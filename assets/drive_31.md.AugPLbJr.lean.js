What is worse is that this book has the danger of making me disbelieve any stories of suppressed childhood memories of abuse etc., which is what I really don't want to happen. If you want to read about the Black Dahlia case, read Gilmore's book 'Severed'. If you want to learn about the lengths sad, unstable women will go to, read this one.

In addition to helping to create great presentations, Rob also addresses how to prepare your audience before the actual engagement. It was very evident after reading this book that his insights are based on real life experiences and success stories, not on armchair academia. As a CEO, it is clear to me that professional speaking opportunities are an effective way to position your organization as innovative, forward thinking and as a viable resource. Immediately after applying Rob's ideas, our company experienced an increase in business. Recently after presenting at the annual board of directors meeting to a group of 100 people, I was told that, because of my presentation, our firm was chosen.

Written about the Great Hickory, NC Polio Epidemic of 1944, during WWII, the story involves a sweet, naive family whose father has gone off to war and who are left to carry on in a harsh and inprotected environment for which they are ill-equipped. They are a little band made up of a young mother, a 13 yr. old, twin elementary school aged little girls and a pre-school aged boy. All of this little family live mostly on the land, have very little meat, and they can wild berries and their own garden vegetables for the winter.The eldest daughter, Ann Fay, is given a set of overalls and instructions by her dad to be the \\"man of the house\\" while he's away...a daunting task for any child. It is Ann Fay who takes on the burden of guilt when her baby brother is struck down with polio, and when she is also taken with polio and removed from her family responsibilities.Blue\\" has won a bushelful of impressive awards for children's literature. It is a very special book. However, its beauty makes it a most worthy read for adults and those who enjoy YA fiction, as well.Having a mother who was a polio patient in Hickory, NC, during this same epidemic in 1944, made me especially interested in this book! Although it's a fiction novel, Ms Hostetter recounts the particulars of the disease, the hospital-like facilities, and the therapies as my own mother recalls them. So, there is much truth to her fiction.The book is also a moral tale. So much of the simple values and morality of a common way of living in the South are protrayed in \\"Blue.\\" The faith that uplifts all of her friends and relatives in Ann Fay's community are deeply moving. These values and the quiet, simple ways of living still linger in this region of NC, today.I recommend this book without reservation to those who love a historic novel, YA fiction, and all readers of medical history."},{"Title":"Blue","review":"Last fall my first library order contained the book Comfort by Joyce Moyer Hostetter. I read it and loved it - set right after World War II in the South, it chronicles Ann Fay's struggle with polio as she recovers at FDR's polio hospital, Warm Springs. Her father is newly back from fighting in Europe and struggling with what he saw in combat. The whole family continues to grieve the death of Bobby, Ann Fay's four year old brother who died of polio.I loved Comfort, which truly stands alone. But, when I found out that Blue told the story of Ann Fay before all that happens in Comfort, I quickly ordered a copy. And of course, it has sat around just waiting for me.I loved Blue, too. Usually I really like to read things in order, but honestly, this novel can stand alone just as well as Comfort can.Ann Fay and her family are living in the South in the 1944. Just as her father ships off to fight in World War II, a polio epidemic sweeps through Ann Fay's county. An emergency hospital opens up and unfortunately Bobby, Ann Fay's four year old brother is struck by polio. Ann Fay can't help but feel responsible. She is the one who pushed Bobby to work in the garden just before his collapse. When Ann Fay comes down with polio herself she is sent to a hospital where she is assigned a room with Imogene, an African American. For both girls, this is their first real friendship they have with someone whose skin is a different color than their own. And Ann Fay begins to see all the ways she and Imogene are alike despite their different appearance. Unfortunately the rest of the world is not quite ready to adopt Ann Fay and Imogene's ability to overlook skin color.While the ending of this novel provides some resolution, I was happy to know how things continued in Comfort. Hostetter would make me quite happy if she chose to continue writing about Ann Fay and her family. I would love to check in on her again."},{"Title":"Blue","review":"I didn't know what to expect when I received this book. It was a selection made by my bookclub.

Death, sickness, racism...very realistic fiction. I loved this book...Polio was never so real to me- my generation has no idea! How much longer till the sequel comes out...Can't wait!"},{"Title":"Blue","review":"Blue, by Joyce Hostetter is a magnificent book that made me think about life and its challenges in the 1940's. This piece of historical fiction, copyright and published in 2006, is inspiring and factual. It tells a great story while illustrating life during WW2 including the polio epidemic, segregation, and life for families whose fathers were in combat. Main character, Ann Fay lives in North Carolina where a polio epidemic has just hit. Her father is away fighting Hitler and she is home being \\"the man of the house.\\" When the epidemic scoops up her younger brother her life becomes a whirlwind of emotion. Ann Fay's bravery and maturity are never ending when the polio forbids her from being near family friends. I would give this novel four out of five stars, because it attracts the reader and bestows upon them empathy for the characters. Anyone who is interested in polio or its effects would enjoy this excellent book. Also, many who enjoyed Small Steps: The Year I got Polio, by Peg Kehret would fancy this book. They both inform the reader about polio and paint a picture of the characters and their life."},{"Title":"Blue","review":"Ann Fay Honeycutt is only thirteen, but she's already the man of the house. This is thanks to her daddy leaving to fight in the war against Hitler and leaving his blue overalls for Ann Fay to fill.Trying to keep the wisteria she loves from choking the vegetable garden she's been charged to tend is nearly a full-time job, and that's without counting the extra work of taking care of her baby brother and twin sisters.Ann Fay thinks these will be her greatest challenges while her daddy is off at war. But then a polio epidemic hits their hometown of Hickory, North Carolina, and Ann Fay learns what real challenge is.This is a remarkable story of courage and of a spirit that cannot be broken. The flowing language this author uses is just gorgeous, and the voice of Ann Fay is as unique as they come. I stayed up late to read the next chapter and then the next -- one of the highest compliments I can give a book.Reviewed by: Julie M.

With help from her neighbor, Junior, she is able to cope. When she comes down with polio, Mama snaps out of her grief. There is so much packed into the pages but nothing seems to want for it.

It is a excellent portrayal of the great epidemic of 1944. It does not mention my most vivid memory. When visiting my brother, we went through a long corridor to his ward. There were iron lungs lined up as far as the eye could see, and as I recall, there was a nurse beside every iron lung. I also remember Dr. Dorothy Horstmann very well & feel she should be remembered on the same level as Jonas Salk & Sabin.

Thank you Mrs. Hostetter for this wonderful story about The Miracle of Hickory."},{"Title":"Blue","review":"What a well written book and also one that inspired me to do further research on polio and US History during that period. The author has a great writing style and character development, I could not put the book down until I was through it. Recommended for adults and teens!"},{"Title":"Blue","review":"Ah, historical fiction. Though it was the bane of my youth, in my old age I'm finding the subject infinitely more interesting that I ever did as an actual kid. I was always the child who'd rather eyeball the latest Anne McCaffery rather than choke down an Elizabeth George Speare. Now I almost look forward to delights like \\"Blue\\". Especially when they have covers as engaging as this one. Evoking more than a few \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" feelings through its cover art, Joyce Moyer Hostetter brings us a tale of racism, polio, and war. It's also a story of love, sheer will, and small acts of heroism. And though I'd some problems with Hostetter's methods, this is one of the best-researched thoroughly engaging tales of 1944-45 you'll find this year.Ann Fay Honeycutt's father's going to war. It's 1944 and American troops are constantly shipping out. Before he leaves, Ann Fay's daddy hands her a pair of overalls and informs his eldest daughter that she's going to have to be the man of the house while he's gone. Ann Fay feels up to the job, taking care of her siblings and tending the family's garden in her dad's absence. Unfortunately, there's a polio epidemic in this part of North Carolina and before anyone knows it the dread disease grabs ahold of Ann Fay's little brother Bobby. Now Ann Fay has to deal with a horribly depressed mother and twin little sisters all in the midst of remaining under a quarantine. When Ann Fay herself comes down with polio, however, she makes the acquaintance of a colored girl and begins to accept what has happened to her with a kind of grace.Now I have a low down-home-folksy-goodness-mixed-with-hopeful-wisdom tolerance. It's why I'll never be able to join in with my children's librarian brethren in loving books like, \\"Ida B\\" by Katherine Hannigan or anything by Joan Bauer. And for a minute there, \\"Blue\\", had me seriously worried. There are occasional moments that gave me real pause. Imogene, the African-American girl Ann Fay befriends, has a section on \\"God's bottle collection\\" that teeters on the edge of preciousness. And I never could quite get used to Hostetter's choice of having Ann Fay's narration written in a kind of southern dialogue. Sometimes she'll be talking in the past tense but put a word in the present (ex: \\"... ever since his daddy's heart give out a few years ago\\"). But by and large the book's emotional impact is true and packs a wallop. I won't give anything away plotwise, but there's a moment on Ann Fay's porch when she's watching a fly land and take off that positively wrings the stuffing out of you. For a moment I wondered if this book would be classified by some kids as \\"depressing\\". But for all the sad moments in the tale there are just as many cheery or upbeat ones. Of course, this isn't a happy-go-lucky tale of how great it was to be alive in 1944. There were problems and \\"Blue\\" takes them all into account. As for North Carolina 1940s colloquialism, it's hard to find phrases any more authentic than, \\"Your momma always said I spit you right out of my mouth\\".And boy, oh boy, you have NEVER seen polio better represented than it is here. I've always had a vague sense of what the disease did to you. I knew you could lose the use of your legs, just as FDR did. What I never considered was how painful that process could be. It's just awful. And Hostetter's well-researched encapsulation of the treatments for it are enough to make your blood run cold. Having recently read Gary Paulsen's fictional biography, \\"The Legend of Bass Reeves\\", which didn't have any bibliographic information whatsoever, you can imagine my delight when I came to the end of \\"Blue\\" and found all kinds of fascinating facts. There's an Author's Note that separates the truth in this story from the fiction. There's a list of books about polio, books about FDR, books about WWII, videos on the subjects, and novels for kids that's so in-depth and pleasant, I've little doubt that teachers everywhere will be creating luscious lesson plans out of Hostetter's hard work.And Hostetter isn't just talented at factual information. She knows how to write a good scene and pull together a host of thematic ideas. In many ways this book is about how unpleasant it is to have to make the cross from childhood into adulthood. Between her mother's incapacitating depression, her brother's illness, having to look after her sisters, her father overseas fighting a war, and the quarantine placed on her by her neighbors, Ann Fay has to be the resident adult. It sounds fun when your dad, leaving, hands you a pair of overalls and tells you to be the man of the house. It's not so fun having to do adult chores and having adult worries when you're only thirteen. This thought really coalesces when Ann Fay is facing a patch of particularly gruesome wisteria head on. Until now wisteria has always been her friend. She has a little hideaway in the midst of its roots she calls Wisteria Mansion. Now it's threatening her victory garden and she has to fight it as hard as her father did. \\"Wisteria used to make me feel nothing but happy. But suddenly I saw why it put my daddy in such a blue mood. I hadn't wanted to see it his way. I wanted to think of it only as the beautiful wall to my mansion. I wanted to hang on to sunny days with sweet purple petals raining down on me and Peggy Sue\\". This, better than anything, is the tragedy of what happens to Ann Fay. She hits adulthood head-on and can't afford to look back.To be blunt, I think Hostetter was doing just fine without bringing the issue of racism into the forefront of her story on page 121. When Imogene suddenly pops into the tale, her presence is fine, but it felt like the story was suddenly switching gears. Now the growing up too fast tale was turning into a tale of Southern racism... sorta. I mean, let's examine the facts here. Ann Fay is a lower income resident of North Carolina in 1944 and she has absolutely no opinions on the African-Americans she's seen all her life? Her parents have never expressed any opinions one way or another? It took a bit of stretching of my credulity to get around that particular thought. Not that Hostetter doesn't cover her bases well. Ann Fay's father isn't exactly receptive to the idea of his daughter hanging out with a colored girl when they're both well again. I'm not saying she doesn't do a fine job with that particular storyline. It just seems extraneous. Like a sudden feeling of \\"Oh! I should be talking about racism too!\\", kinda deal. It was a tale that didn't fit in with Ann Fay's previous struggles.Well, there's strength and weakness to \\"Blue\\", but I'm just pointing out the small things that bugged me because the good things were so strong. Hostetter's got a mess of talent at her disposal, and I certainly hope that alongside her previous book, \\"Best Friends Forever\\", she continues to write up a storm. This is one of the finer titles of the year, no question. Well-researched, well-written, and certainly bound to be well-loved. Problematic in the best possible ways."},{"Title":"Blue","review":"Young readers should find this novel illuminating on two levels, the medical and the social. Hostetter's story of a child's survival of epidemic polio offers a wrenching appraisal of parallel cruelties--crippled children at an orthopedic center where segregation relegates blacks to a tent city on the lawn."},{"Title":"Blue","review":"Blue is a beautiful story of strength and courage in the midst of adversity.

I truly felt for the characters, especially the protagonist, Ann Fay. I could identify so well with Ann's insecurities just as much as I celebrated her triumphs.

This is a must read if you are interested in the polio epidemic, WWII era, or just a profound story of perseverance through life's joys and sorrows."},{"Title":"Blue","review":"I don't know if this book has won any of the children's literature prizes.But it should!The tough,funny,true-to-the-South characters, make this a heart tangling story of a young girl's toughness in the face of her father's absence in World War II, the terrifying polio epidemic that sweeps over her home town and her first heart-to-heart sense of what segregation has done to girls just like her, except that they are black.The story is beautifully written giving a sense of the red clay, the wisteria and the natural environment.

If you are like me and have problems with your emotions you will cry throughout this book. This story takes place in Hickory, North Carolina (my hometown). The writer did an excellent job and conveys the story very well while including a lot of history into the story. This book could be used by teachers to teach different units of study. Not only does the book give a lot about the history of polio, it touches base on race discrimination. When a black girl and white girl find themselves side by side in a hospital for children with polio they become best friends. The girls have a hard time being friends because people around them think it isn't right, but they manage against all odds. The book also touches base on War War II, death and having responsibilities as a young child. If I had to recommend any book to read it would be this one.

While he is gone, there is a polio epidemic that directly effects her family in more ways than one. Seen through the eyes of this young woman, Ann Fay, we realize the hardships faced during that dark period of our history.

He won me over as a child with his Chronicle of Narnia books, but it was his thought-provoking and inspiring book Mere Christianity that solidified his genius in my mind.That being said, it is with great vacillation that I must reveal I did not care for his science fiction novel, Out of the Silent Planet, the first in the Space Trilogy series.I did not like it for the reason I don't care for much of the science fiction I read, and that is specifically the use of ridiculous words that are supposed to be the natural language of the foreign environment. I believe that doing this in abundance, as Lewis did, distracts from the overall story and breaks up the cohesion and fluidity.Also, for me, Lewis really opened my eyes with Mere Christianity. He literally knocked me out with his elegance and ingenuity. But, most of what he talks about in Mere Christianity is employed as themes throughout Out of the Silent Planet. Ordinarily this would not be a bad thing, but it just didn't work in my mind for this particular novel. I won't ruin the plot for you if you choose to read it, but a man travels to a far off planet and there is life there that seems to represent everything we were meant to be. Where the story fell short was in the fact that Lewis spent so much time explaining everything, not very much actually happened.Now, I've heard the second book in this series gets much better, and that the third is even better still. Based upon this news alone, I may try the second book. But, if I were to base my further reading of the Space Trilogy off of Out of the Silent Planet only, it would be the last.~Scott William Foley, author of Souls Triumphant"},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"This book was easy to read, I flew through it without even noticing I was near the end, and all the way I enjoyed it.This book has a great ending as well as introduction.

The story is a fun one to read (relatively). One interesting aspect of this story is reading how Lewis imagined the experience of space travel would be, written in the era before space travel was an actuality. Reading about the concerns about the limited air in the spaceship(not considering the technology that would be developed to filter the air) is a neat insight into what he had to imagine, and Lewis really got quite a bit of it relatively right with his imagination in this story."},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"Although it is dated, the interest of the book is not.

It is not hard sifi, nonetheless, one of the best sifi books ever written (and I am a great fan of hard sifi).

I ran across \\"Out of the Silent Planet\\" at the library while looking for an entirely different book, and was so intrigued by the cover art (a man and a beaver-like creature in a canoe) I had to give it a try. The story revolves around a man named Ransom taken hostage to Malacandra, later revealed as Mars, and the races of beings he finds there.

Published in 1938, I suspect this was a very imaginative book as it features manned-flight to Mars, something that we still haven't pulled off nearly 75 years later. Given that we have pictures of Mars, I had to continually tell myself the book could never happen because the story features humans that are able to survive on Mars as if it were another earth.If you can put aside all the reasons why the book is not possible, it is an interesting read especially when Dr. Ransom, the protagonist of the story, interacts with a spiritual being called the Oyarsa, and with the various inhabitants of the planet.The book forces you to think about mankind, and its motivations, as Dr. Ransom describes our race to the aliens. If you so choose, you can easily read into it the Christian theology that Lewis places in various characters both on Mars and Earth.

This book is very well written and it gives you this sense of adventure, that you are discovering this world along with the protagonist. If you enjoy sci-fi and you are a fan of C.S. Lewis, give this book a shot."},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"First of all, this is a classic work from the author of Chronicles of Narnia and a bunch of other books which should be part of any well educated person's repertoire (Abolition of Man, Screwtape Letters, etc.). This means the prospective reader, who is deciding whether or not to buy and read the book, may rest assured that he will not be exposed to some upgraded fun fiction with cardboard characters and a contrived plot. This is a real novel.For those who are wondering whether Lewis is as good in sci-fi as in fantasy, I believe he does pull it off quite nicely. He doesn't have the same imaginative freedom as in the Narnia series (after all, the planets featured in the trilogy actually exist and orbit the Sun, so there must be some concern with laws of physics, astronomy, and such), but he manages quite well to incorporate humanist and spiritual themes through the use of fantastic characters in a \\"scientific\\" setting.Above all, Lewis provides us with an artistic experience of the moral imagination, in which we witness the moral dilemmas facing mankind and their concrete implications, enacted through the characters and choices of the story's personae dramatis. There are embodied (perhaps with a little too much caricature, which at least highlights these moral choices) the unhampered will to power (disguised as abstract love of humanity), the sheer and vulgar materialistic hedonism and greed, as well as the commonsensical moral uprightness allied to a curiosity about what real people (human, hross, sorn or pfifltriggi) hold inside and express through linguistic and cultural habits.The story does not offer unbearable heights of suspense, or intricate plot twists. Instead, it is a development or clarification of these characters, or moral choices, powered by a basic conflict that creates the tension for the novel: one of the human characters has been kidnapped by the other two, who intend to offer him up as a sacrifice as a trade-in for whatever they hope to accomplish on planet Malacandra. The final denouement and clarification is made possible by the inclusion of a clever literary device in the shape of a set of powerful characters who hold the key to the general distinctions between the earthly and the aliens.These characters (the eldil) are by no means of the \\"Deus ex machina\\" kind, but are a central piece of the book's fictional universe, and an important part of the answer to the question--to which the book purports to provide a reply--about the implications of the Christian theodicy and specifically the account of the Fall to the rest of the universe and its possible inhabitants. Spiritual and physical are brought close together in this very imaginative solution, in which we see that outer \\"space\\" can be, with the right moral and imaginative attitude, more properly called \\"heaven\\".The book leaves us with the suggestion that the very fabric of the universe may be filled with ethical substance, and that to see humanity in an evolutionary struggle for the survival of the fittest is, rather than a scientific conclusion, in fact a moral choice."},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"It's a great story but a little slow at first.

In 2001, I wrote a full length review, but did not publish that text. In 2007, I wrote a second review and published it that year. Review 1 is the previously unpublished 2001 review and Review 2 is the 2007 review]Review 1: \\"Out of the Silent Planet\\", the first book in the \\"Space Trilogy\\", stands as the most sci-fi of the three. While \\"Perelandra\\" stands more as a religious novel and That Hideous Strength as academic satire and anti utopian fiction, Out of the Silent Planet has the most common elements of the science fiction genre. The opening dedication also bears an interesting thought. The opening book is dedicated to Warren, Lewis's brother, who is \\"a life long critic of the space and time story.\\" To the Inklings this was something of a pun, as this dedication had a dual meaning. In one sense, it is just the literal level, but in another, it means Warren is critical of the idea that all there is to the universe is space and time.Lewis' main attack here is the idea of Weston of populating other worlds and eradicating those beings which are there, which is embodied in a very favourable light by Olaf Stapeldon in his novel First and Last Men. The mere thought of killing other sentient creatures, if they did indeed exist, to propitiate the human race was, to Lewis, a true monstrosity.The astronomical distances were enacted by God as quarantines, and the worlds we could get to could not sustain life in the real universe. In Lewis's, both Mars and Venus can support life but Jupiter and Saturn cannot. However, Mars is dying and Perelandra is an unfallen world that will aid in the fight against the Bent One, or Satan. We also get a manifestation of what will occur if we allow greed to rule our lives with Devine, who is so far gone that the Oyarsa of Mars would unbody him if Devine was a Malacandrian native because the hnau is out of him and he is only on the level of the animal.Again, this is a common theme in Lewis that evil, if followed to its extreme, will cause you to lose all of your humanity. One of the most effective scenes in the entire trilogy is the first meeting of the Ransom and the hrossa. It describes, very accurately, what it must be like to encounter an alien species for the first time. Both want to make contact, but both are rather nervous about it.One major thing that interested me about Out of the Silent Planet was Ransom's continuous flight from the sorns. From the very beginning Ransom automatically assumes that the sorns wish him harm because of the conversation he overheard by Devine and Weston. From this, he begins his already constantly journeying life. Out of the Silent Planet is a composite of journeys, with Ransom journeying on a walking holiday across England, and then a journey to free Harry, then to Mars on the space ship. He escapes from Weston and Devine so they won't offer him to the sorns (which makes a very large part of Ransom's overall journey). Here he meets Hyoi and journeys with him to his home. Ransom from there journeys to hunt the hnakra, then to Augray's cave, and from there to Meldilorn and then to home. After all this, he ends up in the pub. This constant journeying also comes into play in the Narnia books. This journey also ties into the spiritual journeys that Lewis's characters' are experiencing ties into their own spiritual progression, which is most evident in The Pilgrim's Regress.One of the most amazing things about this book to me is the fact that out of the 60 reviews it received on initial publication, which was a rather large number for a relatively unknown writer, which C. S. Lewis was at that time, only two noticed the Christian theology throughout the piece, which strikes me as very odd.Lewis became convinced that you could smuggle any amount of theology into a person's mind if you simply called it romance and have done with it. Indeed, that is what the rest of his major fiction did, and almost all if it is successful. Where it becomes quite plain what Lewis is doing with Perelandra, but as it is so obviously the story of the unfallen Adam and Eve and their temptation on Perelandra it does not violate my own personal ascetic that I dealt with during the discussion of LWW. Part of the spell of that story is the fact that it is the Christian story retold, but this time with a happy ending.The single greatest weakness with this book, however, is the length. While Perelandra could have benefited had he cut some of the more preachy sections at the end on the Holy Mountain, this book ends entirely too soon. We do not receive nearly enough exposure to the third race, and Meldilorn is reached to quickly. This is a tale that would have benefited the addition of about another one hundred pages, but sadly it does not. As it is the most science fiction of the three, Out of the Silent Planet is all the more disappointing in this facet. This is the only book of the Space Trilogy which reads like a traditional Wells fantasy, so it would have been much nicer had there been some more length. As it stands, however, Out of the Silent Planet is a good novel with excellent Christian themes but is sadly far too short.-------------Review 2: [In 2007 I wrote and published this review on Amazon.com]OUT OF THE SILENT PLANET, published in 1938 on recommendation of J. R. R. Tolkien, is the first novel of what has become known as the Space Trilogy, or Cosmic Trilogy, or the Ransom trilogy. OSP will be the most satisfactory for those looking for straight science fiction.There are three primary influences that caused Lewis to write OSP. The first is David Lindsay's VOYAGE TO ARCTURAS (a novel that famed literary critic Harold Bloom wrote a sequel too, called THE FLIGHT TO LUCIFER. This is Bloom's only published fiction, and he has longed disowned the novel). It was ARCTURAS that showed you could deal with high philosophical and theological matters in the guise of science fiction.The second influence was the well-known conversation between Tolkien and Lewis in 1937 in which they lamented the state of current fiction and set out to write their own to help correct the matter. Tolkien was to write a time-travel story (his novel was abandoned and unfinished, published in HISTORY OF MIDDLE-EARTH VOL 5, THE LOST ROAD AND OTHER WRITINGS). And Lewis wrote a space-travel story (this novel), the only real science fiction novel he ever wrote..The third major influence is H. G. Wells. Lewis says in an intro note before the novel that even though there are certain slighting remarks about Wells in the novel, he hopes people don't think him too stupid to enjoy Wells. And it is obvious from reading OSP Lewis is very much a fan of Well's science fiction (though not necessarily the social critic Wells tried to reinvent himself as), as a lot of the novel reads like something a Wells fan would write.While the series has overall been labeled as science fiction, this is rather a misnomer. OUT OF THE SILENT PLANET is really the only true science fiction in the trilogy. PERELANDRA is a religious track, and THAT HIDEOUS STRENGTH is the hardest to classify of the three. You either love or hate it. Lewis called THS a fairy tale for adults, which is fine. But as this is a review of the first, lets keep to the first.The best thing about this book is its interplanetary romance and its Christianity. You get to go see another world. Granted, the world Lewis describes is not the real Mars, but I have never held that against this book (some pervious reviewers have cited this as a fault). This is, after all, fiction, and does not need to be held in the confines of the real world. That is why I never understood people complaining of the science in this one. Still, there are some rather jarring slips, such as Ransom confusing the moon and the earth for one another, something that would never happen.Elwin Ransom is kidnapped and taken onboard a spaceship to Mars. The novel opens with him on a walking holiday (something Lewis himself was rather famous for taking - Tolkien went on one of his hiking trips and soon found himself rather out of sorts with his body, and struck to shorter jaunts around Oxford with his dear friend). Ransom chances upon two men in an old house, one of which he knows. This is Dick Devine and Proffessor Weston. Originally they were going to kidnap a mentally challenged boy, but on second thought decide to take Ransom instead, to appease an alien species named the sorns in order to get more of the metal the sorn's call \\"sun's blood\\" (really gold). So they capture Ransom and travel to Mars in a spaceship of Weston's design.Though he fears what he may find there, when Ransom lands he runs away from his kidnappers and ultimately finds himself in company with another alien species. Malacandra (so called there) is a wonderful place, with three distinct species called hnau (the Hrossa, the pfifletriggi, and the sorns). He spends most of his time with the Hrossa. Over the course of the novel, he is introduced to all three alien species, though he spends very little time with the pfifletriggi. All three are vastly different, but all are important to the Martian society. Though he begins in fear of the sorns, ultimately they prove to be powerful allies.There are also other inhabitants in Mars as well. Ransom also learns of Eldils (angels), and also about the Oyarsa, which is the ruler of Mars, and is an archangel. The climax of the novel features Ransom meeting the Oyarsa, and it is the Oyarsa who meters out justice to Weston and Devine.Lewis touches upon several major themes in this introductory novel. Being the Christian that he is, Lewis models the story's cosmology off of Christian theology. In fact, of the initial 60 reviews that OSP garnered when it was first published, only a handful picked up on the heavy Christian undercurrents running throughout the novel. Lewis realised you can smuggle any amount of idealogy under the guise of romance.The other major theme he touches upon is Weston's desire to colonize other planets. To Weston, humanity's survival is the most important thing, and will exterminate other lifeforms to take over their planet. Weston's position of racial geonicide is drawn from Olaf Stapledon's FIRST AND LAST MEN, a novel in which men do kill other species to take over their planet, and Stapledon's obvious endorsement of this racial murder. Lewis was horrified when he read this novel, and so crafted OSP as a response to this novel.The first book, OUT OF THE SILENT PLANET, is the most SF of the three, and also the least satisfactory. The story is excellent, with Lewis using medieval influences to develop a Christian world view in a science fiction setting. Tolkien said in one of his letters (its in LETTERS OF J. R. R. TOLKIEN, one of the early ones), it is simply not long enough. It is a nice story of Ransom being kidnaped and then dealing with the Martian landscape. Yes, some of the science is dated but Lewis is more concerned with other themes to worry about \\"scientific credibility.\\" Although some have said the characterization is flat, for those thirsty for SF this is the best of the three.In several ways, OSP is a particular favorite yet also the most disappointing of the trilogy. Like Tolkien said, it's simply too short. Imaginatively, there are great scenes in the novel, any science fiction lover will find the novel richly rewarding. But as it's the only real science fiction Lewis wrote, I would like to see him have written a much longer novel.Still, a great start for C. S. Lewis, the novelist.-----[In June 26, 2000, I wrote this unfinished review, previously unpublished]\\"OUT OF THE SILENT PLANET is really the only true science fiction in the trilogy.

I have published newly written reviews of \\"The Space Trilogy\\" composed long after I wrote the three original reviews of Lewis's science fiction.)"},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"You probably know that C.S. Lewis was a Christian apologist who wrote many popular books -- both fiction and nonfiction -- which explain or defend the Christian faith. His most famous work, THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA, some of the most-loved stories in all of fantasy fiction and children's literature, is clearly Christian allegory. Likewise, his science fiction SPACE TRILOGY can be read as allegory, though it's subtle enough to be enjoyed by those who don't appreciate allegorical stories and just want to read a thoughtful science fiction adventure with an intelligent hero.In Out of the Silent Planet, the first book in the trilogy, Dr. Elwin Ransom, a Cambridge philology professor, is kidnapped and taken by spaceship to Mars, which is called Malacandra by the alien species that live there. Suspecting that he's about to be offered as a sacrifice, Ransom escapes from his captors and must survive by himself on the strange planet. There, he is enchanted by the beautifully foreign scenery, meets aliens who are nothing like humans, learns about the origin of the species on Malacandra and Earth and, finally, morosely reflects on the fallen nature of mankind.I liked everything about Out of the Silent Planet -- the descriptions of the spherical space ship and the planet of Malacandra, the idea that space is full and living instead of empty and dead, the development of Ransom from a conservative college professor to a daring space traveler, the interesting metaphysics and the ideas about the perception of light and movement, the allegorical explanation of humanity's greed and selfishness which suggests a spiritual origin for social Darwinism. Best of all was Ransom's translation of one of his captor's speeches about human destiny for aliens who previously had no concept of human ambition and aggression.It's easy to see that C.S. Lewis loved language, mythology and knowledge, and that he was ashamed of much human behavior. The Christian allegory is easy to see, too, if you're willing, but discussing that here would require spoilers and remove all the mystery, so I will leave that for you to discover.Out of the Silent Planet was written in 1938, long before we knew enough about Mars to realize that Lewis's story is impossible. However, Lewis did his best with the knowledge he had, settling his Martians in the trench-like canals and leaving the surface dead. Generally, the story doesn't feel as old as it is.I listened to Blackstone Audio's version, 5 hours long, which was read by Geoffrey Howard who I liked very much. I look forward to listening to him read the next book in the SPACE TRILOGY, Perelandra.Originally posted at FanLit."},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"A great adventure story and of course Lewis puts his genius to good use by giving us a different perspective on Christianity"},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"I have to say I really like the title and idea behind Earth's name. This was my first introduction to a novel of Lewis, and it was a real page turner. But this book reminds me of Ayn Rand's novels, in the sense that the story is sometimes good filler between speeches where the authors get down to business. In Silent Planet this occurs mainly in the grand finale. This is, though, convenient for me now since I read this book for history of science research.I feel bad calling the in-between filler, because I don't think it entirely was. There was good integration and demonstration of other points in the novel. At first glance, the softest part in the novel is the coexistence of the three intelligent species. It is rather... naiive? At least too idealistic. Are these species the ideal Christians, who follow commandments and the way of grace perfectly because of total faith and belief in God? This picture isn't argued by Lewis."},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"The first book in the Space Trilogy, Out of the Silent Planet kept my interest even though I am not a big science fiction book fan."},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"While my first impression of the book was so-so, Lewis yet again exposed my own folly by hitting me in the head with the Christian significance of this book halfway through.

The story itself is simple, yet like most of C.S. Lewis' work, it is allegorical. For most of the book, he maintains the perfect balance between traditional storytelling and telling his message. The subjects he deals with just below the surface of the plotline are the true gems here.Questions arise: what value judgement are we making when we believe the human race is the only one that should be entitled to the entire universe? Lewis, like Tolkien, was influenced greatly by WWII and it shows here. He questions the absurdity of armed conflict and analyzes it down to the simplest of levels, to the way a creature on Mars would view it. Although some may find the pacing a bit slow, I found it like savoring a fine wine- no reason to rush, and every reason to try to discern the subtleties."},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"The story begins with Dr. Ransom, a philologist, hiking in the English countryside. Unable to find lodging for the night, he approaches a lone building, miles from the nearest town. Kidnapped by the inhabitants, he is brought on a space journey to the planet Malacandra. The kidnappers plan to give him to the natives of the new planet as a sacrifice.After escaping his captors, he is rescued by a different group of natives, where he learns the language and culture of the planet. Eventually he is brought to the ruler of Malacandra, where he learns about the origin of life on Malacandra as well as Earth. His captors are then brought to the ruler as well, and there is a debate as to what should be done with the Earthlings. They are sent back to Earth, Ransom with a new understanding of the world around him and the heavens above.A quick and easy read, the story is written in the concise language Lewis used to explain so many other complex points. The most compelling points are the simple conclusions Lewis comes to about human nature and the corrupt world we live in.

Lewis' lesser known and, unfortunately, lesser read works is what is commonly referred to as the Space Trilogy (Out of the Silent Planet, Perelandra, That Hideous Strength). I might add that many of those that have not read it at least began it but then gave up before they were able to finish the first volume-I believe that is because Out of the Silent Planet is less of a stand alone volume as much as it is setting up the rest of the trilogy-however, it is very well worth reading in it's own right.The story begins on the planet Thulcandra (Earth, or, the silent planet) where Ransom is taken captive by the sinister Weston and Devine. From there the action quickly moves from the trip to and arriving on the planet Malacandra where the majority of the action takes place. What we gradually learn is that instead of being the dangerous and inhospitable place that Weston and Devine believe it to be, Malacandra is an inviting and wonderful place inhabited by kind and protective species. Lewis presents the Malacandran system as almost a pure society. While there are three classes of beings on this planet, hrossa (the poets), pfifltriggi (the workers), and sorns (ruling class), they are all led by Oyarsa. Even though these classes have separate roles it is clear that they operate with equality and are appreciated for each of the parts they play.Because of the darkness of their mind and intentions Weston and Devine see the sorns as dangerous and the society very simplistic in comparison to their own. Ransom, even though initially led to believe that attitude of his captors is accurate and thus initially fear the inhabitants of this beautiful planet, he soon befriends and emotionally connects to many of them, especially the hrossa and one in particular by the name of Hyoi who is eventually killed by Weston and Devine. Parallel to the darkness of these two antagonists is the darkness and silence of Thulcandra itself. The evil of Weston and Devine is very perplexing to the people of Malacandra-they cannot understand why somebody would kill someone that has done them no harm.In true Lewis fashion you begin to know and love both these characters and this place. If you either began reading Out of the Silent Planet long ago and stopped mid-story or found yourself not that interested in beginning at all, I would encourage you to pick it up and try one more time (or maybe the first time). I think you will be glad you did."},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"This is one of my favorite C.S.

Lewis tells a pretty good sci-fi story of a kidnapped man named Ransom finding his way around Malacandra (Mars). The wonder and awe expressed by Ransom in the book is almost worth the read in and of itself. The 'joyful cosmology' of seeing space as the ancients did, calling them the 'heavens' is shown to be superior to the modern notion that space is just cold dead hostile nothingness. This is contrasted with the 'joyless cosmology' of Weston who accepts some half-baked social darwinist philosophy. The aliens were also quite interesting, although I think that Lewis could have done more with the sorns. The hross were cool though.This was a good start to the trilogy."},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"A crisply written delving into the Western humanoid psyche. Lewis's unparalleled imagination weaves a thought provoking portrayal of our societal strictures - themes as apropos today as when originally published in 1938."},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"This is a fascinating book and story that must be read all the way through book three in the series to be truly understood. One needs to remember that it was written so long ago that the prose is, to me, cumbersome and Lewis goes on and on about things philosophizing at great length about the smallest issue. I felt I had to stick with it in spite of this because by the time I began to see this, I had already invested too much time in the reading of it."},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"I believe C.S. Lewis wrote a masterpiece in the late 1930's, but it's hard to make a space travel piece about our solar system relevent for today. I was really hoping the &quot;planet&quot; they were going to was one of the moons of Neptune or something like that, but as a species we've just learned too much about Mars and have experienced too much real space travel for me to be excited about a book that guesses what both would be like, often incorrectly.Looking at it through 21st century eyes ruined most of the fun of the original work. When he thinks he's looking at the moon from space and finds it is really the earth I cringed. We learned many years after that, but still over 30 years ago, that the earth and moon look nothing alike and no one could make this mistake.Putting aside the science and forgetting it's a space trip, what does the work have to offer in an allegorical sense on the condition of mankind? Again I feel it is dated. When Lewis had written this book it was the era of the great powers when the sun never set on the British empire. From Africa to the Middle East to India to South East Asia all were under British rule simply because they felt it was their right to do so and the native cultures could not stop them. The Weston tie in to the British Empire attitude would have been apparent and very strong to the readship of the 1930's, but many changes have taken place. The destruction of World War II caused dramatic changes across the globe that saw the disintegration of the British empire and the view point of forced dominance that went along with it.So while I think this work is well done, I wish I could have read it 60 years ago instead of now. For works that last through time I much prefer the Chronicles of Narnia, his other great series, that still touches the lives of many today."},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"Read no further if you want to read a glowing review about a science fiction book! Out of the Silent Planet is the first of three books in C.S. Lewis's famous space trilogy. C.S. Lewis claimed that he wrote Out of the Silent Planet because he wanted to create a great space trilogy from a Christian point of view. Skillfully writing many famous books, C.S. Lewis was an astounding writer. Some of these books include, The Chronicles of Narnia, Till We Have Faces and Mere Christianity. The illustrator of Out of the Silent Planet was Kinuko Y. Craft. Publishing the book in 1986, Collier Books recognized C.S. Lewis's writing ability. The book is 154 pages long. It contains no pictures. Since the font in the book is very small, it may be unsuitable for those who prefer a larger type. Because of the slightly confusing aspects of the story, this book would appeal to people aged fourteen and up.The main character in the book is Ransom, who is a philologist. Philologists study language. Playing a large part in the story, two scientists named Weston and Devine are the villains of the piece. Ransom, Weston and Devine travel to Malacandra by space ship, although Ransom does not know why he is being dragged with them. The ship is not like spaceships of today. Circular, massive and ominous, the ship is a product of C.S. Lewis's imagination. When Ransom explores the ship further he discovers while in space, half of the ship shimmers with golden light. On the other side of the ship, there is a midnight blue glow. After landing on Malacandra, Ransom meets Hyoi, an inhabitant of the mysterious planet. Ransom spends much of his time in the habitats of the Hyoi's kin the Hrossa, because he is reluctant to return to return to Weston and Devine. Malacandra is a breathtaking planet. Beautifully, filled with brilliantly blue waters, breathtakingly dramatic forests and majestic mountains, Malacandra changed the lives of any human who set foot on the planet, although Ransom may be lucky if he escapes with his life.While living on Earth, never dreaming he would soon be on another planet, Doctor Ransom was strolling along the streets of Nadderby. Wearily searching for some place to sleep, Ransom hoped to find an inn to rest his head. Although he was on a walking tour, Ransom walks quickly, taking no notice of the shocking sunset to his right. Ransom is drawn to the house of Weston and Devine who dragged him unconscious, into a space ship. Floating in space close to thirty days, Ransom awaited, what he believed to be, his inescapable doom, because of a conversation between Weston and Devine he had overheard. Weston had asked a question. Ransom could not hear. Then Devine responded, \\"Human sacrifice, I suppose. At least it wouldn't be human from their point of view; you know what I mean.\\" At last, Weston and Devine successfully piloted the spaceship to Malacandra. Fearing murder, Ransom escapes into the forest of Malacandra.After staying one tense night in the forest while on the edge of madness, Ransom met an alien inhabitant of Malacandra named Hyoi. Hyoi was a part of the clan, Hrossa. Later, Ransom, Devine and Weston went to a meeting with the god of Malacandra called an Eldil, because he had requested to meet the three humans. Since Ransom knew the language to communicate with the Eldil, which he learned from the Hross, he possessed power in the meeting. Sending Weston and Devine back to their own planet, like a grimy unwanted stray dog, the Eldil regretfully informed Ransom that he must voyage with them. Ransom was devastated. Dramatically, the Eldil provided only enough fuel for ninety days, and the race began.This book contains many flaws, and is not recommended. Since the character Ransom remains under-developed, the reader feels unconcerned what fate the character must endure. In fact reviewer Tal Cohen agrees stating, \\"The charactors, however, are somewhat lacking.\\" C.S. Lewis may have tried to make Ransom a \\"common man,\\" although this made the character un-exiting. Action is rare. Dismally, a majority of the suspense lies in Ransom's brooding about how and when he will be killed. Parts of the book is very pass&eacute;, such as Ransom taking a walking tour with nothing but a pack, and obtaining no hotel reservations. In the book, C.S. Lewis uses Malacandrian vocabulary, which is only defined a few times. Remembering these alien words is unnecessarily difficult. For some readers this may make the book more interesting, but for others, it is a hindrance, because, in an effort to understand the book, the reader has to look back and search previous chapters. Despite these flaws in the book, the conclusion is superb. Lewis really makes the reader question whether there really is a Malacandra after reading the conclusion. The conclusion of the book may be excellent, but in general, the book is mediocre, monotonous and not highly advised."},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"I'm not an avid Sci-Fi reader but came with high expectations, CS Lewis being the writer of the Narnia series, which I read as a child, many, many years ago.I didn't enjoy this novel, with the exception, of Lewis' wonderful descriptive language. In particular, the way he describes the beauty of Malacandra is breathtaking.I thought I was reading something akin to the Planet of the Apes, but without the sense of foreboding that one feels when you watched the TV series version of the aforementioned. I was so tempted to put the novel down, but have a personal policy not to do that, and figured as it was only 150+ pages I'd grin and bear it.Yes, there is a message there about good vs evil and God, but I don't think it was that inspiring or significant.I'm sure my conclusions are heavily influenced by the fact that I don't typically read such novels. I won't be reading the 2 sequels."},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"This is the first C.S.Lewis I've read, and I have to say it is a bit of a disappointment. I didn't know what to expect, but I didn't expect what I got, a rather typical and traditional SF story about a guy who unexpectedly goes on a trip through space to another planet, where he meets some wise aliens. (Their wisdom consists of a sort of Christian Stoicism, an eager submission to the will of God, which is contrasted with the overweening ambition of humanity.) Lewis's writing is a little flat, and while he seems to be trying to inspire wonder in the reader at the beauty of his alien planet, he just as often inspired boredom in this reader. I have to admit, I prefer stories in which the alien planet is the scene of heroic battles or grim terror, as in Edgar Rice Burroughs's Mars books or Jack Williamson's The Legion of Space; Lewis is aiming higher than they did, but whereas they hit their targets squarely, he misses his mark.I read the 2003 Scribners trade paperback, which is a disaster. Many paragraphs appear to be lacking their proper indentation, and it looks like in the process of Americanizing the punctuation many apostrophes were turned into quotation marks. Whoever managed the preparation of the text should be ashamed."},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"Received the book in a timely manner.

Still, I found the Postscript annoying and too overdone. It confused me, and didn't really provide as much closure as the REAL last chapter did. I don't see how the storyline could go on- this man was taken from his home to Mars and back, and now what? I did like the symbolism in Ransom's dream. It was the best part to look back and see how much Ransom had known without really knowing it. The fact that Lewis worked in Christianity into this novel was inspiring, but I still think his Narnia works were far better."},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"I think it's just an ordinary fiction book...Dr.Ransom was abducted,brought to another weird planet,then came back to earth.Perhaps I used to read A.Hitchcock fiction books,that are much2 fun than this.That's why this book isn't fun enough."},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"the first sci-fi book i've ever read (now i'm hooked), really pulls you in, must read 2 and 3 in the trilogy"},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"The product was great!

Mr. Lewis did just that for me as a young man. Some 30 years after reading them, I still think of the story and the lessons it provided. I still think of new caveates to the story I had not thought about before. This is science fiction with substance. And do not stop with this first of the trilogy but go on to the others - _Perelandra_ and _That Hideous Strenght_. You will not be disappointed. Just read it for the enjoyment of the story and let the rest of the substance come with time. Good fiction gives you something to hold onto for years to come and the master storyteller Lewis left us great fiction."},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"Absolutely engrossing science fiction, fantasy. There's really very little action, and the science is, of course, dated. However, the story is told in a very engaging manner. That it is written by a master storyteller is obvious as I was, from the first page, spellbound, and could not get enough of it. Put aside thoughts of intellectualism, theology, and philosophy. Keep it by the bedstand, and simply enjoy. The book is short, just 160 pages, and so I can't wait to obtain the next installment of the trilogy. Absolutely refreshing."},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"I really enjoyed this book. It is a little bit meatier than the Narnia Chronicles (which I love too) as it is meant for a slightly older audience. Great science fiction about space travel and other species. Way better than anything Star Trek came up with. Highly recommended. This and Perelandra (book 2) are great. That Hideous Strength (book 3) is okay, but you would probably be fine just reading the first two."},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"Why the 5 stars? Hey it's C.S. Lewis, what else can I say? I thought this was very thought provoking. It's great work by one of the greatest authors of all time. I think everyone should take the time to read at least one of C.S. Lewis's works. If you've read the Narnia series, you find a similarity where Lewis takes Dr. Ransom and his companions (2 to be exact) and takes them to a whole new world. That's where the imagination kicks in and C.S. Lewis takes you for a ride! It is always a treat to read any work by this man! Kudos!"},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"The concept of this whole book and the whole series is just remarkable. People have always dreamed of life on other planets and Lewis explains this idea so well that if it weren?t labeled ?fiction? it would be completely believable; mostly because of the way he combines his science, Christian, mythical, and historical knowledge. Now, I?ll get to the book.A very intriguing piece of work, I especially loved when Ransom lived in the Hross colony, learning their customs, language, and way of life. It reminded me of how we should have treated people from other races when we discovered them. Also, being an animal lover, I thought the animal-like form of the intelligent Hross was a good concept. I liked the way all the Hross accepted him, even though he was completely different from anything they?d ever seen.The relations between all the ?species? on the planet was also interesting, the Hross are verbally artistic, the Sorn have knowledge, and the Pfifltriggi are artistic in the way of pottery and statues. Yet they all got along and accepted that Oyarsa was the ruler of all of them.Being a younger individual, I found it somewhat hard to get into this book. Lewis? wide vocabulary tended to interfere with the storyline to sometimes, but the idea of it got to me. Overall a great read, I defiantly plan to look into more of C. S. Lewis? work."},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"Refreshing take on life in outer space. If there is life aout there this is what is is like. Once again C.S.

I did not read them until I was an adult and I loved them!"},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"Out of the Silent Planet is an interesting piece of science fiction, a genre I am beginning to enjoy. C.S. Lewis takes us on a fascinating journey to Malacandra (Mars). While there is very little scientific value to the book (hence fiction), the book has profound insights into the condition of humanity. Through the adventures of Dr. Ransom, we not only imagine the intriguing world of Malacandra, but we see the contrast between a culture or world relatively ignorant of evil, selfishness, and greed with the newly entered evil accompanying Ransom."},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"I found this book hard to put down over the short span it was read in. Lewis' masterful words put the character's point of view in perfect context throughout the entire novel. And his subtle approach towards life beings on other planets made for a very believable/realistic adventure. I can't wait to get my hands on the next two books in the Trilogy.Read my other reviews for great Christian books + CDs."},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"One day, I was perusing the scif-fi section of a book store when this book caught my eye. I had heard of C.S. Lewis, so I gave it a quick look. Hmmm... Looks pretty good. I bought it, and when I read it, I was blown away. I have always had a passion for science fiction, but this book was unlike anything I had ever read. A tale of pure beauty, it tells the story of a world gone bad and a final seed of purity that can deliver us. The biblical referances are unparrelled and Lewis's messgae is loud and clear- we can be saved, but only if our hearts are true. This book is highly recommened to sci-fi fans and fans of literure in general. Do NOT hesitate in buying this novel!!!"},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"Lewis presents an entertaining book that is appealing on many different levels. It has your basic action/adventure sci/fi story's Good vs. Evil, but the protagonist is original in that his character flaws (primarily cowardice) are shown. It is refreshing to have a protagonist who is not super-strong and who has his own weaknesses that he must learn to overcome. The unlikely event of an abduction to the planet Mars becomes believable through Lewis' vivid description of the landscape and characters. The philosophy within the story is not outright mentioned; instead, Lewis presents his Christian message through significance and double meanings. A good book on its own, but can be read with the other two in the series, Perelandra and That Hideous Strength."},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"It helps a bit to remember that this C.S.Lewis sci-fi/fantasy adventure was first published in 1943. Even though our knowledge of Mars (Malacandra) is slightly more defined now than in Lewis' day, his wonderfully creative imagination can still delight and captivate a modern day reader.The novel begins with the carefree walking tour of the British countryside by a vacationing Cambridge college philologist named Ransom. By chance, Ransom runs into two crazed and evil (bent) colleagues who abduct him and drag him off via spaceship to the planet Malacandra. Fearing for his life, he escapes his captors and journeys through the waters, forests, canals, and strange countryside of the new world. Overwhelmed by the horrifying feeling of being alone in a place he knows absolutely nothing about, he encounters extraordinary obstacles, situations, and inhabitants throughout his amazing journey.The book is a wonderful story of one man's amazing adventures in a new land; and, while learning about the strange and diverse customs of it's inhabitants, he delves into his own mind and examines thoughts of love, hatred, greed, superior beings, God, and the meaning of life itself.It's a very captivating and refreshing book."},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"Lewis's account of a philologist kidnapped by a pair of scientists (one a warped idealist and the other motivated strictly by greed) is a wonderful work of fiction which touches on topics such as education, philosophy and religion. Its basis in Christian belief will be clear to the educated reader, though the unfamiliar names used to describe it may make the book more palatable to those who like science fiction but are wary of being 'preached to.' Perhaps its most charming strength is its reconciliation of a scientific understanding of the universe with a view of the world to which wonder, mystery and the miraculous are critical. In this book, the two are complimentary rather than contradictory and in the end Lewis makes it abundantly clear that this was his intent. The power of language is a theme throughout and its power both to mask and reveal ideas is sublimely shown when the philologist, Ransom, must translate into an alien tongue the philosophy of the physicist Weston. What Weston uses his polished vocabulary and oratory to convey, Ransom must restate in simple words and in so doing lays bare their real meanings and inherent contradictions.Science fiction and fantasy fans will find a competently written plot filled out with engaging characters and plenty of fascinating, detailed images of alien landscapes, flora and fauna. Though it does involve a space journey, its tone is closer to Lord of the Rings than Star Wars or Star Trek (without LOTR's epic scope). Christians will find a reminder of the beauty of their faith and anybody interested in philosophy and ethics will find plenty of material to absorb and debate."},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"Though I don't agree with a lot of C. S. Lewis' theology, I believe he is one of the greatest Christian writers of all time. His stories inspire the imagination and teaches lessons for all to learn.In this story, Lewis' creative imagination comes out in full force. Though it is a typical sci-fi story (quite well written considering when it was first published [1938]), it teaches us compelling lessons regarding the world, cosmos, humanity, good and evil, and religion.One will find a rich resource of information on what earth could have been if humanity did not fall into sin (the \\"hrossa\\" community on Malacandria nicely depicts life in an unfallen state). It is also a nice action sci-fi that will keep you on your toes throughout. Get it and read it. You will not only be entertained but enlightened as well."},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"I must have read Out of the Silent Planet as a teenager. What other explanation for its being on my shelf, priced at 95 cents? And that reader (who I was) thought it was science fiction, or perhaps picked it because it was written by the author of the (allegedly children's literature) Narnia series.Returning to the story decades later, I see something totally different. That it is science fiction is almost irrelevant. If anything, that's just the genre which frees a writer a bit more by allowing him to suspend any historical or technological occurrence at will. But then, Mark Twain managed that in A Connecticut Yankee without calling it science fiction.Rather, a great writer abstracts the most general from human history, and paints a picture with a different color paint to highlight simply-stated big questions we all ignore. Questions as political as, \\"Is there enough food in the world for everyone?\\" (If so, why do we starve some people in order to force them to do our will?) As sublime as, \\"What is man?\\" Or, both profound and humorous, \\"What are pets and why do we have them?\\"If you have ever had the silly, if somewhat rewarding, experience of discovering a lost 20-dollar bill, now found, in a book on the shelf, consider it as a warm recommendation to re-read books. For if the bill has not changed, or perhaps lost some value, the reader has changed. Hopefully grown from experience, meeting anew the challenge of great questions in the guise of a story, one can enjoy so much more."},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"As I put down my copy of Out of the Silent Planet after finishing it, my mind immediately began to compare it to the other works of C.S. Lewis that I read. Among which were all of the books in the Chronicles of Narnia series. I immediately made the distinction that the Chronicles of Narnia were more geared towards a younger crowd, perhaps less interested in the big picture. Out of the Silent Planet, however, made it clear that it was much more about the idea than the story. The book follows the adventures of one Dr. Ransom and his journey a world not of our own. He has many pitfalls, meeting several different species along the way. He respects or fears each one for a particular reason, learning more and more about them as his stay on the planet prolongs. Near the end he finally finds resolution in his quest to return home and perhaps become better acquainted with what he is experiencing. The entire time one reads this book, you are simply enthralled by a world Lewis created much before almost anything at all was known about space. He may have been wrong on a few accounts of outer space and how travel through out space works, but that is hardly a point of focus. This book makes you explore not only the very depths of your imagination, but also makes you question your beliefs about life as it is known. C.S. Lewis was a very insightful man, delving into the human condition while at the same time creating a book that is hard to put down. His vivid imagery almost places one at the side of Dr. Ransom, and it is very easy to feel the emotion he experiences. I would recommend this book to anyone who appreciates perspectives on life that they may not have explored quite yet."},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"In Out of the Silent Planet, C. S. Lewis develops several themes familiar to modern readers, but likely original at the time of its publication in 1938. Unlike most science fiction of the time, it has aged well. It starts out like one of the classic space operas with a detailed description of a spaceship operating on unfamiliar principles, and an original description of space travel as bathing in heavenly light. His lyrical prose incites the imagination, even while our familiarity with actual space travel provides counterpoint. I would far rather travel through his space than the reality.His description of the alien planet he travels to is a reminder about why we read science fiction in the first place. Not many modern science fiction writers still use this technique to invoke our sense of wonder, but Lewis uses it to great effect, illustrating an alien environment with descriptions of different geology, weather, plant and animal life. After the first few chapters, he begins to develop unique larger themes, completely leaving behind the familiar space opera format.What if man is not the pinnacle of creation? What if God really exists on an immediate, personal basis and is only remotely present on Earth because of alien intervention? What is technological progress without moral progress?This book won't appeal to the hard science fiction fan, but with its lyrical prose and deft handling of timeless themes, it will always be a science fiction classic."},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"How thoroughly refreshing--and how thoroughly embarrassing. Refreshing in that this is science fiction from an innocent, one might even say nave, age. Here we find no light sabers, no warp cores, no wormholes. Even the alien lifeforms are recognizable as having been inspired by an imagination steeped in the reality of earthly creatures or, at least, of earthly imaginations. If \\"Star Wars\\" takes us to the pinnacle of futuristic combat, then \\"Out of the Silent Planet\\" takes us to a calmer milieu where sanity, reason, and compassion still exert major influence. I found the environment a relief from the high stress levels of most contemporary science fiction.Now, why is the book also thoroughly embarrassing? First, understand that the sci-fi genre is merely a stage trapping, a setting in which a serious drama unfolds as the playwright directs. The embarrassment is in the message of the drama. Except for one rather annoying (and carnivorous) water creature, the alien races that one meets in Lewis' novel are far more civilized and rational than are two of the three humans plunked into their midst, and even the third affronts the alien culture through his irrational fear. These representatives of the human race just do not comport themselves as one would like!Many critics intent on explicating Lewis' works see the heavy influence of Lewis' Christian philosophy at work, and, indeed, the \\"Chronicles of Narnia\\" do provide imaginative allegories for Christian beliefs. I do not, however, find such heavy-handedness to be at work in \\"Out of the Silent Planet,\\" though there are some neat creatures that do remind one of fanciful angels. Approach \\"Silent Planet\\" expecting to re-discover science fiction as the genre began and don't expect heavy-duty allegorical figures or any sort of super-technology at work.Do, however, anticipate quite a bit of implied criticism of the human species--a criticism that the actions of Lewis' characters show may be well deserved!Oh, one final observation: One of the absolute joys of this book is Lewis' fine command of the English language. His writing is a thing of beauty--smooth, flowing, close to perfection in its grammatical simplicity and polish. Would that we could all write with such fine skill."},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"C.S. Lewis is best known for his classic fantasy series The Chronicles of Narnia. But he's in his best form in the sprawling Space Trilogy. And the first volume &quot;Out of the Silent Planet&quot; is a solid, dreamy slice of imaginative science fiction with deep philosophical underpinnings.Philologist (studies languages) Dr. Ransom is on a walking tour of England when he encounters a former despised schoolmate, Devine. Things take a nasty turn after Devine and his accomplice Weston drug Ransom, and load him onto a spaceship. Over the course of a month's interstellar travel, Ransom learns that they are travelling to the planet Malacandra (Mars) -- and worst, he's destined to be a human sacrifice.Ransom manages to escape after they land, and finds himself alone in an alien world. He soon is taken in by the otterlike hrossa, and learns that there are three sentient species on Malacandra: the peaceful poetry-loving hrossa, the workaholic pfifltriggi, and intelligent seroni. When a hross friend of Ransom's is killed by the murderous humans, he sets out to find the mysterious, powerful Oyarsa, who might be able to help him and stop his kidnappers.&quot;Out of the Silent Planet&quot; is no space opera. Lewis avoids most of the tendencies of typical sci-fi in favor of a more H.G. Wells approach. Big fleshy plants, sentient otters, decreased gravity and petrified forests really give it the feeling of another planet without using cheap tricks.The most striking idea of &quot;Planet&quot; is the people who populate it -- three dissimilar species, who work together and have no problems like war, starvation, lies, power-lust or any of the other problems that human beings have. It's a stark contrast to our own world, and it illustrates a lot of Lewis's own Christian beliefs without being preachy or silly.The tone of &quot;Planet&quot; is generally very somber and thought-provoking, with long stretches of ethical and philosophical dialogue. Parts of it almost seem like a dream, very eerie and surreal, and the dignified personalities of Oyarsa and his underlings are beautifully done. But Lewis rips loose with some comedy from time to time, like Weston trying to bribe the various natives with a cheap necklace and Tarzan-esque threats of &quot;Why you take our puff-bangs [guns] away? We very angry with you!&quot;Lewis based Ransom partly on his pal, fantasy author J.R.R. Tolkien, and Ransom is a nicely done hero; he's not boring or preachy at all, but merely a &quot;stranger in a strange land&quot; who almost goes bonkers once or twice, but manages to triumph. Weston and Devine, on the other hand, are arrogant and dumb in an all-too-recognizable way. And the inhabitants of Malacandra take a little getting used to, but they're pleasant once you do.&quot;Out of the Silent Planet&quot; still stands up as a vivid and beautifully-written piece of science fiction. You think you know C.S. Lewis after the Narnia Chronicles? Try the Space Trilogy."},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"If one is likely to read and love C.S.Lewis' The Chronicles of Narnia, one cannot help but be equally satisfied, and in some ways more, with this book and the other two in the Space Trilogy (Perelandra, and That Hideous Strength). This book is told about a Dr. Ransom who is taken captive by two aquaintances (Weston and Divine)on Earth and flown by spaceship to Malacandra. It is here where Ransom flees with fear of what may happen to him in his captive's hands and their motives. Along the way he meets the most intreaging of creatures on the planet who will both pull you in and take you away. Wonderfully described and portrayed, C.S.Lewis gives the reader a gift of traveling to a new world full of seroni, hrossa, etc. Allowing for readers with an open mind, to learn and ponder new thoughts and ideas. Ransom through his stay on the planet, learns to face his fears and become a better human being while respecting the differences in others who are unlike himself. The characters and story are unforgetable. I highly recomend this book, and I can assure you will not be hesitant to pick up the second when through."},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"Forget the aliens, the morality aspect, the rare foray into long-windedness about geographic details -- these books are about the human heart, the human spirit, the human mind. Although Lewis is sometimes characterized as a &quot;Christian&quot; writer, the trilogy puts him in any category but, with its dizzying array of characters, language development, scientific plausibility (and implausibility!) and inner emotions investigation that leave you pure spankin' breathless at times. Timeless, timeless writing; you'll think it was written last year, instead of 50 years ago.The first installment is the most sci-fi of the trilogy, with a philologist being shanghied to Mars by someone who could be a 1990's unscrupulous land developer and by a rationalistic scientist (ala many modern movie sci-fi villians). The hero soul searches throughout the novel (he clearly is thrust into the role and doesn't relish it), and develops relationships with Martians who are not unlike Native Americans in culture (though not in appearance!). The subsequent volumes, &quot;Perelandra&quot; and &quot;That Hideous Strength&quot; are fantastic tales of anguish and triumph, with male-female relationships thoroughly, albeit somewhat traditionally, explored.Lewis mostly wrote non-fiction; it is a testament to his brilliance that this trilogy is some of the best-written and well-plotted stuff on the shelves today."},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"Do not read this book if you are simply looking for something to do on a rainy Sunday afternoon; it is not that kind of book. It is the kind of book that forces the mind to perform all sorts of mental gymnastics that are not at all easy at the time but, afterwards, show themselves to be the way through the keyhole of a locked door to a world that could hitherto scarcely be imagined. A wonderful, wonderful book"},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"CS Lewis wrote what I consider the best Christian apologetics of the 20th century, books I've read and in some cases re-read and re-read and re-read, books I turn to regularly. Of course he also wrote the much-loved Narnia stories, which I've also read, both for my own enjoyment and, aloud, to my children. I've read Til We Have Faces (which I liked fairly well) and Surprised by Joy (which I liked quite a lot). I've read a few of the biographies and one critical study of the Narnia books. So you could say I'm a fan. And, yes, I'm on pretty much the same page as Lewis, theologically. That said, I found this book almost unreadable. There is no depth to any of the characters, no logic to the plot, no zest to the prose, and nothing that made me want to read on. I was on a long plane ride though so I did press on. I finished the book but it was a chore and not a pleasure. In fact, I actually rewarded myself for my persistence with brief intervals of the in-flight magazine. Think about that. It's hard to come up with a more damning condemnation of a book than to say I preferred reading reviews of restaurants in Nashville, a city I haven't visited in thirty years and have no plans on visiting in the near future. So why two stars instead of just one? I guess just the aforementioned fondness for Lewis."},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"This was my first time reading any fiction of Lewis's. I have previously read \\"The Screwtape Letters\\" and am still reading \\"Mere Christianity\\".I must say this was an awesome book. Very believable characters, wonderful locales, and Lewis did a great job painting a picture with words. This is the first Science Fiction I've read since reading Isaac Asmiov in high school, and this had me engrossed on the same level as \\"Robots of Dawn\\". I am very excited to read the next 2. I highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"This is a book that was hard to follow and confusing at times with no explanation of many topics introduced. I was dissapointed in C.S. Lewis."},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"Unlike some stories written a while back (Isaac Asimov for example) which are still entertaining I found this book too descriptive and thus very boring.

Some of the paragraphs seemed non-sensical and therefore hard to follow."},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"This classic work of science fiction richly describes a vision of space that is at once both fantastic and realistic. C .S. Lewis's book captures the imagination with colorful descriptive prose amid an exciting and engaging adventure story that leaves the reader enveloped in a setting that constantly evolves upon itself. The protagonist, Elwin Ransom, is forced to think on his feet in order to forge ahead in his unfamiliar surroundings and undergoes a complete metamorphosis of character to confront his enemies. Ransom is the true definition of a dynamic character, as his struggle to understand the alien environment in which he finds himself mirrors the reader's own path through the diverse settings and plot developments. Beyond the intriguing plot, Lewis overlays a deep philosophical study of human nature. Seeing man at both his moral high and low, the reader is forced to consider \\"what is the acceptable price of scientific progress?\\" Out of the Silent Planet is a must read for anyone interested in science fiction or the wonderful writing style of a literary genius."},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"I picked this book up at a local used book store for a dollar. I love sci-fi, and figured it was worth a try because I recognized the author. The story was excellent! After reading it, I found the rest of the series online. The second book in the series was great too, and the third was ok. I'd definately recommend the first two books of the series. However, reader be warned... there are hints of religion included in this series. So if you're looking for an exclusive sci-fi story, this one goes a step further. It's a great story regardless, and focuses on space travel, social interactions with aliens, and even a love story."},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"I personally like this book a lot, in fact enough to give it 5 stars. But I can see how this book is either Hot or Cold with most readers. As with most of his fantasy/sci-fi works, Lewis filled this book with metaphors and at times the story may be a bit tedious because of his need to make these metaphors work. Nevertheless, I think that among science fiction novels, this is a highly under-appreciated work."},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"Once again, I have fallen in love with a book by C.S. Lewis. &quot;Out of the Silent Planet&quot; takes its place alongside &quot;The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe&quot;, &quot;Till We Have Faces&quot;, &quot;The Voyage of the Dawn Treader&quot;, &quot;Mere Christianity&quot;, &quot;The Great Divorce&quot;, &quot;The Screwtape Letters&quot;, and &quot;The Last Battle&quot; as books Lewis has written that I believe everyone should read.I am astounded by Lewis' creative imagination. The planet of Malacandra is a profound idea expressed beautifully. I do not wish to go into too many details because discovery is the real joy in reading this book. However, I must say that Ransom is one of Lewis' most complex and compelling (if somewhat ambiguous) protagonists; and therefore...one of my favorites.I thoroughly enjoyed Out of the Silent Planet.

It's the only fantasy story I really like considering I'm not fond of fantasy. My mom pressed me on reading his Space Trilogy and I hesitated for years until finally trying it out.I never made it through the first book, only up to like chapter 10 and I was bored throughout it all. I forced myself to go until I couldn't bare it. I was surprised but then realize not everyone can write certain genres. C.S. Lewis is great with fantasy, I loved his Screwtape Letters and his Christian Books are very inspiring, but he does not know how to write science fiction. I made like six attempts to read the books but at this point I just honestly can't anymore.I'm not really complaining about the writing style and most of the description is more then fair, but the story is just pointless and boring. The few parts that were suppose to be exciting weren't and usually was short. Part of me wanted to enjoy this series since I love C.S. Lewis, but sadly that wasn't the case. I will always love the Narnia books and will forever be entertained by them."},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"Early in the book a man named Ransom is travelling from town to town in search of lodging. Ransom is a professor of philology, an academic discipline where words, phonetics, and other linguistic constructs are observed. Ransom comes across three men fighting, and through a twist of fate is kidnapped by two professors who are going to explore a planet called Malacandra.After their touch down in Malacandra, Ransom is blown away by the vast differences between Earth and Malacandra. The three men are confronted by giant ghost-like creatures. Ransom runs for his life, and becomes stranded alone on the strange planet. This is the story of his adventures and exploration of the planet Malacandra.The main reason I give this four stars is probably because I haven't read the rest of the trilogy yet, but the story is very exciting once the plot is set up about a third through the book. I can't tell you more than what is above for concern I might give away something.Unfortunately, some of my favorite parts of the book fall into that category of stuff I can't give away. However, what I can say is this. Science fiction often encourages our philosophical and theological imagination. The effectiveness with which Lewis does this is significant. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"I had no clue that Lewis had written a sci fi trilogy when I stumbled upon this one completely by random. I was in between books and it is certainly a quick read, so why not?I am glad that I did. Lewis does a great job in telling a story and making sure that he finishes it up and ties up the loose ends. He created a world that was altogether plausible. The Oyarsa and the Hnau add a lot, and also tell a story about our own world.As with anything Lewis writes, I can't help but look for a parable or some other deeper meaning as it relates to mankind. Dare I say that the Oyarsa are angels in Christian myth, that Hnau are the many different religions that exist? That accepted, then the story behind the story would show the predominance of a God, any God, and that all of the Hnau (Jewish, Christian, Muslim...) all should get a long as they are all ruled by the same god, or in this case Meldilorn?I ramble, but either way Lewis created a story worth reading. I do want to read the next in the series to see where it goes, to see if the parable mentioned above does in fact play out even more. I would recommend, even though Lewis could have made it a bit more involved and in depth than it already was.3.5 stars."},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"This is a must read for any Lewis fan and really for anybody.

I'm a huge Narnia fan, loved Screwtape, and much of Lewis' nonfiction.I found the beginning a bit hard to get into. I'm not sure why--can't pinpoint it. It simply took effort to make myself keep reading. Not overly so, however, or I'd have given up.About a third of the way in, I found I could hardly put it down. I really began to feel that connection with Ransom and the world of Malacandra, and loved watching Ransom grow as a character. The pacing evened out to a perfect balance of thought and action. And of course Lewis' picturesque writing made it all the better."},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"Like many older works of science fiction we now know that the planetary descriptions are definitely not correct. But, like many of those works, the story stands on its own merits outside of the science.Out of the Silent Planet is the first book in a trilogy which explores a great number of religious and philosophical questions by taking the protagonist to Mars (in this book) and Venus (in the next). The story is still fun to read, even on the sixth or seventh go-around. The plot is very well constructed. The villains are chosen to represent certain philosophical viewpoints and thus are a little latter than the protagonist and several of the Martian characters.Although I think anyone could enjoy the story, to fully enjoy it you will need to be at least in sympathy with Lewis' Christian viewpoint, as it flavors the entire work, and crucial plot elements (such as the entire organizational structure of the planets) are based on Lewis' Christian speculations and readings."},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"Besides The Chronicles of Narnia, C. S. Lewis' best-known fiction is his science-fiction works known as The Space Trilogy. Also known as The Cosmic Trilogy, perhaps because the third volume is notably \\"earthbound\\", these three books have been jokingly referred to as \\"Narnia in space\\".At the time that Lewis wrote these works, there was debate about whether there was life beyond the stars, about the limits of science, and about whether new discoveries would finally \\"throw off the shackles\\" of religion. Add into the mix were concerns about social Darwinism, eugenics, imperialism, and so on, and the intellectual debates were fascinating, but they obviously must have troubled Lewis because they all were going towards what he would have concluded was the wrong direction. So Lewis set out his pen, and began to put forth his view of what life may be like beyond the cosmos if aliens existed. Along the way, he dealt with issues such as the importance of life, even if the person is not as intelligent, or doesn't seem to be as worth-while to society, as well as the idea that the ends decidedly do not justify the means in all circumstances. Indeed, Lewis' portrayal of the evil plots by Weston and Devine seem to be a very subtle jab against Hitler in Germany and Stalin in Russia who (especially Hitler) still seemed to have a puzzling popularity in the West.The story starts out with a professor of philology (who seems to have been based upon Lewis' good friend, The Lord of the Rings author, J. R. R. Tolkien, himself a scholar of languages) who is on his break from school, and is using the time away from researching, teaching and grading papers to go on a \\"walking tour\\" of the English countryside.Seeking shelter for the night in a small village, the professor, Dr. Elwin Ransom, comes across a hysterical woman distraught over the fact that her mentally handicapped son hasn't come home from work on time that day, like he always does. Though he really just wants to find a place to spend the night as soon as possible, Ransom agrees to search for and find her boy, and he does so. He comes upon a scene of the young man, scared out of his mind, being roughed up by two other men. Upon rescuing the boy, Ransom finds himself soon kidnapped by the villains, Professor Weston and Devine, Who quickly drug him into unconsciousness.He is stunned upon waking to find himself on a spaceship journeying to a strange planet his captors call \\"Malacandra\\". He soon learns that they intend to give him as a human sacrifice to the natives of the planet, called \\"sorns\\". As soon as the ship lands, Ransom takes advantage of a distraction to run off and evade his (now former) captors. As he makes his way across the landscape of the strange, new world, he learns that all is not as it appears. His eventual fate is not nearly as bad as Weston and Devine thought it would be, but the secrets he learns about his own world will change him forever.This work is truly a masterpiece. Lewis opined on the philosophical and moral debates of his time by use of the story-telling device of science-fiction. Arguably, the credit that folks give to Gene Roddenberry for ushering in some new era of storytelling by using his Star Trek stories to give commentary on current events issues should go instead to C. S. Lewis. Lewis was able to effectively use his typically elegant and witty prose to the extent that his commentary did not interfere at all with the tale he wanted to tell. In most authors, the \\"lessons\\" or \\"Aesops\\" come across in a blunt, clumsy, heavy-handed manner. Not so in this work.I really just want to deal with a two main criticisms that the book and series as a whole have gotten. First, Lewis did not have some hair-brained notion of Mars landscape. He knew, because it was already known to some extent, that Mars was not like this. It is a STORY. He was making up a fiction, just like DC Comics does with the Martian Manhunter, or many others have. The second major criticism is that Lewis hated science. No, he didn't. Ransom was a philologist, which is one of the \\"harder\\" areas of the \\"social sciences\\", the sorns are basically scholars and scientists, and the atheist good guy among the group in the final installment of the trilogy, is an intelligent, scientific man. No, what Lewis hated and criticized was science unrestrained by notions of basic morality and decency. That really is different from \\"hating science\\".The Cosmic Trilogy, beginning with Out of the Silent Planet, is still to this day unique among science-fiction tales, because the aliens that are superior to humans are not so due to atheism, but due to a higher moral state and a belief in God, the God that is known as the Judeo-Christian God here on earth.This book and the rest of the trilogy, like the Narnia books, is enjoyable as a fun story, but for those who wish to \\"dig deeper\\", the commentary Lewis put forth in the books was pertinent to the time in which it was written, and is still relevant today.Highly Recommended."},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"Genuinely delighted. I disliked the book to begin with, I hate it when authors go into a fictional language and attempt to invent one, it makes reading tedious. However I was surprised and delighted with the turn the book takes and ended up really enjoying the whole story. It has one of those grand view / paradigm shifting twists which are both clever and delightful."},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"Exit Darkness, Enter Light: Book One of the Earth CycleMaybe it's one of those roads you take when you're younger, but I never read CS Lewis as a kid. Instead I was a 12-year-old Tolkien nerd. To someone who's read a lot of science fiction over the years, this is fairly entry-level stuff. Man goes to alien world where the aliens turn out to be wiser and kinder than humans - well, there's a trope I haven't heard of before. The description of Mars (it's called Malacandra in the book) is vivid, but from a scientific point of view, preposterous. The real point is Lewis's cosmology, which just like the Narnia books is Christian theology described in terms of aliens and mysterious beings rather than angels and demons. It's not really all that intrusive if like me you don't believe in that stuff, but some more passionate non-believers may find it irritating.The best part of the book is the bit where the hero Ransom and the aliens that he's befriended meet the hero's malevolent human kidnappers, the megalomaniac scientist Weston and Weston's avaricious sidekick Devine. The reason why this scene is so good is that you can see Lewis doing what he liked to do best - attack something. Weston delivers what he intends to be a powerful speech about the human need to expand and colonise the universe, which Ransom translates into the aliens' language. Because Weston's speech is phrased mostly in windy abstractions such as \\"technology\\" and \\"power\\" and \\"Life\\", which the aliens' speech can't support, it comes across as ludicrous: Weston proclaims that humankind's greater technology and mastery of the air and sea entitles us to conquer races who lack such technology, and Ransom translates it as \\"Because we can carry many heavy things faster than you can, we are allowed to kill you.\\" It's a fine bit of knockabout satire, but Weston is made to be an easy target.There are two other books in Lewis's trilogy: \\"That Hideous Strength\\", which is said to be the best one but which I haven't read, and \\"Perelandra\\" which is said to be the worst one, and which I have just started. So far it's not looking good.Lewis fans will want to read everything by their hero, and why not. Nearly everything he wrote is interesting, if not always convincing. But readers who cut their SF teeth on Philip K. Dick, Ursula LeGuin, William Gibson, Neal Stephenson etc. will probably wonder what the fuss is about."},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"This book is just great. Our hero is transported to Mars and finds it inhabited by beings in touch with the entire universe except for one blind spot-Earth. The explaination for this is slowly revealed as the worlds come closer and closer to a crisis and the story is just wonderful. The 2nd book in the series, \\"Perelandra,\\" is quite simply one of the best theological arguments I've ever read presented as an ongoing debate between the characters in the story. I loved this book and have read it several times over the years. The last book in the trilogy is \\"That Hideous Strength\\" and is one of the most downright frightening stories I've ever read, heard, or watched, possibly because much of the story often seems as if it may really be happening with the media in the United States in particular. (And the international media for that matter) I love the whole trilogy and have probably bought all of the books several times in my life because I loan them out and never get them them back! They need to put these out in Kindle versions so I'll always have copies of them."},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"Nowadays you have to remember that everything Lewis wrote was sheer conjecture. The scope of his imagination is breathtaking when you remember that."},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"This is top-class SF! C.S.

It also is incredibly and deeply thought-provoking like most other of Lewis' books, but yet can be enjoyed for the story and details. I highly recommend this book, especially to discuss with a friend or group.The trip takes Dr. Ransom, the protagonist, to another planet where Ransom finds out what life could have been like without the break caused in the Garden of Eden. This could spur many meditations on what life is meant to be like and how life can be more joyful. Classic Lewis, one of the best that I have read of his. If you like his fiction, get this book."},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"This book is amazing, there is not a better word to describe it, I read it over and over again. C.S. Lewis is hands down my favorite Author. What a great man and thinker he was. If you have not picked up this trilogy I advise you to do so. I wont tell you anything about it cause I would hat to spoil it for you. AMAZING!"},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"This book is a marvel for Christian readers. The power of fiction and fantasy worlds is in the idealistic viewpoint they provide. As Christians, we know from Scripture how the world is governed, and how we are to walk in it, but at times our vision gets clouded by constantly looking at our surroundings, and the depravity we see all around. But when we read novels with idealized settings such as in C.S. Lewis's space trilogy, we can more readily understand the fundamentals of joy, wonder, and awe at the world, under the governance of reverence for the creator.Out of the Silent Planet takes readers on a tour of what life would be like without the curse of the fall. The Malacandrian world is immensely beautiful and orderly, under the governance of Oyarsa, who submits to the Old One, God. The hnau, or inhabitants of the world, are so peaceful and innocent, and they offer abundant insights into proper conduct in life. I constantly found myself smiling as I saw the parallels between the various components of the book and Christian doctrine.Non-Christians will enjoy this book as well, of course. It is a fascinating story regardless of what you believe, although C.S. Lewis surely wrote it from a Christian worldview, and I appreciate on a deeper level since I'm a Christian."},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"This first book in Lewis's space trilogy is also the only one that is really sci-fi. Much of the book consists of descriptions of Malacandra, as it is known to those who live there--our name for it is Mars. Bigger things are afoot, it is clear, but what won't be shown until 'Perelandra' and especially 'That Hideous Strength.' The book has a chapter tacked on the end, supplying some more details, supposedly written by Ransom to Lewis--a clever touch; Lewis comes off as the colossal bungler, romanticising a straightforward intellectual narrative, to Ransom's clear-headed scientific observational approach--a spoof within a spoof, well and quietly done. The scenes with Weston and the Oyarsa, Ransom translating, are priceless; Lewis works in some sharp satirical comments against war and greed and pride. Those scenes alone would make the book well worth reading. Add in the strange and fascinating--other worlds and creatures and the memorable descriptions of space itself--and you've got a book with double appeal. True, the science is inaccurate--Mars has no 'hnau's and space is not filled with light. Lewis is not to blame, however, especially for the last--space _ought_ to be filled with light; no one knows why it isn't; whole books (e.g., 'Why the Sky is Dark at Night') have been written on the subject. Science aside, the book really has no flaws except that it doesn't ever soar above its consistent level of quality."},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"CS Lewis was a tremendously diverse and engaging writer. Apart from being the most celebrated modern apologist for the Christian Faith, Lewis brought to the table a very sophisticated appreciation and understanding of great literature.Out of the Silent Planet weaves a tale of Science Fiction before the genre became vastly more popularized in the 50's and following(in large part due to the influence of contemporary friend and member of local literary group, The Inklings, JRR Tolkien.) Lewis, ever the moralist, used his writing as a vehicle to make a greater point. While this is not the blatant allegory that his better known and highly popular Chronicles of Narnia represents, there nonetheless exists a very clear message for the discerning reader who wants to find it.Interesting as well for the choice of Ransom (think there may be a Christian parallel with that name?) as the protagonist. Many believe that Lewis selected Ransom as a philologist in honor of his close friend J.R.R. Tolkien who was instrumental in bringing him to Christianity as an adult wrestling with agnosticism and the inevitable conclusions to which someone of Lewis' intellectual and romantic nature was subject.Themes of original sin and spiritual naivety abound. But, the work itself is sophisticated enough and well written that anyone can read and enjoy the book on its own merits, whether they are looking for those underlying themes or not.An outstanding, classic read. Of all of Lewis' works this is perhaps the least known and appreciated. Don't miss the opportunity to experience a work by this creative genius. Enjoy the ride!"},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"It seems as though the success of the Lord of the Rings trilogy has inspired filmmakers to tackle another huge project, and they have settled on CS Lewis' Narnia books, taking a flyer with Andrew Adamson's production first of the LION, THE WITCH AND THE WARDROBE. If you ask me (of course no one did LOL), this space trilogy of Lewis' would have been a natural, for some of its virtues could be reproduced on film, and perhaps the scope of film could have salvaged some of its weaknesses.As many have noticed, OUT OF THE SILENT PLANET, while giant in conception, is the tightest of the three, and each book becomes more of a baggy monster than the one before. Dr. Ransom is introduced, and kidnapped to an alien planet where overtones of Miltonic good and evil tickle the fancy of the reader while provoking a great deal of suspense as to his fate, and the fate of the whole universe.Ransom is a fascinating character, scientist blended with he-man and activist--would have been perfect for Sean Connery, say, twenty years ago.In the meantime I urge all readers to give OUT OF THE SILENT PLANET a try, even if you're not into science fiction per se. It has a great deal to tell us about the world we all still live in right now."},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"This is the first book of CS Lewis' Space Trilogy that continues with \\"Perelandra\\" and finishes with \\"That Hideous Strength\\". The book imagines a Universe with intelligent life on planets other than Earth, where Earthly humans are the only fallen (sinful) creatures. Three travelers from Earth (Dr. Ransom, Dr. Weston and Dr. Devine ) visit one of these planets without sin, and the book explores the differences between the created before and after the fall. Is Lewis attempting to ascertain what the Creator had in mind for His creation? Maybe. Is he trying to portray what heaven may hold in the afterlife? Possibly. Regardless, the book is my favorite of the trilogy for its nice pace, rich characters and exploration into the mind of God."},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"As a fan of 'hard SF', I was somewhat skeptical that I would like this work, even though C. S. Lewis is a great author. That being said, I was pleasantly surprised by this book. The hardcover version has excellent binding and is of good quality.The tale covers the abduction of one Elwin Ransom, who is taken to Mars as a human sacrifice and escapes. He meets up with the natives, learns their language and comes to understand some fundamental things about the universe and the human race.The author is a well-known Christian, and this tale builds on basic themes of Christianity.I found the book almost impossible to put down. There are so few traditional science fiction details that the book doesn't read like a work of that genre (no space battles, no details on hyperdrive or warp technology). Instead it is an adventure, that unfolds to show the main character (and the reader, who easily slips into the protagonist's shoes) hidden secrets of the universe, thereby unleashing a profound philosophical and moral transformation on him.Very thought provoking, and a must read for any Christian."},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"Out of the Silent Planet is a timeless work of art that has inspired millions. Lewis has intertwined a truly surreal adventure with a deep and meaningful message of peace and tranquillity. His writing is chock full of imagery and beauty. The words paint a picture in the mind so precise that Dali himself would have only wished he could have matched the greatness of this book with his palette.Dr. Ransom, the protagonist, is a very believable character. He and two other men, named Weston and Devine, crash land on the red planet with completely different intentions. Dr. Ransom, having been kidnapped, escapes his captors and embarks on a memorable adventure. Ransom uses very simple logic to learn the language of the native species and he interacts with the four races of Malacandria differently, creating a very interesting and awe-inspiring atmosphere.Lewis, as in his other series The Chronicles of Narnia, uses biblical stories and principals to create and allegory that keeps the reader guessing. The race of Eldil (an energy or spirit type being) offer wisdom and encourage Ransom during his stay on the planet while essentially balking Weston and Devine's petty quest to ransack the resources of the planet. The moral Lewis conveys is a simple, yet important one.Out of the Silent Planet is a diamond in the rough. It was written well before the recent conquest of space and the immanence of technology, so the imaginative view of what Lewis thought Mars might be like is very interesting. I am looking forward to reading the rest of the series, which I've read, only gets better."},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"There's no denying that C. S. Lewis is one of the great writers of the 20th century and it's fast becoming the case that any truly literate person must be familiar with his work. Embarrassingly, I had never read his celebrated Space Trilogy, of which \\"Out of the Silent Planet\\" is the first installment. Simply put, the book is a quick, enjoyable read as simply fantasy/science fiction.Granted, it's not what most folks would consider modern sci-fi. Lewis hews closer to the classic format used by H. G. Wells than the sex and violence-laden style used by most contemporary writers. However, the true genius of the work is the philosophical/metaphysical themes that run just below the surface. Sadly, some of this was spoiled for me because I had previously been given a \\"heads-up\\" about certain specifics discussed in the series. For that reason, I won't go into them here in this review. I think the book is an even better read if you don't know what to expect going in.Suffice it to say, that \\"Out of the Silent Planet\\" is a wonderful book--intellectual but not heavy and overly grandiose. Read it. If you like books that entertain and make you think, you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"C. S. Lewis has taken space travel and Christian theology and woven them into a startlingly believable story, brilliantly told in classic C. S. Lewis prose. There is something on every level - a good adventure tale, a deep look into personality, and a searing expos&eacute; of human sin and its devastating consequences. Those unfamiliar with the basics of theology will not catch the deepest implications, and will therefore miss the subtle beauty and meaning of this incredible little book."},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"This is the great lay-theologian's foray into sci-fi, first published in 1938. I mention that date, because this book does not resemble much current \\"science fiction.\\" It's definitely fiction... but not very scientific. For instance, Lewis avoids explaining any technical problems in how these characters actually leave Earth's atmosphere (or return). What is the source of propulsion? Nowadays, a 7-year-old reader would get bogged down in the first few pages, realizing that everyone would be burnt to a crisp in the homemade space-contraption Lewis blithely hurtles them off in.That being said... the book is still a gem.It begins with Dr. Elwin Ransom (a middle-aged Philologist from Cambridge University) being kidnapped by two men, Dick Devine and Dr. Weston, the latter being a mad physicist who wants to extend humanity to other planets. At first, Ransom is excited with this journey to Malacandra (Mars)... until he overhears that he is going to be offered as a sacrifice to the space-creatures called \\"sorns.\\" Devine and Weston have been to Malacandra before, and have convinced themselves that a human sacrifice is recquired by the sorns, in return for the right to exploit the planet's gold deposits.Upon arrival, Ransom escapes... beginning a conflict that lasts the length of the book and extends to its sequel \\"Perelandra.\\"In this colorful novel, Lewis explores many DEEP themes... the primary one being that, if there is life on another planet, there is no need for us to assume that it is in a \\"fallen\\" state, or filled with wickedness, or in need of redemption, as our own is. If we reached other planets we might find a race which was, like us, rational but, unlike us, innocent - having no wars nor any other wickedness among them. If this were so, we would have much to learn from such creatures, and have nothing to teach them. But, because of our own \\"bentness\\" we would probably find some reason for exterminating them.This is what happens here in Out Of The Silent Planet.Lewis was inspired to write this book after finding that many of his own students held to beliefs in interplanetary colonization and the scientific hope of defeating physical death. Out Of The Silent Planet is an attack on the belief that the supreme moral end of mankind is the perpetuation of our own species. The book is so rich in invention, so broad in scope, so sensuously perceptive in descriptive detail that, after reading it, it's difficult to view the Cosmos through any but Lewis' eyes. Seriously, after my first reading, I walked outside and looked up into the night sky and wondered... \\"What if?\\""},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"I liked this book that depicts three sinful men placed on a planet that seems to have no sin.

I was really able to imagine the planet and creatures. While it's is not a nail-biter... there was more than enough action and suspense to keep me engaged and wondering where the story would lead.Other have mentioned that the social commentary is dated or offensive...

The descriptions are graphic and intricate, creating not just a way of life and a complete planet but a new order of society where everyone has their own place without being overshadowed. Dr Ransom's attempts to qualify what he is seeing show how naive the human race can be, and how easily they can be saved when he is brought face to face with the leader-father-god of the planet Malacandra, Oysara, who sets him with a task which leads him into the next novel: PERELANDRA.

S. Lewis, but when I read Out of the Silent Planet, I definately had a new favorite. This book is very involved and it's not a book to be taken lightly. This is a book with a lot of inner meaning. It talks about the dark side of humanity. Cram packed with comady, action, suspense and science-fiction, Out of the Silent Planet is by far one of the best books I have ever read. And though I haven't read them yet, Perelandra and That Hideous Strength are even better (or so I've heard). But though it's not a very long book, it really doesn't need to be. I would recommend this book to anyone with a bit of extra time."},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"A great book, creating a new world for the reader to explore, unlike any other.

Silent Planet is not as good on its own as either Perelandra of That Hideous Strength. However, it is a strong opener and the descriptions of Malacandra are calculated to give the reader that &quot;poignant stab of unbearable longing&quot; described by Lewis in Surprised by Joy. While it is certainly not as indispensable as so many of Lewis' works, I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"This was a great novel, but it had it's flaws. The plot line of Out of the Silent Planet is excellent, perhaps one of the best sci-fi plots I have come across, but the characterization is something to be desired. Don't get me wrong, the charcters were plenty entertaining and Lewis developed them nicely, but they are a little bit one sided. By that I mean that Dr. Ransom (the main character of the story) is all good -- he has no bad traits. And the antagonist(s) are the same way, they are bad, plain and simple. Personally I like a little bit of ambiguity... just somthing to make the story a little more interesting and a little less predictable. The reason for this aspect of Lewis' characters is probably because of the religous message embeded in the story, for most religons have characteristics of pure love and pure hate rather than ambiguous qualities that I am talking about. (Don't let the religon and deeper meaning thing scare you off, it's still great sci-fi!) Besides the whole religous reasoning, the characters may be a little lacking simply because this is one of Lewis' earlier works, thus he had not likely had much experiance in character development. If you like fantasy and havn't read The Chronicles of Narnia, you may want to read those first (they are also by C. S. Lewis), but otherwise I recommend this novel (despite the negative connotation of this review :). It is, overall, well written and thoroughly entertaining. You definately will not be able to put it down."},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"One of the most exciting books I've ever read. C.S.Lewis makes you feel this is not only a story but the whole truth about what happened to our world centuries ago when God created the universe. If you liked The Chronicles of Narnia, then you'll love this book and the other two of the trilogy."},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"If I could realisticly review this book I would give it a 7.5. But 8 is close enough to what I think I guess. Lewis writes a good novel, but it lags in certain areas. One, he gets all his action done near (or at) the beginning of the book. Two, the story seems do sag in the middle, not to interesting. Three, all the alien names are HARD to catch up with, let alone memorize! Other than those characteristics, I thought it was very well balanced, and very well written. Still, a must read!"},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"This science fiction novel written in 1939 by the great cs Lewis, is a great look at some entertaining science fiction with a moral belief system by the author in place."},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"I have tried multiple times to read this trilogy. This last month I decided to tough it out.C.S. Lewis is known for his Chronicles of Narnia books and other thick-headed writings. The Space Trilogy is not for wimps. It is written in the spirit of H.G. Wells and other ancient novels.The first book of the trilogy is titled, Out of the Silent Planet. Telling the story of a man named Ransom, we follow his adventures to the planet Mars and its inhabitants. (One of which you can see on the cover of the book)Ransom is kidnapped by two men and shoot off for the red planet in a special space vehicle. Once there, they encounter what they suspect to be vicious creatures and Ransom escapes before being offered as a sacrifice.The majority of this story focuses on the environment; many pages are devoted to the descriptions of the mountains and terrain.After Ransom meets up with other creatures from the planet, the dialog picks up the pace.It won't take many people to realize that Lewis is using the genre of sci-fi and these characters to tell a different story."},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"Although this short fictional work suffers from serious grammatical style errors, as well as Lewis' annoying habit of taking a simple sentence and metamorphosing it into a collectional labryinth of archaic and obscure terms, it deserves praise as an early classical work of fictional space-time travel.My biggest complaint with this book is that it hooks you into reading the other two in the series (Perelandra, That Hideous Strength), which in my mind, fall far short of the quality of the original book. This deterioration is apparent but acceptable in \\"Perelandra\\"; however, it culminates in \\"That Hideous Strength\\" where Lewis seems to drift aimlessly among topics of space travel and other worlds, to British monarchistic nationalism, Arthurian legends, angelology, human psychology, reincarnation, mad scientists, and marriage life.In short, while I enjoyed this novel and gained some pleasure from Perelandra, the final book was a horrible amalgamation of aimless themes, lacked a concise plot, and left the reader (at least this reader) disappointed."},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"Despite respectful references to the legacy of H. G. Wells--acclaimed inventor of the modern sci fi genre--C.S.Lewis has chosen to forge his own stylistic trail through the perils of alien prose. This first book in a projected trilogy is set onMalacandra; it's no secret that the destination is actually Mars. The story relates the amazing experiences (but few actual&quot;adventures&quot;) of Dr. Ransom. Kidnapped by two soundrel scientists, the mild-mannered fellow awakens on board a space vehicle, en route to another planet, where he will presumably be handed over to alien brutes as a human sacrifice. The tale progresses slowly and could just have easily been written in the first person, since all activity centers around the unlikely progagonist--a university professor of Philology (the study of Words).Expect many references to the British university system and countless chapters devoid of dialogue; narrative reigns supreme in this CSL novel, with extensive monologues or transliterations. The author's deep concentration on mythologyand man's role in the universe will invite readers into deeper realms of thought. The human psyche, as well as human physiognomy, mentality, morals and motivation form the object of intense scrutiny by way of comparison with the three major species on the planet. Dropping veiled hints about the danger of unbridled anthropomorphism, CSL forces his hero (and readers) to reexamine traditional views of man's inalienable right to propagate his seed throughout the galaxy. He questions our immediate reaction of horror at any and all alien life forms. Must they necessarily prove grotesque and brutal?Thinly-disguised references to the Judao-Chistian heritage may lead meditative readers to ponder space as some sort of Heaven, withthe creative blending of mythology and pre history; should manaccept a universal protector god-family as both rational and compassionate? Will Professor Ransom be held hostage for the human race or will he offer himself as living ransom in the future? There seems to be much &quot;in a name&quot; and exhaustive linguistic details in this Sci Fi novel. A thought-provoking book which was intended to entertain by more than mere action and dialogue, OUT OF THE SILENT PLANET drags on long beyond the exciting denouement. Definitley not in the Wells or Verne tradition, this read is sci fi for the philosopher, who may well wonder which of the two worlds deserves to be called &quot;Silent.&quot;"},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"I have been reading alot of sci-fi lately - Wells, Asimov, Clarke, Heinlein, Niven, Orwell, Card - I am afraid Lewis just doesn't come close. Characters, plot, setting, style - you name it I feel he just fell far short with this book. Disappointing since this book is listed in many of the top sci-fi lists.I have read several of Lewis' works (Narnia, The Great Divorce, Screwtape Letters) and I just couldn't get into Out of the Silent Planet at all. What he accomplishes and communicates in his other works just doesn't come through here.The vast majority of the book is spent describing the new world the main character finds himself on. Nothing about this world interested me at all. The races of creatures, the landscapes, everything seemed bland and uninspired.I am a big fan of allegory as a literary device but I didn't think the message here was strong at all. If you want an allegory that is much more inspired, lively, and communicates much clearer, I recommend \\"The Man Who Was Thursday\\" by G.K. Chesterton.If you have read The Screwtape Letters or The Great Divorce and are looking for something on that level of brilliance, this just isn't it."},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"I generally make a point of reading a book before I watch its movie version. In my experience, no matter how great the movie, it is no match for the original written story.Sadly, that was not the case when I read \\"Into the Silent Planet.\\" It was such a painful read for me that I wished to watch the movie version instead. The catch is, the movie version does not exist (not at least to my knowledge; if anyone knows of one, let me know!)The storyline goes like this. An Englishman by the name of Ransom is kidnapped by two scientists and taken to the planet Malacandra for human sacrifice. Ransom manages to escape once he gets to the planet, and the rest of the story talks about his encounters with the beings in Malacandra. Add to it 2 parts philosophy, 1 part Christian theology.One of the reasons why I wished for the movie version is that C.S. Lewis describes Malacandra with such detail and precision that I can only imagine how breath taking it would be to behold the scenery on a large-screen cinema. However, I also found his writing long-winded and often drier than a piece of burnt toast. (And now that I think about it, I don't think I was able to quite get into \\"Lion, Witch and the Wardrobe\\" but LOVED the movie version)I know C.S. Lewis is a beloved writer, but I just can't seem to get into his books. Oh well, to each his own."},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"I am a CS Lewis fan. Have read Chronicles, Till we Have Faces, Screwtape Letters, etc. Was really excited to read this book based on the reviews posted here. I was terribly disappointed. This book moved at a snails pace. I was bored to tears until chapter 12 picked up through 18, and let down through the last post script. I am not sure if the reviews were based on Lewis the author or the book- but I didn't get the raves. Needless to say, I am done with the space journey and won't be finishing the trilogy."},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"Mere Christianity. The Chronicles of Narnia. The Great Divorce. The Screwtape Letters. The Weight of Glory. The Problem of Pain. A Grief Observed. The Abolition of Man. Outside of his memoir Surprised by Joy, every book that I have read by C.S. Lewis has been outstanding. His fantasy is a classic of the genre and it is recommended one reads Narnia at various stages of life to get the full effect, his essays are excellent, Mere Christianity is one of the more important and influential books in modern Christianity. Why, then, did I hesitate for so long before starting the first volume of his Space Trilogy? Did I have some premonition? Everything else has been stellar.And then comes Out of the Silent Planet. I couldn't have been more dissappointed. It's the story of a man named Ransom who is out walking in England when he meets a man he knew back in school. The man, and a cohort, knock Ransom out, kidnap him, and take him to another planet: Malacandra. There Ransom escapes his captors and discovers various alien creatures and learns about their culture (not humanoid at all) and tries to figure out what exactly he should do next and where exactly he is. Malacandra is far more familiar than he would have thought, and the reader can probably guess early on which planet we're talking about here.Fairly simple story, but it's all in the telling. Lewis must have missed something that has served him well in his other fiction, because I could not have been more weary of this book. The action is told in such a way that even when these big events are happening (travelling to another planet, first contact with a sentient alien race, speaking with a nearly divine creature), it feels like nothing is happening. I'm not sure how that could be. Lewis described creation in The Magician's Nephew and the end of creation as we know it in The Last Battle, and it was wonderful. By the time I hit the fifth and sixth chapters I was simply waiting for it all to end. It didn't matter. Thankfully this was a short novel, otherwise I may have put it down without finishing, but I feel bad. I wanted to like this book, I like the work of C.S. Lewis. I'm sure somewhere in this trilogy there is a built in Christ story like the Narnia books, but I don't think I'm going to find out. I can't imagine picking up Perelandra and trying to read it. There are plenty of books by Lewis which I haven't read and I'm sure they are all far superior to Out of the Silent Planet.They'd have to be.-Joe Sherry"},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"If I was lamenting the state of contemporary fiction, as wikipedia mentions Lewis says in his biography, this is not what I would want to see happen to provide a cure.A cure for insomnia, or, in a pinch, a firelighter, perhaps, but there is not much else of interest here."},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"I read the whole out of the silent planet trilogy a few years ago when I was given it for Christmas. I would like to make an interesting comment though. I am surprised that other readers did not seem to mention this, but at the end of out of the silent planet (At least in my book.) There is a letter written by Lewis to the reader. In which he claims the story to (So far as he and his friend can tell.) be true! When I first read this I was incredulous to say the least. But, as I began to think about the idea it seemed unlikely that Lewis would lie. He was for 1 a Christian. For him to throw himself out in the open with something like that and it to be a lie would be very foolish for him. I am a Christian myself and I know for a fact God would not have left Lewis' conscionce un-guilty for long if had lied. Especially since Lewis was a very devout Christian as many of his avid readers know. Lewis also in this letter points to some interesting ancient writings that seem to point to some truth in the matter. I have also done a small amount of research myself and well.......some of the evidence is fairly compelling. Though to be truthful the experience that Lewis' friend had could have been some extremely strange and vivid dream (which his friend actually thought it was at first.) Some of the other things I have looked into involving the book seem compelling. Research and draw your own conclusions. I personally think (Now anyway.) That God created life on other planets but for the exact reason stated in the book we are not supposed to know about it or go to where it may be. Intrerestingly enough this book was given to me when I was asking God if He had created life elsewhere. Well, you can think I am crazy you can think whatever you like. I just thought it would be interesting to not that letter which others seem to not know of or avoid.God Bless"},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"One of the best books I have read. It is a pretty easy read, as is most of Lewis' fiction. BUT it is also very deep. You can read it just on the surface level and be very entertained, but if you think about it more deeply, you will find a LOT of rich material."},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"While this was not a bad science fiction novel in and of itself, I was more impressed at the social and spiritual insight that the author was able to weave into the story. I am familiar with the writings of C.S. Lewis, and I am always impressed at the way that he can give me a fresh perspective on how I view the Christian faith. While C.S. Lewis took some obvious liberties with cosmology and theology, I think that the unique twist that he put on the story of Satan's rebellion was very interesting, and it helped me to think about it in a different light, namely, the perspective of other angels. Something else that I found interesting was the juxtaposition of the innocent and kind Malachandrians to the proud, self-centered Devine and Weston, and how this contrast showed what life on Earth may have been like if humanity weren't affected by evil."},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"It took me 4 months to read all three books. It astonishes me on how much the average reader has lowered their expectations of writers. CS Lewis challenges the reader to think while they are reading; instead of going into a mind-numbing guide through a series of words prepared by writers who have little to no respect for the minds of their readers.Every word written by CS Lewis, in his space trilogy, demand the reader to be their own thinker. In the second book, I was somewhat disgusted by the fact that Lewis derides the word \\"equality\\" in marriage. But I continued, simply because I wanted to know how the story ended.In the 3rd book, CS Lewis went further and explained that there is no equality in marriage: No tit-for-tat, it is about sharing and giving your all to the person you have married... Not just women or men. He defined avarice as the reason our world is failing. \\"Nature is something dead--a machine to be worked, and taken to bits if it won't work the way he pleases.\\" CS Lewis must have known a few oil tycoons in his day... But this can also be applied to any marriage. What is natural, is that we care for each other; and treat each other with respect. We fight this because of our self-centeredness. Our wants are placed above what is natural.His spirits, in all the books, define the whispers in our ears; which in turn, define our actions.These books are not for the weak in will; the weak in spirit; or the closed minds. And I must confess that mind slightly closed in the second book, toward the end. Perservere and you will be rewarded at the conclusion of the third book. Even if you are not Christian, I do recommend taking his advice to heart; and cleave unto each other with joy and caring!"},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"Out of the Silent Planet begins with an unnamed man walking down a road during the evening, trying to find a place to stay. He meets a woman who asks him to find her son and bring him home, so the man, whom we soon find out is named Ransom, goes to the place where the woman's son is working and has to climb over the hedge because the gate is locked. So begins an unexpected adventure for Ransom, who is kidnapped by an old schoolfellow and a physicist who have built a space ship. Lewis really has a wonderful way of writing so that everything seems so real. In describing a sort of dream or hallucination, which really has no bearing on what is happening, he makes it feel real. And oh! the way he describes space (or Deep Heaven) is so breathtaking! Once he gets to Malacandra (the planet Mars), he escapes from the two men who kidnapped him. He meets Hrossa, one of the alien races (though they are so unlike aliens that it sounds strange to call them that, or to call them Martians because of the images they conjure up in the mind). The Hrossa are hnau, or rational creatures who have their own language. Ransom, being a philologist, is trhilled. I was confused by the two words Harandra and Handramit. One means highland, and the other means lowland, but I could never keep them straight. Other than that, though, I have no complaints. I love it, and just finished reading it for the third time. Read it, if you like space travel and adventure. I'd say it's better than H.G.Wells, at least because it has a Christian worldview, and also because of his elegant prose, some of which is almost poetry it is so beautiful."},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"If you love sci-fi, read this book. If you love theology, read this book. CS Lewis does an ingenious job of masking the Christian story of man's fall and redemption in a page-turning original sci-fi story.

While this is not like Lewis's other works, such as the Chronicals of Narnia, it is something that proves his ability to tell a story. If you are expecting the Chronicals as Narnia, you will be disappointed; Lewis writes this in a similar fashion as the series, but with its sci-fi storyline and its far off ideas it is a bit different form his most popular work. As far as fiction goes, this is a solid read for anyone who likes exploring the gray areas of religion and the deep expanses of space. It is a good addition to any collection of books."},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"In C.S. Lewis's science fiction classic, Out of the Silent Planet, we follow the journey of Dr. Elwin Ransom, a Christian philologist. With piercing wit and imagery, Lewis imprints a captivating story upon our minds. During a pleasure walk, Ransom inadvertently falls into some deep entanglements, is kidnapped, and transported to another planet. Here he finds a fantastic world, of pink and purple and green plants, warm blue rivers and lakes, chill air, and narrow green mountains that nearly pierce the planet's atmosphere. Furry, intelligent creatures dwell there, and angels walk the planet regularly. Throughout his stay on this planet, Ransom sees the evil effects of greed and humanism, and finds the Creator's handiwork in other parts of the universe. This is more than just a fantasy story. It is a journey into the realms of the soul, the spirit, the heart, and the mind -- one that will leave you exhilarated an encouraged.Ryan RobledoAuthor of the Aelnathan:"},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"Lewis uses this story well as a platform to communicate profound lessons about human nature, spirituality, natural law, social customs, etc. The concept for the book is impressive, especially considering its publication date of 1938. The story focuses more on dialogue and thematic development than action or adventure, though there are certainly a few such scenes. While this is an enjoyable read, the style and pace of the book are sure to make it less accessible if the reader doesn't approach the book with proper expectations. This is not a page-turner, but a story with a philosophical and theological focus. I recommend this book for those who are ready for science fiction in a slightly different gear. If you approach the book in this way, you will be richly rewarded.

In this novel Lewis subtly injects spirituality as compared to his better known works of Christian apologetics. This journey does not have the powerful impact that many of his other novels have had.The story begins on earth; a man (Ransom) stumbles on to two men with plans to kidnap another person on to their spacecraft; Ransom ends up being kidnapped instead. The space ride ends with a landing onto a distant planet. Confrontation with aliens is soon after. Ransom ends up escaping. He encounters many different life forms, and discovers they do not contain the evil that exists within us. After being summonsed, Ransom ends his journey with this higher being.

The first 3 or 4 chapters are enough to put man to sleep right on the spot.

Halfway through the novel the reader will be compelled to question veracity surrouding the notion of man's uniqueness amongst the heavens. But the greater surprise is of Mr. Lewis taking the dangerous step of showing Occidental man's brutal use of technology after discovering it. Hitherto probably not analogised in this particular manner, the story goes beyond that aggression, instead focusing on how any man who views our human race as being superior to life on earth can be labelled, justifiably so, as fanatic and dangerous."},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"A great book!

Weston is, in fact, a physicist who has secretly built a space craft in which he and Devine plan to return to Mars (Malacandra, in the native Martian populace's language) with nefarious ideas of plunder and planetary domination. As part of their plan, they drug and kidnap Ransom to take him along as a sacrificial peace offering to the native population.On the face of it, a beautifully written Out of the Silent Planet has a simple classic sci-fi plot and can certainly be enjoyed at this level. But virtually every reader will recognize that Lewis' work probes far more deeply than that. His strongly held Christian beliefs, never far from that surface plot, are apparent in his criticism of human prejudice and greed. It is also clear that he holds extremely strong views against notions of eugenics and the then universally held belief in the natural supremacy of western white civilization as compared, for example, to aboriginal populations elsewhere in the world. Even though his allegorical tale goes so far as to include a version of angels and an archangel, the story never becomes preachy, odious or whiny.Astute long-time readers of science fiction are always on the alert for errors of scientific fact. So Lewis may be mildly criticized for making a fundamental error in how gravity would work aboard a space craft but this certainly detracts in no way from the quality of his story. To the contrary, I thought he earned top marks and high praise for crafting, for example, a startlingly accurate description of the appearance of the sky in the transition zone from atmosphere to space at extremely high altitudes (at a time, of course, when space travel was at best a twinkle in scientists' eyes). I also noted a single quite astonishing comment that seemed to predict Einstein's work on cosmology, travel at light speed and relativity ... \\"But if the movement were faster still ... in the end, the moving thing would be in all places at once.\\" His brief exposition on linguistics and the possibility of a universal syntactical structure of languages was also fascinating without being distracting or pedantic.For fans of soft sci-fi, Out of the Silent Planet will provide a smorgasbord of delights - alien characters and personalities, philosophy, ethics, survival in a potentially hostile environment and descriptions of alien flora and fauna that are near poetic in their beauty and majesty. I'm looking forward to reading the next novels in his masterwork trilogy, \\"Voyage to Venus\\" and \\"That Hideous Strength\\".Highly recommended.Paul Weiss"},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"Firstly I must state that I am not a Christian; in fact I'm quite firmly an atheist. And given the life story, reputation, and themes of C.S. Lewis, it is quite impossible to approach his works as anything but Christian allegory. But, despite being largely inspired by and relative to an ideology which I do not support, this remains one of my favorite science fiction novels. The images are so evocative, the concepts so inventive, and the themes so fascinating that it rises above both simplistic faith-based moralizing and the tropes of its genre.I first read this book I believe in junior high school, putting me at the age of eleven or twelve. At the time, I didn't have any understanding of the larger issues in the novel. I read it as simple fantasy, and was still mesmerized. The world that Lewis so carefully constructs is so unearthly that one is consistently amazed at how he is even able to conceptualize something so removed from human experience. He is quite just in his ridiculing of early space travel fiction (which is plentiful; so much so that the book is now published with a formal recognition of the author's respect for his predecessors), for his imagination is so much the greater in his visions which easily escape the fear of the unknown and the necessity that each facet of the otherworld be analogous to a facet of this.Now, however, when I read the novel, I realize that even in creating something so amazingly different, it still incorporates a very strong and complicated allegory. This is so tastefully presented that it was not even visible to my younger self, but it now is equally as fascinating to me as his descriptions of alien languages and landscapes and philosophy. The story functions on a great many levels: a man exploring a new world, a man overcoming fear and coming to faith, a critique of colonialism, capitalism, and greed, a retelling of several biblical stories, and many other things besides. And none of these stories is presented in black and white, but rather in a multidimensional, intelligent way. Aspects of socialism, Christianity, democracy, and individualism are shown to coexist and complement each other; the unfaithful are critiqued but not demonized; the faithful rewarded but not unfaltering or flawless. And all is presented with such elegance that one is not assaulted by it, but delights in unraveling it and considering its implications.A huge amount of philosophical and political issues are touched on in the novel, and they are largely presented skillfully through metaphor rather than exposition, and still it remains focused in its ultimately optimistic but not simplistic message. This, coupled with the extraordinary imagination and texture of the narrative make it immensely enjoyable for the casual or the analytical reader, and it is worth revisiting several times, given its impressive depth."},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"OUT OF THE SILENT PLANET, published in 1938 on recommendation of J. R. R. Tolkien, is the first novel of what has become known as the Space Trilogy, or Cosmic Trilogy, or the Ransom trilogy. OSP will be the most satisfactory for those looking for straight science fiction.There are three primary influences that caused Lewis to write OSP. The first is David Lindsay's VOYAGE TO ARCTURAS (a novel that famed literary critic Harold Bloom wrote a sequel too, called THE FLIGHT TO LUCIFER. This is Bloom's only published fiction, and he has longed disowned the novel). It was ARCTURAS that showed you could deal with high philosophical and theological matters in the guise of science fiction.The second influence was the well-known conversation between Tolkien and Lewis in 1937 in which they lamented the state of current fiction and set out to write their own to help correct the matter. Tolkien was to write a time-travel story (his novel was abandoned and unfinished, published in HISTORY OF MIDDLE-EARTH VOL 5, THE LOST ROAD AND OTHER WRITINGS). And Lewis wrote a space-travel story (this novel), the only real science fiction novel he ever wrote..The third major influence is H. G. Wells. Lewis says in an intro note before the novel that even though there are certain slighting remarks about Wells in the novel, he hopes people don't think him too stupid to enjoy Wells. And it is obvious from reading OSP Lewis is very much a fan of Well's science fiction (though not necessarily the social critic Wells tried to reinvent himself as), as a lot of the novel reads like something a Wells fan would write.While the series has overall been labeled as science fiction, this is rather a misnomer. OUT OF THE SILENT PLANET is really the only true science fiction in the trilogy. PERELANDRA is a religious track, and THAT HIDEOUS STRENGTH is the hardest to classify of the three. You either love or hate it. Lewis called THS a fairy tale for adults, which is fine. But as this is a review of the first, lets keep to the first.The best thing about this book is its interplanetary romance and its Christianity. You get to go see another world. Granted, the world Lewis describes is not the real Mars, but I have never held that against this book (some pervious reviewers have cited this as a fault). This is, after all, fiction, and does not need to be held in the confines of the real world. That is why I never understood people complaining of the science in this one. Still, there are some rather jarring slips, such as Ransom confusing the moon and the earth for one another, something that would never happen.Elwin Ransom is kidnapped and taken onboard a spaceship to Mars. The novel opens with him on a walking holiday (something Lewis himself was rather famous for taking - Tolkien went on one of his hiking trips and soon found himself rather out of sorts with his body, and struck to shorter jaunts around Oxford with his dear friend). Ransom chances upon two men in an old house, one of which he knows. This is Dick Devine and Proffessor Weston. Originally they were going to kidnap a mentally challenged boy, but on second thought decide to take Ransom instead, to appease an alien species named the sorns in order to get more of the metal the sorn's call \\"sun's blood\\" (really gold). So they capture Ransom and travel to Mars in a spaceship of Weston's design.Though he fears what he may find there, when Ransom lands he runs away from his kidnappers and ultimately finds himself in company with another alien species. Malacandra (so called there) is a wonderful place, with three distinct species called hnau (the Hrossa, the pfifletriggi, and the sorns). He spends most of his time with the Hrossa. Over the course of the novel, he is introduced to all three alien species, though he spends very little time with the pfifletriggi. All three are vastly different, but all are important to the Martian society. Though he begins in fear of the sorns, ultimately they prove to be powerful allies.There are also other inhabitants in Mars as well. Ransom also learns of Eldils (angels), and also about the Oyarsa, which is the ruler of Mars, and is an archangel. The climax of the novel features Ransom meeting the Oyarsa, and it is the Oyarsa who meters out justice to Weston and Devine.Lewis touches upon several major themes in this introductory novel. Being the Christian that he is, Lewis models the story's cosmology off of Christian theology. In fact, of the initial 60 reviews that OSP garnered when it was first published, only a handful picked up on the heavy Christian undercurrents running throughout the novel. Lewis realised you can smuggle any amount of idealogy under the guise of romance.The other major theme he touches upon is Weston's desire to colonize other planets. To Weston, humanity's survival is the most important thing, and will exterminate other lifeforms to take over their planet. Weston's position of racial geonicide is drawn from Olaf Stapledon's FIRST AND LAST MEN, a novel in which men do kill other species to take over their planet, and Stapledon's obvious endorsement of this racial murder. Lewis was horrified when he read this novel, and so crafted OSP as a response to this novel.The first book, OUT OF THE SILENT PLANET, is the most SF of the three, and also the least satisfactory. The story is excellent, with Lewis using medieval influences to develop a Christian world view in a science fiction setting. Tolkien said in one of his letters (its in LETTERS OF J. R. R. TOLKIEN, one of the early ones), it is simply not long enough. It is a nice story of Ransom being kidnaped and then dealing with the Martian landscape. Yes, some of the science is dated but Lewis is more concerned with other themes to worry about \\"scientific credibility.\\" Although some have said the characterization is flat, for those thirsty for SF this is the best of the three.In several ways, OSP is a particular favorite yet also the most disappointing of the trilogy. Like Tolkien said, it's simply too short. Imaginatively, there are great scenes in the novel, any science fiction lover will find the novel richly rewarding. But as it's the only real science fiction Lewis wrote, I would like to see him have written a much longer novel.Still, a great start for C. S. Lewis, the novelist."},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"Very few science-fiction books treat religious themes and even fewer take religion seriously. This short book by C.S. Lewis does both of things wonderfully. It examines the idea of what other inhabited worlds could be like, given the assumptions of a Christian worldview. What would an alien Fallen world look like? What would an un-Fallen world look like? What would the sacrifice of Christ mean to these worlds?These are some of the themes that Lewis addresses in this semi-allegorical tale. Written in 1939, it still holds up fairly well. Lewis concentrates on the psychological and religious aspects of the plot and offers reasonable, but not detailed, scientific explanations for the space travel, etc. Because of this, the scientific explanations still sound plausible.Lewis does one thing in this book better than the vast majority of science fiction writers (and for this alone, the book should be read): convey the utter incomprehension of viewing an alien world. The pages that describe the hero's struggle to make intellectual sense of the visual sensation that is the alien world are nearly perfect.Much of the book revolves around religious themes of the nature of rational beings and the implications of the fall. Earth is \\"the Silent Planet\\" the title refers to and Lewis' explanation of why the Earth is silent is brilliant. The book provokes a lot of thinking and you will find yourself re-examining your assumptions on the implications of Christ's sacrifice.Lewis also has an original interpretation of the emptiness of space that is also worth the price of admission.All in all, this book is a delightful read and should be read by anyone interested in a good science fiction book. If you are not religious in outlook, read this book to have your viewpoints challenged and to read how Lewis describes an alien world. You will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"I almost gave the book 4 stars because it can very difficult to follow - but that's a problem with me, not the book. It's amazing how Lewis creates this entirely new world, one in which there is no point of reference with the planet Earth. This is both a source of wonder and difficulty, since the world he creates is so foreign. The first time I read it, I was not particularly sensitive to the dual meanings Lewis applied to different things. In subsequent readings, however, I've noticed far more. If you read with a specific intent of discerning deeper meanings in things, you run the risk of imposing your own ideas on the text, which is bad practice. I recommend reading the book slowly and carefully, taking time to ponder the different characters, events, and, most importantly, words spoken. Lewis is making a very serious point in the book, and addressing some crucial human issues. Read carefully. Personally, I find the book difficult, but only because it somewhat begs to be handled respectfully and diligently - not haphazardly or cavalierly. The book is simply a fantastic piece of literature, full of intrigue, wonder, and profound philosophy. Get it, read it, reflect on it."},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"This book was excellent. I finished it in one week and am now beginning Perelandra.

Lewis's powerful imagination and evocative writing ensure that the adventure is paramount, the Christian concerns unobtrusive. In fact, Christianity is never even mentioned. Instead, by following Ransom's experiences among the industrious, beaverlike hrossa and the tall, ascetic sorn, we come to understand why the inhabitants of Malacandra call Earth the Silent Planet. With its beautifully described landscapes and whispering, invisible entities, Malacandra is a realistic utopia well worth this literary visit."},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"Don't let the allegory or \\"this is a story with a message\\" reviewers scare you away.

It was published in the middle of World War II in England.Ransom escapes being a planned human sacrifice on Mars and falls in with creatures that have cultures like the Cherokees (a Native American tribe for those of you on the net not from the Americas). He meets the planet's spiritual guardian, Oyarsa, and among other things learns that earth is referred to as the \\"silent planet,\\" hence the title of the book.Lewis has several things to say about mankind's wish to colonize the galaxy and beyond - - which are all negative, and amazingly contemporary for readers today.Many fault the technology Lewis envisioned as dated, but I find hints of Lewis' sci-fi ideas in other stories - - such as the most recent First Contact. Dr. Ransom finds the purpose of his life on earth crystallized on Mars. You may find your purpose here crystallized as well - - but at the least, you will read a highly entertaining, and unusual story."},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"I really didn't know what to expect from this book - I had actually never even heard of it. I am familiar with Lewis' writings though and this one did not disappoint at all. I actually read the book in two sittings. I am a reader, but I don't usually consume books like that - unless they are very good. This one is that good. I can't wait to read the next two!"},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"Clive Staples Lewis can be called the father of Christian Science Fiction and Fantasy. Out of the Silent Planet, written in 1938, is the first of a trilogy of stories. The others are Perelandra and That Hideous Strength.Lewis is the author of many novels including, The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe, and the other Narnia stories as well as non-fiction works including Mere Christianity, The Abolition of Man and A Grief Observed. Lewis was a close friend of J. R. R. Tolkien, the author of The Lord of the Rings. Both were professors at Oxford University and members of an informal literary group called the Inklings.The science part of the story is largely dated. Lewis had little idea what space travel would be like. His Mars is a much more Earth-like planet than we now know it to be. The writing style is also somewhat dated, being told in narrative more than is done in modern literature, but it still works both as an adventure and allegory. In all of his fiction works Lewis uses allegory to teach Christianity. In the story Elwin Ransom, the protagonist, is kidnapped and transported to Mars by two acquaintances. Ransom flees his captors upon arrival on the alien world. After a couple days of travel he sees a Hross. At first he thinks it is just a beast but he realizes it is speaking and slowly they begin communication. Later he meets Oyarsa the ruler of the planet and, most likely, an archangel. Oyarsa's messengers, regular angels, are called eldila. Ransom also learns that Earth is the silent planet, cut off because it is ruled by the Bent One, a fallen angel.As he says near the end of this story, \\"What we need...is not so much a body of belief as a body of people familiarized with certain ideas.\\" His overriding purpose in Out of the Silent Planet is to familiarize a secular world with some of the principles of the Christian faith.As the story wraps up, the narrator laments the evil he sees spreading across the world and of his hope that the direction of history might be altered. Of course Lewis knew that evil rules this world and only at the end would it be defeated.Recommendation: To understand Christian Science Fiction, start with Out of the Silent Planet. It remains a five-star story.Kyle Pratt"},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"Five out of five is way to high -- the characters are plastic, the narrator has a set of annoying mental habits, and the odd descriptions of a truly odd world are often downright confusing. Three out of five is too low -- the book is original and often paints its colorful world with grace and style. (3.5?)This book IS like Narnia -- a book of Christian ideas told in with almost adolescent simplicity. The reason you'll like it is because, occasionally, it hits home. And when it does, you realize that the world C.S. Lewis is painting, however simple, is one you would like to see more of.If you need a quick idealistic reprieve from your modern world, give it a try."},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"C.S. Lewis's &quot;Out of the Silent Planet&quot; (the first of the three books in the Space Trilogy) -- in which the narrator is kidnapped by two bad guys and taken on their spaceship -- takes you to Mars, and a surprising visit it is! Mars, the Roman god of war -- Mars, the Red Planet -- scary Martians ready to invade Earth? Far from it all: on the planet Malacandra, as it is known to its inhabitants, in an environment of varied climates and richly fascinating landscapes, you meet remarkable, intelligent, peace-loving creatures, learn their language, discover their spiritual superiority, and find out that the only invaders to be feared are the bad guys from Earth. The visitor makes first contact with the spiritual being Oyarsa, who will re-appear to guide him in the later novels. The technological details about the spaceship and space travel are dated; however, this only adds to the book's charm, without being distracting. While there are theological ponderings, particularly about the moral decay on Earth, the Christian themes as well as the overall tone of this book bear much resemblance to the author's Narnia novels, most especially &quot;The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe&quot; because it is filled with a sense of wonder at the discovery of a new, different, and more innocent world"},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"Many readers come to know Lewis through his magical Narnian chronicles. That's no surprise as the books are still bestsellers today. His Space Trilogy, though, is far less known, and that's a minor tragedy.Out of the Silent Planet was one of the earliest science-fiction books. Written in 1938, it was far ahead of its time. In fact, I read somewhere that the book includes the fourth ever mention of the world 'spaceship', a sign of its frontier material.Out of the Silent Planet reads like a blend between Robinson Crusoe and Avatar. Ransom, the main character, finds himself stranded on a strange planet far away from Earth. Without food or direction he travels along the whimsical terrain, mingling with native inhabitants and ultimately meeting the Great Power in charge.Like Robinson Crusoe, the book is slow at parts. It's as much a mental narrative as a physical one. But this adds to the realism as Ransom has the same internal struggles you would expect of someone in an unfamiliar world.As in Avatar, the book shows what happens when humans crash into a more peaceful, morally developed, spiritually grounded culture. Ransom arrives alongside two other men, one representing science and the other human abasement. Between the three of them they reflect the primary tendencies we have toward strange cultures--one tries to civilize it, another to exploit it, and Ransom tries to leave it in peace.I'm sure I'll have more to say about the Trilogy as I finish the next two volumes, but Out of the Silent Planet was a great start. Fans of science-fiction, especially those with a more philosophical bend, will especially enjoy it."},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"My least favorite of the trilogy, but an important set up to the other two. The main character, Ransom, is kidnapped and taken to the planet Malacandra, where he discovers that the rest of the universe is in harmony with God - that is, everywhere except earth (the silent planet).There's some great nuggets in this book - on the nature of sin and temptation, as well as reflections on epistemology and cosmology. I wasn't crazy about the dialogue, and I had often had trouble picturing what Lewis was describing in Malacandra (though that may owe to my own lack of imagination).It's worth the read, if for no other reason than to prepare you to read the second book in the series, Perelandra."},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"This novel was written in response to Olaf Stapledon's LAST AND FIRST MEN. Lewis was fascinated with the way Olaf Stapledon was able to fuse philosophy and science fiction, but shocked by an episode where Earthmen wipe out the ecology of another world so that humans can adapt it to their use. He wrote this novel as a counterweight. Oddly enough, this may have been the ultimate source of the movie \\"Avatar\\": human defending a Utopian alien planet against his own species.In the story the hero, Ransom, visits the planet \\"Malacandra\\" (eventually revealed to be Mars). The details of Mars are of course way out of date from the modern point of view; one can think of it as a Tolkien-like imaginary world. Like Tolkien (who was a friend of Lewis's and may have been the model for Ransom), Lewis gives brilliant descriptions of the world: its people, their languages, the landscape, even the subtle effects of lower gravity. Three very different species (hrossa, sorns, and Pifiltriggi) live in near-perfect harmony. The hrossa specialize in art, the sorns in abstract thought, the pifiltriggi in technology. Ransom learns to admire each species and to think of his own species more critically.Finally he meets the world's ruler, Oyarsa, who explains the history of the planet. Part of it is that Earth is the misfit planet of the universe and is out of contact with the rest; hence the title \\"Silent Planet\\".Readers who are Christian can interpret the Oyarsa's revelation as a religious allegory. Those who are not can enjoy it as an interesting mythology. The sequels put more emphasis on the religious background and so might not appeal to everybody, but this novel is quite accessible."},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"These negative reviewers seemed hell-bent on getting a very character based, suspense or action story like dean koontz would write. the deeper purpose of this book is to shine a spotlight on what is typical human nature and what is God's nature (and how we each are alone in discovering these). this book explores how we approach foreign people and either cooperate, kill, exploit, or attempt to enslave them. it also explores God's ways of protecting the humble and turning against the proud and how a whole nation may suffer for the sins of it's leaders. it's sad that modern readers can be unwilling to enjoy the more subtle themes of some excellent classics. for those who didn't get what i got, read \\"heart of darkness\\" and then revisit this book. both reveal humanity outside the pretenses of ordinary society."},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"This is the first book in C.S. Lewis's amazing Space Trilogy. These books are far less known than Lewis's Narnia series or even his Mere Christianity or The Screwtape Letters, yet it is just as good as any of those writings and goes to show the versatility of Lewis as an author.This first book begins with our hero, Dr. Ransom, out for a walking tour in the countryside, dressed in that shabby way for which professors are renowned. His foes are his former schoolmates Devine and Weston. These men believe they need a human sacrifice, and by capturing Ransom they have their victim, for they have made a spaceship and are taking Ransom to Malacandra the red planet.Once on Mars, Ransom escapes his captors, meets many species, and finds out that on Mars there has been no \`Fall' and Ransom from Earth or the Silent Planet is a bit of an oddity. People from earth are considered to be \`bent' in nature, from the original sin of the fall.Follow Ransom as he treks across a strange world, and must find the courage to risk it all to save not only an alien race, but also, possibly his own soul.This is a first book in an amazing series. Try it - you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"This is one of many fabulous books by CS Lewis. It is fiction, but in an allegorical sense. It is the story of Dr. Random, a man who is kidnapped and taken to the planet of Malacandra. There he escapes his captors, and finds himself among a strange alien race. He lives among them for some time and learns their language and customs, including religious beliefs. He tries to teach them about Earth, but they cannot grasp the concepts of murder, greed, corruption, or any vice.In time, Ransom is summoned to appear before Oyarsa, who he thinks is a form of deity but turns out to be a kind of steward for the planet. In his charge is the care of Malacandra, and he insures that the three dominant races exist in peace. Ransom appears before him, and he explains that his intention is to know about \\"The Silent Planet,\\" which Earth is called by all other planets.He explains to Ransom how they all live in harmony--each doing his share of the work. Their lives are simple, and thus very happy, but they also understand certain spiritual matters to a degree that baffles Ransom (they do not fear death, and don't grieve when someone dies). He explains that each planet has an Oyarsa, but that Earth's became \\"bent\\" (the Malacandrian word for bad or corrupt).When his former captors are brought before Oyarsa, one of them, Weston, makes a powerful speech threatening them with annihilation and boasting about the strength of his world. Ransom translates, but finds it impossible to express Weston's corrupt notions in the Malacandrian language. This is one of the most beautiful messages of the book. The Malacandrians can't even understand corruption, let alone be influenced by it. Their society is so simple, yet so pure, that they don't even have a way to express it.As Ransom explains in Malacandrian, Weston's noble intentions suddenly seem very corrupt when explained in such simple terms. Weston's claim that \\"our right to supercede you is the right of the higher over the lower\\" doesn't seem so convincing when Ransom translates it: \\"he says it would not be the act of a bent [being] if our people killed all your people.\\" Of course, Oyarsa does not see his point of view.This example demonstrates the satirical brilliance which dominates the book. By creating a race that doesn't comprehend violence and vice, Lewis very successfully shows how ridiculous it is. The book is filled with thoughts like this, brilliantly woven into the story to create sheer masterpiece. If there is a work of fiction that shows CS Lewis' genius, this is it."},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"This first installment of The Space Trilogy takes us on a moral journey through space hinting that maybe it is we who are the &quot;not so friendly alien race&quot; for a change. Some portions of this book would make HG Wells proud but I found the religious undertones a bit tiring. I have not as of yet read the other two books in the trilogy, but Out of the Silent Planet held my curiousity long enough for me to consider doing so. If I could give half stars i would throw this pamphlet-esq novel 3 1/2."},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"C.S. Lewis has to be one of my favorite authors. His style of writing is amazing--he successfully describes and mantains a whole other world with its own unique landscapes and races. But, despite being wonderfully written in nearly all aspects, he creates a type of science fiction unique in itself. Never have I read a sci-fi novel like this, and verily, this one surpasses all. The book is complex in both terms of vocabulary (as Lewis sucessfully manages to create life-like characters in the profession of Philology and a Physics professor) and a difficult set of allegory. Certainly, the book is not for the weak reader looking for a book to half concentrate on. Nonetheless, the book is really inspiring, outlining an age old conflict of good and evil in a new way, and all the while establishing a solid foundation of religion...I won't go too far...I recommend that everyone reads this book!"},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"Well written and thought provoking.

Is such a thing possible in a world that is corrupted by original sin? That is the real question."},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"Once again, C.S. Lewis manages to awe the reader with his clever characterization and rich plotline. The allegorical element-- though not as direct as The Chronicles of Narnia-- is food for the intellect. Lewis provides insightful commentary on Earth's collective culture, casting in a light of both criticism and amusement that culture's contradictions and vanity. Lewis highlights especially well Earth's diverse personalities, some of which are embodied by seroni, hrossa, and pfifltriggi. As he accomplishes all of this and also presents a deep message about the nature of the world's struggles-- all while creating an intriguing, full plotline-- C.S. Lewis again has created a masterpiece and proved his mettle as a literary genius. I recommend this to anyone who is looking for a rich, intellectually-engaging story, especially those who are willing to believe in angels."},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book! \\"Out of the Silent Planet\\" is a classic science fiction story and clever morality tale. The wonderful descriptions throughout the book brought the planet Malacandra to life in my imagination. It is a fascinating journey into the unknown. I had the pleasure of reading this story with hardly any forehand knowledge of what it was about. The cover art of the edition I purchased is very good. It is an illustration by Kinuko Craft that shows a man and furry creature together in a boat surrounded by a wondrous world. It hints at the story without giving too much information away. This book is the first of the so called \\"space trilogy.\\" It is followed by \\"Perelandra\\" and \\"That Hideous Strength\\" (please see my reviews of these two books for more details). While the books of the trilogy do tie together they were also written to be read independently of each other. A note to sensitive readers: The villains occasionally utter curse words of condemnation and there are brief moments of violence.Note: Sometimes I enjoy musical accompaniment while reading. I found that Jean Michel Jarre's album \\"Equinoxe\\" was one of my favorite choices to listen to while reading this story."},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"Incredible imagination coupled with truth.

Must read all."},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"Just finished it, great book, hard time putting it down.Another great series by C. S. Lewis. On to number 2..."},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"I first read Out of the Silent Planet in high school some twenty years ago. It was the first C.S. Lewis book I had ever read. And even at that time, reading was a brand new hobby for me. Over the years, as often happens, other great enjoyable books find their way before my eyes, and intriguing reading experiences like this one are pushed into obscurity. Five years ago, I picked up my First Lewis-Love for the second time. And just a few weeks ago for the third time. Repeat readings over the years show the remarkableness of Out of the Silent Planet.For my generation, different images spring to mind at the mention of science fiction. Star Trek, Star Wars, 2001, X-Files - and the list can go on for far longer than I have time to type or you have time to read. Among the titles is rarely found epic allegory. I realize Lewis did not intend this book (or its sequels) as allegory, but the symbols and allegorical images, if you will, are clearly there. (It may be said that science fiction is one of the most difficult genres in which to refrain from allegory.)Dr. Ransom may be more closely likened to John Bunyan's Christian than Jesus Christ or first man Adam. He (and the reader) unknowingly and unwittingly stumbles into the clutches of Weston and Devine, little realizing he's much more than a guest. What fascinates me most about his voyage through space (I realize OOSP is not unique here) is how accurate and believable the description even though it was written long before manned space exploration. Imagine someone in George Washington's day describing the monotony of an intercontinental flight.Ransom's adventures consisting of panic, despair, discovery of companionship, and learning and mastery (more or less) of the alien planet's indigenous languages are what drive much of the story. Though Ransom is not perfect (he's still a native of the \\"Bent, silent planet\\") - and therefore not unfallen Adam - and not possessing of any great strength or power - and therefore not Christ, his limitations are what make the story so intriguing. He is constantly surrounded by beings (Hrossa, Sorns, Pfifltriggi, Eldila, and Oyarsa) who do possess some sort of amazing, other-worldly strengths -and for the most part, they are simply amplifications strengths possessed by humans and some animals here on earth.Yet for all this, Ransom still never meets the all-knowing, all-powerful Maleldil. How similar to readers of Narnia learning all about Aslan, the Son of the Great Emperor Over the Sea. Yet at the end of all seven books, we still never meet the Great Emperor Over the Sea.Out of the Silent Planet gripped my attention and fascination in the same way as 2001 A Space Odyssey though OOSP perhaps left me with more hope. Unlike Dave Bowman, Ransom encounters more than just the cold, darkness of space. Malacandra (Mars) is teeming with intelligent and even hospitable life. Makes me want to go back...."},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"I enjoyed this book. It takes a little bit of brainpower to process some of it, so not something you read in one night (unlike the Narnia books, which you can get through in a couple of hours).I get the picture that Lewis, as sort of a Classics guy, got frustrated with some of the Moderns - I wonder if the character of Weston is a composite of some of the science faculty at Oxford. The sort (and this isn't strictly \\"science\\", but an attitude about science) that would consider things like art, philosophy, & literature a whole bunch of made-up nonsense, whereas science is based on Truth, and thus scientists should be in charge.Lewis (in this as well as other works) likes to take a step back and get the reader to consider some of the unstated assumptions that shape the Modern world view, things that are so deep within the modern psyche that we are not generally conscious of them. In this respect, sometimes Lewis sounds a bit dated, because some of the Modern thought that was prevalent in his era (and so apparently irritating to him) has faded in favor of post-modernism (whatever that means). For example, Weston's speech (which Ransom translates rather hilariously) reflects a more colonial period and worldview, which at one time was quite prevalent, and Lewis would be at least a little bit controversial in mocking it. But now in our post-colonial, politically correct, diversity-conscious age, we are all conditioned to see the inherent wrongness of Weston's interplanetary cultural imperialism. Lewis himself is writing somewhere in the transitional period between Modernism and \\"post-modernism\\", so to some extent he is already beating a dead horse, but not completely - some parts of Modern thought have been quite thoroughly subsumed into the contemporary period.I thought the science fiction & fantasy elements of this story were surprisingly well done, given that Lewis himself was not a scientist, but he seemed to be at least somewhat up on things like gravity and orbital mechanics, even if there's not a lot of technical detail. What I liked was this notion that Ransom is reflexively fearful of the aliens - in his mind, before he ever meets them, he imagines they must be both super-intelligent and super-malevolent. And indeed, this is something deeply ingrained in us, whether it is from stories & movies we see from a very young age (E.T. & Close Encounters of the Third Kind not withstanding!), or something else that recoils at the notion of an intelligence which is not human. So imagine the surprise when it turns out that the aliens are all decidedly non-evil, and quite happy and gentle. The book is not quite so allegorical as the Narnia books, but the implication is clearly that the Malacandran races are not \\"fallen\\". Borrowing from some of Lewis's other works as well, this would mean that they act according to their nature; it is Man who is the abberation among rational creatures in doing evil, by acting against his own nature, and against his own interest (all the while thinking he his seeking his own interest). And thus it is perhaps a uniquely human trait to fear and expect evil from the non-human.Lewis did put some effort into creating some language & grammar for his Malacandrans. I wonder if he was trying to show Tolkien that he could play at that game too, but it does come across as just that - Lewis is just playing at making up a language & grammar for the sake of his story, whereas for Tolkien it's almost like creating the language & the grammar leads naturally to the stories. Although Lewis's writing is erudite, it lacks the \\"epic\\" and \\"classical\\" feel of Tolkien. Lewis is more conversational and chummy. There is a fairly long section at the end - Ransom, Weston, and Devine's audience with Osarya - in which we get a lot of speech that is English translated into Malacandran, or Malacandran back into English. Now some of this does come across as quite funny, mostly at Weston's expense. But since the conceit is that Ransom himself is not at all fluent, it comes across like a kindergarten reading book with simple, awkward sentences. And it gets pretty old, since they are talking about some fairly deep stuff. Although maybe Lewis is making a meta-point there, that for many of us our language skills (and even our very thought processes) are quite primitive when it comes to deeper questions of morality and philosophy. No argument could convince Weston of his wrongness because that part of his brain that is meant to understand such things is stunted.There was a little bit of weirdness at the end, where we switch from the main third-person narrative, to the author's (i.e. Lewis's) point of view, where he describes how he heard the story from Ransom, with excerpts from correspondence, etc. I think the point is to try to bring the story more into the \\"real world\\" (while also maintaining the sense that it sounds, and perhaps really is, delusional). However, I thought it detracted a bit - left me feeling less immersed."},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"Be warned: This is a good book.There is something personal about Lewis' writing. He draws you into his worlds with amiable and insightful prose, inviting you on a journey to distant, unfamiliar places. When I put the book down, it was like ending a conversation with a good friend-- a friend who just happened to be one of the most brilliant thinkers of the twentieth century.If you are on the fence about purchasing this book, then get off the fence. First, the fence is a horribly uncomfortable place to be. Secondly, \\"Out of the Silent Planet\\" is a great book.

It was shipped quickly and it is in very good condition. I plan to order Book Two and Three."},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"Lewis wrote this space adventure story before man actually entered space, and he did so as a way to present the beginnings of his Christian morality story, which stretches over the next two novels in the trilogy as well. C.S. Lewis obviously writes clearly and effectively, and he provides an intriguing theory of primary \\"angels\\" for each planet -- entities assigned by God to act as the spiritual leaders of the planets. In the case of Earth, we come to discover that his angel for our planet has become \\"bent\\" or morally damaged, and has attempted to cut us off from the other planets, their angels, and obviously God him/herself.Lewis's imaginative depiction of the planet Mars is enjoyable, and provides a wonderful insight into how popular science at one time had the image of \\"canals\\" on Mars, just as HG Wells and other writers also adopted the same scientific theory before our telescopes, satellites, and rovers proved otherwise. Lewis also seems to enjoy using the setting on another planet as a fun plot opportunity to poke fun at some parts of human culture here on Earth by showing how odd and inexplicable they seem to other races.The notion of three intelligent races sharing a planet and co-mingling was a nice plot element, and the reader receives the clear indication that Lewis would have liked to have developed that element of the story a little more perhaps, but it would have been a diversion away from his primary purpose of explaining the broader battleground of war among the planetary angels -- i.e., Earth against the rest of God's creations."},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"'Out of the silent of planet' has this feeling of your typical old fiction space story. Throughout the story there is suspense moments and in other there is comtemplation of beauty and ethereal picturing. The reason i bought this book was for an apparent analogy with christianity; that was my main expectancy. Now this fiction story seems to bring a subtle analogy, that of sin and even subtler of God and the Devil. So in that sense i was not satisfied, i thought it was going to be a bit more clear. I felt what C.S. Lewis wanted to portray was morality and its depravation.Now despite its analogy subtleness i still enjoyed it as a fiction story, its journey appeal and the etheral descriptions.

LewisReviewed by: K. KimPeriod: P. 5A philologist named Dr. Ransom is unwillingly drawn into the adventurous and somewhat terrifying experiment of two manipulative professors; Devine, an old and disliked schoolmate of Ransom's; and Weston, a thick and grim physicist. After being drugged and put to sleep, Ransom awakens to find himself on board a strange, homemade space ship of some kind with Weston and Devine as his only company. Presently, they land on a planet named Malacandra where the colors, landscapes, and inhabitants are strange and beautiful at the same time. Ransom soon deciphers that he was brought to Malacandra to be handed over to some unknown creatures that go by the name of sorns. He desperately takes off in abrupt shock and, after a few days of wandering aimlessly about, befriends a clan of furry, otter-like creatures who call themselves the hrossa. While living with them on this new and unusual planet, he learns many habits, customs, and vocabulary words of their language. After Ransom travels to a godlike spirit named Oyarsa, the captured Weston and Devine reveal their plans to destroy all life on Malacandra in order to bring their superior race of humans here to live. It is here that Ransom realizes the residents of Malacandra are not the beasts; humans are more so, being the most bent race of all. Weston and Devine are forced out of the planet, and a slightly homesick Ransom decides to return to earth with them, leaving Malacandra in peace.I faintly disliked this book mainly because of its lengthy descriptions. The dozens of sentences spent describing perhaps one vegetable cluttered up the story so that it didn't flow quite as smoothly as I wished. An excerpt from the book: \\"The purple mass looked for a moment like a plump of organ-pipes, then like a stack of rolls of cloth set up on end, then like a forest of gigantic umbrellas blown inside out.\\" Another thing I disliked about this book was that it was a bit of a hindrance to have the Malacandrian words inserted throughout the story frequently. \\"Ransom understood him to mean the hrossa lived down in the handramit and the seroni up on the harandra. What the deuce were seroni, he wondered. The open reaches of the harandra did not look as if anything lived up there.\\" Unless one memorized the terms, then one would have to flip back through the book and find the meaning of the word once again. However, these were simply mere annoyances that distracted me in reading the story. The story itself was excellent.What I liked about this book was that it had a sense of majestic grandness in its subjects. The story had real splendor and brilliance with its words. \\"...it is not a few deaths roving the world around him that make a hnau miserable. It is a bent hnau that would blacken the world. And I say also this. I do not think the forest would be so bright, nor the water so warm, nor love so sweet if there were no danger in the lakes.\\" After you read it, it shall not be easily forgotten. The story and its characters stay with you forever. Also, the point made on the view on humans interested me. There comes a point where Ransom views other humans with the Malacandrian eye, and I find his descriptions intriguing: \\"The bodies were a little narrower at the top than at the bottom so as to be very slightly pear-shaped, and the heads were neither round like those of the hrossa nor long like those of sorns, but almost square. They stumped along on narrow, heavy-looking feet with they seemed to press into the ground with unnecessary violence. And now their faces were becoming visible as masses of lumped an puckered flesh of variegated color fringed in some bristly, dark substance...Suddenly, with an indescribable change of feeling, he realized that he was looking at men.\\" The story was unique, and that quality was one I enjoyed thoroughly.My favorite part of the book was the scene where Ransom first encountered a hross. After running out of the woods, Ransom stopped to rest by a river. The hross (later identified as Hyoi) emerged from the river like a great seal as Ransom stared, somewhat intimidated and in awe, for this was his first close encounter with a creature of Malacandra. After spotting Ransom, Hyoi simply stared back, and each individual stood immobilized and curious. Neither dared let the other advance, yet both wished to do so themselves. Finally, Hyoi walked back a few paces and retrieved water, blending in some sort of alcoholic substance. After gulping some of the liquid down, he offered it to Ransom, and soon each individual introduced himself or herself as a hross and a man. Shortly thereafter, Ransom learned a few Malacandrian words from Hyoi, and was taken to the hross' village. I enjoyed this part because it displayed an expression of peace between two beings. It was the starting point of Ransom's friendship with the hrossa (plural form of hross).This story was overall very touching and memorable. It contained distinctive intelligence and wisdom in its view of humankind as a race. The natural depth of the story was very compelling and convincing. Despite any flaws it may have had, I enjoyed it very much and would recommend it to any eager reader out there."},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"This is a period piece - a thoughtful work from the era not far from Doc Smith. It's also a wonderful classic.Lewis lays out a stark set of characters: the amoral scientist, the money-grubbing capitalist, and our protagonist, a bit of a blank slate. As in H.G.Wells' Time Machine, our correspondent arrives in a land where different faculties of modern thought have been split into distinct species. The first is the literati, the poets. They are agrarians for a living, but exist for expression in the spoken (not written) word. They are also warm - by measured body temperature - and fuzzy. The next are almost an intelligentsia, but it turns out that their thoughts are all second-hand. They know about their world and about other wolds, but it seems that their instruments and insights were all given to them by agencies unspecified. This species, not surprisingly, is tall and pale - a walking ivory tower. Going beyond Wells' two-way split, we have a third sapient species: a combination of sculptor, engineer, and grovelling toad.After that, the further divisions become more interesting. There are the eldil. They are very nearly invisible, and their voices can't always be heard. Wherever they appear, though, they carry the word and will of some superior being. There is also Oyarsa, the law of the world, but a unique and living being. Oyarsa is just the law of one world, though, and knows that there are other worlds and other laws. Finally, there is the undefined Maleldil, to whom all Oyarsa are subordinate.Mankind, of course, is measured and found wanting. With Lewis' Christian orientation, though, it could be that human Original Sin is just a local aberration, caused by a defective Law that created our defective world. Lewis also makes it tempting to infer a hierarchy of seraphim and angels, below a planetary hierarchy of Oyarsan archangels. By distant inference, higher, galactic levels of hierarchy could also exist.This is almost a morality play. Our hero is Ransom, held ransom against our species' good behavior. The miser is Devine [sic], perhaps by opposites. The amoral plunderer is Weston (western?). It reads well next to Piers Plowman, for example.C. S. Lewis followed all the canons of good space opera. He also turned C. P. Snow's two worlds into two literal worlds. By today's standards, this is a slim volume. It is dense, though, and carries its weight. I enjoyed coming back to it."},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"Harder to rate on a 2nd reading - I recall really liking it before, so I've probably added a star to make up for the fact it wasn't novel for me. I mean, it has a lot more thought going than your standard SF novel and a fabulously grand historical cosmic setting (although the characters are fairly one dimensional - almost personifications of certain viewpoints), and the fact I was expecting this undermined my pleasure.People (and aliens) are defined the way Lewis defines them: morally. Other attributes are secondary.There's the Lovecraftian sense of non-anthrocentrism, although each planet's species has a benign angelic overseer - except humanity. From this come all our ills, particularly illustrated in this story, greed and humanism. The former is dismissed cursorily, the latter more carefully undermined, challenging the notion that technological advances bestow rightful authority (a far less popular idea since 1945).As a wonderful idea to explore an argument and a world view, this is admirable. Moreover Lewis respectfully and ably adapted H.G. Wells' style for his own purposes. Look elsewhere, however, for action sequences, snappy dialogue, and psychology: Lewis' characters consistently, purely and rationally act out their basic convictions."},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"I love Lewis and I love SciFi so this was a perfect combination for me.

Though it may be a Christian discourse, I found the themes of the \\"bentness\\" of human nature and the propensity for xenophobia to be more philosophical.Some people may like to point out the implausibility of three intelligent co-existing species on one planet, or the flimsy science, but this book is so much more than mere cold hard science & logic, as was displayed through the character of Weston. The calculating physicist defends humanity's viral nature as only the result of the \\"survival of the fittest\\" and humans will take over Malacandra with our superior technology and war. Conversely, the Malacandrians take the \\"live and let die\\" attitude. They think the human fear of death, desire for limitless wealth, and abhorrence to monogamy to be pointless (hmm... must be Buddhists) which brings Ransom to the conclusion that perhaps we are the morally inferior species. That is why humans have come \\"out of the silent planet\\" as, unlike Malacandra, its moral ruler has fallen and has no voice in the heavens (space for the ahtiests, heh)The diction was pretty smooth, not all the authoritarian British style I was expecting. The pace was suspenseful - easily done on a strange planet with unknown friends and terrors around ever corner.

I came across this book and decided to give it a shot. I knew that Lewis and Tolkien were contemporaries so I expected a work of quality. I was not disappointed although there is definitely a difference in writing style between this book and LOTR. First of all, Lewis has far fewer characters in his tale - I would say that there are only 6 that are given significant detail. This is helpful because you have to focus much more on the scenery and alien beings.As for the story, you get to take a journey of self discovery with Dr. Elwin Ransom - the central figure of Lewis' Space Trilogy. It is difficult to say too much about the story without giving away the plot - so I won't. Let me simply say that the story is thought provoking from a moral and religious point of view, and there is plenty of adventure. If this sounds like the kind of book you like, give Out of the Silent Planet a try."},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"...and Lewis does an excellent job combining opinions on ethics, religion and the fundamentals of humanity into an entertaining tale. I am a sci-fi author myself, and what I've found is that many sci-fi writers either sacrifice a good story in order to make a strong point, or they fail to make a point at all in an effort to create a fun story. Lewis is adept at providing both.Interestingly, although I am an avid sci-fi reader (obviously), I had never read much of Lewis' work until now. I recently picked up Out of the Silent Planet because someone compared the main character from my own book to that of Ransom. There's no way I could hear such a comparison and not immediately rush off to buy the book and see for myself... after all, being compared to a classic author such as Lewis is a real honor!Reading the book from this angle caused me to focus deeply on the literary structure and character development within the book. Ransom is a character that you can relate to immediately -- despite the generational gaps between author and reader -- and you can understand his fear, wonder, and intrigue as he finds himself on a new world. The descriptions are inspiring yet not overly lost in details, allowing the reader to use his or her own imagination to create a landscape and society as diverse and colorful as Ransom himself must have found it.In short, he successfully delivers a sense of wonder and amazement to the reader. The action, dialog, etc. are well used as well, but it is definitely the sense of adventure and awe that made me slap my forehead and say &quot;why haven't I read this until now?&quot;While many younger readers may balk at the language (which has a decidedly &quot;old&quot; feel to it), I would recommend this as required reading.

So I guess that I can see that Lewis is definitely influenced by H.G. Wells, but I also think of Kurt Vonnegut in a way. His writing style is obviously very different, but the way that both of them expose your daily life as very possibly misinformed. That life isn't neccesarily limited to perfunctory duties.

The characters were specifically ordained. Ransom, the main person, could be remarkably hysterical at times in his conducts, thoughts, and speech. So were the other beings that were mindfully created by Mr. Lewis. It was a clear-cut high moral adventure.

Upon arrival he escapes and journeys out into the planet encountering,to his great surprise, several forms of intelligent life. He struggles to adapt andunderstand their ways of life, picking up the alien languages as he goes. He is taken to thebenevolent and peaceful leader of the planet and interviewed. He discusses at length theachievements of modern man and the differences between their two worlds. The book is aunique look at humanity's strengths and flaws, and an interesting anthropological read. Itcalls several religious beliefs into question, but it is important that the reader remainaware that it is pure science fiction. The book is relatively short, but it makes up for anylack of volume with its thought provoking intricacy and insight. Though it starts out alittle slow, it picks up to a very exciting read. The perspective about the human conditionoffered by C.S. Lewis is invaluable. The book is not as much about the alien life forms,but about their harmonious unselfish society and the way that man has become a ratherobtuse figure in the galaxy. In the book it is we as a species who defy the natural order,not the so called \\"aliens.\\" In essence, he finds that we humans are unable to create autopia of our own because of our ever present need for self-gratification.

I loved the Screwtape Letters, I loved Mere Christianity and I have read most of the Chronicles of Narnia. But this is a bit of a head scratcher. It's not that the story is bad. Quite the opposite in fact: it is a very interesting story and shares many similarities with the classic sci-fi of Jules Verne and H.G. Wells. The problem for me, and one of the problems I've always had with Lewis, is that he is too smart for his own good. There is hardly any wonder or amazement in the character of Dr. Ransom at being on a new and strange planet. Both the character and the author treat Malacandra and its inhabitants as something to be analyzed and dissected rather than as something to awed about, like what you find in the Narnia tales. Not only that, but the postscript at the end kind of deflates everything as the character writes to the author saying that there were other senses, emotions and tales that the author left out that could have made the story better. Well, if Lewis, who is already a great writer, could have written all of these into the story, why didn't he do that? Certainly it would have made the tale more interesting and boosted the somewhat minuscule page count (158 in my edition). In the end, it's an interesting that tale that is weighed down too much by Lewis' brilliance."},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"Out Of The Silent Planet is a science fiction space adventure written in 1938, the first book of three by Lewis collectively known as the Space Trilogy. It's about a philologist (or linquist) named Ransom traveling on foot when he coincidentally meets up with an old school mate, Devine, and a brilliant scientist, Weston, who shanghai him aboard their spaceship on a long journey to another planet in the Solar system. You'll guess which planet, if you know a bit of astronomy, before it's revealed. On that planet Weston and Devine are about to hand Ransom over to some natives (aliens called Sorn) when he escapes and makes his way from the hostile plateau climate they landed in to a more habitable zone in a deep canyon where he lives among another race of aliens, the Hrossa. He discovers there is a third intelligent race on the planet and that all three groups are ruled by a spiritual leader known as Oarsa. As he seeks out this Oarsa, his captors are closing in on him.Throughout the narrative there is much preaching about the immorality of the prospect of the human race arrogantly conquering the universe, as though the author were answering such a proposition by some other author or scientist like, perhaps, H.G. Wells.Since it was written in the 1930s I'll compare \\"Out of The Silent Planet\\" to other sci-fi novels of that time. First, some might call it science fantasy or some other branch of literature; I won't argue with that, but can compare it only to what I've read, and for that period it's mainly sci-fi by such authors as Edward E. Smith, Jack Williamson, and A. Merritt. To give you an idea where I'm coming from, my favorite author is Robert Heinlein, who wrote \\"Starship Troopers\\" and \\"Space Cadet.\\"Smith's \\"The Skylark Of Space\\" was probably the first novel that could be called a precursor to such modern space adventures as \\"Star Trek\\" and \\"Star Wars,\\" in which the heros and villain travel in interstellar spacecraft. It was written in 1911 but first published in the late 1920s. \\"Out Of The Silent Planet\\" is scientifically less believable, especially in the description of the spaceship, and less logical, but somewhat more stylish and readable than Smith's work, which, while groundbreaking, imaginative, and scientifically thought out, suffered from technically perfect but colorless style. On the other hand, Out Of The Silent Planet is not as stylish, atmoshperic, or entertaining to read as A. Merritt's novels such as \\"The Moon Pool,\\" though they are even less accurate or logical. Incidentally, Jack Williamson's \\"Legion Of Space\\" novels, written a bit later than Smith's first work, are even more directly akin to \\"Star Wars\\" and \\"Star Trek\\" (Jack Williamson is, by the way, still living and still writing science fiction as of this posting). Though the first Buck Rogers novel, \\"Armageddon 2419 A.D.\\" appeared in the same issue of Amazing Stories as \\"The Skylark of Space,\\" it wasn't about space travel at all, just a Rip Van Winkle story.Personally, of these I've mentioned, I prefer Smith's novels, which evoke a strong feeling of wonder and awe just from the serious treatment of the subject matter, in spite of what some may call dry style. For a little scary, atmoshperic escapism, A. Merritt's best. \\"Out Of The Silent Planet\\" is halfway between in two different ways, and I didn't find the mix very effective. Some passages seemed drawn out and pointless, the framing devices dated, and the device of the hero being kidnapped to end up in space a bit gimmicky by todays standards, even trite when it was written, but on the whole it was worth reading just to satisfy my curiousity; I don't feel the need to read the sequels now."},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"I don't know what else to say about this book, other than that it doesn't seem to have much of a concept.

On the other hand, the aliens are somewhat intriguing, even if they are not as compelling as some other fictional aliens.I don't want to come off too harsh; even if the book is a bit stiff, it isn't bad. Also, it is only the first part of a trilogy, so this is not the complete story. For Lewis fans, this might be a worthwhile book, as long as they don't expect Narnia; for science fiction fans, however, this will probably come a bit short."},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"Elegant telling of how religion, specifically Christianity, could be present in other places in the universe.

I had read The Chronicles of Narnia and the Screw-tape Letters though so I gave it a go. This book is really cool. The way he weaved his religious with the science of the time to create a new mythology was great.

I recommend it."},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"The book \\"Out of the Silent Planet\\" by C.S. Lewis, the first volume in a trilogy, gives us a view of the human condition from an outsider's perspective. The Christian concepts of sin, the adversary, the heavenly host and the Creator are all a part of this clever story by Lewis, and are here given a science fiction/fantasy backdrop. We are shown our sinfulness and its concomitant attributes: fear, greed, anger and insanity, from an innocent's perspective. Though we as a culture and a people have a spectrum of good to evil, even the best of us falls short in perfect trust and love, a failing indeed....(link to the rest of review)http://www.helium.com/items/1613012"},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"could there be life on other planets?

Great read and very different. A little bit heady, spiritually, but I think I understood it."},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"I was reminded of how excellent C. S. Lewis' command was of the English language. The consistently appealing story line, coupled with his protagonist's philosophical observations as his adventure progressed, made for a most engrossing tale.

Read it first many years ago, and loving going through it again. A must have for any lover of good scifi and spiritual traveller"},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"This is the first book of Lewis' Space Trilogy and it has all the wonderful qualities of a SciFi/fantasy book mixed with a certain amount of theological and philosophical intellectualism that one would expect from such a distinguished author.First published in 1943, Out of the Silent Planet transcends sense of time and place with a focus on the greater themes of life, death and the pursuit of joy rather than specific scientific details. That the book is full of allegory is not in doubt, but even the most cliched moments are written artfully and with a panache seldom seen in the genre.Those who enjoyed Mary Doria Russell's The Sparrow will probably also enjoy this book, which is considerably less violent, but explores the same themes. Lewis ends the book with a compelling epilogue that leaves you hungry for the remaining two books in the trilogy. Prepare to not only suspend your beliefs, but to come away with a tremendous amount of personal insight as well."},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"This is the first book in C.S. Lewis's amazing Space Trilogy. These books are far less known than Lewis's Narnia series or even his Mere Christianity or The Screwtape Letters, yet it is just as good as any of those writings and goes to show the versatility of Lewis as an author.This first book begins with our hero, Dr. Ransom, out for a walking tour in the countryside, dressed in that shabby way for which professors are renowned. His foes are his former schoolmates Devine and Weston. These men believe they need a human sacrifice, and by capturing Ransom they have their victim, for they have made a spaceship and are taking Ransom to Malacandra the red planet.Once on Mars, Ransom escapes his captors, meets many species, and finds out that on Mars there has been no \`Fall' and Ransom from Earth or the Silent Planet is a bit of an oddity. People from earth are considered to be \`bent' in nature, from the original sin of the fall.Follow Ransom as he treks across a strange world, and must find the courage to risk it all to save not only an alien race, but also, possibly his own soul.This is a first book in an amazing series. Try it - you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"This is the first book in Lewis' acclaimed Space Trilogy wich also consists of Perelandra and That Hideous Strength. I first read this book when I was in junior high and didn't really remember much about it. So, I decided to read it again. Plus, I never read the rest of the books in the trilogy and am planning to do so soon.In this book, we are introduced to Dr. Ransom, a professor of ancient languages, who is kidnapped by a couple of evil scientists and taken to a planet called Malacandra. Thinking that he is being given over to some alien life-form as a sacrifice, Ransom quickly escapes from his human captor's grasps and takes off on a trek across this strange planet that he has found himself on. However, all is not what it seems and Ransom soon begins to see a bigger picture of what is taking place on Malacandra. In the end, Ransom learns a great deal about this beautiful planet, but even more about himself and the rest of humanity on earth.The descriptions Lewis uses in writing about the planet are quite extensive and beautiful at the same time. Although some might think that the author seems to be a little long-winded at times, he definitely makes you feel like you are experiencing the same visions and adventures that Dr. Ransom himself has been placed into.Not only is this a provocative space-fantasy, it is also a disguised social commentary on the affects of sin and the evil that springs forth from it. Although an excellent science-fiction novel with an allegorical sub-story, this is not a \\"lite\\" read. Those that are only familiar with Lewis' Narnia books may not enjoy this one as much. However, those that have read some of his other works such as Mere Christianity or The Screwtape Letters should enjoy it immensely and will even notice a lot of the same themes throughout."},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"Upon reading this book I gained an alternitive view of alien races and a new way to think about such matters. Lewis takes us on an incredible journey to Mars and one cannot help but enjoy the way he does it. I recomend the second book in this series to anyone who has read the first. enjoy."},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"&quot;Out of the Silent Planet&quot; is a stunnigly captive and imaginative tale. C.S. Lewis, the mastermind behind many great books, really struck it in with this one. He tells of a curiously smart character named Ransom, and is survival on the foreign planet Malacandra. 3 co-existing species, living in what is described as a beautiful, lucious, paradise, really add to the splendor of the book. Having first been published in 1943, this book still draws you in with its philosophical and suspenseful storyline. I reccommend this great piece of literature to any and to all."},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"This is one of C. S. Lewis's science fiction trilogy composed of Out of the Silent Plant, Perelandra and That Hideous Strength. While they do not have to be read in that order, I suggest it for your greater appreciation. H. G. Wells, Arthur Clarke and their like have swayed us to the belief that extraterrestrials who are more intelligent than we are also evil and might wish us ill. Lewis calls our attention to the fact that we are the only race we know to be fallen and the reverse might be the truth: that the aliens may be the moral ones and we the criminals. Some of this insight inspired the movie 2001 even though it was based on a very pessimistic story by Clarke. Lewis puts his considerable imagination and his outstanding writing ability at the service of a theological, philosophical and humanistic view of the cosmos rare if not unique in the field of sci-fi, and for those reasons these books deserve more than one visit. My most recent -- possibly my fourth - reading was as enjoyable as my first. These books are easily understood by teens and can still give mature thinkers much food for thought. This first volume introduces the philologist Dr. Ransom, and describes his kidnapping to another world, his encounter with other species, his learning the language (Lewis has as much fun with language as J.R.R. Tolkien), and his coming to see reality through new eyes. While science has made some of his descriptions a tad dated, his insight survives the passage of years well. The final additions come as a bit anticlimactic; one has the sense he is answering the objections of some readers and throwing in a few details he ought to have included in the first place. But if you have bought into his vision they can entertain somewhat like the out-takes shown during the final credits of a film or TV show."},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"This epic (but still short) space story, written by C.S. Lewis, has completely changed my perception of the author's writing ability. I have always been familiar with the \\"Chronicles of Narnia\\" series and I've read all of them at least twice. This is how I got to know Lewis: through the \\"Narnia\\" series. I picked this book up, not expecting much, but was totally blown away by the end.To start, this book isn't specifically a sci-fi book; in fact, Lewis has managed to write an epic fantasy story completely independent of any definite genre. It's not a complete sci-fi, but more of a \\"science fantasy,\\" asking you to go beyond the \\"facts\\" that we know about space today and look at it in a completely different light.On the Christian side of the story, \\"Out of the Silent Planet\\" and its two sequels (PerelandraandThat Hideous Strength) add a whole new perception of the Christian faith, with our own understanding of faith being a mere chip off the iceberg. Instead of just another metaphoric translation of stories and their morals from the Bible, Lewis dares to tell us that we don't know the whole thing. In many ways, he has written his own Bible story, set in a modern age, where space travel is possible, to incredible affect. In many ways, it fits into what we currently know about Christianity, but adds many unheared-of possibilities. It's quite intriquing.It's really too bad that C.S. Lewis was famous mainly for his \\"Chronicles of Narnia\\" books, which were entertaining, but at many times, frustratingly simple. This and the other two books are his true masterpieces and has gone beyond what any modern author has done as of this time. Far more thought-provoking, mature, and entertaining than the \\"Narnia\\" books, this is truly Lewis's best. I dare anyone to try and do it better."},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"One's first impression of this book might be that it is science fiction, but it really falls into the category of fantasy. While it does involve space travel and aliens, Lewis was exploring religious themes through allegory, rather than suggesting that a society such as the one he creates actually could exist. \\"Out of the Silent Planet\\" was originally published in 1938, by John Lane, London. This is the first of the three books which have become known as the Space Trilogy, the second is \\"Perelandra\\" (1943) and the third is titled \\"That Hideous Strength\\" (1945).In this story, Professor Elwin Ransom, a professor of ancient languages finds himself in the English Midlands and under unusual circumstances he is reacquainted with a former schoolmate, Devine (a person he remembers disliking), and he meets Professor Weston, a noted physicist. They drug and kidnap him and he is taken aboard a spaceship to a planet called Malacandra, which he later learns is Mars. Afraid that he will be given to aliens called Seroni as a sacrifice, he manages to escape and meets Hyoi, who is a different is a different alien race called the Hrossa. From Hyoi he learns the Hrossan language and about the other races on the planet, i.e. the Seroni, Pfifltriggi, Eldila, and Oyarsa, who is the one in charge of the planet, and who is very similar to an Eldil. Being chased by Devine and Weston, he makes it to Oyarsa from whom he learns the nature and history of the solar system.Lewis uses this book to address some of the same situations as have occurred in other noted science fiction works. In H. G. Wells' \\"The War of the World\\" (1898) there is a dying Mars and the Martians are attempting to take the Earth for their new home. This situation also occurred in Olaf Stapledon's \\"The Last and First Men\\" (1930), but Stapledon goes on to later reverse the roles as Man escapes a dying Earth to take Venus as his new home and in the process exterminates the native inhabitants. Professor Weston's speech at the end of this novel clearly is meant to represent Stapledon's arguments as seen by Lewis. Lewis' Martian races, unlike those in Wells or Stapledon, are virtuous and have all accepted their fate even though it means their death. In this story it is man, in the form of Weston and Devine who are evil, not the aliens.There are many religious parallels that can be drawn in this story. The one referred to as Maleldil is clearly God. The Eldila are like angels, and the Oyarsa, of which there are apparently one per planet are probably archangels. Earth's Oyarsa, who has become \\"bent\\" (or evil) is Satan or Lucifer. In this story, the Hrossa, Seroni, and Pfifltriggi are unfallen or virtuous, while man has been cast out of the Garden of Eden.At less than 160 pages, this is a short novel. Lewis has created an interesting story and there are some nice touches, such as the pieces of language that he puts throughout the book, which add a distinct quality to it. This isn't a book which changes the face of speculative fiction, but overall it is well done."},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"It's a great book, though it isn't as much a sci-fi book as it is a novel. I would not recomend reading all of it without adictionary, especially for younger readers. The story follows the ever-curious Ransom as he journies across an unknown planet. Overall a good book and a great read."},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"C.S. Lewis is a name that many children and their parents know by heart. In school and long after, they fell in love with his much beloved 7-volume \\"Chronicles of Narnia\\". In addition to that seminal work, Lewis was also noted for his profound takes on Christianity, whether he wrote purely theological books or weaved Christian themes into his fictional novels. One of his more celebrated efforts is his \\"Space Trilogy\\" consisting of the three books: \\"Out of the Silent Planet\\", \\"Perelandra\\", and \\"That Hideous Strength\\". Having yet to read \\"That Hideous Strength\\", I am unable to comment on the overall arc of this trilogy. Though, I can make assessments out of what I have read.The first book in this series is \\"Out of the Silent Planet\\"; a short 160 pages, but by no means a quick read. It focuses on the travels of this series' hero, the estimable Dr. Ransom as he is kidnapped by two devious scientists, Doctors Weston and Devine, and flown out of Earth (the aforementioned \`silent planet') and whisked to the alien planet of Malacandra (the native name for world we know as Mars). Initially fearful of being sacrificed by Weston and Devine to an indigenous Malacandran species known as sorns, Dr. Ransom escapes once they land upon the world and begins and journey where he meets many of the indigenous species, among them, the subservient hrossa and even the sorns he so feared. In his journeys, Ransom is struck with awe and wonder at the magical visual world he sees, from the lush, fertile valleys that are only visible from the planet surface to the more desolate, but no less intriguing, mountaintops where few of the indigenous lifeforms still reside. His travels provide a strong allegorical reference to biblical themes and Christian doctrine. Malacandra provides a glimpse of what Earth could have been if it had never suffered the fall of Original Sin. All Malacandran life is governed by a benevolent being known as the Oyarsa, who is subservient only to the being referred to as Maleldil (though easy to view as God, himself). The Oyarsa of Malacandra laments no longer hearing from the Oyarsa of Thulucandra (\\"The Silent Planet\\" aka Earth), who is referred to as the one who is \`bent' or \\"gone bad\\". Ransom is to ponder the significance of what he has observed and consider how to use that knowledge. As Malacandra is further from the Sun than the Earth, its indigenous life has been around much longer and can serve as an example its wayward sibling.Small print-type, complex sentence structure, and long paragraphs all combine to make reading \\"Out of the Silent Planet\\" (and the rest of the \\"Space Trilogy\\") a challenge to those who are not used to Lewis' writings. Even at 160 pages, multiple readings are recommended in order to absorb all of the themes presented in this book, but don't think that reading \\"Out of the Silent Planet\\" isn't a worthwhile endeavor. Much can be gleaned from its pages and more can be pondered after reading it."},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"STORY: Dr. Ransom is kidnapped by two other scientists and wisked away to the world of Malacandra. His wouldbe kidnappers think they are brining him to be a sacrafice to the beings of that planet. What happens is an adventure of discovery and facing the truth about human nature, which forever changes Ransom.MY FEEDBACK:1) SETTING - C.S. Lewis just shines in his descriptions of new, exotic places and the beings that live there. His vivid details allow the reader to create a wonderful mental image of a world totally different from our own. Very, very nicely done.2) CHARACTERS - The cast of characters consists of Dr. Ransom, Dr. Weston, Dr. Devine and the various beings found on Malacandra (sorns, hross, pfifltrigg and Oyarsa). Every character has a purpose and is allogoric of something greater, which is sometimes clearly demonstrated and at other times left to the reader to interpret. At no point was I bored or upset at stereotypes when reading about these characters. Even if you don't see the allogories they represent they are still intriguing and unpredictable.3) STORY - I read somewhere that this story is a retelling of the Christ story from the Bible. I didn't see that. Yes, there were some similarities such as the Bent One could be Satan and his fall from heaven. Otherwise, just reading the first book I didn't feel like I was bring preached out or given a Bible Study of any type. It was an intriguing sci-fi story of discovery.Also, like many secular sci-fi books written prior to 1950, this book makes clear commentary on human society. In other words if someone puts this book down because of the social commentary then that reader is unfamiliar with such literary trends as mentioned. I did prefer this author's handling of social commentary more than other authors of the time that I've read.Lastly, the book is written very well. Many times I felt like I was reading poetry instead of a sci-fi novel. C.S. Lewis' professional handling of the written prose is very, very enjoyable and appreciated.OVERALL - I can't think of anything wrong with this story. It had action, a mystery, suspense, discovery, aliens, space-flight, characters true to their nature, social commentary, allogory AND all this squeezed into less than 160 pages. In many ways this books ends with most of the story resolved so there doesn't seem to be an immediate need to read the rest of the trilogy. BUT...if you like this first book like I did then you'll find very little reason not to rush out and continue reading right away. A very enjoyable sci-fi read."},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"The C.S Lewis Space Trilogy (of which Out of the Silent Planet is first) was recommended by a friend, and I found myslef immediately inthralled by the book itself, as well as Lewis's style of writing. The book is told in such a way that tries to convince the reader that this actually happened, or at least could, and it was able to convince me. As the character Ransom walked across England I felt I was there beside him. When he visited Mars, even with the bizzare scenery it seemed so real in my mind. Lewis also has a gift for making strong points in his novel (about Christianity in particular) without making the reader feel guilty, because he uses such human characters that are filled with normal and relatable flaws. Even with the protagonist's name he sends a message, becuase as you read this book, you will see how his name comes to play. Despite the strong Christian undertones, I feel that a wide variety of readers will enjoy this book. The story is catchy, the imagery is incredible, and the characters are fully round and fully enjoyable. I recommmend it to all! But I warn, even though this book is good on its own, after reading the first you will innevitably want to read the rest of the trilogy!"},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"Lewis said that he wrote this book to \\"exorcise\\" science fiction. He devoured H. G. Wells when he was younger, and Lewis obviously shows a Wells style in the first few chapters. Dry though the beginning is, don't stop! Keep reading, because once Lewis finds his own voice, this novel takes off.Lewis presents Christian themes in ways that most theologians can't dream of. How does a pure and innocent being understand evil? It can't, but it can understand the nature of being \\"bent.\\" And, of course, the whole concept of the \\"Silent Planet\\" is pure brilliance.Once you reach the middle of the novel, you won't be able to stop because Lewis creates one of his best good vs. evil battles. If you're looking for a simple Narnia tale, you won't find it here. Instead you'll find an insightful and entertaining adventure that looks into the true nature of humanity. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"I grew up reading about Narnia, and as I grew older I wanted more. How pleased I was when I discovered the Sapce Trilogy! CS Lewis does not disappoint the reader, as he continues to use his excellent writing style to tell the story of the battle between Good and Evil from a science fiction perspective. Out of the Silent Planet tells the story of how evil falls upon a planet which has existed in harmony for many years. Ironically, it is the earthlings who bring the evil and pain to the planet, and another earthling who must guide himself and fight the evil to try to undo the Great Harm. The book takes off a bit slow in the first chapter, but captures the reader into the space fantasy after the first few chapters. This book is the first book of the trilogy which becomes very intense and thought provoking in the last book: That Hideous Strength. You will find many interesting parallels between this story and the story of our own history in fighting evil and realizing our faith and mission."},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"While I do not think that this series is anywhere near as good as the Narnian Chronicles (with the exception of Perelandra, which is perhaps my second favorite Lewis book behind only Till We Have Faces), it is still incredibly good.I noticed that a previous reviewer said that \\"His major defect is that he can never quite succeed in suppressing his didactic Christianity.\\" Why on earth would you think that he had even been trying to suppress his Christianity? I think what you mean is that he does not repress his Christianity as you wish he would have. A piece of advice: if you read something by C. S. Lewis, expect it to be Christian. It is absurd to excpect him to write non-Christian novel; that would be like expecting a blue pen to suddenly let loose a flood of red ink. Lewis meant for his books to be Christian. Parts of this book are obviously alligorical (i.e. \\"the Bent One\\", etc.), and I do not think that Lewis had any intention of hiding this. For my part, I am very happy that he did this, as it not only provides good, fun reading, but also provides valuable truths to be gleaned from it.I was going to give this book 4 stars, but then I couldn't think of anything bad about it (other than perhaps a bit of misinformation about outer-space, but we can hardly fault Lewis for that, since he wrote this long before any man-made thing had ever been to space), so I changed my rating to 5 stars.I highly reccomend this book, if for no other reason that to get to the second in the series, Perelandra, which is amazing."},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"This, the first of the Space Trilogy books by C.S. Lewis is a compelling tale that weaves the greatest of all conflicts - that between good and evil - into an entertaining and thought provoking web. To sum it up in a few words, it is a meld of Science Fiction and Philosphy with a decidedly Christian bent. Like many good yarns, it takes an unbelievable situation (The main character is abducted while on a cross country hike, and taken to another planet) and then provides us with believable reactions and motivations.As in almost all Science Fiction, this book has a light, escapist side. It is set in surreal surroundings and peopled by fantastic characters, with philosophies that are somewhat - but not exactly- human. At the same time it challenges readers to examine themselves and to look at things in a different light.In a compelling way, startling for its clarity and insight, many topics including athiesm, pride, greed, and the desire for immortality flesh out the story. In keeping with his deserved reputation as one of the greatest Christian apologists (read &quot;explainers&quot;) Lewis sets forth the Christian Ideal against believable and determined adversaries who embraces the attractive and desirable nature of evil - not only without realizing it, but while rationalizing their actions to be just and full of honor.I would highly recommend this book to the reader who would like delve into philosophy, but is hesitant because it is dull,dry, too complicated or too difficult to read. The book is very nutritious, and fairly easy to digest. It should be enjoyable to both the novice to philosophy, as well as for someone more advanced. While it is some work to read, it is not heavy lifting.After reading &quot;Out of the Silent Planet&quot;, you will doubtless want to read the other two books in the series &quot;Perelandra&quot; and &quot;That Hideous Strength&quot;. Like the first book, they are entertaining,riveting and thought provoking. For the non-believer, the books will provide insights which will cause you to re-examine your doubts. At the conclusion, the trilogy comes to a climax that makes the hair stand up on my neck even now.A thoroughly enjoyable read, a You won't regret the time you spent with this book in your hand."},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"Hey, C.S. Lewis actually wrote other stuff! Fancy that! For those who only know him as the author of those books with the big cat, the kids and the closet entrance into a fantasy world, he's got lots of other stuff out there. This is just one of those other works, I think the really only important SF work he ever did (it's actually the first part of a trilogy, but I think those are less SF). It's great fun, really, definitely reminds me of H.G. Wells in its calm tone when describing the utterly fantastic and impossible, except that Lewis has a slightly better gift of description to make up for his only slightly lack of imagination (but only when comparing him to Wells, mind you). Basically Dr Ransome winds up being kidnapped (really through no faunt of his own) by two others and winds up on a planet that turns out to be Mars. Ransome winds up meeting the local people and learning their ways while trying to survive and his sure scientific tone in the face of something hardly comprehendable is the bedrock on which this novel rests, no matter how afraid or excited he is, he stills displays an unwavering confidence in detail and exacting observations. Which makes the narration compelling in its subtle beauty of detail. The folks of Mars are interesting, a far cry from the warlike being of Wells' famed novel, and there's probably some overt commentary that I'm missing (Lewis was a devout follower of Christian beliefs and I think those color the other two books more than this one) but what the heck, it's fun and entertaining and that's what count. People tell me they don't like to read Lewis because he tends to be &quot;preachy&quot; and talks down, but there's nothing like that here. The trial scene towards the end with all the Martians is absolutely fascinating and complicated at the same time. The only overt Christian thing I found was the reference to Earth as the &quot;silent&quot; planet (ie. fallen), something which I think is developed more in the two books. But for me this has all the classic attributes of good old fashioned SF, a calm reasonable tone, the narrator's attention to science and detail, a general disregard for science if it gets in the way of a good story (we know Mars doesn't have people and it'd take a heck of a lot longer than twenty eight days to get there, but who cares . . . I'm not basing a scientific paper on it) and unreserved creativity. A fast read that'll probably stay with you, it's definitely worth a shot."},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"here's the deal. i loved this book. it really makes you think towards the end and addresses alot of interesting topics. very interesting, imaginitive, spiritual, challenging, all the great c.s.lewis characteristics.my one and only beef (and the reason you should NOT purchase this book) is that the publication is absolutely horrible. there are so many typos, i want to cry. i seriously can't find another publisher who still carries this book. i dearly wish i could, because i am ashamed to own it, and i hate that, because the book is marvelous. but when you are reading along and every apostrophe is replaced with a quotation mark and vice versa, and simple words like &quot;the&quot; and &quot;that&quot; are mixed up, i feel that c.s.lewis must be rolling over in his grave. if you can find another publication of this book (ie, NOT by scribner / simon &amp; schuster), DO IT. don't buy from this publisher, but DO buy the book."},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"Out of the Silent Planet is science fiction in the sense that, in order to create a fantasy for adults, Lewis had to send his hero and villains to a world far enough for a re-imagining, but near enough that they could plausibly go there from here. Lewis not being a scientist, and this book being sixty years old, the plausibility of Lewis' idea of space travel wears quite thin by now, though of course he didn't mean to be taken seriously on that count even then. A more serious problem Lewis set himself to solve was, &quot;What might an unfallen world look like?&quot; And also, &quot;What might a society in harmony with God and nature look like?&quot; or &quot;What is the nature of rationality and soulishness?&quot; I find some of Lewis' ideas unsatisfying. (Paradise and survival of the fittest are difficult concepts to reconcile; if the Malacandrians are all at peace, how did they evolve, as Lewis apparently thinks they did? And how does the ecosystem avoid being overrun with critters?) Still, this book is a great fantasy with many insights, and a lot of fun to read. No one I know combines so fertile an imagination with such philosophical depth and psychological acuity as C. S. Lewis. All these are in evidence here.The planet is a beauty. Among Malacandra's cauliflower highlands and tourquoise canyons, its philosopher bird-spectres and tribal seals, Lewis enacts an exciting story. His readers will find some familiar images and themes: island paradise, the cultural dynamics of tribes and Greek philosophers living side by side (see Till We Have Faces for more), the wind-bag philosopher posing as scientist posing as philosopher. (The passage in which Ransom translates Weston's defense of planetary imperialism and genocide into &quot;Malacandrian&quot; then, for our benefit, simple English, is a classic blend of linguistics and philosophy. See George Orwell, Politics and the English Language, for an essay from that period that, in effect, explains what Lewis is doing with that deceptively simple passage, and why it desperately needs to be done. See also Abolition of Man.)This is the tightest and shortest of Lewis' three &quot;sci-fi&quot; novels. You can read it in a few hours. Lewis was probably wise to shift to frankly supernatural means of locating his heroes to other worlds, in later fantasies. Still, don't miss this wonderful tour of Mars for the world.author, Jesus and the Religions of Man"},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","review":"This is the first book in C.S. Lewis's amazing Space Trilogy. These books are far less known than Lewis's Narnia series or even his Mere Christianity or The Screwtape Letters, yet it is just as good as any of those writings and goes to show the versatility of Lewis as an author.This first book begins with our hero, Dr. Ransom, out for a walking tour in the countryside, dressed in that shabby way for which professors are renowned. His foes are his former schoolmates Devine and Weston. These men believe they need a human sacrifice, and by capturing Ransom they have their victim, for they have made a spaceship and are taking Ransom to Malacandra the red planet.Once on Mars, Ransom escapes his captors, meets many species, and finds out that on Mars there has been no \`Fall' and Ransom from Earth or the Silent Planet is a bit of an oddity. People from earth are considered to be \`bent' in nature, from the original sin of the fall.Follow Ransom as he treks across a strange world, and must find the courage to risk it all to save not only an alien race, but also, possibly his own soul.This is a first book in an amazing series. Try it - you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Runaways Vol. 4: True Believers","review":"The first 18 issues of Brian K. Vaughan's series Runaways are some of the greatest comics I've ever read. His story about 6 Los Angeles teenagers who ran away from home after finding out that their parents were evil supervillains was original, witty, and exciting. I was waiting for another hardcover to come out, but I just couldn't wait any longer. These first six issues of the second run of the series are great. The widespread theory is that, while Runaways hasn't been as good since the end of the initial run, it is still very good. Personally, I don't know what to say about that. Yes, so far, it's not as good, but it is still amazing, and I feel that we need to see where everything is going before we can make judgments like that.Anyway, the story begins a few months after the end of Eighteen, the final issue of the first run. The Runways, who include Karolina (an alien who manipulates solar energy), Molly (a super-strong mutant), Gert (a girl with a mental connection to a velociraptor), Chase (the pilot of their ship the Leapfrog), and Nico (a sorceress), who is the new team leader, have made it their mission to fight crime in LA and to help other kids. In the wake of the destruction of the Pride, which was the evil organization that was run by their parents, supervillains have flocked to LA. While the Pride was evil, they kept the other villains out of LA, but now that they're gone, a power vacuum has been created, and the Runaways feel responsible. The team is now operating in one of their parents' old lairs under the La Brea Tar Pits, and their exploits force them to run from the law. They are still juvenile delinquents in the eyes of the police and the Avengers.However, an Avenger soon pays them a visit, but there is a twist. A woman appears in their base and claims that she is from the future and that she is none other than Gert. It turns out that she will be the leader of the Avengers in the future, but her team, along with every other superteam, will be betrayed by one of their own. The future Gert tells the Runaways to find a boy named Victor Mancha and stop him before he can grow up to become the man who destroys all heroes on Earth.Victor is a teenager going to a Los Angeles high school, who idolizes superheroes along with his friend. The two of them often dream about what it would be like to be heroes, but neither of them feel like they could do it. But when the Runaways show up to apprehend Victor, he learns that he may not be as ordinary as he once thought.Meanwhile, a group of former child superheroes called Excelsior has been given orders to find the Runaways and detain them. Excelsior, which is comprised of Phil Urich, the heroic incarnation of the Green Goblin, Julie Power, formerly of the Power Pack, Chris Powell, who was Darkhawk, and a few others, are a group dedicated to preventing teenagers from becoming superheroes. They feel that being a hero messes up one's childhood, and they try to track down the Runaways in order to help them. As the story goes on, the Runaways try to avoid Excelsior while get to the bottom of the mystery that is Victor Mancha.A huge theme of True Believers is whether or not we ever truly become our parents as we grow older, which is a thought that horrifies the Runaways. Vaughan's writing continues to impress with a great story, good humor, awesome characters, and great nods to other comics. Look for the reference to Astonishing X-Men in the \\"future flashback\\". Also, while I love the Young Avengers, I think that Gert's reaction to Victor's belief that the Runaways are the Young Avengers is hilarious.Runaways is my favorite comic, and this collection of issues is supberb, or, at least it is when it comes to the content. The format, though, leaves a little something to be desired. I don't know why Marvel would reprint this in Digest form. It actually shrinks down the book, and it is printed on non-glossy paper. While there weren't too many problems, there were a few times when I couldn't make out where one object ended and another began. Also, the cover to issue 6, which is beautiful, looks only so-so in this collection. Still, until they release a hardcover (please Marvel, release a hardcover soon), this is a good read."},{"Title":"Runaways Vol. 4: True Believers","review":"This is such a great series and when the first volume ended, I wondered how it could get any better. Well, Mr. Vaughan has proved me wrong. It's better! Much better! This first book is a great reintroduction to the characters as well as a great start to the new season (as they like to call it)! We are introduced to some new characters, old villains and heroes, and get a better sense of the established characters. And what an ending!If you like Runaways Season 1, you best be reading the second series! 'Cause it only gets better from here!And also, I totally dig Princess Powerful! Rock on Molly!"},{"Title":"Runaways Vol. 4: True Believers","review":"after slogging through way too many mediocre and downright poor story arcs while suffering the seemingly interminable wait between the end of runaways vol. 1 and the new series, this TPB has single-handedly restored my faith in the power of a good story w/ great characters that's so worthwhile it gives you a buzz of enjoyment (and also restored my faith in vaughan's writing). i was wary of this new (or \\"renewed\\") series from reading descriptions of it, w/ the storyline focusing on the son of a famous marvel villain (named victor -- hmm, who could his father be?) and a new group of d-listed former teen heroes (among them darkhawk, chamber from gen x, and julie powers from power pack), but vaughan makes it work w/ some surprises up his sleeve. w/ so many characters, things could've easily gotten glossed over and left underdeveloped, but vaughan somehow makes it gel beautifully, somehow without effort. more of the focus gets shifted to these new players and so a lot of the characterization of the runaways themselves tends to be more reminders of who they are rather than further development. chase doesn't get as much to do, but the other four girls are in the thick of things and kick ***. gert is as sardonic as ever, and nico and molly are still \\"freakin' awesome\\" (wish karolina had a bit more to do though). the namechecks are still as pervasive and comical as ever also. if you loved the first series you prob. already have this. if you haven't yet gotten into runaways, get vol. 1! you know that a comic that namechecks the teen girl squad has gotta be worth reading."},{"Title":"Runaways Vol. 4: True Believers","review":"As much as i love the writing and character dialouge, I have to give any book that falls apart after 1 reading a single star.

I have other copies that have a better binding that seems to be an after-market add-on that helps the book stay together. But as for the volumes I bought recently this is not the case and since the pages are not marked it makes it very difficult to put the book back together when more than a few pages fall out each time I open the book."},{"Title":"Runaways Vol. 4: True Believers","review":"It's been a while since I've caught up with RUNAWAYS, and I've heard it's actually on some sort of hiatus right now? I stopped reading it once Joss Whedon's brief run was done. But I just re-read my RUNAWAYS collection, and, for whatever reason, I'm opting to reminisce some about the bunch of issues which, in trade format, make up RUNAWAYS Vol. 4: TRUE BELIEVERS. This is back when Brian K. Vaughan and Adrian Alphona were still ruling this roost, and when RUNAWAYS was one of them titles I couldn't wait to come out.The premise: There comes a point in our childhood when we suspect our parents of being evil. I guess it mostly happens when we're at that rebellious stage and the 'rents just seem to be in that heavy prohibition mode. Brian K. Vaughan supposes that six teenagers (okay, Molly Hayes is only eleven), during an annual get-together, shockingly learn that their parents actually head up the Pride, the murderous secret crime syndicate which controls Los Angeles and pretty much the entire Lest Coast. The kids run away, but they run away with weapons and other resources pilfered from the Pride's hidden lairs. On their own now, the children decide to do what's right and make up for their parents' sins. It helps their cause that their group comprises a mutant, a witch, an extraterrestrial, a prodigy, a teen telepathically linked to a velociraptor, and, uh, Chase who is this dull-witted jock. Chase is probably the weak link, but he's only second to the youngest runaway Molly in being lovable. Chase and Molly are also the funniest of the bunch.By the time RUNAWAYS Vol. 4: TRUE BELIEVERS rolled around, there'd already been a slight shuffling of the roster, as the prodigy Alex Wilder turned out to be a lowdown traitorous mole. At this stage the Pride had also been eliminated, thus leaving L.A. vulnerable to this and that super-villain trying to step into the void left by the Pride or simply trying to get his crime spree on. The runaways are doing their best to take on all evil comers, and it's gratifying that the kids harbor enough mojo that they rather easily take down the likes of the Wrecking Crew.In this story arc, Vaughan introduces Victor Mancha, a superhero-obsessed teenager, and I love how Vaughan keeps stirring the melting pot. Victor is half-Mexican and half-whatever (Nico is Asian, Alex was black, etc.). The development of his powers coincides with the runaways' seeking him out and confronting him. Y'see, a future version of one of our runaways had time traveled to the present to warn our gang that the adult Victor Mancha would turn out evil and, furthermore, that Victor's own sire is the \\"greatest evil in the universe.\\" That gets our kids' attention.The Loners also debut in this story arc, although here the group is called Excelsior. Excelsior is a small non-profit venture seeking to help troubled teen superheroes as they re-adjust to normal life. Its current clientele consists of second-string teenaged and formerly teenaged ex-superheroes (including Darkhawk, Chamber, Ricochet, and - in a move which has me sort of questioning Marvel continuity - a more grown up Julie Power from Power Pack, etc.). Anyway, Excelsior gets wind of our runaways and immediately sees them as its next project. Cue all the misunderstandings and the obligatory fighty fights. It eventually all works out. Sort of.With this series Brian K. Vaughan tried to steer away from several superhero tropes, with varied success. The \\"no costumes\\" thing worked out okay. He sort of gets away with not utilizing code names for the kids, although at the start of the series, the runaways did come up with code names and applied them for a bit of time. Eleven-year-old Molly comes up with probably one of my favorite superhero code names: Princess Powerful. I like that Vaughan introduced an eclectic power set for the characters and placed limits or caveats to these abilities. Molly, for example, is a mutant possessed of incredible strength but her exertions leave her drained and so she must take a nap. Gert is psychically bonded to Old Lace, the genetically-engineered dinosaur her crooked time-traveling parents had stolen from the 87th century. Whatever impacts Gert also impacts Old Lace, and vice versa. In one instance (but not in this set of issues) Gert's allergy to bee stings forces her and Old Lace to bow out of battle against Swarm. I really like it when writers have to think their way out of corners, and there'll be a time when the inhibition to Nico's magic will start gnawing away at writers' creativity (her mystic Staff of One disallows repeat usage of a spell already cast).Vaughan has an ear for how teens talk, and he drops plenty of hilarious pop culture references, and so no wonder Joss Whedon is a fan and no wonder he took a stab at writing this series. RUNAWAYS gives us awesome moments tempered with scenes of devastating heartbreak. You never quite know in which direction Vaughan will steer his stories. At any given moment, a lurking velociraptor may leap at you from out of a tree or mechanical Leap Frogs just may leap on you, period. Yeah, it's like that. Vaughan does a nice bit of misdirection regarding Victor's true origin, and I never once caught on. And throwing even more buffalo chips into the fire, near the end of this arc, Vaughan suggests that the Pride may not be as defunct as originally assumed. Artist Adrian Alphona's sorta realistic, sorta manga-ish style works perfectly for this series, and it was never the same when he left. But we get to enjoy him for this volume. Anyway, currently on hiatus, RUNAWAYS, I'm hoping, can find a home again."},{"Title":"Runaways Vol. 4: True Believers","review":"Brian K. Vaughan, Runaways, vol. 4: True Believers (Marvel, 2005)The second life of Runaways kicks off in True Believers, the fourth collection in Vaughan's dysfunctional-superhero-teens comic. The team are now down to five, with the traitor eradicated in the battle between the Runaways and the Pride, and they've taken over their parents' old hideout below the La Brea Tar Pits museum. The destruction of the Pride has created a power vacuum in Los Angeles, and the Runaways, feeling responsible for it, go back to their crimefighting ways to prevent any supervillains from taking hold. This brings them to the attention of Excelsior, a support group for ex-costumed heroes who want to keep teens from vigilantism. Which is awesome enough, but one day, the antique time device is activated in the Pride's old lair, and a future version of Gert appears to beg the team to stop Victorious, a supervillain who's still a teen in their time. They find him and kidnap him, but discover that things are not always as they seem... Vaughan's struck off in a new direction with Runaways, and it's a fine one. Very good stuff, this. ***"},{"Title":"Runaways Vol. 4: True Believers","review":"\\"The Runaways\\" are an eclectic set of young heroes - multi-cultural and edgy - a younger, sexier version of the Fantastic Four. At this point in the story arc, all the \\"core\\" runaways are girls except for one. I love the way Vaughan writes strong girl characters. Nico, the un-stated leader of the pack has the most appeal and character development so far. She is \\"Japanese by way of Glendale\\", a Goth girl without the pretense. She's as realistic as a teenage daughter of wizards with a magical staff can be.At this point, we still don't really know whether their parents were super-villains or super-heroes. With that mystery as running subtext, the real action centers on the Runaways. The dialogue is the sometimes witty, sometimes indulgent. Vaughan sprinkles his dialogue with allusions to pop culture, art, music, TV and movies.Volume Four reaches new highs. I thought Volume 1 started the series too slowly, and even Volume 2 wasn't hot yet. Volume Three really kicked it into high gear, and in this Volume 4, the series is starting to achieve its potential. The kids are interesting, unique and cool. The challenges they face are tough but realistic. Even the artwork is stellar in this volume - Alphona has matured as an artist: the drawings of the kids are finally detailed - killer! The Runaways rip it up in this volume! Highly recommended: 5 Stars.Volume 5 awaits!"},{"Title":"Runaways Vol. 4: True Believers","review":"With the first major crisis that the Runaways went through out of the way, it seemed as if their story was coming to a close. The Pride was--the way things were looking--defeated, and the kids were ready to embark on a new path in their lives. The series could have ended there. But it didn't. \\"True Believers\\" kicks off the \`second act' (that is still an ongoing monthly series) of Runaways, continuing the story of the kids who fought back. The only question about \\"True Believers\\" I had in my mind was \\"Can it live up to the first eighteen issues of Runaways?\\"For the most part, yes. It isn't nearly as epic, because what's really happening here is the planting of seeds that will eventually become a bigger story. It's interesting to see what will surely be a tale as epic as \\"Runaways Volume One\\" unfold, but it also makes me impatient to get to the juicier stories, but that's just a character flaw in me, not the writing. The story of this miniseries itself is a solid one, centering on a new major character named Victor, who will either grow up to be good or grow up to kill the Avengers and the rest of the Runaways in the name of his father (who, hint hint, is a major Marvel villain). The Runaways are torn whether to help him or to kill him before he becomes a supervillain, and Victor is as torn between using his newfound powers to harm the Runaways before they can capture him and to trust them with his life.There are also a lot of new elements thrown in, such as a new team of superheroes \\"helping\\" the Runaways, as well as a new mystery that unfolds at the end. As with any Brian K. Vaughan series, we get heavy doses of emotion, darkness, humor, and sci-fi/fantasy action. The art is still done by Adrian Alphona, but the colors in this volume are the richest we've seen them, making each character leap off the page with vivid color. It looks like the second act of Runaways is shaping up to be just as mind-blowing as the first.DISCLAIMER: It is best to buyRunaways, Vol. 2instead of the separate digest paperbacks. It is a hardcover edition, much better quality, that includes not only this, but also #5 and a lot of extras.7/10"},{"Title":"Runaways Vol. 4: True Believers","review":"This continues to be enjoyable, even if perhaps not as good as at the start. I am not sure that the break etc. is a good thing, or not. It is certainly getting crazier, as the offspring or various other creations and aliens turn up, along with revelations about the past."},{"Title":"Runaways Vol. 4: True Believers","review":"Runaways may look juvenile, and indeed it is perfect for the young adult crowd of comic-book lovers out there. But it's also surprisingly amusing and applicable for adult readers too. Brian K Vaughen is, as always, a spectacular writer. His characters are believable and amusing, and the plots are great. I own all of the Runaways published so far, and am still impressed with the series after two volumes of appreciation. This is a great series for comic book veterans (especially those who like Vaughen) and people new to the medium. Its also perfect for a huge range of ages. My younger sister loves it, my older parents love it, and my friends in college love it. The collected paperbacks are a great deal since they're sturdy and the art is vibrant. This series if definately RECOMMENDED for anyone young inside or out."},{"Title":"Runaways Vol. 4: True Believers","review":"Like the other volumes before it, this is a fun extension of the Runaways story.

Most people don't notice in the specs that these are small \\"Archie's Digest\\" size reprints, or in other terms, approximately \\"Reader's Digest\\" size collections. Being so small, it's difficult to appreciate the art, and hence the book altogether.Instead buy this:Runaways, Vol. 2which costs $16.49 and collects all 18 issues of this arc. If you buy these small digests separately, you'll end up paying $23.97 for three small books. If you buyRunaways, Vol. 2instead, you'll be getting an excellent full size hard cover edition and save yourself $7.48.However, if you like to own three smaller sized digests over a single hard cover with a gorgeously illustrated original print dust jacket at a significantly lower price, then get this instead."},{"Title":"Cairo: The City Victorious","review":"Although an Egyptian currently attending college in the USA, I am however a Cairene, and have lived in Cairo for most of my life. I've frequently wondered about the love-hate relationship we Cairenes have with our ancient yet bustling city. The more I thought about it, the less I seemed to be able to describe how I really felt about growing up in Cairo. Then I came upon Max Rodenbeck's book, and I can't describe how happy I am to have read it.Rodenbeck's book is a truly fascinating account of Cairo. It's accounts of Cairo's history and its people are extremely vivid, yet do not burden the reader with excessive and pedantic detail. The author however examines all sides of Cairo's historical development, but most importantly, Rodenbeck devotes great efforts to examining the lives and attitudes of Cairenes through the ages. It is in this respect that Cairo: The City Victorious is truly fascinating. No book that I know of has ever come this close to capturing the indomitable spirit of Cairenes and how they and their city have endured through the ages.This book is remarkably even-handed in its treatment of Cairo, giving credit where it's due, but never shying away from criticism when it is needed. It is an educating, entertaining, and in short, excellent narrative. This book has made me understand my own home city better, and after reading it, I'm more proud than ever to be a Cairene. Thank you Mr. Rodenbeck for a wonderful book."},{"Title":"Cairo: The City Victorious","review":"What a pleasure it was to read this book! Mr. Rodenbeck manages to cram a lot of fascinating information into just 267 pages. The book ranges over an enormous period of time, from the days of the pharoahs right up until the present. Obviously, in such a short book you can't go really in depth but somehow after you're done reading you feel that you really understand Cairo and the people who live there. I learned many interesting things. Did you know that a thousand years ago Cairo was full of apartment buildings that ranged from 7 stories up to possibly 14 stories high? The city was so small considering the size of the population that they had nowhere to go but up! Another fascinating fact was that when the pharoah Cheops had his pyramid built at Giza the specifications called for 2.3 million stone blocks of an average weight of 2.5 tons to be used. In order for the pyramid to be completed during the 30 years of Cheops's reign this meant that a stone block had to be into place every 2 minutes! I could go on and on. You learn something on every page: about the physical layout of the city and how it has changed over the centuries; its relationship to the Nile; the way the wealthy and the middle class and the poor live; the importance of Islam and the struggle to find a balance between religion and the secular world; about such leaders as Farouk, Nasser and Sadat; the occupation of Cairo by Napoleon and later on by the British. One of the best things about the book is that Mr. Rodenbeck does not let himself get in the way of this wonderful story. He describes the way things have been in the past and the way they are now and he doesn't preach or predict or otherwise feel the need to insert his ego into what he has written. This is really an excellent book!"},{"Title":"Cairo: The City Victorious","review":"I had only read a few pages of the book when I found tears rolling down my face.

The author skillfully wades through all of these cultural and historical waters while focusing on the consistencies of the city's history and of the character of its people rather than on any dialectic between a troubled present and the glorious past.Rodenbeck will take the reader through 5000 years of Cairo's history and while giving him the sensation of having been in all of the city's forms from Pharonic Memphis until the present. The reader is there, in every metaphorphisis of the city, in Memphis, in Fustat, in Fatimid Al-Qahirah, in the Citerdal and the European-style quarters. This book is the closest thing that one can have to a time machine, the reader will feel as if he is there in the ancient, midevil, Mamluke and colonial times, and also in the present."},{"Title":"Cairo: The City Victorious","review":"As an American ex-pat living in Cairo for the past four years--with all the resultant emotions and biases inherent in that--Rodenbeck's history has taken my somewhat jaded view of Cairo and reinvested it with a sense of awe and appreciation. Three-fourths of the way through the book, I have a long list of sites to visit--places I hadn't heard of, let alone seen--and an increased understanding of this complex city and its contrasts. Rodenbeck fills the book with wonderful bits of trivia ( it was possible in 16th century Cairo to make a living as a professional farter!) to round out his broader explanation of the sweep of Cairene history. Other reviews take him to task for his lack of thoroughness, but that was not his goal.

Having visited this City some years back this book brought back snapshot memories of the street kids begging and selling all sorts of things each time you stopped. The crushing crowds at the Museum and the amount of traffic and the noise and smell of a truly vibrant city. The book made me realise how much I did not see and understand. The author, Max Rodenbeck, tells a remarkable and fascinating story of this cities history, how and why it has become what it is now. The author flicks back and forth from the earliest days to modern Cairo but you never get lost in the story, the narrative just drags you along happily. This is a great book, full of interesting pieces of information and a great way to see Cairo without actually leaving your reading chair!

Anecdote, analysis and character are all sharp, rendered up to the reader in a kaleidoscopic fashion that is both erudite and populist. The approach suits Cairo well, for \\"other places may have been neater, quieter, and less prone to wrenching change, but they all lacked something.

Its noise, bustle, size and sheer press of humanity make it a record breaker - it is, according to the United Nations, the most densely-populated large urban area on earth....If there is any shortcoming in this account of transformation and renewal, it is that Rodenbeck shies in predicting the next stage. A correspondent for The Economist. he implies that privatisation, new investment and the growth of globalised markets will pull Cairo out of its present problems.

He has left us with a book that balances the recurring myths of Egyptology and biblical times with the controversial subjects that hound modern Cairo. My one complaint with this book is its reluctance to give any critical commentary of Hosni Mubarak's 20 year reign over Egypt. The period has seen Cairo further its role vis-a-vis the rest Egypt with its mounting population growth, coupled by the rise and (sometimes) fall of Islamic fused politics and the strain to recreate itself as a tourist mecca. Yet Rodenbeck avoids a critical commentary. Might he feel such criticsm will only harm his work as an Economist journalist for the region? Nevertheless, the book is a great introduction to this magical city, one sure to leave its visiotrs doubly loving and hating its size, diversity, possibilites and history."},{"Title":"Cairo: The City Victorious","review":"Few people can know Cairo as well as Max Rodenbeck, and certainly none of them writes better. Rodenbeck is incapable of penning an inelegant phrase, and his deep affection for and immense knowledge of this utterly exasperating and utterly fascinating city is apparent on every page. He's a natural storyteller with a delicious sense of humour who has many wonderful stories to tell. As a one time Cairo resident I found his book totally absorbing. I wish it had been twice as long. My book of the year. Spellbinding."},{"Title":"Cairo: The City Victorious","review":"I'll be visiting Cairo next month so i wanted to read something about this city.The book is not bad when it comes to history.The author explains the political,economical and social changes with accuracy and insight.However he lets out,what i believe, important history about the city.He doesnt go into details regarding The Citadel or the islamic buildings in the city.He just mentioned them when it is relevant to the story his telling.I felt that, as i was going to be a first time visitor to the city, i wasnt getting all the neccesary info or inside scoop on the monuments ,buildings and landmarks that makes Cairo a great city.I think the author falls short in this regard.But as an introduction to the city itself is very good and gives color to the account."},{"Title":"Cairo: The City Victorious","review":"Fantastic Portrayal of Cairo, history and present. Intelligently written with tremendous insight of Egyptian psyche and language. Fascinating account of history focusing on social history, traditions, habits and customs. With Egypt's long history, the social history often takes back seat to major events, battles, temples and achievements.A huge amount of serious research and very savvy analysis of trends produced an excellent work that flows easily like reading an article on the pages of good newspapers yet has the backing of tremendous research of history.Sadly, however, there is an over reliance on work and analysis of discredited Orientalists, but the author's clear love and understanding for Cairo has saved the work from being colored by the arrogance of the racist historians he relied heavily on."},{"Title":"Cairo: The City Victorious","review":"I have been in Cairo twice for business purpose in the past.

I would have probably given it 2.5-3 stars had it not been for the overrated reviews already given the book and the fact that this book was published by a university press. I expected much more.I found that while entertaining, the book was far from thorough and that it strayed every now and again into an occasional irresponsible comment - something one shouldn't expect from a university publication. In addition there was a heavy elitist bias.Much of this book seems to be based on stray documents that have been cobbled together to form an extremely generalized and probably misleading portrait of Cairo throughout its multi-layered, several thousand year history (how does one cover the thousands of years of history of cairo in 350 pages?). The author's analysis of modern events also seemed somewhat schizophrenic and reflect his bias as a journalist for \\"The Economist\\".Finally I think that this book about Cairo was written from the perspective of an outsider that seems to value the structures and institutions of Cairo beyond the welfare of the common people of Cairo. If given the opportunity to debate, many in Cairo would at least object to his analysis of the post-revolution period and beyond."},{"Title":"Cairo: The City Victorious","review":"An outstanding concise insightful documentation of not only the history of one of the oldest and greatest cities of the world, but of Egypt in total.

I was born and lived in Cairo myself till my late twenties, then moved on to the rest of the world and has found this remarkable review after reading an incredible article about Egypt written in the Economist magazine by the same author. After reading it in a soft cover I went and purchased the hard cover version as this is a book I would hope my kids would get to read one day. If you are planning a trip to Cairo or if you are a true scholar this book is your key to the gates of the city, so enjoy."},{"Title":"Cairo: The City Victorious","review":"Rodenbeck, a journalist for The Economist, has written a superior paean, one that mixes the intensity of first-hand experience with the fruits of a thorough immersion into the written record. The result is both jaunty and learned, a pleasing whole that will interest those who wish to imagine that exotic locale as well as those who have personally experienced the city and wish better to understand its rhythms. Few cities can inspire as interesting a book as Cairo: The City Victorious and few writers can carry it off as well as Rodenbeck.Size and crowdedness tend to make Cairo less than a favorite for travelers - more a place to bear and get through than to enjoy. But if one can endure the noise, dirt, and traffic, there is much to discover. The city contains antiquities from an amazingly diverse collection of eras; only Rome can try to compete with Cairo's monuments that span the five thousand years from the great pyramids of Giza to the present. Rodenbeck breezes through ancient times and settles on the medieval era, then traces its decline during the dismal period 1500-1800. His account comes most to life in the late nineteenth century, when Cairo revived in the guise of a partially European city (in 1910, he reckons, one-eighth of the city was foreign-born) -- a heady, exciting place for the Europeanized elite.&quot;The first half of Cairo's twentieth century saw the West overwhelm the East. High heels and two-tones clattered up marble stairs; camelskin babouches rustled down. The century's second half saw the reverse: silken slippers shuffling down, bare peasant feet and army boots stomping up.&quot; After the coup of 1952 that brought Gamal Abdel Nasser to power, Cairo then suffered, as did the whole country, under Nasser's tyranny and the cost of his foreign adventures. Even Rodenbeck's infectious narrative takes a somber turn, weighed down by totalitarian rule at home and military disaster abroad. Fortunately, things improved with Nasser's death in 1970 and the lighter rule of Sadat and Mubarak that followed, though our author finds much not to like in the present-day city. Fanatical Islamic sheikhs who would ban zucchini because of its suggestive shape are one sort of problem; the inevitable proliferation of McDonald's are another. Still, he counts on the city's &quot;shambolic grandeur and operatic despair&quot; to continue, on its &quot;enduring, life-giving nonchalance&quot; to sustain it beyond jihad or hamburgers.Middle East Quarterly, September 1999"},{"Title":"Cairo: The City Victorious","review":"Max Rodenbeck wrote this book as though, he was speaking to me on a cafe, somewhere by the Nile.I am Egyptian, and thought I knew a lot about Cairo, but after reading this, its a shame to say that I learned a plethora of things from Rodenbeck.

I love how he doesn't get in the way of telling us about Cairo - I just wonder, how did he find out all those juicy tidbits about Cairo and he isn't even Egyptian nor a true Cairene?!

Written with thorough research and an awe inspiring eye for detail that could only come from an insider, this book is a testimony to the author's unsurpassed experience with the city, its history, its people, and his overriding passion for the place. As a Cairene myself, I have to say my eyebrows were raised more than once at the astonishing detail I thought few people could convey with such command, I caught myself laughing many times at the anecdotes and the Rodenbeck's personal observations. And in more than one place I was driven to tears by the passion I could read between the lines. Thanks to this book I believe I have rediscovered my own home and rebuilt my peace with it (because if you read the book you will understand that Cairo can drive many of its inhabitants quite mad). I fell in love with it all over again, and I really needed to; the recent events and the upheaval, the revolution's ongoing struggle for transformation against stagnation, the chaos and the lawlessness have driven many of us to despair. But Rodenbeck reminded me once again that I live in an ancient city that has seen so much more than I can take. He assured me, \\"Whatever challenges it may face, Cairo will surely endure.

In this book, he is open about his life especially the rough years in Russia, his first exposure to the theater, his first time at directing. He also writes about his professional relationship with another Russian, Anton Chekhov. He writes about his travels mostly in Russia such as his journeys to Petrograd, the Russian provinces that inspired many of Chekhov's plays, and of course his first journey abroad. The book is really for theater junkies like myself who would have loved to have been a theatrical actress or director but life isn't so bad. He has directed William Shakespeare's tragedies like Othello and Julius Caesar along with Chekhov favorites like The Cherry Orchard, The Three Sisters, Uncle Vanya and The Sea Gull.

He became rich in so many other ways."},{"Title":"My life in art (Meridian books) (MG 4)","review":"For those in the arts, and especially those in dramatic art, this book is a must.

Anyone acquainted with the western cowboy era is familiar with Frederic Remington's art. Those recognizing him also as an artist in prose are a much smaller group.In the early part of his life, Frederick Remington (1861-1909) was earning his keep as a journalist. He published \\"Pony Tracks in 1895. It is a collection of reports written from the American West for magazines. Readers will appreciate the skill of writing as much as the history. In addition, it is illustrated with the fine art work for which Remington is justly famous.The stories range all across the American West and down into Mexico. He wrote several after traveling with various cavalry troops, including some lead by General Miles. There is also his account of a five-hundred mile stagecoach ride in Mexico in which Remington admits, \\"I'm a Jonah in a stagecoach, and that is not a superstition, but a fact amply proven by many trials.\\" In addition to the trials and mishaps, he gives us an insightful description of the people, mules, and countryside. Another trip was with the soldiers policing Yellowstone Park prior to the creation of the National Park Service.At another place a canoe trip provides an opportunity to combine the adrenaline-spawning excitement of white water with contemplation over a pipe beside the campfire. \\"You drink in the spell of the forest and dream of the birch barks and the red warriors who did the same thing a couple of centuries since.\\"Anyone with a complete copy of \\"Pony Tracks\\" on their bookshelves must certainly treasure it. The University of Oklahoma has recognized the value and made it available. Unfortunately, it is a scanned copy flawed with smudges and other signs of heavy wear. Some of the illustrations are reordered but I didn't find any missing. In the absence of a copy from earlier publication, the book currently available new is well worth the price.

For both, this book is a must buy.--Reviewed by M. E. Volmar"},{"Title":"How to draw animals","review":"How To Draw Animals by Jack Hamm is the book that started my art career. It a simple drawing guide with step-by-step instructions for sketching more than a thousand different animals. When I initially purchased this book four years ago, I had no idea that I could draw at all. I had never even considered doing art for anything more than a hobby. Three years later I won my high school's art scholarship and am now majoring in the fine arts at the University of Lethbridge with aspirations of being a tattoo and airbrush artist. It all started with the first drawing I tried in the book - the front view of a horse (page 63). I read all of the instructions about drawing horses and began sketching right away. I was amazed with what I had produced. It actually looked like a real horse! I was so impressed, I went on to learn more of the techniques in the book. Soon, I was drawing animals left and right, receiving many compliments from friends and family.The fact that the book is able to break drawing down into a few easy steps is part of what makes it so successful. The first page contains seven follow-through steps for drawing the greyhound. The steps are very simple, and therefore not at all intimidating to the beginning artist. It starts off by explaining that drawing the animal begins with drawing a stick-figure representation of the animal. The next steps go on to explain how to make changes that will turn those stiff lines into the sleek figure of a greyhound. In doing so, the guide also gives a small anatomy lesson on the animal, thus informing the reader of the importance of being familiar with his or her subject. That is one of the most important lessons I have learned to this day in animal drawing. Next, the book goes on to explain how to simplify the animal before drawing. It is a very elemental approach to drawing, as there is no particular animal in mind. This approach helps the reader to gain an understanding of how the basic shapes and proportions of the animal work. After the reader has a feel for the basic shapes of animals, the writer encourages experimentation with different body parts and shapes of different animals. This leads to a large section on the comparison of various body parts and skeletons, and then an explanation of movements and typical body postures of each animal. Finally, the book goes on to motivate the reader to add his or her own imaginativeness to his or her knowledge, as there is more enjoyment in creating something completely different when one has a store of animal information in his or her own mind. With that in mind, the reader may be inspired to continue on with other artworks.I must advertise the fact that the book is a wonderfully informative step-by-step guide. The preface reads: the purpose of this book is stated in the title. The &quot;how&quot; of anything involves a process. It's not enough to place finished, real-life pictures of animals in front of oneself or a student wishing to learn....This statement is very true. The success of this book is greatly based on its ability to train the reader how to look at the common characteristics between all animals and apply them accordingly. The beginning artist must be trained to see all aspects of his or her subject matter and in doing so, will begin to understand what makes an artwork successful. Drawing animals can be quite difficult and intimidating, but by using this book, the artist can gain confidence through experience, and work at his or her own pace.This book is not an introduction to drawing in itself, but just the drawing of animals. The thought of learning to draw animals right off the bat might be relatively overwhelming to the beginner. Not all beginners may be ready to jump right into drawing animals, and therefore may require initial instruction before using this book. That is the only reason I would not recommend this book to someone. Other than that, I would strongly suggest this book to anyone who has an interest in art but has never acted on it.I am an ambassador of self-learning! I probably would not be involved in the art field at all if I had not purchased this book. I still use it when I need a refreshment on my knowledge or even an idea for a project. It is wonderful when a person who is interested in learning a skill is able to do it in the comfort of their own home and at the pace that he or she prefers. Any person who would like to learn how to draw animals - or even to further enhance his or her drawing skills - can and may benefit from it."},{"Title":"How to draw animals","review":"While Jack Hamm is quite well-respected, I have to recommendThe Art of Animal Drawing: Construction, Action Analysis, Caricature (Dover Books on Art Instruction, Anatomy)for anyone considering this book. While this book does have a lot of useful information (like demonstrating the position of the ankle in different animals), some of Hamm's drawings are lifeless, stiff, and sometimes downright awkward-looking. This is most likely due to the use of taxidermy models (in some cases photos of taxidermy models) as the base for his drawings. This is most evident in some of his more exotic animals where the faces look malformed.Even by looking at the images provided here, there is a bit of a difference in the feel his sketch images when compared to his finished ones. This is more pronounced in the book itself when you see the book in its entirety. The poses for the finished animals are routinely a little bit unnatural looking, just like how the lion on the front is, if you look at him long enough.Hamm's instruction itself is valuable, but the images he presents with them are not always the best. I have personally found copying the images in a drawing book to be a good study to understand an animal and get an idea of what it is and how it moves, and that is where this book falls short. Basically you end up copying a copy.I would not hesitate to recommend this to someone looking for a couple of animal drawing books, but if you're only going to buy one, Hultgren is the way to go. I speak as someone who owns both. This book has some useful information in it, but Hultgren is the one I carry around with me. In conclusion, it's a good book, but not the best."},{"Title":"How to draw animals","review":"This book, combined with \\"Drawing the Head and Figure,\\" and \\"Drawing Scenery: Landscapes and Seascapes\\" is a critical part of what I consider a complete course in commercial art, barring color theory. Many good books are available on color theory, but these three volumes condense everything you need to know to illustrate.Jack Hamm's style is dramatic and powerful. His instructions are simple and he's best for giving many, many examples. It's easy to find anything you want to copy. His proportion diagrams for cat bodies in motion or at rest are fantastic. The animal I was most familiar with drawing was cats, so the cats section gave me great trust in the bear, dog, horse and other animal sections. He covers a wide variety of animals with clear instructions.This book is a perfect example of the \\"hundreds of examples, very little text\\" style of art instruction. You won't find many step by step projects, but it's content-heavy. Treat it as a slow read. I could've handled it at age 9-12 but it's best used taken a page at a time, trying the exercises, reading and rereading.It's reread value makes it a must-own. All of Jack Hamm's art instruction books are the sort that demand replacement now and then for being worn out, because they're good long term references. No matter how good I get at drawing, there's always something new to learn. At a bargain price under $10, this is a good investment in your future as an artist, whether you're a goal driven future professional, a hobbyist, already a pro artist.It isn't an easy read, but it's a well indexed easy reference. The only comparable animal drawing book I've read is Charles R. Knight's \\"Animal Drawing: Anatomy and Action for Artists.\\" They complement each other well because Knight goes a little deeper into natural history, fur patterns and textures and details -- while Hamm gives a lot more on motion, proportion and general drawing techniques valuable if you're drawing the human animal or anything else.

Hamm's drawings are anatomically accurate, and well organized by animals with similar structure, such as the cat family. This arrangement enables the reader to memorize just one set of underlying shapes for many, many animals. He provided side-by-side drawings comparing various members of the cat family (for example) to make this clear, and also provided side by side drawings that illustrated the differences between cats(mostly in the head and fur pattern.) He provided detailed instructions for each group of animals, covering such topics as: easily memorized basic shapes to start your drawings; the details that make your animals look natural such as angles of the ears, stances, typical expressions and what they mean, detailed gaits (especially of horses), and many poses. He did show a few detailed examples of skeletal and muscular structure for a select few animals, but don't expect a lot of these.This is a fundamentals book, and the emphasis is on giving the beginner the skills that will have him/her drawing animals and enjoying it."},{"Title":"How to draw animals","review":"\\"How to Draw Animals\\" by Jack HammJack Hamm is incomparable when it comes to drawing instruction.

This book, one of his four classic how-tos of drawing, has already been a gift to artists everywhere for generations, and is a priceless resource of knowledge and information. Along with Hultgren's similar book, this is the classic workbook on the subject.Hamm stresses a solid approach to the construction and anatomy of animals, but also helps the reader grasp the conceptual aspects of how animals are put together and what similarities and differences are important to comprehend. The book is very thorough in grouping animals into basic families, such as big cats, monkeys, elephants, etc., and the organization of the book is a major plus. Hamm is sharply focused on construction, solidity, and three-dimensional views of animals and how they move. A college art course could be taught from this book.Hamm's greatest admirers have always been his peers- fellow artists will tell you that this is the right aproach to drawing animals, and this book will remain in print and in use forever."},{"Title":"How to draw animals","review":"This book is a great reference book for drawing animals and is relatively thorough in showing the different types and their common similarities across, and within, species.

My ability to draw animals improved tremendously after reading over and practicing what was shown in just the first 6 or 7 pages. The recommendations on how to draw a basic animal skeleton were extremely helpful. After reading even more of this book, my understanding of how to draw animals has simply increased even more. This book was very well put together. Each page is filled with information was useful information that either helps teach the reader how to draw better or acts as an excellent reference. The writer gives step by step instructions, but the instructions aren't overly specific, which means that they are useful for drawing other animals and other poses than those that are demonstrated. Going off of the old saying, if you hand someone a fish, they eat for a day. If you teach them to fish they will eat for the rest of their life. This book not only hands you a fish, but it also teaches you how to fish at the same time. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is a beginner artist because Jack Hamm (the author) not only demonstrates how to draw animals, but it also introduces basic drawing techniques at the same time (i.e. basic drawing skeletons). It would also probably be really useful for more advanced artists because of the great abundance of excellent reference images that are within this book. There is an entire page dedicated to showing different kind of animals eyes, and another shows different kind of animal noses, another shows different kind of animals ears, there are many pages showing animal muscle structures and skeletal structures, etc. I could go on and on. Each page is filled to the brim with helpful information, instructions, and reference images. There is no wasted space in this book. This book is simply packed with a lot of great references, and what makes it even better is that the author will make comparisons between the different animals characteristics to clearly indicate their similarities and differences so that the reader can apply the shown techniques to animals and poses that aren't in the book also. I would recommend this book to anyone who is looking to draw animals, and I'd also recommend any of Jack Hamm's other books because from what I read of this book and one of his other books \\"Drawing The Head & Figure\\", all of his books seem to be equally as good as this one."},{"Title":"How to draw animals","review":"i had purchased this book yrs ago for myself and found it to be a wonderful referance and help on detail art work i had lent it out and it was never returned so i missed having it when i saw it i bought it to again be the wonderful referance guide when i draw,,,,"},{"Title":"How to draw animals","review":"I originally purchased this book when I was 8 or 9 years old at a library book sale.

Dr. Plummer, himself a bishop in the Independent Catholic Christian Church, does an excellent job of presenting a look at this movement in its great variety. He draws on his long personal experience and many personal connections to describe churches with elaborate liturgies conducted in members' living rooms, very traditional services conducted by gay, lesbian, and transgendered clergy, and theologies combining traditional sacraments with mystical and esoteric revelations. This is a movement which welcomed women into the episcopate over half a century before the Anglicans did, and whose embrace of gay Christians predates the founding of the Metropolitan Community Churches by over two decades.This movement has not been taken seriously by many mainstream religious and academic institutions, and the long out-of-print standard works (Anson, Brandreth) are marred by the contempt of their authors despite giving valuable historical information, so Dr. Plummer's insightful and respectful analysis provides an extremely valuable and long overdue standard work for the study of this movement. After providing a valuable historical overview, he analyzes the worship, theology, structure, and education of clergy in this movement.As fascinating and educational as this text is, this is one of only a small handful of books I have been fortunate enough to encounter in which the footnotes compete with the text for one's interest. Those whose appetites are whetted for more will spend countless hours exploring the \\"many paths\\" whose markers are supplied in those footnotes, many on the Internet, since the online revolution has been a tremendous boon to this movement, lacking in the resources to disseminate information widely by older means. The footnotes document the many personal relationships the author has nurtured with people representing a wide variety of jurisdictions within the movement.Anyone with an interest in this movement, anyone with a fascination with church history, anyone interested in the women's and lesbian/gay/bisexual transgender movements within religion -- must add this book to their library. It will be difficult to wait with patience for Bishop Plummer's next book."},{"Title":"The Many Paths of the Independent Sacramental Movement","review":"The religious veneer of the United States is dominated by larger corporate-style denominations. There are major Protestant denominations - United Methodists, Presbyterians, Southern Baptists and American Baptists, Disciples, and others - at one end of the spectrum, and the Roman Catholic church at the other end. Many people are surprised to find that there are variations beyond these broad categories - the Anglicans and Lutherans fit uneasily between the Protestants and Catholics (and sometimes find themselves lumped in with one or the other group), and the Orthodox don't fit neatly on a two-pole continuum.However, beyond this broad categorisation are countless smaller entities. Leaving aside the non-Christian religious bodies (which are also countless), there are an increasing variety of Baptists who do not belong to the major Baptist groups, Methodists outside United Methodism, Prebyterians outside the mainline denomination, several varieties of Lutherans, and more. What is less commonly known is that there are also splinter groups and smaller jurisdictions derivative of Roman Catholicism, Anglicanism and Orthodox lines dotted all across the nation. So unknown are these beyond their own communities that it surprises Episcopalian bishops and priests that someone might describe himself as an Anglican without being either in the Episcopal Church USA or any other national church of the Anglican Communion.John Plummer has undertaken an important study of this group in his study, 'The Many Paths of the Independent Sacramental Movement.' He studies this phenomenon on several bases - doctrines, practices, and leadership history. He doesn't develop this simply as the history of important figures nor as a simple history of ideas and liturgical development, but does a good blend of all of these methods to bring about a more full description of the situation.As Plummer states in his section on method, the best one can do with regard to this ever-changing group is to take a snapshot, which may or may not bear significant relation to the way the situation will look in the future. Some groups are very small, and many are in a constant state of redefinition of their own communities that directories that have been attempted in history have been out-of-date before they were off the printing presses.Plummer begins with many of the standard academic works on the subject; scholars such as C.B. Moss, Henry Brandreth, and Peter Anson have had definite bias against their subject material, some examples of which Plummer demonstrates. Other scholars such as J. Gordon Melton take a less judgemental approach, whereas figures such as Pruter and Bain are very positive in their approach to the overall subject, if not always toward the individuals and jurisdictions involved. Plummer has also explored several smaller works and academic theses that deal with smaller issues in the episcopi vagantes and continuing Anglican areas, providing references to material that is very valuable for the researcher.There is a certain sense of individualism run amok in some expressions of the independent sacramental movement. 'Perhaps the anarchic confusion of the independent movement is actually a creative ferment, where valuable ecclesiastical experiments are taking place, the results of which can then be offered to the larger church.' This confusion, however, is threatening to mainline denominations already under threat from scandals, large-scale schism and the animus that personal ego clashes can generate.Seeing myself as a theologian first, I immediately turned to the chapter on theology, and agree with Plummer in his analysis - 'the independent sacramental movement has not yet seen much sustained theological reflection.' This is due in part to the fragmented nature of the community, which Plummer acknowledges. There are no major schools, no major faculty or facilities for research, academic work or publishing, no scholarly journals or conferences that draw from a large audience, and thus far no leading light in the arena of theology from within this movement. While the independent sacramental movement may never produce someone with the stature of Augustine, Aquinas, Luther or Wesley, there is room in this area for growth and experimentation. There are 'areas within the independent movement where distinctive developments with theological potential, quite different from the mainstream, are happening.'Plummer's book is a very valuable addition to the small but growing body of work about the independent sacramental movement. Those who call themselves Independent or Continuing Anglicans, Old Catholics, Independent Catholics, Autocephalous Orthodox, or any other such configuration (and the configurations are legion) will find a worthwhile discussion of their own historical roots. Those outside the independent movement, both within and outside of Christianity, may find much that is fascinating, but a very real part of the larger Christian community."},{"Title":"The Many Paths of the Independent Sacramental Movement","review":"John Plummer, Ph.D., has clearly done an excellent piece of work for his doctoral dissertation. I was turned on to this book by my Priest and found that this is not what I would expect from an academic paper. John Plummer has done a very thorough and concise job of providing background and current information on the Churches in America that are following Apostolic Succession. He goes through historical material covering several centuries, then presents information on the liturgy of the groups he has been researching. As a seminarian in the Liberal Catholic Church International I found the entire book to be honest and forthright without having any form of prejudice in the methods of presenting information to me, the reader. I strongly recommend this book to those seeking more information on the sacramental movement in America."},{"Title":"The Many Paths of the Independent Sacramental Movement","review":"This is the book I wish I'd been able to give to my family and friends several years ago when I began my own journey in the Independent Sacramental Movement.

There's an exuberant chaos in the Independent Churches today - at its best, filled with the joy of the Good News. I am, frankly, amazed at the sheer breadth of groups covered in this one volume, and at the level of access Bp. Plummer was able to gain across ideological lines to bring this information to the public. This book stands head and shoulders above previous efforts to give an actual flavor of who we are, and how we aspire to proclaim the Gospel.Bp.

Prior to this book's publication those interested in the subject of independent sacramental jurisdictions and churches had to choose between articles (of various degrees of quality) on Web sites or out dated books written by less than friendly critics. Dr Plummer admittedly writes from the point of view of someone \\"on the inside\\" and in my estimation at least, this is a positive, not a negative, factor. By way of constructive criticism, I would have liked to have read much more about the tremendously significant influence of the late Archbishop Herman A Spruit and the Catholic Apostolic Church of Antioch than Plummer has given us here. 20th and 21st century independent Catholicism would simply not be what it is today apart from Herman Spruit and he deserved a much wider exposure and detailed analysis than he was given in this book. By contrast, groups like the Evangelical Orthodox, while worthy of mention, deserved much less exposure than Dr Plummer gave them, in my estimation. Also, the Index while better then none, is not exhaustive. Those things not withstanding, this book is to be highly recommended and those who study the field of modern American religious movements owe Fr Plummer a special thanks!"},{"Title":"The Many Paths of the Independent Sacramental Movement","review":"Bishop John Plummer has written, what many of us within the independent sacramental/Old Catholic movement have been waiting for.

This book was timely for me as I was struggling to get my bearings in what has been a confusing, puzzling and sometimes alarming movement. Dr. Plummer provided the overview that I needed. He describes typical adherents as having gone through two or more jurisdictions, and a very fluid, rapidly evolving spiritual ecosystem. This has been my experience in the space of two and a half years, having transitioned through two earlier jurisdictions and finally finding a home in a third.I am reminded of the story of the Tower of Babel (Genesis 11:1-9), an ancient tower symbolizing the ultimate demise of human enterprises due to human pride. The building of the tower is described as effort for self-glorification and human initiative apart from God. People seek their own security in community life and culture, independent of God. God has to step in to prevent mankind from seizing yet more power for themselves and going beyond the limits of their human limitations (Gen. 3:22; 11:5-8). Their communication with each other to advance their efforts is frustrated because they begin to speak different languages. Finally, they abandon the building of the city and go their own way, becoming scattered over the earth. Such is the origin of the hundreds, if not thousands, of different denominations and jurisdictions within Christianity.We in the independent movement are fully aware of the ossified state of larger institutional structures and their shutting out and rigid denial of full participation of Christians because of gender, sexual orientation, marital status, ethnic background, or other differences. While the values of the independent movement are inclusive, we've been subject to the same fractionation as so well described by Dr. Plummer. With such small groups, the dynamics are easily disrupted by egotism and individualism, perhaps not dissimilar to the early Christian communities. Dr. Plummer captures that fluidity well.Pentecost was the ultimate biblical answer to this problem of human pride and divisions: On this day, the Holy Spirit was poured out on all people so they understood one another even though they spoke different languages - the barriers that divided people and nations were thus removed (Acts 2:1-11; Ephesians 2:14-18). Dr. Plummer has provided us with a basis for understanding the \\"different languages\\" we speak, and for establishing better communications among ourselves. Those outside this movement will find the best and most current overview available. We didn't make it into \\"New Religions: A Guide: New Religious Movements, Sects and Alternative Spiritualities\\" [Edited by Christopher Partridge, 2004, Oxford University Press]. (There were entries for \\"Western Esotericism,\\" and \\"New Age Traditions\\".) The scant literature on the independent sacramental movement has been well summarized by Dr. Plummer and cited so that inquirers or researchers will be able to access these works.

Goodson, an America, joined the RAF in 1939 and flew Spitfires with the Eagle Squadron. When America entered the war, he was inducted in to the Army Air Corps and transotioned to P-47s. Later, he switched to P-51s and was shot down near the end of the war. In this book, he vivdly recounts air combat from nearly the entire war and pays homage to his comrades. What I liked best about Goodson's account was his humanity. He never glorifies what he did or boasts, even though he was one of the top American aces of the war. I get the impression that he intended the work simply as a tribute to those who fought."},{"Title":"Tumult in the Clouds: A Story of the Eagle Squadron","review":"THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS I HAVE READ ABOUT WWII AVIATION .THE AUTHOR TELLS HIS PERSONAL STORY BUT IN A BROADER SCENARIO OF THE PEOPLE AROUND HIM AND THEIR PERSONALITIES .IT'S HAS IT'S HUMOROUS ANECDOTES BUT THE TOTAL PERSPECTIVE REFLECTS ON THE PILOTS OF HIS GROUP , THEIR FIGHTER PLANES ,AND THE TRAGEDY OF WAR ."},{"Title":"Tumult in the Clouds: A Story of the Eagle Squadron","review":"This book turned out to be different than I had expected. I've read a dozen or so books about the air wars over England and Europe, so I was expecting more of the same. However, Mr. Goodson's approach was entirely different. He focused on the leaders of the squadron, their contributions, their valor and their loss. It seems that each of the great pilots that he flew with were eventually lost to ground fire or air combat. A few survived the war, as he did, in German prison camps. His story of survival after being shot down was one of the poignant I've ever read. The fact that he had survived a London bombing and then found himself being bombed by his own B17's was incredible. The fact that he spoke German and could therefore understand the hatful comments about his presence in the bomb shelter added extra depth to the story. I found his writing and style to be excellent and would highly recommend the book. I was deeply moved by the fact that each and every day, regardless of fatigue level, these men had to get up, climb into their cramped cockpits and fly in all types of weather and cold. Though I had read this before, it hit much harder in this book."},{"Title":"Music From the Soul: The Singing Nun Story","review":"Author stayed faithful and was diligent about getting the truth out, not tabloid fodder. Hopefully others will write more biographies in the future, with in depth evaluations, from the perspectives of historical, psychological and religious communities. Pictures were included. Wish there was at least one of Jeannine and/or Annie as a child. I can't help but think it's too bad they didn't hang on a few more years: they would have had the internet for a forum. I wonder if the tax department would have left her alone if the convent had called off the dogs. Another pity is that they didn't muster up their courage and immigrate to Canada before the situation seemed so out of control."},{"Title":"Music From the Soul: The Singing Nun Story","review":"I am quite sure that Jeannine Deckers wished that her life was the ever cheery, whimsical life of the Flying Nun, but reality isn't always such a bang.

It will break your heart, but it will also open your heart to passions of the heart."},{"Title":"Music From the Soul: The Singing Nun Story","review":"That's the best description I can come up with for this book. I muddled thru to the bitter end hoping against hope that it would get better, reasoning that it couldn't get any worse. Hope and reason were both jilted. I have to assume that this book was published without benefit of an editor's guidance, because there is no focus or cohesiveness to the book at all, even though it is presented in chronological order. It isn't that I don't agree with her conclusions, it's that when she makes them she contradicts herself countless times. From which, if either, of Decker's parents was the cause of her problems, to whether there was a lover's relationship between Decker and Annie, the author constantly goes back and forth on every issue. She hints at conspiracies against Decker, but never delivers the proof; for all the footnotes and references, she still doesn't present facts, just innuendo. I might have been able to tolerate the horrible writing style if I could have pieced together an overall perspective of Decker's life, but all the author offered was hit-and-miss minute details of particular days every few years. There is no overview of what was going on, just \\"on this day there were money problems and depression and drugs\\" and \\"on this day she was happy and then mad and there were problems\\". Dreadful."},{"Title":"Music From the Soul: The Singing Nun Story","review":"I suppose there is much truth in the adage, \\"the truth hurts.\\" Kind of ironic that there is \\"truth\\" in that isn't it? But, trite as it may be, it's fitting to the title of this review. Sadly, this book is an absolutely, horribly boring tale. A nun. She sings. The end. Many men of the cloth sing, yet where are the bios of them? I suppose we should be satisfied with their many cd's.But, I found the story of the Flying Nun much more exciting and enjoyable. If you haven't yet tried that piece, I strongly encourage you to check it out. She had many exciting adventures and, when I finally saw her photo, she looked remarkably like that lady who was cavorting about with \\"the Bandit\\" and being chased by \\"the Smokey\\" in that silly car movie. But surely, if that were the case, she would have used her Flying Nun prowess to simply levitate the Trans Am away from the sheriff and brought them all to safety.Also, since we're on the subject of singing, you should look for the Singing Cab Driver, Myrtle K. Hilo. Her cd was available, at one point in time, here on Amazon. She has a song that will simply move you to tears and joy, all the same time. Much more exciting and fun stuff than any old Singing Nun.Lastly, you should look out for the Singing Detective. He too was far better than this so-called Singing Nun."},{"Title":"The Rule of St. Benedict, Latin & English","review":"This is an important contribution to the studies of Saint Benedict because the book shows clearly what parts of the Rule are from Benedict's own hand. For a long time this information was available, but only for those who had the patience to work through the texts by themselves. With the manner of printing of this edition of the Rule, this material is very clear. For those of us who live under this Rule, this book is an important tool to further understanding the spirit of our founder."},{"Title":"French Canadians in Michigan","review":"It's really about time French-Americans with roots in Canada tell their stories and even toot their very historic trumpets. French history pre-dates the English settlements in colonial America. It's called \\"The French Fact\\". Thousands of French-Canadians can trace their family genealogies to the 1640s and even earlier. Many families even, rather easily, find their first ancestor's roots in medieval France because the history of the culture is so meticulously preserved through the accuracy of the Roman Catholic Church's directories of baptisms, marriages and deaths. Nevertheless, few Americans learn about French-Canadian culture. So, it's about time the descendents of French-Canadians tell their interesting and special stories. Thankfully, many French-Canadian families living in New England are telling their family stories; but now we learn the French-Canadian history and culture is proudly shared by others living in Michigan. Thanks to the research by John P. DuLong, a third generation French-Canadian whose family settled into the Michigan area, the stories of America's French-Canadians are literally tied together - Michigan's French-Americans are culturally similar to New England's \\"Franco-Americans\\". Moreover, it's not a parochial or regional history anymore. DuLong's history of Michigan's French-Canadians is a story New England's Franco-Americans will relate to. There's vintage photographs and even a tourtiere recipe (traditional pork pie, an icon of the French-Canadian culture). Furthermore, all French-Americans of Canadian descent will enjoy a well deserved sense of pride in reading French-Canadians in Michigan. As a side comment, it seems the writing of French history in North American suffered sort of an arrested state of development after Francis Parkman published his series in the late 1800s about the French in North America. A lot has happened since Parkman wrote his chronicles, largely transcribed from the Jesuit Relations documents written by French missionaries. DuLong's work on French-Canadians in Michigan might stir more interest in French-Canadian history. For the sake of a culture older than Plymouth, in Massachusetts, we need more of DuLong's writing to preserve the dwindling numbers of living memories of French-Canadians in America."},{"Title":"French Canadians in Michigan","review":"This is a very good, if very short, introduction to its topic. The work's brevity is the reason for granting only four stars, although the work's format is shared by other volumes in the \\"Discovering the Peoples of Michigan\\" series. The whole series is likely to be of interest to students of the history of the state, while individual volumes will whet the appetites of those interested in specific groups (likely because those groups are part of their own heritage).The most valuable thing I learned from DuLong's book is that French Canadians came to Michigan in two waves. Not only did the French, spreading out from Canadian \\"New France\\", constitute the first European explorers and settlers of the state. There was also a wave of immigration from Quebec in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries drawn to the lumber and then automobile industries.The compound \\"French Canadian\\" is used throughout to signify that those who started their North American adventure in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries in French-speaking Canada quickly came to see themselves as distinct from the European French, including later (if few in number) immigrants who came directly from France. An interesting topic that DuLong just barely touches on is the relationship between the French Canadians in Michigan and those who remained in Quebec. The former found themselves in a different country following the French and Indian (or Seven Years) War and the War of American Independence. Those in Michigan were left to the three-fold contradiction of being true to their heritage, however conceived, being \\"good Americans\\", and maintaining contact, particularly with relatives, in Canada. A source of particular ambivalence has been the movement for Quebec's independence from Anglophone Canada.This book is recommended to those primarily interested in history. For those whose interests are more directly genealogical, DuLong has written TRACING YOUR FRENCH ANCESTRY. I haven't read this, but given the author's role as president of the Detroit Chapter of the French Canadian Heritage Society of Michigan, and on the strength of the present book, I'm sure it's worth checking out."},{"Title":"Black Vulmea's vengeance","review":"I understand that Donald E. Grant produced this and other deluxe volumes of R. E. Howard's stories a couple of decades ago, focusing primarily on the ever-popular Conan tales.Well, like the six volumes of the Bean R.E. Howard Library (which, among other things, collected all the Bran Mac Morn, Solomon Kane, and King Kull tales in single, affordable volumes), Black Vulmea's Vengance collects a handful of Howard efforts that showed that he could create heroes, action, and character interplays far more interesting than anything found in his most famous stories.Two stories and the novella found in this volume can either be read as top-notch pirate stories, or they can be read as typical Howard action tales. What *isn't* quite typical Howard, though, is the presence of female characters that display a bit more depth than one usually finds in his work.Considering the relative age of this book and the fact that I received a first edition when I ordered it, I imagine that there are only a limited number of these left. I urge all Howard fans, as well as those who appreciate well-written adventure fiction, to order a copy. The price is definately right for these fine, hard-to-find tales. The book would have received Five Stars if the colour plates present had been better executed. They were the only dissapointing aspect of this hardcover collection."},{"Title":"Black Vulmea's vengeance","review":"There are three stories included in this book. The first story is called &quot;swords of the red brotherhood&quot;. If any of you have ever read the conan story The treasure of tranicos, then you have read this story, as it is nothing more than a change of setting and the names have been altered, the other two tales are not even worth mentioning. All in all a very poor read."},{"Title":"Side by Side: A Multicultural Reader","review":"A very interesting book, filled with short stories from different cultural backgrounds.

Although frequently criticised in Spanish literary cliques, the very particular sense of humour and recurring style of Marias is captivating. Having a kind of film noir story background, Marias creates a set of curiously charming characters that develop through a catching story line. Special mention to a superb scene that features the king of Spain, Juan Carlos I, unfortunately not at the reach of non-Spaniard readers. Do not miss it, especially if you can read the original Spanish prose."},{"Title":"Manana en la batalla piensa en mi (Alfaguara de Bolsillo) (Spanish Edition)","review":"Al principio, este libro me pareci&oacute; dif&iacute;cil de seguir, y hasta un poco aburrido. Mi primera impresi&oacute;n es que el autor se iba por la tangente que daba gusto. Pero segu&iacute; leyendo y al poco me di cuenta de que de tangentes nada. Este libro es como un gran concierto de pensamientos, los cuales todos se centran en un punto com&uacute;n. Esas tangencias o periferias est&aacute;n dise&ntilde;adas con tal habilidad que complementan la historia sin parecer superfluas: Ruib&eacute;rriz, Celia/Victoria, el &Uacute;nico, todos caracteres bien perfilados, con mucho color, y las citas entremezcladas en el texto, las escenas de pel&iacute;culas, todos contribuyendo a realzar una trama ya de por s&iacute; apasionante. El protagonista se debate entre decisiones tomadas y asumidas, y sus di&aacute;logos consigo mismo son de lo mejor que he leido en la literatura espa&ntilde;ola en mucho tiempo.El final es imprevisible. Cuando ya pensaba que sab&iacute;a por d&oacute;nde iban los tiros, en el &uacute;ltimo momento me llev&eacute; una sorpresa. Qu&eacute; ir&oacute;nica puede ser la vida, qu&eacute; carcajadas se pega a nuestra costa (o en este caso a costa de De&aacute;n).Las notas adicionales (otra sorpresa que no descubr&iacute; hasta el final) son muy interesantes, y si ya por entonces me cab&iacute;a alguna duda del pedazo de escritor que es Javier Mar&iacute;as, ah&iacute; se me borraron por completo. Esta novela es para no perd&eacute;rsela."},{"Title":"Manana en la batalla piensa en mi (Alfaguara de Bolsillo) (Spanish Edition)","review":"I have read four novels by Mar&iacute;as so far, all of them are great, but this one is the best by far. I wouldn't call it a &quot;mystery/thriller&quot;, it is a novel about decisions one's takes and it's implications, about unevitable things and about death. The technique is impressive, recurring phrases that seem trivial at first and make more sense every time they are mentioned. Shakespeare's quotes applied to the situations. If you would read only one book by Mar&iacute;as, read this one."},{"Title":"Manana en la batalla piensa en mi (Alfaguara de Bolsillo) (Spanish Edition)","review":"Siempre he pensado que hay dos tipos de escritores. A decir verdad son tres. Seg&uacute;n mi categorizaci&oacute;n reduccionista:1.- Los que relatan una historia y todo el apoyo de la obra est&aacute; en ella. Sin m&aacute;s que la simple historia2.- Los que describen emociones y reflexionan sobre los hechos de una historia. En estos escritores la historia es s&oacute;lo un material conductor para montar estas expresiones.3.- Los que cumplen con los dos requisitos; historia y reflexi&oacute;n, que son los menos comunes de encontrar.Al segundo tipo yo los llamo \\"Los Interioristas\\" y soy un fan&aacute;tico de estos escritores. Y por favor, que no se me malinterprete; un escritor interiorista para mi tiene mucho m&aacute;s valor que cualquier otro (Haruki Murakami, Juan Jos&eacute; Millas, Ernesto Sabato y por supuesto Javier Mar&iacute;as).Parecer&iacute;a que en cualquier historia que cuenta Javier Mar&iacute;as, no pasa nada, ya que todo transcurre a trav&eacute;s de esas reflexiones. La estructura es m&aacute;s o menos as&iacute;: Un hecho, seguido de lo que ese hecho les representa y le hace sentir el personaje principal. A trav&eacute;s de esa experiencia se generan tambi&eacute;n recuerdos y se cuenta una historia m&aacute;s, dentro de esa misma historia, pero en la cabeza del protagonista. Se generan m&aacute;s sucesos dentro del personaje que en la historia misma y se recrean esos recuerdos dolorosos. A trav&eacute;s de determinados hechos sin importancia, se detonan los pensamientos, muchas veces pesimistas de este personaje. Generalmente es muy paranoico y a su alrededor percibe que existe una conspiraci&oacute;n en su contra.Este personaje tambi&eacute;n esp&iacute;a, sigue a otros como un detective en busca de pistas y reflexiona. Se obsesiona con otras personas. Se convierten en seres vac&iacute;os de s&iacute; mismos que esp&iacute;an a otros sin ser vistos. Para conocer sus actividades cotidianas, para sacar conclusiones err&aacute;ticas siempre.El espiado tiene una vida oculta y secreta, mientras que el esp&iacute;a es un ser volcado en los otros, con una vida estable y pintada incluso como aburrida por si mismo.El escenario el la obra de Mar&iacute;as regularmente es Madrid y sus calles. Toda la historia se desarrolla en el interior del personaje y resulta claustrof&oacute;bica, aunque siempre transite en exteriores. Describe con gran detalle los pisos de las zonas de clase media alta en donde los protagonistas viven y trabajan. Relata con la minuciosidad de un relojero suizo que pasa el tiempo armando con paciencia unos cuantos engranajes de la compleja y diminuta maquinaria. As&iacute; es Javier Mar&iacute;as con sus historias. Es un escritor con mucho oficio, como dije de artesano, de relojero y con paciencia va bordando ese detalle para adentrarnos en el trauma de un personaje que le ocurren cosas, pero siempre al interior de &eacute;l mismo, por una situaci&oacute;n que siempre es secreta y que no puede revelar, pues ser&iacute;a juzgado y censurado por lo dem&aacute;s. Nadie debe espiar a otros. Nadie se debe obsesionar con otros. A estos personajes s&iacute; les ocurre.Esta obsesi&oacute;n por otras personas llega a estar muy cerca de tocar la locura, pues empiezan a alterar la realidad, dentro de ellos mismos y en una acto esquizoide empiezan a confundir a las personas con las que se topan en la calle, pensando que son aquellos objetos de su obsesi&oacute;n. Son personajes construidos con una base m&aacute;s psicol&oacute;gica que filos&oacute;fica, y son altamente reflexivos de su situaci&oacute;n, la cual domina sus vidas y decisiones.Viven en las calles y vagan en ellas. Son meditabundos y observadores. Sus personajes nunca desean ser el centro de atenci&oacute;n y detestan a la gente protag&oacute;nica y ruidosa, pero siempre est&aacute;n rodeados por este perfil de personas.Este el personaje principal tipo de Javier Mar&iacute;as. Y para ilustrar el comportamiento, pongo un ejemplo: En su libro Ma&ntilde;ana en la batalla piensa en mi, su personaje principal es un escritor que hace discursos y textos para otros, principalmente para funcionarios del Gobierno espa&ntilde;ol ( a esto se lo conoce como a \\"El negro\\"). Este personaje se enreda con una mujer casada, quien lo invita a su casa mientras su marido est&aacute; de viaje. La mujer tiene un hijo peque&ntilde;o, al que manda a dormir para consumar la noche con su amante, la cual lleva planeando con anterioridad con nuestro protagonista. Ella se empieza sentir enferma y piensa que es la comida, y V&iacute;ctor, el personaje principal, describe todo el encuentro y c&oacute;mo ella empieza a agonizar y despu&eacute;s de unas horas, inexplicablemente muere sin que &eacute;l sepa la causa.Este hombre se encuentra en un departamento de una mujer casi desconocida, que acaba de morir y con un ni&ntilde;o peque&ntilde;o en la habitaci&oacute;n de al lado. Despu&eacute;s de mucho pensar y vagar por la casa, hace un sin fin de escenarios posible y sin m&aacute;s sale del departamento. El personaje se modifica y empieza con dos comportamientos que no abandonar&aacute; m&aacute;s: la especulaci&oacute;n de todo y la obsesi&oacute;n por conocer m&aacute;s de esta mujer que ha muerto. Desde ese momento y todos los d&iacute;as vigilar&aacute; el departamento de la mujer desde la acera de enfrente y no perder&aacute; el movimiento incluso del edificio. Observa salir y entrar a la gente. Se imagina historias de todos. Sigue al padre, al esposo, y hace conjeturas de cada uno de ellos.En otra de sus obras, Coraz&oacute;n tan blanco, el personaje principal tambi&eacute;n est&aacute; marcado por una tragedia desde el inicio, la cual tambi&eacute;n se convierte en un misterio y se va a aclarando a lo largo del libro, pero con sus respectivas obsesiones.Los t&iacute;tulos de estos dos libros son citas o fragmentos de obras de Wiliam Shakespiere, que toma Mar&iacute;as para dar t&iacute;tulo a los dos libros. Los protagonistas de estas novelas son muy similares entre s&iacute;. La situaciones, las tragedias, los misterios, las reflexiones. Tal vez es una especie de continuaci&oacute;n, pues primero escribi&oacute; Coraz&oacute;n tan blanco y despu&eacute;s, Ma&ntilde;ana en la batalla piensa en mi.Tal vez es por su dominio de la lengua inglesa y su profundo conocimiento de la obra de Shakespiere, que hace diversas referencias de palabras en ese idioma. En varios momentos de sus novelas, desmenuza alguna palabra que en castellano no existe y la describe, como siempre, reflexionado sobre de ella. Busca describir la comprensi&oacute;n de un concepto dentro de un contexto y se vuelve incapaz de dar una traducci&oacute;n exacta de la palabra. Un ejemplo de esto, es, seg&uacute;n Mar&iacute;as, \\"el abolido verbo gelicgan\\", que significa \\"la relaci&oacute;n o parentesco adquiridos por dos o m&aacute;s hombres que han yacido o se han acostado con la misma mujer\\" es uno de los ejemplos de palabras que utiliza en su leguaje. A ciencia cierta no s&eacute; si lo invent&oacute;, pero &iquest;No ser&iacute;a genial, que s&iacute; existiera una palabra como esa y que describiera ese estado?Para empezar a conocerlo, recomiendo sus libros: Ma&ntilde;ana en la Batalla piensa en mi y Coraz&oacute;n tan blanco, particularmente el primero, que es fenomenal, que parece una novela polic&iacute;aca, de misterio, pero se convierte en totalmente otra cosa. No esperen finales clim&aacute;ticos. No es ese su estilo, Disfruten mejor durante todo el trayecto de la historia, la visi&oacute;n reflexiva que les ofrece este autor, y reflexionen ustedes mismos sobre sus propios recuerdos y sus parejas, tema obligado en Coraz&oacute;n tan blanco, en donde Mar&iacute;as nos hace pensar lo que significa casarse y caer en el molde de una nueva vida sint&eacute;tica a la que ha denominado \\"Cambio de estado\\", y en la que de un d&iacute;a a otro nos obliga a vivir con los art&iacute;fices de una nueva casa y la \\"suspensi&oacute;n de h&aacute;bitos y convicciones. \\"Es el fin de algo y nada seguir&aacute; como hasta entonces\\".Javier Mar&iacute;as fue considerado por la critica acad&eacute;mica como uno de los 10 mejores autores en lengua castellana de la segunda mitad del siglo XX, que deben ser le&iacute;dos; en la lista de 100 escritores, figuran autores del nivel de Garc&iacute;a M&aacute;rquez y Fernando del Paso.Los paseos por Madrid, Nueva York, La Habana y el interior de V&iacute;ctor o de Juan, ser&aacute; el recorrido en un carro de monta&ntilde;a rusa, que no siempre ser&aacute; agradable, pero si divertido e intrigante. Tal vez aprendan algo de ustedes mismos, como un paciente en terapia, que se escucha a si mismo hacer reflexiones interminables acerca de su madre, de su padre, y sus propios motivos heredados.Pero, &iquest;qui&eacute;n es Javier Mar&iacute;as?Javier Mar&iacute;as naci&oacute; en Madrid en 1951. Hijo del fil&oacute;sofo Juli&aacute;n Mar&iacute;as, pas&oacute; parte de su infancia junto con su familia en Estados Unidos, ya que su padre fue encarcelado por ser republicano y se le prohibi&oacute; impartir clases en la Universidad espa&ntilde;ola. Recibi&oacute; una s&oacute;lida educaci&oacute;n liberal en el Colegio Estudio, heredero de la Instituci&oacute;n Libre de Ense&ntilde;anza. Estudi&oacute; Filosof&iacute;a y Letras (secci&oacute;n de Filolog&iacute;a Inglesa) por la Universidad Complutense de Madrid.En 1970 escribi&oacute; su primera novela, Los dominios del lobo, que ser&iacute;a publicada al a&ntilde;o siguiente., Estudi&oacute; Filosof&iacute;a y letrasEn 2002, inicia su m&aacute;s ambicioso proyecto literario al publicar el primero de tres tomos de su novela \\"Tu rostro ma&ntilde;ana\\", historia de 1600 p&aacute;ginas, que involucra sucesos de los antepasados del personaje principal, que estuvieron en la guerra civil espa&ntilde;ola y la segunda guerra mundial. En julio de 2009 public&oacute; el tercer y &uacute;ltimo tomo de esta novela la cual le tom&oacute; 8 a&ntilde;os de sus vida en escribirla y qued&oacute; exhausto, por lo que refiere que por el momento ya no desea escribir otra novela, pero s&iacute; cuentos. En esta novela, como en las novelas antiguas, aparecen muchos personajes y es tan extensa, como los rusos o los franceses.Durante muchos a&ntilde;os escribi&oacute; en El Pa&iacute;s Semanal, en la secci&oacute;n \\"zona Fantasma, pero despu&eacute;s de un incidente que la parecer fue censurado, decidi&oacute; dejar de escribir para este semanario.

This book gives a good introduction to operators on Hilbert space, and could be read by a beginning graduate student of physics.The theory of operators on Hilbert spaces could be viewed as a generalization of the theory of matrix transformations on finite-dimensional vector spaces. This viewpoint is readily apparent in chapter 1, wherein the author introduces Hilbert spaces as infinite-dimensional vector spaces (over the complex numbers) with an inner product. The author shows how to handle infinite sums of vectors, which requires the notion of convergence, and how to guarantee an infinite sequence of vectors converges to a limit vector that is also in the Hilbert space: the famous Cauchy sequences of vectors. The notion of a linear functional is also introduced, the author proving the one-to-one correspondence between continuous linear functionals and vectors, and connects this with the Dirac bra-ket notation.Observables in quantum mechanics are represented by operators on (separable) Hilbert spaces, and these are studied in chapter 2. It is straightforward to define a linear operator in finite dimensions, but in infinite dimensions one needs the notion of a continuous linear operator. The author proves that a linear operator is continuous if and only if it is bounded. Unitary operators, so crucial to the calculation of probabilities in quantum theory, are introduced in this chapter also. In addition, the author studies projection operators, which are very important in the measurement process in quantum mechanics. lastly, the author discusses unbounded operators, which are ubiquitous in quantum theory, especially in the theory of angular momenta.Obtaining measurement results in quantum theory corresponds to obtaining an eigenvalue of a Hermitian linear operator. Thus one must develop a notion of diagonalization (or &quot;spectral resolution&quot;) of these operators, and this takes place in chapter 3. In infinite dimensions a Hermitian or unitary operator need not have any eigenvalues or eigenvectors, but the author shows how to obtain a spectral resolution using spectral families of projection operators. He proves that a self-adjoint operator is bounded if and only if its spectrum is bounded, and also Stone's theorem, which gives a representation of a unitary operator as an exponential of a unique self-adjoint operator. Such a representation is expected from the standpoint of how time evolution is characterized in quantum mechanics.Things become more abstract in chapter 4, wherein the author studies operator algebras. The goal of the chapter is to find conditions under which the functions of a set of noncommuting operators include all bounded operators. This problem motivates the definition of a von Neumann algebra or W*-algebra, this definition depending on the important notion of a weak topology on a set of bounded operators. It is this topology that is the most relevant for the connection of quantum theory with laboratory measurements.In chapter 5, the author makes clearer the concept of a state in quantum mechanics, this being done using the concept of a density matrix. States specify expectation values of bounded operators, and the author shows how to represent the expectation value of a bounded operator using a unique density matrix. Probabilities in quantum-mechanical calculations are then viewed as expectation values for projection operators, and the author uses Gleason's theorem to justify that projection operators are sufficient to determine the representation of a state. Having set up all this formalism, the author then derives the uncertainty principle for a quantity represented by a Hermitian operator. He then shows that real quantities which are simultaneously measurable with unlimited precision are represented by commuting Hermitian operators. lastly, the author addresses the implicit assumption that every bounded Hermitian operator can represent a measurable quantity. He gives an example of a system that cannot, this occurring because of 'superselection rules'. An operator that commutes with every Hermitian operator which represents a measurable quantity, but is not a multiple of the identity operator is then called a 'superselection operator'. He also discusses, but does not prove in detail, the representation of the expectation value of an element of a von Neumann algebra in terms of a density matrix. When a superselection rule is in place, the density matrix is not always unique. The author then shows how these facts enable one to view a von Neumann algebra alternatively as a collection of bounded operators that commute with all the projection operators.States of course evolve in time, and so do observables. In chapter 6 the author derives the equations of motion both for the states and the observables. For the states this is the 'Schrodinger picture', and for the observables the 'Heisenberg picture'. Wigner's theorem on unitary and antiunitary operators is used to show that the time evolution of states is linear. The Heisenberg picture is illustrated by an example of a single particle. A more complicated situation though is when the classical system is not integrable, and is still the topic of intense research. The author also includes, atypically for books at this level, a discussion of what happens to the Schrodinger picture when superselection rules are included.The mathematical tools used in this chapter are used in chapter 7 to study Galilean and Newtonian space-time transformations of states."},{"Title":"Linear Operators for Quantum Mechanics","review":"I really like this book and find myself returning to it often to clarify issues in the mathematical foundations of QM only superficially treated in many standard QM textbooks. The book is very concise, clear and rigorous. It's jammed packed with theorems and proofs, not physics exposition or examples. The pace is very brisk and there's no hand-holding. So be prepared!I'm teaching myself quantum mechanics using several standard QM textbooks and have found this book complements them very well. It does, however, assume that elusive quality of \\"mathematical maturity\\" (this is really a definition/theorem type book, so be forewarned). In fact, Jordan states the book is the result of first-year graduate QM courses he taught and assumes the reader is at that level. From my experience, I think one should be comfortable with at least standard university level calculus (some analysis helpful), linear algebra, some linear functional analysis and a smidgen of group theory. If you are studying a physics textbook on QM and would like to know more about the mathematical foundations, I highly recommend this book. For the price, I think it would be hard to beat.Some background in linear functional analysis is necessary to really understand the mathematics of Hilbert spaces underlying quantum mechanics. For those without any background in linear functional analysis, I recommend very highly Rynne and Youngson'sLinear Functional Analysis (Springer Undergraduate Mathematics Series)(my personal favorite), or the longer but admirably clear classicIntroductory Functional Analysis with Applicationsby Kreyszig. I also highly recommend Helmberg's marvelousIntroduction to Spectral Theory in Hilbert Space (Dover Books on Mathematics).For those, like me, with aging eyes, be aware the font is very small!Aside: For those who do not have sufficient mathematical background for Jordan but feel they need a succinct guide focusing on key topics that often trouble beginning students, I also highly recommend Bowman'sEssential Quantum Mechanics. It only requires standard calculus and linear algebra but provides a number of very insightful concise explanations of various key topics in basic QM. (Cf. my Amazon review.)"},{"Title":"Linear Operators for Quantum Mechanics","review":"This is a five stars book with a mortal sin.The book is a good introduction to functional analyses with quantum mechanics serving as motivation for definitions and theorems.It is very good for physics students that have already had a good course on quantum mechanics. Since it is intended to be a book to be used as described it is incomplete as a functional analysis book. Now the mortal sin: the author presents spectral theory using projection operators.This is fine. However to neglect the conection with the continuos spectrum will surely repel the intended audience. There are other books that do not do this and therefore are to be prefered.An old one is by Friedman( Lectures on applications oriented mathematics) . A new one is by Zeidler(Applied functional anlysis: applications to mathematical physics)"},{"Title":"Linear Operators for Quantum Mechanics","review":"Physics students learn that Classical Mechanics can be formulated in a variety of different ways at increasing levels of abstraction beginning with Newton's Laws, then progressing through the principle of least action and Lagrangian mechanics, to Hamilton's equations, and finally to Hamilton-Jacobi theory, and that each of these \\"layers\\" needs to be learned before the next one can be appreciated.So it is with Quantum Mechanics too. With QM there are at least three levels of formulation beginning with wave functions, progressing to Dirac's formalism, and then to operator formalism which is the subject of this book.With that said, if you don't already know -- really know -- the wave function and Dirac formalisms, this book should be avoided until you do.Although perhaps useful as an introduction to the operator formalism, this book's real intent is to provide a glimpse at the substantial mathematical machinery behind the operator formalism, so the student can set their understanding of it on firmer mathematical ground. Nonetheless, this book is only an introduction to the mathematics behind the operator formalism, and many important results are stated without proof.There are only seven chapters in this book, and the first four are mathematical preparation. Physics doesn't really enter the picture until chapter five, \\"States\\". And it is here that the reader begins to appreciate the elegance of the operator formalism: it handles quantum mechanics and quantum statistical mechanics simultaneously. This is because in the operator formalism all states are represented as density operators. And pure states are simply idempotent density operators. That is, density operators for which A^2 = A. This makes them projection operators. And is another point of elegance: in the Dirac formalism a state vector only defines a state up to a phase factor, but in the operator formalism, this ambiguity is removed.However, there is still plenty of ambiguity within the choice of operators used to represent measurable quantities.Regardless, I thought this book did a very good job both in selection of topics and level of coverage for its intended audience and purpose. There are, however, only a few exercise which are all at the end of the book, several of which are quite challenging.If you are an undergrad, I'd suggest you postpone this book and spend your time learning more quantum mechanics itself. In addition to a solid knowledge of quantum mechanics, the well prepared reader should have a strong background in finite dimensional linear algebra. Knowledge of elementary analysis and even a bit of group theory will be helpful as well."},{"Title":"Linear Operators for Quantum Mechanics","review":"When I first picked up this book I was dubious regarding its likely suitability for somebody like myself: an engineering Ph.D. who had taken graduate quantum mechanics, and who also has a B.S. in physics. The book is full of proofs and does not have a single diagram or illustration of any kind. Nevertheless, the more I delved into it, the more appreciative I have become of its approach. The proofs are not difficult and the lack of diagrams and illustrations is more than compensated by the authors steady development of each concept--a development that relies on clear derivations that fill in the important steps for the reader.For me, Jordan's book provides the most balanced introduction to Hilbert space in quantum mechanics. Compared to R.I.G. Hughes'The Structure and Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics, Jordan relies less on intuitive arguments, but more on clear and explicit derivations. Often in reading Hughes I found myself wondering \\"what exactly is he getting at here?\\" In Jordan, however, with his clear derivations and proofs laid out explicitly before me, I do not have to wonder! Don't get me wrong though! I still found Hughes quite valuable, especially in his breakdown of the quantum measurement concepts explored in von Neumann'sMathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics, a topic that is not addressed to the same extent by Jordon.The part of this book that really won me over is Jordon's treatment of spectral decomposition (Section 14), which is explored on pages 42-49. This section is part of Chapter 3, Diagonalizing Operators, pp.34-66. After reading Section 14 and most of Chapter 3 in which it is imbedded, most readers who have benefited from a graduate level quantum mechanics course should be able to understand spectral decomposition, especially after taking a brief look at Section 10 on projection operators (pp.26-29).This extremely compelling and lucid treatment of quantum mechanics in terms of Hilbert space is also an incredible bargain! If you are a relative novice such as myself who has ANY interest in Hilbert space and quantum mechanics at all, there is no way that you can pass up shelling out the mere $8.25 for a brand new paperback copy of this unassuming, but ultimately amazing, little 144-page book!"},{"Title":"Linear Operators for Quantum Mechanics","review":"The language used in this book is easy especially for those who have a physics background.

I cannot recommend this book highly enough. It's the fruit of her years as a reader, a writer, a feminist, and a mother. Her persona here is enviably understanding of the men in her life. Weaving her actual life (stories of her kids, and her lucky husband) with the author's characters and with the author's themselves is Chutzpah with Heart. It works. It is SO good that in addition to giving it five stars, I actually had the fleeting thought that it should be more expensive than it is, a first that any like idea has occurred to me about ANY book.

Anne Roiphe is also a reader who carries certainly literary characters around with her, like a cherished friend.

She looks at male literary characters that made an impact on her and why they did so. But what is so insightful is the years of maturity that she brings as she looks back on them. How was it that Holden Caufield could speak to her so powerfully in the 50's and how did the adults miss it? What was there about Hemingway's Robert Jordan that made us want to run off to Spain? And why, in spite of his obvious shortcomings, did we sympathize with Updike's Rabbit? Roiphe's candor and insight into the characters, the times, and the authors makes this book enjoyable from start to last, leaving us craving for more. No doubt this book will send you back to those books for another look and another adventure with them.

The word frequency lists do help students to focus on learning the most commonly used words in the Greek New Testament and, thereby, to rapidly build a working vocabulary.The most helpful aspect of the vocabulary lists is the mnemonic aids that Metzger provides for some of the words. When I began to memorize Greek vocabulary I used mnemonic devices for the many words that had no English cognate or other obvious relation to an English word or meaning. Many of these devices were silly, but they made the word stick out in my mind; Metzger states that this is a good technique and believes that it is often a case of 'the sillier, the better.' I only wish that he had provided more mnemonic aids as he leaves us empty-handed in regard to many words (especially some of the more difficult words). Still, the ones he does provide are a great help.The second half of the book, as other reviewers have noted, has been surpassed by others in newer books. I also recommend Warren Trenchard's \\"Complete Vocabulary Guide to the Greek New Testament\\" (Revised Edition) as the best and most comprehensive vocabulary resource for the beginning student - just don't allow certain portions of the book to become a crutch that keep you from memorizing the principal parts of verbs. Thomas A. Robinson's \\"Mastering Greek Vocabulary\\" is another good resource for building vocabulary through memorizing words by their cognate group; however, Trenchard's volume also provides this information (and more), so it's still the better resource.

The author clearly did a lot of research, and can write a skillful sentence. But his determination to fault everything Richard Herrin ever did interferes with the telling of the story.For example, Herrin and Garland passed their classes. Meyer focuses on Herrin's academic issues and seems to fault affirmative action for both Richard's presence at Yale and his poor academic performance, hinting that he was incapable of meeting Yale's standards, yet at other times mentions the degree to which Herrin neglected his studies. In contrast, Bonnie Garland also had academic performance issues and also neglected her studies, but it never occurs to Meyer to claim that her status as a legacy (child of an alumnus) might have gained her preferential treatment in admission to a college too difficult for her. Of course, if you can neglect your studies at a competitive university and still pass, you're clearly bright enough to have earned your place there, regardless of where you're from or who your parents are.It's a shame that Meyer couldn't be more objective, because it's a sad and perplexing story. Although it originally caught public attention because of the Yale connection, what was ultimately so notable about it was the degree to which the Yale Catholic community rallied around Richard, the self-confessed killer; their focus on him was so strong it almost seemed that to them, Garland's death at his hands was Herrin's tragedy, not that of her family and friends. Moreover, I believe that the involvement of such prestigious well-wishers led to Herrin's relatively light sentence. While Meyer captures some of the flavor of these circumstances, his issues with Herrin frankly leave the reader wondering why anyone, however strong their religious faith, would stand by this pathetic, self-centered, clinging loser."},{"Title":"The Yale Murder","review":"this was the first book I read when it was first published years ago and opened my mind to the realization that good non-fiction is often better than fiction. This is a really good character study of we humans. Very thought provoking."},{"Title":"The Yale Murder","review":"I don't usually read true crime but this one is fascinating.Richard was a poor Mexican-American who went to Yale in the 1970s on an affirmative action program. Socially he was out of his depth at Yale; I am sure he also had some underlying psychiatric disorders. Bonnie was an upper class girl at Yale whose dad was a Yalie as well.They fell in love but when Bonnie told Richard she wanted to see other men, Richard bludgeoned her to death. He did this in the middle of the night at Bonnie's parents' large home in a rich suburb. The rest of the family were in the house at the time but were not disturbed by the killing. Richard then escaped from the house, intending to kill himself, but within six hours he gave himself up to to police.A jury, having examined the evidence with great care, found Richard guilty of manslaughter, not murder, on the grounds that he was suffering from extreme emotional disturbance. Richard served more than fifteen years in prison which is a long time for manslaughter.The author tells the story in detail : Richard and Bonnie's love affair; the killing; the trial; interviews with Richard's friends, lawyers, psychiatrists; the reaction of Bonnie's parents; the then law of manslaughter and murder; opposing psychiatric testimony.If you are interested in people, even \\"evil\\" people, this is a fascinating book.Only four stars because the book has only one photo, that of Richard and Bonnie at a picnic, two years before the killing. The book would benefit from a few photos; \\"a picture is worth a thousand words.\\" Dr Gaylin's book on the same killing has several photos."},{"Title":"The Yale Murder","review":"I've known Mr. Herrin since 1996 when he came to work for me soon after his release from prison.

The book is fascinating as is Richard's life."},{"Title":"How to Photograph Cars","review":"Well thought out, excellent chapters, actual picture by picture explanations of techniques.

I then realized I was looking for some grand revelation. I started over and found that there was a lot of cleaver and less obvious information.

This book demonstrates love. This is the perfect, Christian book, not only for entertainment, but for encouragement. Libby's father was awesome. I did envy her, though, because it made me wish I had of had a father like hers. This book reminds us that God DOES have plans for us, and he DOES work in our lives, and His plan is the perfect plan. Libby was also awesome. At only 19, she is mature, and is a good example to follow. Not only is she Christian-hearted, she is an honest hard worker, and a dedicated friend and fellow human. I loved her. One example in particular that I really loved about her, was when Naomi was trying to tell Libby about some personal business, Libby said &quot;You don't have to tell me&quot;. Most people would have listened with greedy ears, and then wanted more. I guess I found this especially encouraging because so many people today are so nosy and ask personal questions. Libby wasn't that way. Another thing I loved was the old-timy setting. Even though I live in modern day, I grew up in the country, so I could relate to a lot of the ways in which they lived. It was a warm feeling. After reading this book, I went to a museum, and an old country store was on display in the museum. Mail slots were set up in the store, just like they were in Willie Blue's store. I felt as if I were in Willie Blue's store! Libby seemed as if she should be there! The characters were great and WELL-developed. Like I mentioned earlier, a very AWESOME character was Libby's father. Zerilda Payne was a pain. Willie Blue apparently, as Libby discovered, was a noble man. This book had an awesome finish. When I got near the end, it was hard to put down. It was simply awesome and heart-warming. I do recommend it. I can't wait until I get the two books after this one in the sequel. I want to read on about Libby's life. I'm glad it doesn't end here! I've grown to love Libby, so of course I want more."},{"Title":"Prairie Rose (Prairie Rose Series #1)","review":"I loved this book.

I need to be able to get up the curve VERY quickly about a lot of different software products.

Do not buy this book if you have any sense."},{"Title":"One Hundred Days: Napoleon's Road to Waterloo","review":"Alan Schom's book, while on the face of it an informative guide to the Waterloo Campaign, is at best misguided and at worst completely untrue. Although he paints an interesting view as to the relationships between Napoleon and his brothers many of his other comments are contradicted by all other books on the subject. He says in his passage on the trial of Marshal Ney that this was one of the most hated men in the army, and yet every other authority describes Ney as the darling of the men, described as the 'Bravest of the Brave'.His view that Napoleon was certain to be defeated is also seriously flawed. Both Austria and Russia were more concerned with neutralising each other than with fighting Napoleon. David Hamilton-Williams in his book 'The Fall Of Napoleon' has hard evidence that these countries would have made peace with Napoleon had he won Waterloo. This book is fatally flawed in that it seems unable to give any credit to anyone who rallied to Napoleon in the campaign which he so nearly won against all the odds."},{"Title":"One Hundred Days: Napoleon's Road to Waterloo","review":"Schom is no great fan of Napolean, as his recent biography of the little Corsican demonstrates. However, I thought in reading this book that he provided a fairly even-handed, readable description of a fascinating period in European history. Most readers are familiar with the basic facts: In 1815, the deposed Napolean Bonaparte escaped from his island exile of Elba, and set sail for the shores of his beloved France. The king sent the army to recapture him, but upon encountering their former leader the troops rallied to his cause, and he ultimately marched into Belgium as the rest of Europe looked on in horror at this menace whom they thought was out of their hair forever. An alliance of troops, under the command of Lord Wellington, met up with Napolean on the great battlefield of Waterloo, leading to Bonaparte's final great defeat.This book provides a very readable account of these 4 months, and effectively demonstrated how close Napolean actually was to pulling off one more great victory. He points out the damaging mistakes by Napolean's inferior generals, leading to his flank being disrupted by General Blucher at a crucial point in the battle. We all know how the story ends, and yet the story was oddly suspenseful in Schom's hands nonetheless. He also paints a very vivid, sometimes unflattering portrait of Napolean, who was not the same man who boldly grasped the crown from the Pope in Notre Dame and proclaimed himself Emperor over 10 years earlier. Napolean was physically weaker, had a slight drool, and lacked the dynamic force of his younger days during the final 100 day campaign.All in all, while Schom's critical attitude towards Bonaparte has sometimes been open to attack, I thought this was a very entertaining historical narrative for the casual history buff like myself."},{"Title":"One Hundred Days: Napoleon's Road to Waterloo","review":"I found this book to be very readable and once again, I also found it to be another one of Alan Schom's anti-Napoleon treatment. I am bit amazed that someone of Mr. Schom's talent as a writer and historian would be wasted on such bias effort. I would like to ask Mr. Schom if Napoleon have done anything good or decent in his life since he really like to paint this French Emperor and one of history's greatest military commanders as little better then petty dictator with delusion of grandeur with a Hitler complex.Mr. Schom would probably find a greater acceptence among Napoleonic readers if he would be more fair in his assessments of the facts and characters. When you are too bias against your subject, then its pretty clear to any reader that you got a grudge against it.The book overall, doesn't add anything new to anyone who is well read on the subject of Waterloo campaign. For experience readers, this book will end up in your local used book store. For casual readers, there are many anti-Napoleonic traps that author insert to make claims that Napoleon was nothing more then an early 19th century misanthrope.PS: I believed HMS Bellerophon was a ship of a line, not a frigate."},{"Title":"One Hundred Days: Napoleon's Road to Waterloo","review":"This author seems to have a decidely anti-Napoleonic bias. While on the surface there is nothing wrong with that, as Bonaparte has gott'en a lot of positive press over the years by Chandler and the like. Still, one would prefer a bit more subtle approach on what should be a balanced work on history.This book is more a standard history than a military appreciation of the Waterloo campaign. Those looking for another military appraisal of this epic clash will be somewhat disappointed here. The author spends a lot of time chronicling the Emperor's return, which is interesting and does not tend to get too much attention in other works on the subject. Napoleon's efforts to the throw together a new government in a matter of days gets a lot of attention here and each major character involved gets a lot of attention. Fully a third or more of the book is taken up with mini bios on all the Bonaparte clan, as well as Fouche, Tallyrand, Davout and others. An entire chapter goes into great detail examining the tacit French resistence and over all lukewarm response toward his return in 1815.The actual campaign of 1815 does not get started until the last third or so of the book. Here we get some nice insights of the strategies involved, and the mistakes made by all sides concerned. The letheragy of Ney, Soult, Grouchy and even the Emperor gets some explanation. Mistakes were made in 1815 that had not occured before. The author clearly shows that he was past his prime, and while the desire to conquer was still there, the will to do so was not. Napoleon's attention to detail was not at the same level as in previous campaigns. This might not have mattered before, but against the likes of Wellington, Blucher and Geneseau he could not afford such mistakes. Luck also was against him. Napolean often said a good marshal was a lucky one. This was lacking for him in 1815.The author provides an exciting, if limited description of Waterloo itself. Nothing much new here as the emphasis of this book is elsewhere. Readers will be disappointed in the less detailed military perspective, and tried and true Bonaparte fans will also find much that is not appealing in Alan Schom's portrait of the great man. The main strength of this work stands on its overview of the three month period that comprises his return up to and including the famous battle itself. The characters of the time, the period international politics and the events leading up to the start of the campaign all make for good reading. Schom repeats himself a bit, but that is the nature of the beast when you try to combine social, political and military perspectives all in one volume. Worth reading and good to balance with many other works on the Waterloo campaign."},{"Title":"One Hundred Days: Napoleon's Road to Waterloo","review":"I attacked One Hundred Days like Wellington attacked the French. Unlike a biography I read of Boney years ago, Schom marvelously and succinctly described the background and characters of a constellation of lesser notables who surrounded the Emperor. In doing so he made understandable the mood of France as Napoleon made his spectacular come back attempt before bowing out of European history. This book filled an enormous gap in my understanding of France as a European power and as a nation at the beginning of the 19th century.

He and his publishers have split up his very well received book \`How to Cook Everything' into several separate pieces and is charging for the pieces more than the price of the original book. This volume, \`Vegetarian Cooking' is one of the pieces.The author and the publisher are not trying to hide this fact, although I suspect they will not shed a tear if you buy the book with the impression that this is new material.On the surface, I am sure they will rationalize that they are doing their readers a service by providing parts of this very good book at a lower list price than the whole book. This is pure hokum. The original book is a very good contribution to the genre of \`If you own only one cookbook, this would be it' cookbook. So, why would I want to buy only part of that book? If I want a book on basics, I would do much better to buy Alton Brown's \`I'm Only Here for the Food'. If I want a book on quick cooking, I suspect one of Rachael Ray's books will be better AND cheaper.

If, however, you want to read a romance for grownups, this is your novel. It is the story of Amy Dickerson, a 40 year old auctioneer with some personal issues to resolve--her father, her mother, her failed love life. She becomes involved with two men as the novel progresses and begins to resolve some of those issues. She eventually falls in love.

With two throw-away lovers in her immediate past she is intrigued by Trevor, he of the dark eyes and recently deceased mother whose apartment is crammed with Victoriana. Yet, there is something unsettling about the man who at the last minute decides he cannot part with his mother's belongings.Meanwhile, Amy's widowed mother calls and begs Amy to return to Houston to auction all of her father's possessions, items the older woman can no longer bear to look at. This visit causes Amy to reassess her relationship with her father, a tall , broad shouldered cowman who never understood why she didn't remain with him to run the family cattle business. Not only that but she comes to wonder exactly who she is and what she is meant to do. Is Earth simply a place where everyone owns or is owned?Enter Alain Bouchard, wealthy and exciting Frenchman, who is buying Nichols and Gray and gives every sign that he wishes to obtain Amy as well. He offers her a more than lucrative contract to remain with the auctions house and promises a trip to &quot;his&quot; Paris.Yet, as with Trevor, Amy eventually senses that Alain may not be the perfect lover after all. Once in his apartment she appraises it with a connoisseur's eye and more - she finds a hidden cache that is both provocative and revealing.Robert Olen Butler has created a strong, interesting character with Amy. But she is a woman with whom it is hard to empathize. Her tough, cynical exterior belie the notion that she has a heart to be broken.Nonetheless, Fair Warning is an intriguing peek at the glamorous rich who are propelled by their &quot;shopping pheromones.&quot;"},{"Title":"Fair Warning: A Novel","review":"I first heard of Robert Olen Butler when he won the Pulitzer Prize for A Good Scent from a Strange Mountain. Then I read his book They Whisper and enjoyed it. Then, for some reason, I lost track of him. I didn't read anything else of his until I came across this novel, Fair Warning.The main enjoyment of this novel comes from a character study in the form of its protagonist, Amy Dickerson. She is an auctioneer for a small but prestigious Manhattan auction house. She has a natural ability to read and understand people which makes her very good at her job. She is able to see what people are willing to part with in terms of both money and objects. On the other hand, this ability interferes with her relationships both with her family and her potential lovers. While longing for the ethereal herself, she can only see people's material wants and that includes a person's desire for her. In the end, she must try to see her own desires most clearly and come to peace with them.This is a nice little book. Butler's prose is quite engaging and the book is short enough to be read at a single sitting. Amy and her relationships do make for a fun glimpse into an upper class New York/Paris world. I was tripped up a bit at the end by Alain's neo-Naked Pictures of My Ex-Girlfriends obsession which seemed a bit of a cheap ruse in an otherwise very emotionally realistic novel. Still, it is certainly worth the time."},{"Title":"Fair Warning: A Novel","review":"In this book Butler paints a truly extraordinary picture of a female auctioneer from Texas, working in New York City at the 3rd biggest auction house. She is in fact the star of the house. She has an ability to auction like very few others. And as this is the case, when the auction house decides to sell to a French investor, her continued employment is a significant issue in that purchase.But as usual, Butler takes on the role of a female character for his protagonist. In this impressive and interesting stream of consciousness presentation Butler reveals the innermost mental meanderings of a lady who is in a wonderful position in life, all she has to do is figure out who she wants to marry.As an auctioneer, she is obsessed with collectors and valuation. This predilection would be most natural for a person who does such activity every day of her life. But what she had not thought much about is that people can also be collectors of people and memories. In a sense, all people are collectors of memories. And this concept is highly relevant to her when she is making certain life-impacting decisions.Truly a fine modern novel, it is recommended to all those who are interested in the inner workings of the female mind, as Butler sees it. Since this is often his authorial position and since he has some incredible insight into the workings of the human mind, his book comes as no surprise.The book is recommended for all readers of classic literature, particularly those interested in gender analysis. Once again, this book is a fine offering from Mr. Olen Butler."},{"Title":"Fair Warning: A Novel","review":"I think this is one of those books that will appeal more to women than to men. It is the story of a forty-year-old New York auctioneer who seems to think an awful lot of herself. She has the usual romantic complications, including a banal liaison with a cliched Frenchman, whose &quot;secret,&quot; when we find out what it is, is pretty silly. This is not an offensive book; just not very interesting. There are some lines of dialogue here that will make you roll your eyes and groan."},{"Title":"Fair Warning: A Novel","review":"There are some great passages in this book, and some interesting dialogue between the main characters. Unfortunately the plot doesn't hold up and the conclusion of the book is pretty unsatisfying."},{"Title":"Fair Warning: A Novel","review":"This book has all the smart and sexy charm of New York city. I was so caught up in the atmosphere of this book that at times I felt as if I was the protagonist, Amy Dickerson. Once I started reading I couldn't but it down until I finished. This is definitely a story that will stay with me forever."},{"Title":"Fair Warning: A Novel","review":"&quot;Fair Warning&quot; indeed. That is what the prospective purchaser requires here. This is a very disappointing effort by an author whose previous work I have often found both insightful and enjoyable.This is a book of subjective reflection by a two dimensional main character surrounded by other two dimensional charictatures. What would make a reader care for any of these cardboard cutouts? None are developed to the point where they hold interest, much less engender affection or empathy.If this novel did not appear to hold itself out as a study of interiority and self-reflection -- a devling into the soul of the main character -- perhaps then the lack of depth and nuance would be less irritating. If Butler has decided he now wants to write &quot;romance novels,&quot; then he better add some of the juice of &quot;They Whisper.&quot; If , on the other hand, he wishes to continue to hold the attention of &quot;literary fiction&quot; readers, I suggest a little more meat on the bones of this very boney effort."},{"Title":"Fair Warning: A Novel","review":"Readers will be attracted to Mr. Butler's latest effort after being enchanted by 'A Good Scent from a Strange Mountain.' However, Fair Warning, while not without merit, does not live up to the Pulitzer prize-winning Good Scent/Strange Mountain.The stories in Good Scent/Strange Mountain are told from the perspectives of Vietnamese immigrants, both male and female, living in the United States after the war. Fair Warning is told from the point of view of an attractive, successful young professional woman in modern New York. Neither is the vantage one expects from a white American male. I found this approach astonishing in Good Scent/Strange Mountain, but just entertaining in Fair Warning.The subject of the latter book is the worthy matter of peoples' relationships to objects of possession. This is potentially its most interesting aspect, but is treated too lightly to be completely fulfilling.There are moments of wry humor in Fair Warning, but not quite enough to overcome the lack of originality in the characters. I would recommend Fair Warning only as light reading. It is not for the reader seeking emotionally stimulating, thought-provoking literature."},{"Title":"Fair Warning: A Novel","review":"This book is what I call \\"romance with substance.\\" I appreciate the strong female character (Amy), especially since she's older. She does seem a bit one-sided, but I think that was the author's intention: a woman whose self-worth is wrapped up in her career as an auctioneer. There are other characters I would have liked to get to know better. At times Butler went on and on describing artifacts and I found myself skipping ahead. That (and the many run-on sentences) distracted from the story line. The whole \\"wealth\\" thing isn't really a fascination for me, but the transformation of character IS (e.g., how Amy thinks of herself at the beginning of the book and at the end). The ending was a surprise - no \\"happily ever after\\" - and I liked that."},{"Title":"Fair Warning: A Novel","review":"Of the three Butler books I've read, this is the weakest rendering. The writing, as always, is artistic and nuanced. The characters, as always, are full-blooded and dimensional. What fails to measure up to Butler's talent is the story. We read and expect more -- more resolution, more understanding, more growth. Nonetheless, it bears the stamp of intelligence that we've come to expect from his work and is worth reading."},{"Title":"Fair Warning: A Novel","review":"This is a love story about a professional woman who may have just met the man of her dreams. Amy is an auctioneer, just turned 40, single, and dissatisfied with the relationships she has had with men. In her profession, she deals with collectibles and collectors. To put it bluntly, she manipulates bidders, with greater skill the better she knows them, making objects of them as well. Living in this objectifying environment, a strong part of Amy believes you express yourself through the objects you collect. This isn't the whole Amy, however. What makes the story interesting is the struggle among Amy's different parts to make her an independent, self-defining person and still find love. Enter dark-eyed and romantic strangers.There is one serious problem, however, that costs this book at least one star: the author's use of language. At one point, Amy says, &quot;Isn't language mostly a matter of naming things?&quot; Is Amy speaking for the author here? I thought novelists used language to evoke emotional responses in their readers. Amy narrates this book; her words carry the story. How would you expect a gal born and raised in Texas cattle country, but now a sophisticated New Yorker, to speak and think? Probably not in six-word sentences spliced together by &quot;and&quot; up to a half page long. Yet, that is the style Butler has adopted for Amy. This &quot;no-style&quot; manner of writing has to be deliberate. It can't be laziness, in a writer this experienced. Did Butler make a bet with a friend regarding who could churn out a novel in the quickest time, or was he playing games with his publisher? Is style out of fashion? I don't get it.Read this book for the love story. Amy's dilemma may strike a chord in your life."},{"Title":"Fair Warning: A Novel","review":"Abominable. Stilted dialogue. Sketchy characters, except for the auctioneer herself, who is lame, pretentious, and not remotely likeable. With dueling lovers named &quot;Trevor&quot; and &quot;Alain,&quot; don't expect too much, hoss. Not to mention the cringing cliche of a fairy godfadder, Arthur. And the mean, Lear-like Daddy, provenance: Cormac McCarthy. And, of course, the &quot;M&quot; famiglia, Missy, Molly 'n' darlin' Maggie. A-and da perverted lute or luit, whatever. (Incidentally, this crummy novel either consciously or unconsciously rips off Paul Griner's vastly superior novel &quot;Collectors.&quot; Read that one instead, hoss.)"},{"Title":"Bryan Kest's Long, Slow & Deep: A Complete 90 Minute Yoga Workout (CD & Booklet)","review":"If you don't have a regular yoga practice you will be overwhelmed by this yoga workout. Bryan has you go through some pretty intense poses and if you have tight hamstrings you're in for a powerful experience! I first tried this CD after a particularly stressful workday, and I emerged feeling relaxed, liked I'd washed the tension away. So I recommend it for someone who's all keyed up and would like to chill out. Sometimes doing the &quot;power&quot; yoga vinyasa style all the time isn't what your body needs. But even though you're not doing a zillion chaturangas, this is a challenging workout all the same. It's challenging for your mind - though it's two hours of intense stretching, the time just zips by as you concentrate on your breath. As a final note, there are some poses he goes through that may not be so helpful for folks with tricky knees, particularly as this is a CD and the booklet pictures aren't very clear. Bryan doesn't cue options here, so if you feel like somethings not for you, don't do it."},{"Title":"Bryan Kest's Long, Slow & Deep: A Complete 90 Minute Yoga Workout (CD & Booklet)","review":"This yoga routine is very different from other power yoga routines that Bryan has made. Frankly, it is probably not at all what you would expect if you have done any of his other tapes or CDs; even with the title, Long Slow and Deep, I didn't know exactly what I was getting myself into.Instead of moving through the poses in a hot, sweating fashion (although it seems like I sweat a little from time to time), you simply hold the poses, most of them for no more than two minutes, and a few for just a few moments. Holding some of these poses is INTENSE, especially for the hips, knees, and hamstrings. Bryan admits that you may want to run away from this routine because it is hard to slow down and spend two hours doing it (it is 2 hours long, not 90 minutes, even though the cover says 90 min).I must admit, though, that after doing this routine half-heartedly a few times, I was drawn back to it for some reason and I'm very glad I perservered (I've been doing it several months now). The first few times I did this, I could not even sit up straight in some of the poses, nor did I have the patience or mental quietness to hold them. Frankly, I was very frustrated with myself that I couldn't even sit up straight when he was talking about bending forward! It is NOT easy. Now, though, I make time to do this routine once a week and it is so beneficial for relaxing my muscles, getting my mind calm, and being in the present moment. My flexibility has improved SO much. Of all the routines I have (and I have all of Kest's as well as some others), I look forward to Long, Slow, and Deep more than any other one I do. It is SO rewarding to complete and I enjoy the relaxed feeling I have all over when I am done.Also, one really cool feature of this Kest CD is that he includes an 8 minute rest at the end of it, making it harder to turn your mind to the other things in your life and skip the rest at the end. He also doesn't say anything for about 5 minutes during the rest, which is really nice.I love this routine, but it is not an active one. It takes a quiet mind and a lot of calmness and patience to get into it. Good luck if you take the challenge, and if you do, give it a few tries before you give up because it is worth the effort."},{"Title":"Bryan Kest's Long, Slow & Deep: A Complete 90 Minute Yoga Workout (CD & Booklet)","review":"What a nice change from the same old vinyasa flow that's on so many yoga cds and dvds! Even though the poses themselves aren't very difficult, the challenge comes from the holding. He gives you enough time in each pose to really work with the breath, sink into the pose and go deep inside and stay deep for the whole practice. When it was over, I felt totally stretched out and thoroughly cleansed from the inside out. Although I wish he would have kept the words \\"ass\\" and \\"crotch\\" out of the program, I was so deep into the yoga that it really just washed over me. Other than the coarse language, I like his style because it's different and authentic. I definitely appreciate depth over speed, and that's why I like him. Most power yoga leaves me unsatisfied because we move too fast to get that deep connection, but even in Bryan Kest's power videos, he moves slow enough so you can get the real benefits of yoga. This is definitely one of my favorites."},{"Title":"Bryan Kest's Long, Slow & Deep: A Complete 90 Minute Yoga Workout (CD & Booklet)","review":"I have purchased all of Bryan Kest audio CD's and have taken his classes for years but this is the most challenging and orginal of them all. Holding poses for up to five minutes takes so much more focus than flowing thru a vinyasa flow class. If you really want to challenge your mind and have some variety in your yoga practice buy this CD now. If you can't attend one of Bryan's classes this is the next best thing especially if you travel."},{"Title":"Bryan Kest's Long, Slow & Deep: A Complete 90 Minute Yoga Workout (CD & Booklet)","review":"The principle behind this yoga practice is similar to that of Yin yoga, where you hold poses for five minutes or more to stretch the connective tissue binding your organs and muscles. Connective tissue does not respond to bouncing stretches - only by holding a pose for five minutes or more will you be able to stretch it and get the chi to flow.It's a great alternative workout to all those sun salutations, and can be daunting for beginners, but it is a good place to start as any. My feeling is you don't need to be advanced to do it. If you want more flexibility, you can try it even if you are beginner or intermediate. Just don't over push yourself, stop wherever your limit may be - and don't back out - stay in the pose wherever you may be, and let gravity and your body do the rest. Just persevere and your body will naturally open up in a few months.It's wonderful to have this yoga practice in the CD/DVD market. My only gripe is that since it's supposed to be \\"long, slow and deep\\", I kinda expected it to be \\"long, slow, deep and quiet\\" too. Bryan Kest - however much I adore his yoga lessons - talks too much in this CD. I put up with it in his Power Yoga series because it's more Yang and active and his talking distracts you less there. But here, when you're trying to sink deep into a pose and concentrate on the sensations in your body, his loud and sudden \\"ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh\\"s and \\"ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh\\"s can startle you and get very distracting. Perhaps it's his way of showing empathy with the students, but I found it terribly annoying.Constructive suggestions and encouragement is great and all, but when he starts to ramble, e.g. \\"do this for yourself... for your family, your loved ones, your wife, your child, your husband... your friends, colleagues... do this for the people you're friendly with... or not friendly with... etc etc.\\" (non verbatim), it can drive you up the wall.I only wish he had talked less, and not talked for the sake of filling the silence.If only this CD had an option for pose instructions only. Of course, that said, you could always do the poses yourself using the booklet and without the CD, but there is no one to keep time for you.I gave this 3 stars only because of all the yakking. However, the workout on its own deserves 5 stars. For all those who do not mind all the jibber jabber, by all means, add this to your collection!"},{"Title":"Bryan Kest's Long, Slow & Deep: A Complete 90 Minute Yoga Workout (CD & Booklet)","review":"This is a very challenging and GOOD yoga session. However, the tone he sets is that you're in bootcamp, and to \\"tough it out\\", rather than, \\"release and breathe\\" - the POINT of doing these to begin with. He also grunts and groans in this CD - uh, kinda weird. I have Kest's other Power Yoga videos that I LOVE, among several others that I use, but I did not like this CD. Of course \\"Power\\" Ashtanga style yoga is meant to be vigorous and challenging, but yoga should ALWAYS be SOOTHING to the mind, which this CD is not."},{"Title":"Bryan Kest's Long, Slow & Deep: A Complete 90 Minute Yoga Workout (CD & Booklet)","review":"I was scared to buy this cd after reading other people's reviews. I bought it anyway because I love Brian Kest's previous DVD's. Boy was I glad I did! I love this yoga practice because you don't do any standing poses. You still get a very intense stretch but without all the sun salutations and warrior poses (sometimes I just need a break from them). Be warned--this is 2 hours long. However, you feel like it only took 45 minutes because you feel so good once you get into it. The stretches are intense and for advanced people. There aren't very many backbends or twists but your hamstrings get streched out like never before. I didn't hear any of the \\"offensive\\" terms other users mentioned (did they edit them out in later versions??) and Brian's voice is deep and soothing. If you've only done yoga from DVD's or videos you should try doing it from a CD. You can light a candle and really relax without the glare of the TV set. I highly recommend this CD."},{"Title":"Bryan Kest's Long, Slow & Deep: A Complete 90 Minute Yoga Workout (CD & Booklet)","review":"First a few words about myself to make it easier for you to judge wether my opinion might be helpful to you or not. I'm a Power Yoga Teacher with my own studio in Germany. I own a lot of good Yoga DVDs to use for training and inspiration. Since I'm german my english spelling is pretty bad. Please excuse that!I liked Bryans first DVD Set on Power Yoga a lot. Then I purchased one DVD of his newer series and was very dissapointed. I gave this DVD a pretty bad review here on amazon, for some as I think pretty strong reasons. So I'm not one of the true Bryan Kest Fans who like everything he brings out.This having said I want to state that this CD (as well as his Advanced CD2)is really great. Bravo Bryan! The Flow on the CD is very well rounded. It is not one of the typical fast moving Power Yoga Flows. You wont find many Vinyasas here. This one's about patience and about moving into stillness. It wont make you sweat quite as much but it will challange your calm mind and your elasticity like never before. This truely is an advanced Flow. It's not suitably for those who use Yoga just as a workout.But as another Yoga Teacher ones statet, using Yoga without adressing the mind is like going to wimbledon with a tabletennis rakett. So this workout might be more for intermediate to advanced people, because it goes more into the depth of Yoga.It is a great Flow for those days where you don't want to work so hard on physical strength and cardio but still want to have a strong practice. To me this one is a must have.Bryan talks a lot on this CD but in contrary to the DVD I was talking about in the beginning he does it in a calm and encouraging way. The things he says are really good advice and I like his sence of humor. Some might be distracted by his loud sighs from time to time, but I understand that he is just trying to make his students relax, to show them the right direction. I personally wouldn't do it this way in my class for it isn't my style of teaching, but I think it is very apropriate and it doesn't bother me at all.I hope this was helpfull to you! Let me know.

The List is constantly evolving.Namast&eacute;!Kai"},{"Title":"Bryan Kest's Long, Slow & Deep: A Complete 90 Minute Yoga Workout (CD & Booklet)","review":"This is the first Bryan Kest cd I purchased. It got me hooked!! I now own his Power Yoga, Advanced Yoga, Advanced Yoga 2, and Spinal Strengthening cds. His style is honest, albeit a bit raw and earthy----which I love, but some people are put off by it. He never loses track of what's important---your breathing being free and calm, going to your edge but not beyond it, letting go of your egotistical expectations, recognizing that your body is not the same as anyone else's. I could go on and on, but better for you to check it out yourself. In this cd, you're on the floor throughout---no standing postures. And this cd lives up to its title----he takes you slowly, holds you in postures for a long time, and you go very deep. He says there are 2 schools of thought as to how to go deep----one says you have to heat up, get the body warm so it can open up. The other says you have to have patience so the body can let go and you can go deep. Hence, the long holds. Bring patience to your mat when you put on this cd and have a wonderful experience."},{"Title":"Bryan Kest's Long, Slow & Deep: A Complete 90 Minute Yoga Workout (CD & Booklet)","review":"Like its title suggests, this is a slow but challenging yoga practice that lets you go deep into some difficult poses. I always come out feeling deeply stretched and relaxed, but like many other reviewers I found some of Bryan's talking distracting. His reminders to stay with the breath are excellent, but some of his banter is too over the top, LA for my taste. A nice combination of poses, though, and I can see why he has such a devoted following."},{"Title":"Bryan Kest's Long, Slow & Deep: A Complete 90 Minute Yoga Workout (CD & Booklet)","review":"Upfront - like others have stated this is closer to 2 hours than ninety minutes. I like to do this on a late Sunday afternoon to wind down and prepare for the week ahead. This routine will not burn a whole lot of calories but that is not the intention. It will stretch you and take your flexibility to whole new level. The last pose before the relaxation is worth the price alone. A beginner could do this since camel and plough are the \\"hardiest\\" poses but a beginner probably would not want to do a two hour class. Again, people who like P90X yoga and stretch dvd will probably like this a lot and the hamstrings exercises would be good for people who lift weights. Kest is an acquired taste and people wither like him or think he talks to much but if you like Tony Horton then you probably will not have any problems with Kest."},{"Title":"Bryan Kest's Long, Slow & Deep: A Complete 90 Minute Yoga Workout (CD & Booklet)","review":"I turn to this CD at least once a month and each time I congratulate myself on how much better I survive it each time -- because each time I feel that much better. I do weight-lifting, calesthetics and aerobics 5 times a week and a good thorough stretch like this once a week. It is a beautiful workout -- zen even -- simple, agonizing, effective and just what you came for."},{"Title":"Bryan Kest's Long, Slow & Deep: A Complete 90 Minute Yoga Workout (CD & Booklet)","review":"My first introduction to this routine/practice was when I was living in Bellevue, WA. There is a yoga studio there in Kirkland that had a class taught based on this workout. I took it, thinking it was a slower pace, more calming practice than the power yogas (read: easier and less stressful). After my first class, I literally felt like I had gotten a full body massage. It was amazing. Ever since then I've been hooked. Unfortunately, I moved out of that area and have been looking everywhere for a similar class. Eventually I had to contact that yoga studio in WA to ask if they could refer me to something. They referred me to this, saying this is exactly what I was looking for. I haven't tried this workout just yet (is it really $1300???), but assuming this is what I've been told, then this is an awesome workout. I don't think it's physically challenging so much as it is mentally challenging. If you are like me and need to de-stress and get a great, deep workout without stressing yourself out with fast-paced, screaming workouts, then this is for you. It challenges you to stay in deep poses for several minutes, it challenges you to block the rest of your day out. It is the most satisfying workout routine that I've ever experienced.Not sure if I'll get in trouble for this, but there's a cheaper alternative than what's offered here on Amazon. The over $1000 price is ridiculous- I still can't believe it.

I don't know why I waited so long, except I was not in the right state of mind to use this type of holding asana practice 15 years ago. This CD does consist of some advanced positions, but you can modify if you have knee issues and he tells you most modifications during the practice. There is no music on the practice and initially I thought \\"hey I'll just play something in the background\\" but I don't need too. I never minded Bryan's chattiness so as far as I'm concerned it doesn't need background music. The book is very nice, I was expecting some photocopied pieced together nonquality thing--and it's really nice.

I love the book that comes with the CD with photos of the poses. I like audio yoga better than TV becasue I don't like leaving the poses to look at the TV, change my position to see the TV, etc. There is definitely something to be said for finding that place where you want to run away from sensation and sticking through it anyway. I definitely felt my body's response the next day and it felt good to work differently than I normally do. So Kudo's to Bryan. However, sometimes I find his style a bit annoying and overbearing. He can be condescending and judgemental to the students when they are figeting during the live class the CD comes from. I would rather hear more compassion, I would rather hear more silence (paradox emphasized), I would rather here a softer loving approach rather than an ego driven LA I'm-so-cool-because-I use-words-like ass-crotch-attitude.

I haven't had one bad experience with his dvds and his live classes are awesome. This cd was good for the practice alone but one thing was really annoying. I'll get to that in a minute. I may be partial because I enjoy Bryan's style of yoga more than other types. I was able to attend a handful of his classes in Santa Monica while on holiday a few years back. This is the kind of cd you should put on if you have had previous instruction in a studio and feel comfortable in the asanas to do them safely on your own at home. If you are past that and need to unwind this is the cd for you. It is long and at times intense but you will feel incredible once you finish, even if you don't make it all the way through, you will feel better for the effort and release of tension. I CLEARLY understand the other reviewer on the obnoxious AAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH's I found it a little funny in the beginning in a \\"what the heck was that all about\\" kind of way and the more it occured the more disruptive I found it to be. Maybe he was trying to empathize with the class, and I get that. It wasn't a connection for me, others may not mind it in the least. Different strokes...The practice itself is wonderful!!! Bryan really does a good job of making the class challenging but accessible. The asanas themselves are not \\"pretzely\\" and their sequencing is fabulous, the length of time you hold them is where the challenge comes in. Even if you are a seasoned practioner of Power or traditional Astanga yoga you will be pleasantly surprised at how differently your body will respond to this practice. It is enjoyable and worth every penny. Now if I could just figure out how to erase those annoying \\"AAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHs\\" sprinkled throughout."},{"Title":"Bryan Kest's Long, Slow & Deep: A Complete 90 Minute Yoga Workout (CD & Booklet)","review":"I have attended Bryan's yoga classes for years, but traveling on business every week has made it more difficult to attend.

But I like what he says, and I like to be reminded of certain \\"life truths\\" now and then, because it is so easy for me to get wrapped up and frustrated with the challenges life presents. His reminders ground me, calm me, and really complement the practice (without be too spiritual). I also don't think he was \\"bootcampy\\" as another reviewer mentioned, because he always says you can come out if you need to; rather, he is trying to encourage us to face challenges head-on rather than running away because we are scared or not use to it. After all, you cannot run away from all the challenges of life, right? This is a good time as ever to practice remaining calm.I have been overly stressed for the past...6 months or more, especially over the last few weeks. Today I went over the edge, and needed a major calm-down, de-stress session. I tried this CD for the first time, and although I am certainly not the most \\"advanced\\" yogi, I definitely benefited. HIGHLY recommended for anyone!I do have 2 critiques: First of all, this is definitely not 90 minutes. It is almost 2 hours, which was fine for me, but it is nice to know in advance. Also, while I don't mind Bryan's talking or groaning at all, I didn't like how the microphone was being turned on and off constantly. I kept thinking the CD was broken or stopped suddenly! I am sure I will grow accustomed to it, though, and it is hardly a major issue. :-)"},{"Title":"Bryan Kest's Long, Slow & Deep: A Complete 90 Minute Yoga Workout (CD & Booklet)","review":"it's not his voice that bothers me - it's that even when he's exhorting you to pay attention to what's going on with you, he just never closes his mouth for a moment. And then there's the every now and then sound emission that reminds me of a cow giving birth. It's one thing if it's me doing it in the privacy of my home when I need to or a person in a class nearby- but over a microphone on a CD where you just keep hearing it over and over it really galls. And they seem to be placed in spots where you really might want to pay attention to yourself and not have your attention drawn to him. Actually, that's at the core of my problem with this set - he's got to be the center of your attention and he'll make sure he is. I guess if you really want constant prodding and encouragement, and someone counting down the time remaining in a pose then this won't be a problem for you.If you can get through that, the routine is excellent. You actually can stay in poses for a sufficient length of time. He says it's his hardest class, and I guess if you're not used to relaxing into a pose and just jumping from one to the next to build up a sweat, then it might be very challenging. For me even though I was glad to see a well thought out routine that gave enough time to the poses, I've not been able to get past the over-talking so I won't be using this much.Also - it's a 2 hour routine, not the 90 minutes advertised."},{"Title":"Bryan Kest's Long, Slow & Deep: A Complete 90 Minute Yoga Workout (CD & Booklet)","review":"First off, I liked this Brian Kest workout better than his others (I also have his PowerYoga multi-CD set, which I just might sell) simply because I (1) already have a pretty decent set of yoga DVDs, and (2) because as purely a verbal class, I can take it with me when I travel on business, or need some 'me' time and can therefore use it literally in my backyard or spare room away from the family.I downloaded (almost the entire) program into my Ipod, take my sticky mat and water bottle, and rejuvenate for almost 2 hours. You will need this time, since the exercises flow well. The only step I did not download is the super-intense 10-minute Sitting Forward Bend.One thing that I did learn from this program is that it is important to not force your body into any pose; it will slowly, in its own time, 'flow' into the pose. Very important for those of us who stop and start exercising, and get upset when we have trouble touching our toes.As for his voice...yep, can be annoying, especially all the sighing and growning - however, it may be on purpose since it is a verbal course, and it could be a way to keep you from dosing off."},{"Title":"Bryan Kest's Long, Slow & Deep: A Complete 90 Minute Yoga Workout (CD & Booklet)","review":"I have several Bryan Kest DVDs and audio recordings (MP3s from his website and Long, Slow, Deep from Amazon). You absolutely cannot find a better, more complete workout than what he gives you. If you are into chanting, OM'ing and hitting a gong, forget it. If you want to stretch, get strong, sweat and generally feel awesome then buy his stuff. Personally, I find his language refreshing. He makes it funny. I greatly prefer his description of the poses (yes, even \\"crotch asana\\") to these long Sanskrit names that are hard to remember. He makes yoga totally accessible by describing the poses in detail, in English, so I don't have to make learning Sanskrit part of my practice. It's too bad he isn't greedy, I would love to see this form of yoga franchised out, it's amazing."},{"Title":"Bryan Kest's Long, Slow & Deep: A Complete 90 Minute Yoga Workout (CD & Booklet)","review":"When my acupuncturist suggested I try this CD series, I was skeptical. I loved Bryan's Power Yoga DVDs and wanted something as physically challenging. Also, I didn't like the idea of CDs as opposed to DVDs. Boy, was I wrong! This has become my new favorite workout.First, it's long and challenging, but not in the Power Yoga way - it's mentally tough. On the CD, Bryan even says this is his toughest class. You're holding poses for longer and going deeper. You aren't working up a sweat as much as working deep inside your tissue. I walk away from this nearly two-hour class feeling a-may-zing. Like new.Second, I love just listening to the CD without having to look up at the TV screen. There's a booklet of poses you can reference as you go, and I find that I'm much better able to concentrate when not trying to visually follow along.Yes, his voice and his vocal interludes can be a little intrusive or annoying at times, but the workout, the depth, and the peace achieved are all so darn good, it doesn't matter.I only wish there were a shorter version for when I didn't have the full two hours to give to this, but this CD is well worth the money."},{"Title":"Bryan Kest's Long, Slow & Deep: A Complete 90 Minute Yoga Workout (CD & Booklet)","review":"I received this cd yesterday and started my day with it today. It was most engrossing and immediately created positive change in my body. The time went by quickly and it was hard to believe two hours had gone by. I will definitely improve with repeated use, but even 'out of the box' this session helped unkink many knots and much tension. By the penultimate asana, I was deep in another world.FYI, based on earlier reviews I listened for and did NOT hear any of the comments others were taken aback by.It was an excellent experience and I do recommend it to those looking for an inner-focused journey through their bodies."},{"Title":"Bryan Kest's Long, Slow & Deep: A Complete 90 Minute Yoga Workout (CD & Booklet)","review":"I ordered this CD along with spinal strengthening. I liked the spinal cd better as they are VERY similar. This is a lot of forward bending and some poses that are bad for the knees. As a previous reviewer said, it WILL cook your hamstrings. Be forewarned, Bryan uses sexual imagery, such as \\"crotch candy\\" and crotch asana\\" I found this offense at first, but I block him out. Ultimately, I returned this CD and kept the Spinal one."},{"Title":"Bryan Kest's Long, Slow & Deep: A Complete 90 Minute Yoga Workout (CD & Booklet)","review":"If you have done Bryan's power yoga program, you'll find this workout to be a lot different, in a very good way. It is an audio workout and you have to follow the book for the poses until you've done the workout a few time.This workout is all-engrossing, 90+ minutes that fly by so quickly. It is particularly good for my very tight back, shoulders and neck. I emerge from this workout feeling so completely energized and relaxed.Though I love Kest's power yoga workouts, sometimes it's too strenuous after a long day at work. This workout gives that much needed \\"down time\\".One note, I tried to do this workout on a Friday and then again on the following Sunday and it was just too much too soon. My hamstrings had not yet recovered from Friday's workout. This is a good once a week workout.I notice I am walking and standing taller, more like that of a professional dancer than someone who crunches up to a computer screen all day.My only complaint about this is the fact that it's not a visual DVD. For the price it should be. Come on Bryan, make some more DVD workouts. In this day and age, a cd with a book workout is obsolete."},{"Title":"The Vampire: His Kith and Kin- Origins of the Vampire / Generation of the Vampire / Traits and Practice of Vampirism / The Vampire in Ancient Civilization / The Vampire in Literature","review":"The Vampire: His Kith and Kin by Montague SummersIn 1973, I received a document on Prince Vlad III Dracula, also known as Vlad Tepes or Vlad the Impaler. I was later able to translate the 18th century document and turned it into a graduate research paper. It was in that same year that I re-read Bram Stoker's Dracula for the third time.Like Sherlock Holmes, Dracula has remained a personal classic. It was therefore a passion of mine to spend many hours in the graduate stacks at the University of Mississippi reading books on vampires and werewolves. I found the folklore and history of such mythological creatures to be an \\"academic\\" pursuit while I spent my first year as an EDPA Graduate Fellow working on a history degree. Although I later transferred to educational history, I was fortunate enough to discover Montague Summers. Summers has, according to most historians and folklorists, remained the leading authority on vampires, werewolves and demons. Perhaps the two most important books written on vampires, during the 20th century were The Vampire: His Kith and Kin (1928) and The Vampire in Europe (1929).To understand these exceptional works, one must first understand the author. Perhaps no one in the current century is better able to describe Summers than Nigel Suckling:\\"Alphonsus Joseph-Mary Augustus Montague Summers (1880-1948) was a fascinating character in himself. Throughout his life he was described by acquaintances as kind, courteous, generous and outrageously witty; but those who knew him well sensed an underlying discomfort and mystery. In appearance he was plump, round cheeked and generally smiling. His dress resembled that of an eighteenth century cleric ... He wore sweeping black capes crowned by a curious hairstyle of his own devising which led many to assume he wore a wig. His voice was high pitched, comical and often in complete contrast to the macabre tales he was in the habit of spouting. Throughout his life he astonished people with his knowledge of esoteric and unsettling occult lore. Many people later described him as the most extraordinary person they had known in their lives.\\"Summers two books on vampires have remained my personal favorites. Although I currently possess over 70 books on vampires and werewolves (i.e. histories, folklores, psychological studies and sociological ramifications), the extensive footnoting and citations by Summers places his works far above anything written since. Summers believed in the existence of vampires. It is this belief that made the reading of his books worthwhile. It is also well worth the time and effort needed to translate all of the sources that Summers utilized in his massive works.Dr. Carl Edwin LindgrenProfessor of Military and Medieval HistoryMember, Royal Historical Society (University of London)"},{"Title":"The Vampire: His Kith and Kin- Origins of the Vampire / Generation of the Vampire / Traits and Practice of Vampirism / The Vampire in Ancient Civilization / The Vampire in Literature","review":"I will send a picture or send a video of it, on this days,I havent finished reading it as soon as i finished i will send more info.

The content of this book is neither accurate nor complete, doesn't cover the major additions to Excel 2003 and appears to have been updated solely by a new author unknown in the Excel developer community.If I want support, I'll ask my questions in the Excel newsgroups, where I'm confident they'll be answered by someone who actually knows Excel and uses it daily.I've had the 2002 version of this book sitting on my desk for a year or so and I find myself regularly refering to it. For me, the first half of the book containing the narrative about VBA is the best bit and much more useful than the object model listing in the appendices. When I read (on Amazon.co.uk) that the appendices were now downloadable and had been replaced by more than 400 pages of new material, I immediately ordered this update. I was expecting lots more of the same information-packed writing I'd enjoyed in the 2002 version, covering the topics mentioned above, such as &#34;Object-oreinted theory and VBA&#34;, &#34;How to use VB6 and VB.NET&#34; and &#34;Advanced error handling and debugging methods&#34;. All great stuff!Unfortunately, NONE of that is actually in the book! The object model appendices have NOT been removed, are NOT downloadable or searchable and have NOT been replaced by new material! I can only think that the 'Editorial Reviews' on this page were written from an initial outline that the authors didn't deliver.Already disappointed by it not matching the sales patter, I began to read the book, only to find that the four authors of the 2002 version (Bovey, Bullen, Green and Rosenberg) didn't actually contribute to this update! The new author, Kimmel, seems to have done the update by himself - and it shows!As far as I can see, there are three new chapters. The first is a totally impenetrable and theoretical one about Objects, interfaces, polymorphism, inheritance and lots of other jibberish - with nothing relating that to VBA or how we might use it. The second is a basic chapter about debugging and testing (certainly not the &#34;Advanced debugging and error handling techniques&#34; promised). The other new chapter is about XML, which mostly repeats the old material in the &#34;Excel and the Internet&#34; chapter, says that Excel 2003 and can now open and save xml files (with File &#62; Open), but completely omits anything about mapping XML elements to cells using the new 'XML Source' task pane! Those three chapters have been added without increasing the page count much, so the rest of the chapters have been 'edited' to make room - often by deleting those little bits of information essential to applying the concepts to our own code. His edits also included removing all the variable naming conventions from the example code!Kimmel has also restructured the book, so instead of the 'gradual increase in complexity' approach of the 2002 version, he's put all the 'theoretical' chapters up front - so we learn about writing userforms, database access, the windows API etc before we learn how to open a workbook or select a range! I can only think that C. Walker's review was about the 2002 version, because his comment of &#34;with every chapter the level of learning increases&#34; certainly doesn't apply in my opinion.The biggest problem with this edition, though, is that Kimmel obviously knows nothing about Excel. There are so many errors, inaccuracies and incompleteness that I'm amazed it passed the editing stage. Surely anyone can spot the error in his tip of closing addins from the Immediate window using the command:AddinWorkbooks(&#34;TheAddin.xls&#34;).CloseI guess he didn't know whether to use the Addins or Workbooks collections, so used both! And wouldn't that be an 'xla' extension?Bottom line: Do NOT buy this book. If you have the 2002 version, there's nothing extra worth having, and lots of new errors to stumble over. If you don't have the 2002 version, buy that version instead of this. Everything in it applies equally to Excel 2003, and the biggest new additions in Excel 2003 (XML Mapping and the VB.NET integration) aren't mentioned in this version anyway.And if you're like me and want to read more from the original four authors, a new book by them has just appeared on Amazon.com - Professional Excel Development - due out in February.

Essential introductory topics are sprinkled throughout the book seemingly randomly. Much of the writing is horribly ambiguous or just plain unreadable. I am a beginning programmer, though I am highly proficient with Excel. I was lucky to be familiar with some other programming languages because the explanations of object-oriented programming concepts in this book (as well as other topics covered) would have been completely incomprehensible without a moderate level of background experience. The examples in the book are neither practical, nor particularly well designed to illustrate the VBA concepts that the authors are trying to teach. Instead, the authors seem to be preoccupied with designing examples to convey stylistic programming conventions that they personally favor."},{"Title":"Excel 2003 VBA Programmer's Reference (Programmer to Programmer)","review":"This huge (1176 page) book is intended for Excel users and programmers from beginning to advanced, this book presumes you have a reasonable working knowledge of excel and a full installation of the software. It does not presume that you have a working knowledge of VBA, after all, that's it's subject.In fact, chapter 1 is titled Primer in Excel VBA. Excel VBA is, of course, a specialized version of Microsoft's standard VBA, where those specific points that cater to spread sheet manipulation are differrent from the VBA's associated with other parts of the Microsoft Office package.This book gives a general introduction to VBA, but it is entirely within the context of Excel. This is indeed a Primer. It starts with how you open the Visual Basic Editor and goes on from there. Generally the book grows step by step. But not always. ==On page 83 it says: \\"OnTime - You can use the OnTime method to schedule a macro to run sometime in the future.\\" OK, I understand this. But only 7 pages later it says: \\"VBA does support interface polymorphism. Interface polymorphism is orthogonal to class polymorphism.\\" Huh? Does this help me schedule something to run in the future? Is this supposed to mean anything at all to me? Since I have no idea what it's talking about am I supposed to go look up all these new words somewhere? Is this really going to help me? Anyway, you skip a few chapters and you're back into getting some useful information about things like creating user forms.All in all I rate the book quite high.

Either skip the basic concepts or include them, but don't introduce a little in chapter 10, a little more in chapter 19, and a little more in chapter 24. This is especially inexcusable because the authors used earlier chapters to show off some irrelevant, incomprehensible class modules and debugging code.The back cover and the description given above are inaccurate: there is no mention of VB.NET in this text. This is documented in the errata and it is shamefully fraudulent that the Amazon product description repeats this error.The errata available from the publisher doesn't begin to scratch the surface of all the coding errors in this book. I estimate that 25% of the code examples are just plain wrong. Sometimes these mistakes could be editorial in nature (eg. using \\"Chart\\" instead of \\"ChartObject\\") but in several cases, the code example has NOTHING to do with the topic being discussed in the text.

The first audacious volume chronicled the rise of a new global order based on a network of information flows. Since Castells views the human species as essentially predatory, some remedial measures are needed to resist the injustices that will arise. This second volume is therefore prescriptive. A masterly presentation of the world's current social movements follows. The author's discussion of the affect of the internet on political action and political campaigns is especially useful. Despite the volatile subject matter, I thought that Castells never quite sacrificed his objectivity although a delicate balancing act does take place throughout the volume. This book and the previous one sometimes read like some great epic of science fiction but it is our own very real world in the 21st century that the author is discussing. As an introduction to our brave new planet, this book could hardly be bettered."},{"Title":"The Power of Identity (Information Age/Manuel Castells, Vol 2) (v. 2)","review":"This is the second volume of 'Information Age'. This volume deals with how the social movement has changed through internet and globalization.The public sphere is where social movement projects itself. The internet has had great impact on the public sphere with its global reach. We's witnessed that kind of potential on the some handful of anti-globalization protest in recent years.But what has changed is not only the way of protest. According to Touraine's typology, a social movement is defined by three principles: the movement's identity; its adversary; its vision or social model. Globalization transformed the identity of social movement. Zapatistas and recent environmental movements are the graphic examples. Now adversary is not confined to local government, but the government representing the interests of global agencies like TNCs. They oppose their specific identity and the well-being of society against the global adversary. The impact of these movements comes from their media presence and from their effective use of IT. Castells argues that the ability or inability of the state to cope with these challenges will largely condition the future of society in the 21st century."},{"Title":"The Power of Identity (Information Age/Manuel Castells, Vol 2) (v. 2)","review":"The second book of already classic Castells' trilogy The Information Age, in which the author attempts to reveal structural similarities between various contemporary social movements opposing dominant socioeconomic order. Obviously inspired by Marxist's search for the subject of historical change, Castells tries to infer from these similarities what are necessary prerequisites for the rise of a successful global movement with a positive (constructive) program of social change - change that would remove at least the most serious inequalities and injustice that stem from capitalist logic of today's globalized world. Even if partly unsuccessful in its goal, this book represents very valuable source of sociologically, economically and historically relevant up-to-date (2004) information about contemporary resisting collective identities and their strategies - varying from feminists, Zapata and green movement to Al-Qaeda and Aum Shinrikyo. Castells is successful - although mostly in simplified form - in connecting development of selected collective identities with crisis of modern state, rise of network logic of social organization, development in the mass-media system, and globalization of national economies. This book represents essential reading for all social scientists who are interested in related problems.

Unlike the acting editions, this publication contains the plays in their original condition, no lines changed or stage managers' blocking cues, just the good stuff. Kaufman & Hart's comedies not only stand alone as the greatest American comedic plays, but also as universal works adaptable to a modern stage. They created characters, and wrote lines that showcase biting wit, physical comedy, and plenty of unforgettable one-liners--a mixture that has something for everyone, and everything for many. You don't have to agree with me that Kaufman & Hart were/are America's greatest comedic playwrights (not to mention their other areas of theatrical expertise), but you should definitely give them a chance to convince you themselves.

However it has subsequently been considered a classic, consistently on high school and college reading lists. It's not an easy read, but not difficult, though some passages about whaling are frankly boring to most of us. The story is enveloped in mystery and foreshadowing and is many layered. It centers on the overwhelming obsession of Captain Ahab to hunt down the great white whale that tore off his leg on his last voyage.Despite the sense of doom there is humor in spots and a terrific tale of the sea with metaphysical implications. Melville based the ending on an actual whaling event documented in the book \\"In the Heart of the Sea\\" a few years ago.This is an excellent edition, leather bound with quality paper and large, appropriately styled print.

Haldane's \\"The Insurrection in Mesopotamia 1920\\", recently reprinted, is proof that warfare in the Middle East changes very little.Haldane commanded some 60,000 British troops, 23,000 Indian troops and another 60,000 support personnel and camp followers at the height of British operations to suppress the Iraqi insurgency of 1920. Facing the British were more than 130,000 insurgents.The British were unprepared for the Iraqi uprising, which began in late May and spread quickly. However, massively reinforced, Haldane and his troops were able to regain the upper hand and defeat the insurgents by the end of the year.Some of the lessons learned include:- Commanders inexperienced with the region (India and Iraq) were unable to act effectively and in a timely manner due to their inability to weigh the value of intelligence and their ignorance of their enemy and the resources of the country;- The availability and quick movement of reinforcements from outside Iraq was critical to the British victory over their insurgents. The British reinforced their forces in Iraq with some 20 battalions, allowing them to conduct concurrent operations throughout the country;- Led by Turkish officers, the Iraqis were able to initially mass large numbers to overwhelm smaller British columns, usually by enveloping both flanks;- The insurgents also targetted key infrastructure, especially bridges, in an attempt to restrict the movement of British forces;- A combination of stationary troops, operating from blockhouses, and mobile columns allowed the British to eventually defend key facilities, while launching offensive operations throughout the country to first defeat and then punish the insurgents;- The rapid movement of British troops along railways and waterways was cruicial to the British victory;- In the Arab world, no news is good news as bad news tends to travel fast. \\"For evil news rides post,\\" writes Haldane, while good news baits.\\"- Following the defeat of the insurgents, British columns moved throughout the country to disarm the insurgents in a series of punitive expeditions. Only after they had been disarmed did peace return to Iraq;- The holy cities of Najaf and Karbala were the first cities dealt with and required the enforcement of a strict blockade and the presence of a large number of troops to bring under control;- Iraqi levies - consisting of Police and Striking Forces - played an important role in quelling the insurgency. However, the British quickly realized that these troops required better training and equipment. And the insurgents learned quickly to target these troops and their families.There is, thus, still a great deal to be learned from British operations in Iraq during the 1920 insurrection."},{"Title":"The insurrection in Mesopotamia, 1920,","review":"Having served recently in the US Army in Iraq and having studied this book, I say, simply, if you're planning on leading troops in Iraq, you should read this book."},{"Title":"Twenty-Seven Props for a Production of Eine Lebenszeit (Grove Press Poetry)","review":"I can honestly say that Twenty-Seven Props is one of the worst books, poetry or otherwise that I have read in a long time.

There is no variety of concerns, and a notable lack of elegance or even real meaning. This is apparently the product of an arrogant but misguided poet striving to be ambitious and different, but what we really have here is more of the status quo, rendered in a syrupy style that is sickening after a while.

Specifically, the slam poets, the performance poets, and those on the opposite end of the spectrum who haven't yet figured out that rhythm is still an essential component of free verse.Richard Howard, in his brief but effusive introduction to the book, seems focused on the fact that most of the poems in this book are not, to the unschooled eye, really about much of anything: \\"I am perfectly well aware,\\" Howard opines, \\"that the first (and probably last) question that will be asked is 'What's it all about-- what's he saying?'\\" As I have said repeatedly, folks, if that's the first question you ask when you read a poem, go to whatever school taught you poetry and demand a refund. It's the wrong question by a mile. The first thing you should be asking yourself after reading a poem is \\"how does it sound?\\"In the case of Timothy Donnelly, the answer is, for every one of these poems, \\"fantastic.\\" Donnelly may be a young poet publishing his first (as far as I can tell, anyway) book, but he's obviously already paid his poetic dues. He is a master of aggressively free verse, but free verse which uses with a surgeon's precision both rhythm and internal rhyme. This is poetry that is truly a joy to read aloud.\\"See before him compost, a mound of it, the moistrot monitored with heart.

Any reader will be stunned at the formal and linguistic play of these poems. I cannot recall another recent book that has so altered my perception of what is possible in a poem. Donnelly writes about a workshop for poetry dioramas, creating an appendix for an imaginary play, and in one poems includes all of the following: a dachshund named Hephaestus, hot diggity, a gazebo, Little Gidding, Marblehead, and Colonel John Glover of The 14th Mass. These poems are full of voices beautiful and sad, encouraging the reader to grow more strange."},{"Title":"Twenty-Seven Props for a Production of Eine Lebenszeit (Grove Press Poetry)","review":"Donnelly's poems are infused with energy and ideas that are exhilarating and, at times, heartbreaking. The title poem, which takes place inside an imaginary stage set, starts out innocently enough (as many in this volume), but the speaker, and the reader, is slowly seduced, horrified and delighted by his own mind's ability to turn language and life into a nightmare both beautiful and strange. All of this is accomplished with astonishing skill and ease. This book breathes some life back into the overcrowded and increasingly sterile American poetry scene.But his greatest asset is his voice: wild, expansive, exhilarating yet carefully wrought. A great book to get you re-excited about contemporary poetry and re-thinking the world around you."},{"Title":"Twenty-Seven Props for a Production of Eine Lebenszeit (Grove Press Poetry)","review":"If you believe that art is an execution of craft and genius in combination, and you put equal premium of both aspects-- or on the balance between them-- this book will delight and hearten you. It is fiercely smart and polished, and its observations about emotion both exult and score deeply. There are priceless, pointed moments of humor. The author has a clear fluency in poetics and language beyond the contemporary; his startling originality is rooted there, in how he breaks and borrows from form, and imports words and objects out of the broad universe to which only astute, devoted, diligent, and actually talented poets have access. And while there isn't a sloppy choice made in these lines, neither is this universe an entirely exalted one; this book draws from TV-bright dailog and commerical trappings as adeptly as from Latin, Blake, and horticulture. Donnelly works with sophisticated tools of evocation, provocation, and rendering because he has substantial ideas to express. Here there is a symmetry to the means and the stuff; they demand one another, they make demands of one another. This is a rigorous, classical measure of art. This book will restore your expectations of poetry and sets a standard for rigor and depth in contemporary work."},{"Title":"Twenty-Seven Props for a Production of Eine Lebenszeit (Grove Press Poetry)","review":"A friend recommended this book to me.

I'm not 52 or even half that but I'd still like to categorize myself as a \\"serious reader\\" if I may & from where I'm sitting this book is the real deal. 27 Props = the most happening & eye-opening poetry collection I've read in a pathetically long time, kids. When you read it you end up reading it out loud. Or you want to be writing & to me that's the sign of something real. I guess it must be a good sign too that people seem to love it or hate it. But I don't know what kind of dud could hate the likes of Sonata Ex Machina or From a Further Meaning Faded or The Driver of the Car is Unconscious or the first poem or even the last poem, take your pick.

That's what I'm saying."},{"Title":"Twenty-Seven Props for a Production of Eine Lebenszeit (Grove Press Poetry)","review":"As close to perfect as a book of poetry, circa now, could be. The poems in this collection come on like a wall of sound... Sense comes up, falls back, and then reappears out of an unexpected direction. That's the way it's supposed to be. It'll make you gasp with delight and awe. You can't do better than Donnelly's first book... Try out, for example, the title poem. Read \\"Sonata ex Machina\\" aloud. You won't be disappointed. Don't listen to the jealous and/or deeply troubled critics on here. It's impossible not to expect big things from this young poet."},{"Title":"Twenty-Seven Props for a Production of Eine Lebenszeit (Grove Press Poetry)","review":"It's very interesting how almost every bad review of this book is an ad hominem attack: that is, the reviews either accuse the poet directly of being some kind of a faker, or trying to pull something over on us; or else they insinuate that his \\"clever\\" style is somehow a direct attack on the reader. And all those reviews sound a lot alike, as if they were written by the same kind of person, someone who is bitter and confused about how Donnelly's poetry could ever have been published (as opposed to theirs).The explanation is simple. These poems are deeply searching, sometimes crazed, often neurotic (in the sense of returning over and over to the same themes, images, even lines, as in \\"Sonata Ex Machina\\" or \\"The Driver of the Car ...\\"), and very brilliantly composed. And often beautiful. They certainly are unlike almost anything being written today, which makes the vitriolic accusations of the fix being somehow in even more mystifying. At worst, you could say that Grove published a book that tries and fails, which seems in artistic terms to be something worth praising ... at least the book doesn't just sound like everything else.These poems attempt to mean (and succeed) in unexpected, harrowing, and brilliant ways. They are difficult and tonally strained precisely because the poet is attempting to confront the deepest existential issues, and not just using a lame period style to cover up the fact that there's nothing of import being faced in the poems. And they are avatars of negative capability, something we could always use more of in literature.Take a look at this book. It's something important, and something new. Again, at worst you could say, well, the poet made an honest effort and tied himself in knots more often than, well, not; but I don't think that's what you'll feel, if you approach the book with an open heart and a ready mind, and not with the bitterness of a professional resenter."},{"Title":"Twenty-Seven Props for a Production of Eine Lebenszeit (Grove Press Poetry)","review":"I have never read a book that knocked me out like this, I was surprised.

I have to admit I was skeptical when my friend recommended this book to me, I don't usually read this kind of poetry, but I have been won over and happily so."},{"Title":"Twenty-Seven Props for a Production of Eine Lebenszeit (Grove Press Poetry)","review":"This book is fun. It is satisfying both on the level of entertainment and on the level of real-deal literature. It can be sorrowful and confusing and unusual and wacky and wild and even funny. All of this makes for a great and varied read. It is also fun to read out loud. I would love to see the poet read from his work someday. Donnelly is a master of language, in my opinion. Some of the poems are just breathtaking, like Marblehead, Anything to Fill in the Long Silences, Driver of the Car is Unconscious and even the quieter ones are great such as Kneeling Man with Cane on Construction. I would highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Twenty-Seven Props for a Production of Eine Lebenszeit (Grove Press Poetry)","review":"that when I read this book, my first reaction was: \\"There is REALLY no point in finishing my own manuscript.\\" Timothy Donnelly has written the book that I wanted to write, and has written it BETTER than I ever could have written it. To the reader who wrote that this book has no rhythm: get real. How many times do I have to sift through poems about somebody's butterfly garden or their kitchen love affair, before the God of Poetry shats out somebody like Timothy Donnelly to wake me up? How many times can I read \\"experimental\\" poems by the lit journal clicky cliques that are so pointless and tedious that I would have better luck removing my own pancreas with my teeth then get through one of their poems, before a Timothy Donnelly arrives, snuggled in with my nutmeat? And you have to hear him read -- go to \\"Live From Prairie Lights\\" and look him up. 27 Props, to which I am giving a well-deserved five stars, turns both experimental AND modern poetry on their heads and gives them the \\"what for,\\" as well. And BTW, I loved the observation by one of the reviewers that \\"this book is fast and fun like a Sunday drive with a guy who talks fast about fun stuff.\\" Damn right. And if you're in the Pac NW with a Turkish Royal in one hand and some binocs in the other, all the better."},{"Title":"Twenty-Seven Props for a Production of Eine Lebenszeit (Grove Press Poetry)","review":"After reading this collection, I wondered what made this poet tick, and, why would anyone care about what he is writing about. While I don't spend much time with Modern poetry, I didn't find the book challenging, difficult, edgy or clever. To this reader's mind, it is insubstantial and aimless, a display of ambition and dabbling in experimental verse, with no climactic payoff or deep meaning. So as not to make it a total waste of money, I gave away my copy to a co-worker, who flipped through and returned it right back to me. There are many ways to describe this book, but I would have to say that &quot;worth while&quot; isn't one of them, unless anyone would want to spend som time wading through this circumlocutory swamp."},{"Title":"Twenty-Seven Props for a Production of Eine Lebenszeit (Grove Press Poetry)","review":"This book seems to engender rather extreme responses.I really liked this book - it is well crafted and unique and intelligent and suprising and I will probably pick it up often.There are some exciting things happening with new poets these days and we should encourage all kinds of writing."},{"Title":"Twenty-Seven Props for a Production of Eine Lebenszeit (Grove Press Poetry)","review":"Clunkiness abounds in this debut collection, which is about as deep as a dinner plate, and as memorable. Looking for some good emerging poets to add to your repertoire? There are lots of choices out there in poetryland, if you want great experimental verse that is bold and risk taking and changes your notion of what poetry is all about. This poet uses phrases that are downright embarrassing, so much so that you will find yourself suppresing giggles, and his so-called poetic language is contrived and strained for, not clever. While some powerful moments occur, they are outnumbered by moments of shrillness. I kept thinking of the loud, insistent wail of an infant as I read this."},{"Title":"Twenty-Seven Props for a Production of Eine Lebenszeit (Grove Press Poetry)","review":"As is the case with so many emerging and younger poets' work, this debut suffers badly from a grating tendency toward cleverness, rather than having a genuine range of feeling. As such, it is uninteresting and uninspiring."},{"Title":"Twenty-Seven Props for a Production of Eine Lebenszeit (Grove Press Poetry)","review":"27 Props is a clumsy book that gets on your nerves after spending time with more than a few poems, as the best are in the beginning. It is a cacaphonous collection that contains too many rambling poems, lacking in music and rhythm. What rhythm there is was strained for in an obvious way, that seems contrived and self conscious. Although I like challenging poets, and Wallace Stevens is my favorite, I look for talent, depth, and mystery behind the complexity to derive a satisfying read. 27 Props comes up short, though is probably about average in what you find in today's poetry. NOT RECOMMENDED by this reader."},{"Title":"Twenty-Seven Props for a Production of Eine Lebenszeit (Grove Press Poetry)","review":"What can you say about lines like \\"no brackish suck to sea\\" or something about a reddening to pass through the\\"pores of my face and willful to sicken\\" except they are silly as can be? Or else, go to your dermatologist. These arent just silly but are for the most part, just plain godawful. They seem to be interior dramas that are not compelling to the general reader, making you wonder if even the poet himself knows what on earth he is talking about. My guess is, probably not. If you enjoy experimental poetry, this book is hardly the best place to read it."},{"Title":"Twenty-Seven Props for a Production of Eine Lebenszeit (Grove Press Poetry)","review":"It's a good sign when so many, and especially so many heated, reviews and opinions crop up for a new book of poetry (although, one could do without the personal attacks and unintelligent yellings).

Congratulations to the author. There are many poems in here that I will probably never tire of reading. They create a complex psychological and mental atmosphere that doesn't resemble most other contemporary poetry. At times they're surreal and over the top with the &quot;wall of sound&quot; effect but at other times they're quiet and humble, you get the whole picture. The feeling is more like a wild movie or a great CD. This book has really changed my expectations of what can be done in a poetry collection. I look forward to more from this author."},{"Title":"Twenty-Seven Props for a Production of Eine Lebenszeit (Grove Press Poetry)","review":"What I liked in Twenty Seven Props for a Production of Eine Lebenszeit is the sometimes laugh-out-loud humor. That's about it. Irony is hardly an original device, and it happens to be an overused device. Also, it has been done much better by far more gifted poetic masters, young and old, so the humor/irony aspect can only go so far here. On a scale of one to ten, this one deserves a low score because it doesn't offer anything beyond some cleverness and the aforementioned irony."},{"Title":"Twenty-Seven Props for a Production of Eine Lebenszeit (Grove Press Poetry)","review":"Twenty-seven Props for a Production of Eine Lebenszeit is an extraordinary book that should establish Timothy Donnelly as the leading poet of his generation. It is easily the most impressive collection of poems I've read in recent years. Donnelly's brilliance is apparent throughout. His rhymes and rhythms are intoxicating and impeccable, each line engaging, each poem a welcome challenge. In contrast to the bland repetition and dull uninventiveness that characterizes so much of contemporary poetry, Twenty-seven Props is innovative and unique and doesn't lend itself to comparison. The voice, technique, wit and verbal dexterity are distinctly Donnelly's. The poems are at times humorous, at times heartbreaking, always imaginative and tempered with the unexpected. The poems defy categorization and exist in their own realm, encompassing all that is strange and intriguing and wonderful in verse. The book is endlessly fascinating and seamlessly crafted with poems that invite and reward rereading. Each poem in the collection is remarkably beautiful; to experience Donnelly's work is to move among the numinous. Donnelly's erudition is unmistakable and his talent with language is astonishing. Anyone who wants to be amazed should buy this book and experience the effect of Donnelly's exceptional poetry. Throughout the book are stunning lines like \\"loss makes us us again, but in the image of a hunger / that we can't call back or contemplate or kill. We are that we are dead.\\" There is nothing better being written. These poems are more substantial, of a higher caliber and a different world altogether than the work of other poets. For all those disillusioned with the quality of contemporary poetry, Twenty-seven Props for a Production of Eine Lebenszeit will remind you what it means to be amazed. I love the book and have the utmost admiration for the poet. I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves poetry. To those readers who hesitate: in the very least, this book will remind you why you love to read."},{"Title":"Twenty-Seven Props for a Production of Eine Lebenszeit (Grove Press Poetry)","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed Donnelly's first book of poetry. I usually don't read contemporary poetry, but the book came highly recommended and surpassed my expectations. He challenged me to read on a more intellectual level; his irony and humor consistantly present and welcoming to the reader. The poems are difficult without being unintelligible; humorous without being obnoxious; they pay heed to their predecessors without being overshadowed by the past. These are poems of wit, innovation, and beauty -- the final product is staggering. I would recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Twenty-Seven Props for a Production of Eine Lebenszeit (Grove Press Poetry)","review":"It is not meant to be \\"experimental poetry\\" These poems contain infinite depth of content and intent. As for being \\"pretentious\\" and \\"indecipherable -- not true, though the book does make a intellectual demands from its reader. For those who complain that the book is melodramatic and shrill, do yourself a favor and investigate irony's underbelly before passing judgement on 27 Props. Develope a proactive way of reading poetry. For the reader willing to invest time and effort, this book will blow your mind. For the reader looking for an easily accessable/formulaic/intro to poetry/roses are red, violets are blue kind of read, this is not the book for you. However, if you enjoy a challenging, rewarding, imaginative and thought-provoking read -- and, for that matter, you do actually know how to read -- you will love this book. The language is gorgeous. The book is brilliant. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."},{"Title":"Twenty-Seven Props for a Production of Eine Lebenszeit (Grove Press Poetry)","review":"i tried to get inside these poems, but the immaturity and shallowness didn't prove satisfying. the book notes that the poet is a student and it shows. while the vision is cohesive it is not interesting, and maybe better worked out in therapy than on the page."},{"Title":"Twenty-Seven Props for a Production of Eine Lebenszeit (Grove Press Poetry)","review":"The ambition far outweighs the accomplishment in this book, and the level of self-involvement is such that any intelligent, thoughtful and mature reader will be highly turned off almost immediately."},{"Title":"Twenty-Seven Props for a Production of Eine Lebenszeit (Grove Press Poetry)","review":"It's early, but I'm confident that this book is going to be one of the best poetry releases of the year.

This isn't a watered down guide from a massive multi-national publisher: it is the real skinny on what to see and do in the Virgin Islands from a seasoned traveler and writer with an eye for details and interesting facts and a passion for his subject. Explore the Virgin Islands covers the U.S. (St. Croix, St. John and St. Thomas plus Water and Hassel Islands) and British Virgins (Tortola, Virgin Gorda, Jost Van Dyke, Anegada and more) in breadth and detail, with a keen eye on the history and ecology of one of the Caribbean's most beautiful areas.The book's introduction demonstrates Pariser's true interest in the region and its environment. Pariser includes a ton of great background information, as well as anecdotes about the history of the Virgin Islands old (the Carib Indians, Slavery) and new (Senator Adelbert Bryan). There is also an expanded section on the flora and fauna of the Virgin Islands, its animal life, and of course the many coral reefs. He sends his readers on vacation with the knowledge and appreciation to fully enjoy the complexities and beauties of the Virgin Islands.Explore the Virgin Islands is a handsome, softbound volume with a stunning cover photo. It's filled with numerous detailed maps, color and black and white photographs, and helpful charts and sidebars (more than one hundred) with diverse information ranging from Anegada's pink flamingos to Blackbeard the Pirate. Indeed, it's Pariser's mix of island history and folklore with complete travel nuts and bolts that make this book both interesting and useful.Vacationers will find everything here they need on the practicalities of planning their trip - where to stay, what to eat, and the best things to do. Each island's most popular attractions are given ample space. For example, on St. John the hiking trails and the U.S.V. I. National Park are fully explored, while St. Croix's diving gets the spotlight, with lots of information on dive sites and shops. All of this is presented with relevant phone numbers, website and email addresses, locations, opening times and more.As part-time Virgin Islands residents we are familiar with most of the travel guides to the area, and this book is clearly our favorite. It contains a great mix of information attractively presented, with the entertaining sections on the history and natural wonders of the Virgin Islands, both above and below the water, complimented and balanced by the practical advice that any traveler would need. It is an indispensable tool for your pre-trip planning. But, once you are here, you will find yourself picking it up for a restaurant phone number, to check for what you might see while snorkeling, or to find out the name of an interesting building you saw while walking in any one of the islands' towns during the afternoon."},{"Title":"Explore the Virgin Islands (Sixth Edition)","review":"I think this is an excellent guidebook. It has the flavor of a Lonely Planet book, without such a complete \\"backpacker\\" emphasis. I find it enjoyable to just read. It's very well written, without trying so hard to be cute or flashy. (I recently bought a pile of guidebooks for Florida and they were all a waste of money except the Michelin Green Guide! Leave it to Michelin.)I find that this book has a wealth of practical and interesting information. Every question I have come up with regarding planning our trip, I have quickly and easily been able to come up with an answer to. It's full of good maps and photos. He tells you when a spot has been overrun by tourists or if the surf is dangerous there. He tells you when to be especially careful about being ripped off as a tourist. There are lots of interesting bits about the local flora and fauna and historical sidebars. It has an extensive index, a bibliography organized by subject, and a glossary of creole words and other island-specific expressions. It was updated last year, so I expect the information to be very accurate. He gives lots of specific restaurants, hotels, etc., with phone numbers and addresses and recommends some. He doesn't give reviews of the businesses generally; but often gives the flavor of the clientele or some other indication of what to expect (prices, etc.) I imagine it would be pretty hard to slam some business in a place this small and still be able to do this kind of work.This is not a backpacker's guide -- aimed exclusively at the cheapest way to do things. It's a general guide, with all kinds of information. He does tell you how to do it cheap (and tells you where that will be a pain in the rear.) Here's a quote that explains it:\\"It's not practical to take a bus [from the airport] because the schedule has been cut way back and the bus does not come to the terminal. If you have strong legs and little luggage [backpackers ...] you may go out to the main road and wait for the VITRAN (around $1, exact change) ... Be sure to ask if it is a, 'dollar bus.' Otherwise, they may try to charge you more.\\"To me, this delivers exactly what I want to know about the bus system: cut back schedule, doesn't stop at the terminal (!!), long walk to pick it up, precise cost, exact change, how not to get ripped off. Bullseye in my estimation.I find this guide to be nicely complete, easy to use, and enjoyable to read. Very hard to find this combination of qualities in a guidebook. I haven't yet visited the VI; but I feel well equipped now. I have traveled extensively (years) in Asia, Africa, and Europe, mostly by bicycle. I have seen umpteen guide books (including many \\"Let's Go\\" books: virtually useless except for listing cheap transport and cheap accomodations. I remember what \\"Let's Go Europe\\" said about the magnificent city of Orleans, \\"Good place to do your laundry.\\" [!!!! Did they visit the place??].)This is a good guidebook."},{"Title":"Explore the Virgin Islands (Sixth Edition)","review":"I ended up buying this particular guidebook (Oct. 05 edition)based on the spectacular reviews and was rather disappointed with it. It is mostly fine if you like to take organized tours and/or money is not a consideration. The only other travel guidebook I have ever used was by Let'sGo (for a different place) and I was far more satisfied with that. Too bad Let'sGo does not have a guidebook for Virgin Islands.Pariser's description of sites in St. Thomas is rather brief; there are far better descriptions in one of the free travel brochures available at the airport and elsewhere in St. Thomas(neither mentions admission charges though). The description of public transportation on St. Thomas and St. John is pathetic. The LonelyTravel guidebook (from 2001!) listed schedules for public buses on St. Thomas and St. John, which were still correct at least for St. John. While Pariser listed some contact phone numbers instead, try using these to get any information!On the positive side, Pariser's book does contain general information about the US Virgin Islands in some detail plus the British Virgin Islands, though with less detail.By the way, if you are interested in doing some hiking on St. John, try getting a map from a NH guy called Trail Bandit (this is all I know about him; sorry). It shows more trails than the NPS map of hiking trails that you can get at the NPS office in Cruz Bay.Have a great trip! It is a wonderful place to visit."},{"Title":"Explore the Virgin Islands (Sixth Edition)","review":"I have visited the Virgin Islands many times, and always with great delight. This book has shown me many things I didn't know, and will definitely be in my suitcase next time.The discussions of flora and fauna in the beginning are exceptional, but this book has far more to offer. The discussion of places to eat and to stay is much more thorough than that in most other guides, and includes places I wouldn't want to miss. The discussion of activities and sites includes things I haven't seen in any other guide, and approaches I haven't found discussed elsewhere.The dramatic cover and the charming photographs inside also help to convey the mood and beauty of the islands. Add this to the author's willingness to reveal his opinions and preferences, and you have the kind of unique and charming guide that is a rare find."},{"Title":"Explore the Virgin Islands (Sixth Edition)","review":"I do quite a bit of traveling and often buy a Lonely Planet guide as a basic reference. Lately, however, I've become somewhat jaded by its formulaic coverage and superficial approach. I'm also skeptical about how they go about choosing which accomodations and restaurants to include in their books.Pariser's book at first glance looks remarkably like a Lonely Planet guide--the same format and much the same information. However, Pariser puts more of himself into it and the book clearly is a labor of love. Pariser's guide compares to Lonely Planet like a family restaurant to McDonalds."},{"Title":"Explore the Virgin Islands (Sixth Edition)","review":"Travel through St. Thomas, St. John, St. Croix and the British Virgin Islands without waiting to board the plane! If you've already visited this region of earthly paradise you are sure to find an abundance of ideas for shopping, local attractions, beaches, historical sites and fascinating fun facts to add to your next island experience. There's even a getting married section for readers who may be dreaming of a beach wedding. This guide not only explains sea life, animal life, plant life and coral reefs it also warns of underwater hazards and cures, offers tips for environmental, undersea and boating conduct and provides island do's and don'ts. Explore the Virgin Islands takes readers beyond the standard travel guide information and encourages them to become adventurous island explorers.

Mr. Pariser has a strong sense of the environment and there is no questioing his feelings about jet skis! There are lots of photos and maps and info on taxis, ferries, walks in the towns of Charlotte Amelie and Christiansted and hundreds of phone numbers and websites. However, Mr. Pariser is best when giving you the history and politics of both the American and British VI and when delving into the flora and fauna of the many parks and beaches and the rocks and dive spots best for snorkelers and scuba divers. 100 pages are devoted to the BVI including Tortola and Virgin Gorda with all sorts of little hotels and restaurants included. He has plenty of practical tips throughout the book, such as warning about taking water (and food if you want)along to Buck Island National Park (the underwater one). A nice guide for your backpack."},{"Title":"Explore the Virgin Islands (Sixth Edition)","review":"I'm only going to St. Joh, and thought this would cover everything I needed.

Having read Larry Benoit (How to Bag the biggest buck of your life), there are several similarities. However, Hal goes one step further by discussing several methods of bagging that trophy buck. I did note that both hunters use the same firearm (Remington 30-06 pump w/iron sights).Personally, I feel this is a better book for the buck (pun intended)with multiple ways of getting the biggest buck of your life. Hal's book gives you a good start on what to look for when beginning tracking, stand hunting, using a grunt tube etc. Larry Benoit covers tracking only. Personally, I feel this book covers tracking equally as well as Larry Benoit does w/his book. Do what I did read em both, but if your budget is tight I'd buy this one!"},{"Title":"Hunting Big Woods Bucks","review":"This book really seems to cover the most effective hunting tactics for those of us in the colder climates. It deals with tracking (especially in snow) quite a bit. It also deals with deer behavior and the probable reasons for this behavior. I have learned a lot from this book and plan on using the tactics explained and looking for bucks in places covered here. I love how the lessons learned are interspersed with good hunting stories to back up the lesson. Not all the stories are success stories either. Mr Blood does a good job explaining the hunt and respecting it, whether it leads to a harvest or not."},{"Title":"Hunting Big Woods Bucks","review":"I have all their books, all provide some interesting reading.

This guy really hunts like everyone else WANTS to hunt. He can track, sit, rattle, drive. Hal Blood will be the next great deerhunter in the Northeast. I've already booked a spot in his camp for this fall. It's almost impossible to book a one on one hunt with him. I read the book twice before I gave it to a friend. He booked the hunt with me."},{"Title":"Hunting Big Woods Bucks","review":"I liked this book alot . As a tracking book it's as infomationaly complete as any. I personally like \\"Big Bucks the Benoit way\\" better. The chapter \\" Track him down\\" in this book is worth the price of the book. As with the other tracking books I have found the sign reading info is relivent most anywhere. Hal Blood, The Benoits, R.G. Bernier are pure deer hunters. They hunt the toughest areas in the toughest conditions. They are going to be successful on big deer anywhere they choose to hunt. Not just on a high dollar lease's and guided hunts like alot of the \\"experts\\" are.

I was very excited to get it and read it immediately. Lots of useful info. Absolutely no problems whatsoever."},{"Title":"Hunting Big Woods Bucks","review":"I bought this book with the hope of learning something about big woods deer, which I hunt in my home state as well as Canada. This is a pretty good read with some great stories of big bucks (although muddied by a few annoying typos). I struggled trying to portray in my mind how Mr. Blood's hunting style (tracking and stillhunting in what I presume is semi-open, mountainous country) would apply to the brush country I hunt, but I had the same problems with books written about and by the Benoits. However, I've hunted big woods bucks for nearly 30 years, and a few points made by Mr. Blood hit home for me, so the book was well worth buying and reading."},{"Title":"Hunting Big Woods Bucks","review":"A nice, quick-reading compliment to the author's first book! If you're buying one, buy the other as well - and bring them to deer camp! Even the most expert of big woods deer hunters will glean some meaningful detail from these pages."},{"Title":"Hunting Big Woods Bucks","review":"This is a good book on regional tactics and methods. It covers some of the same material as the Benoit books but also fills in some missing aspects. While the Benoit books have a good deal of information some of it is phrased in their personal style that is a little off the mainstream. Blood's book is more of a bridge to the bulk of deer hunting methods. He covers stand hunting, for example, and adds some tips on letting spooked bucks calm down that are worthwhile. The book does gloss over some information and some details may also not apply to your area. For instance, I am in the same bioregion as he is, but we don't have the brown ash that is the key rub tree in his area. Also, I haven't seen some of the patterns, he mentions.One thing that I do find fault with is his comments on shooting running bucks. He says it is essential to his methods and states that, \\"If you don't learn to make running shots, you may not get many shots at big-woods bucks. Over the years, I've taken a lot of bucks that were running, and I have never wounded one -either I've made a good shot or had a clean miss.\\" That is good to hear but it is in defiance of physics and probability. If you shoot at running deer in the woods you are going to run the risk of wounding and losing deer. Why he avoids this issue I don't know, but it is a disservice to the reader, many of whom, will not be properly prepared for an ethically dicey dilemma. The Benoits avoid this, as well, and, as their videos show, it must happen more than they admit.On the whole though, this is a very accessible book with a lot to offer big woods hunters especially when added to the Benoit books.I saw somewhere that he is working on a new book or an updated book. It will be good if he can expand on this fine effort."},{"Title":"Hunting Big Woods Bucks","review":"Hal tries real hard to give you a good in depth view of his hunting techniques which incompass many styles.

I've never hunted with Hal, but after reading his book, would like to, as well as enroll in his hunting and tracking class.He covers not only tracking, but stand-hunting, stalking, equipment and preparation for the North Woods, use of topo maps, etc. Hal has organized the book very well, and throughout, he includes detailed, actual accounts of successful and unsuccessful hunts by himself and many of his clients.

He enjoys his work and loves his girlfriend Rachel. Ben is looking forward to seeing his parents who are coming for a visit, but they are killed in a shoot-out near the Watergate Hotel. Ben races over to the scene, only to be accosted by a dying Russian Tarnofsky who provides him secret information that needs to be given to superspy Landau.Ben's world, already crumbled by his parents' deaths, completely shatters as he is now involved in the Middle East crisis here in America.

It's the President's son, not daughter, who is at risk.The book is an exciting, fast paced thriller. What I found most interesting was the premise of the &quot;Assistants;&quot; Jews in foreign countries who aid the Mossad and the government of Israel without pay and who risk all in doing so. The little bit of info given about the author makes one wonder how much of this is truth disguised as fiction. There is mention of Osama Bin Laden and his threat against a First Lady, but makes it seem like that was the end of him. We all know better. The hero's interest in Magic is an important element of the story from beginning to end and the brotherhood of the magicians was another interestingaspect I would like to read more about.

As thanks for a service provided she gives him an estate - Queen's Folly. The story follows the estate and the family through multiple generations, all effected by his passion for his queen.

I liked Elswyth Thane's Williamsburg series but wouldn't recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Art of the Barbarian: Conan, Tarzan, Death Dealer","review":"If you can find it, buy the 4th issue of Verotik's short lived, Death Dealer series. That's what makes up the bulk of this uninspiring \\"collection\\". The Tarzan covers that are featured are from the relatively lackluster Dark Horse comic series back in the nineties (some of the short series were very nice but the regular title left a lot to be desired and these are some of the covers). In fact, the lion's share of this collection is art culled from the early to late nineties and none of it is particualrly great. Some of it is good, but none of it has the visceral impact that such an artist should be able to deliver. The violence is rigid, somewhat graphic for blatent effect but never feeling as terrible as it should appear. An annoying part of this collection is the Gallery section towards the back. In most books this is a chance to see anything from lush sketches to full blown \\"masterpieces\\" in all the artist's glory. There is no such thing here. This \\"gallery\\" consists of some drawings and sketches, and some of these sketches are featured in the very same gallery as a group and in other parts of the book. That's correct, three reproductions of the same sketches in three different parts of the book.If you buy this book another glaring element are the many times the same exact lizard heads are depicted, and most of these from the exact same perspective (and the lizard image in question was lifted directly from another artist's drawing that was featured as an illustration in a novel, and that artist will not hard to identify for people who know their contemporary fantasy art).To make matters worse this collection is not well reproduced. Many of the drawings are reproduced badly. With such a mass marketed, slick, collection this book is nothing more than a dreadfully showcased reprint of art already very familiar to those who already know this artist. There are a few new pieces in this collection but once seen they leave me with no impression at all other than it's time for this artist to find another style to imitate. Conan fans, beware. Other than a small handful of sketches there is only one rather muddy looking finished drawing of Conan.Art Suydam is actually a decent artist but his heavy leaning on another-more famous-artist's stylings is a crutch he should completely discard at this point in his life. It is time for the Real Arthur Suydam to step up and make his mark. This book does nothing to highlight his skills."},{"Title":"The Art of the Barbarian: Conan, Tarzan, Death Dealer","review":"Good reproductions of the original art. Good information about the artwork."},{"Title":"The Art of the Barbarian: Conan, Tarzan, Death Dealer","review":"APP Press International, James Thomas WinslowDon't be misled by self-appointed niche critics who miss the point of this series of books entirely. This is a long overdue and most refreshing overview and retrospective on the sword and sorcery genre and the art of the barbarian--a fictional genre derived from actual historical events in Europe, which were then popularized as pulp novels and stories in the \`30's, penned by writers such as Edgar Rice Burroughs and Robert E. Howard. The genre has since seen two rebirths--one in the 70's in popular paperback and comics and the second today in '05 via comics as well.As part of the third coming of the barbarian, this series of two books from Image and the hardcover from Heavy Metal cover the genre in depth, looking at the history, the authors, focusing on three of the better known sword and sorcery characters, and most auspiciously flowing around the art of one of the genre's recent artists, Arthur Suydam.This approach of looking at the history of a genre with such a renowned artist's work as a backdrop is novel and appropriate, and it is interesting to hear from the line-up of contributors of the book on their take on the artwork and sword and sorcery, while giving a nod to creators of the past. This retrospective is achieved with in-depth and scholarly text from writer Peter Sanderson, coupled with reproductions of some of Suydam's classic covers, interior comic illustrations and sculpt designs, encompassing his illustrative work on Conan the Barbarian, Tarzan and Death Dealer.One of the things that struck me most is just how refreshing this book is with its lushness--filled with pen and ink illustrations throughout, intricately detailed. Very classical in nature, reminiscent of works from the great age of illustration--artists such as Gibson, Cole and St. John. This is so nice to see in this current world of assembly line, digitally colored art that we see so much of today in comics and elsewhere.Some of the stand out art included in these books are, the series of painted Tarzan covers, and a series of impressive red chalk illustrations that comprise a series of Conan studies from the REH story, \\"The Frost Giant's Daughter.\\" (Speaking of Conan, I must confess that I have been somewhat disappointed by the various WWF depictions of the character. Not so here. The interpretation by Suydam is easily the best depiction of the character I've seen since Barry Smith's fine designs in the \`70's.)I was also particularly impressed with the Death Dealer artwork, which appears here for the first time in it's original format without the overbearing digital color, which obscured the art in its original printing. This collection of highlights forms Suydam's own personal homage to predecessor and sword and sorcery guru, Frank Frazetta. I enjoy it when an artist tips his hat to a past contributor as a sign of respect.Don't be misled by naysayers. I have followed the career of this unique artist, who throughout his career, has made a point to unravel the secrets and techniques of masters from bygone eras and then, on occasion, display them openly in his own tongue and cheek fashion...if for no other reason, than to show that he can--A hobby that has earned him both praise of fans and sideways glances from hardliners and contemporaries who all too often miss the point completely. I am certain fans, however will appreciate the artist's personal homage to friend Frazetta.One of the odd details of the Death Dealer art is that I don't recall ever seeing comic panels that look so finished and rendered as these! The panels seem to stand by themselves and remind one more of the Canaveral plates from one of the Burroughs novels than panels extracted from a comic book.Of the two books from Image, \\"Chapter One\\" is 78 pages in length, while \\"Chapter Two\\" was disappointingly shorter at 64 pages. Both are black and white throughout. The Heavy Metal hardcover book is 98 pages, and is color and sepia, with a gallery. I like that the publisher provided duplicate art in the gallery section, so that if the gallery section is removed for mounting, the book is not minus some of its more impressive art.Having seen all the books in the series, I much prefer the hardcover. Unlike its predecessors, the Heavy Metal book is a sturdy volume, the kind of book that I'd want to hold onto and then pass down.One thing that history has shown us is that fads come and go, but good work is timeless. It is nice to see a creative pick up on the work of his predecessors and continue a time-honored tradition. Just as Michelangelo picked up on the teaching of Da Vinci and Raphael followed Michelangelo, so do these books show how writers and artists of the present have been influenced by past greats of this genre.My review: If you are not into the \\"boy stuff,\\" pass on these. But if you are a fan of Conan and the sword and sorcery genre, these books are a must."},{"Title":"Process reengineering: The key to achieving breakthrough success","review":"This is one of the most straightforward, content rich books on process design and reengineering in my library. It's not the biggest in terms of page count, but certainly among the best in pragmatic approach and techniques. It's also a compact catalog of process frameworks to which I refer when I need a quick approach that I can tailor and apply to a specific problem.Mr. Roberts starts this book running. By page 7 h's stepping you through an &quot;as-is&quot; and &quot;to-be&quot; scenario of a process in need of redesign. He shares his process reengineering philosophy in chapter 2, which is highlighted by twelve highly effective tenets that will serve you well as either a process designer or reengineer. Chapter 3 covers possibilities and pitfalls and addresses the key elements of any well designed process, including customer focus, cycle time improvements, process efficiencies and other attributes. The pitfalls cited are sage advice that make this book all the more valuable. The process reengineering framework given in chapter 4 is a complete roadmap to reengineering and can also be recast into a framework for process design and implementation. This is one of the most valuable aspects of the book.The chapter that most greatly influenced my thinking is on opportunity assessment. This area, in my opinion, is where projects get initiated before they are completely thought through. The focus on traceability to customer requirements, quantitative value analysis and business case approach should be required reading for anyone who has the authority to initiate reengineering projects. The information and approach will go a long way towards ensuring that you wisely commit resources to the right things, and will also circumvent premature failures (not to mention tarnished or ruined careers or reputations).Chapters 6 and 7 address planning the reengineering project and identifying and assigning the team. These are followed by four chapters devoted to the sequence of tasks and milestones for the project: analysis, design, risk and impact assessment, and planning and implementing the transition. The last is a critical point that, if not done properly, will kill an otherwise successful project. Each of the chapters, however, provide clear and straightforward direction on how to accomplish necessary tasks and successfully meet milestones.After a process has been implemented the job of tracking and measuring project performance begins. This is the subject of chapter 12, and is a necessary part of a thoroughly planned and executed reengineering project. After all, the goal is to supplant a legacy process that is no longer efficient and/or effective, not create a brand new process with the same limitations.Overall this is a valuable book that is easy to read and filled with excellent advice. If you are faced with either designing a new process or reengineering an existing one this book will point you in the right direction. It will also step you through what you need to do, while pointing out the pitfalls along the way and advising on how to avoid or deal with them."},{"Title":"Classic Ballparks: A Collector's Edition","review":"CLASSIC BALLPARKS is a decent enough book, but in the enormously crowded field of baseball books, it is not especially memorable. One can debate what the greatest sport is, but there is absolutely no debating that the literature that has grown up around baseball completely outclasses the literature surrounding any other sport, and perhaps all other sports books combined. Only boxing can be identified as a distant second. Due to the incredibly crowded field of baseball books, this one would be completely forgettable except for one thing: the miniature ballparks that accompanying the set.To be honest, I got the set for the ballparks. A friend at work brought them in and I flipped out when I saw them. There are six in all, all roughly two to three inches in dimension, and all surprisingly accurate for such inexpensive replicas. I live two blocks from Wrigley Field and so know it extremely well, since it makes up part of the furniture of the neighborhood. I would have gotten the book for the model of Wrigley alone, but thankfully there are five other classic parks as well. Obviously, if you are choosing only six parks, some very hard decisions will be made. Wrigley and Fenway, as the two most beautiful parks in baseball, are naturals, and Yankee Stadium is nearly as essential. But you next have to leave out some really crucial parks. You can't really quibble too much with the Polo Grounds or Ebbets Field, but Tiger Stadium is a bit iffier. I personally would have preferred Forbes Field or old Comiskey, but I'm not unhappy to have a really nice model of Tiger Stadium.The great thing about the set is that you can read about the fields while looking at first-rate replicas. I've seen photos of all the parks before, but the models bring them alive in a way that I would never have anticipated. For instance, I knew that Ebbets had a very long left field line, but when you look at the model you realize that it had to have been one of the most challenging left fields to play in the majors, while right field was positively tiny. All serious baseball fans know Willie Mays's catch quite well, but looking at the model and seeing the spot where he caught it, with some knowledge of the distance to the spot, makes it seem all but impossible.Any baseball fan should own this, and anyone who has a baseball fan to buy things for and aren't sure what to get him or her, this would be an absolutely perfect gift."},{"Title":"Classic Ballparks: A Collector's Edition","review":"I Had purchase this item as a Christmas gift and they send me the wrong item very disappointedI had to purchase another gift so I never reordered the correct item"},{"Title":"The Joy of Service!","review":"I think this book is terrific.

The genius of this question is that it calls attention to--though, typical of Brian Lamb, he doesn't dwell on it--one of the real scams of the book industry, the fact that the folks who are blurbed frequently have some previous relationship with the author. Someone, it may have been The New Republic, actually used to have a terrific feature where they untangled these relationships. My favorite recurring motif is where the Author's Acknowledgment thanks a person who, we suddenly realize, has not so coincidentally provided an encomium for the cover. Harder to track down, but equally amusing, are the mutual blurbs, where authors' words of praise appear on each other's books.Now, I'd read Geoffrey Norman's Morgan Hunt series several years ago in paperback, and thoroughly enjoyed it. But had I not, what right-thinking man could resist the blandishments on the back of this hardcover that I found; the authors quoted are : James Hall and Loren D. Estleman, an outstanding thriller writer and the best private eye novelist of his generation respectively; P.J. O'Rourke, one of the funniest political writers going; and not just one but both Buckleys, Christopher and William F., Jr.. I mean, c'mon, even once you realize that Geoffrey Norman is a contributor to National Review (founded by WFB) and Forbes FYI (edited by Christopher) and has written for The American Spectator (once home to PJ), you just aren't likely to ignore that collection of famous fans.As I said, the books are outstanding irrespective of who endorses them. Morgan Hunt is a former Green Beret and an ex-convict, having killed the man who was physically abusing his sister. He lives in the Florida Panhandle, and the natural world is an integral part of the stories. He's tough but likable, and though he's got a streak of machismo and a fearsome moral code, it's not as if Norman is trying to brainwash unsuspecting readers with conservative dogma.Blue Chipper might even surprise some folks, who tend to pigeon hole conservatives. The story centers around the exploitation of poor black athletes, in this case a basketball phenom, by scholastic athletic programs and coaches. Norman lives on the Florida Gulf Coast for part of the year, his column for National Review is on sports, and he writes about hunting and the outdoors for Sports Afield. This entry in the series gives him the chance to flex all his muscles, which he does to good effect.Of course, the other half of the year he spends in the People's Republic of Vermont and you should really be sure to track down his columns on the increasingly frightening politics of the Green Mountain State. They are a hoot.GRADE : A"},{"Title":"Power Golf Tenth Printing","review":"Ben Hogan, one of the great legends of golf,describes his own playing style in order to helpother golfers shave points off their game.

Hogan offers a breakdown of the swing, and it is easy to follow. Not only is the book illustrated, Hogan did a nice job articulating how to get better and hit it longer. One thing I found that was very helpful was in the last two pages, Hogan talks about course management, and tricks to saving shots when you are playing in all types of conditions. This was a very informative and useful section of the book.There are many golf-instruction books out there, and this book stands the test of time, as did Hogan's golf game. I recommend it to any golfer."},{"Title":"Power Golf Tenth Printing","review":"Although it is often overshadowed by his second book, 5 Lessons:The Modern Fundamentals of Golf, Hogan's first book, Power Golf, still deserves it's place on any golf addicts bookshelf. Power Golf offers Hogans wisdom on other facets of the game than the full swing, especially shotmaking.The difference in the quality of writing can easily be understood because Hogan wrote his first book alone and the second with the help of one of the greatest golf writers of all time, Herbert Warren Wind.I found this book to be a fascinating look at the way Hogan played the game and a great source for more of the clear practical thought that we found in 5 Lessons."},{"Title":"Power Golf Tenth Printing","review":"This was written in 1948 and is utterly useless as a &quot;how to&quot; guide for a beginning or intermediate golfer in 2001. I'm sure that even Hogan, if he were alive, would tell you not to buy it as an instructional guide. It is, however, FANTASTIC for the scores of photographs of Hogan at all stages of his swing. You'll clearly see why this man hit the ball in a way that we amateurs never will and 99% of professionals never will. As someone else pointed out, this is Hogan's swing before his near-fatal accident and before he developed a controlled fade. Some of the positions he achieves are mind-boggling and completely beyond anyone without his supreme talent. For the best quality in the photographs, I'd look for a used hard-cover copy (they are still plentiful). Buy this, but only as a piece of golf history. For instruction from Hogan, buy Five Fundamentals or one of the recent videos analyzing his swing."},{"Title":"Power Golf Tenth Printing","review":"&quot;Power Golf&quot; is an excellent driving range accessory. The book will no doubt be troublesome for the average once a month hacker whose bad habits have accumulated over several years.

Not as great as his more famous &quot;5 Fundamentals&quot;, but nonetheless still packed with valuable insights, and superbly written.This was done before his great transformation. He had already reached the pinnacle of pro golf but had not yet suffered the car wreck. His swing at this stage was a classical, long, professional swing of that era."},{"Title":"Power Golf Tenth Printing","review":"Ben Hogan may or may not be the greatest golfer ever, but he certainly wrote the most influential golf books of all time. He more than anyone else established and propounded the fundamentals of the modern swing. Though some of the material is inevitably dated--younger folks may not even know what the heck a spoon is--most of what he says is just as helpful today as it was over fifty years ago.This book is especially appropriate for beginners and there are three essential bits of advice that are all someone really needs to know when they pick up a club for the first time :(1) The basis of the golf swing is a good grip. A good grip &quot;enables the two hands to act as a single unit.&quot;(2) &quot;The first movement in the downswing is the turning of the left hip to the left. Forget about your arms, hands, shoulders and club at that moment and start the hips turning, led by the left hip.&quot;(3) &quot;My advice to the beginning golfer is to go ahead and hit the ball as hard as he can right from the start. He will be wild for a time. That's only natural. Later on he can straighten out his hooks and slices with minor alterations to his swing. But if he doesn't learn to hit the ball hard right at the start, he will never be able to get distance without a major overhauling, because his speed and timing setup will be something less than his full power.&quot;That's it; that's really all you need to get started. It's a terrific little book, complete with quaint illustrations of a little golfer in pleated slacks and a sweater demonstrating the lessons. Of course, there is one more more thing that Hogan emphasized and no book will help you with; if you want to improve you have to practice, a lot.GRADE : B+"},{"Title":"Power Golf Tenth Printing","review":"I think of this as the Bible for golfers, especially the novice or duffer who is willing to study and work at improving his game. Hogan's writing covers almost everything from the most basic considerations--grip, stance, and back swing--to much more detailed instruction. It won't replace a good, in-person teacher, but it's a great place to begin . . . and then continue. Any golfer can probablly take 5 strokes off in a few short weeks by going over the basics."},{"Title":"Power Golf Tenth Printing","review":"Written by the man himself, it's a must read for any fan of Ben Hogan and anyone looking to unlock his swing secrets.

This method is considered dangerous by many but if used correctly is extremly effective.Two athletes in the USA were said to have improved their 100m best times by over a second, one of them improving from 12.3 down to 11.1 after a years use of this training method along side his sprint training.If not used correctly this method of training could be the end of your athletic career. Do NOT build up too quickly. Use the preparation phase properly and ease off if you are still tired from any previous training session.Used wisely you can pretty much abolish the idea that you have to be a born sprinter. Michael Johnson is a second quicker than most because in his training he also uses this method and has been for years.I started my training a year ago and have improved my 400m time from 48.32 to 46.21 and I believe the complex training has had a major role to play in this.A very good book."},{"Title":"Explosive Power & Strength: Complex Training for Maximum Results","review":"This is an excellent book that is broken up into 3 parts delineating the nature of complex training, then the nuts and bolts of complex training, and finally how to customize a workout routine for your athlete or team.It is my most frequently used resource on a shelf full of this type of material."},{"Title":"Explosive Power & Strength: Complex Training for Maximum Results","review":"Yes, the book doesn't have extraordinary exercise descriptions, but the essential exercises are described well... I don't think the point of the book was to describe exercises... the purpose was to explain to you \\"Complex training\\" and how it can help you achieve \\"Explosive power and strenght.\\" If you want superb exercise descriptions, try his book Jumping into Plyometrics (That's the purpose of the book to describe plyometric exercises), but if you want to actually KNOW how to use complex training then this is the right book for you. If you are a beginner and know nothing of exercise I'd try another book, but if you're fairly seasoned and understand good training sense and technique then pick it up."},{"Title":"Explosive Power & Strength: Complex Training for Maximum Results","review":"The titleof my review is a tautology, but that's what this book is about, really. It gives the coach or athlete a good introduction to why and how they should use complex training for sports. Chu writes a good chapter on the theory behind complex training, or as some call it: contrast training. Contrast training is simply put to train similar movements or the same muscles with both resistance and plyometric exercises in the same workout. You will learn how to put together a training program using contrast complexes in your workouts, and how to periodize the complex method in a training year. The author is concerned with safety, complex training is after all not for everyone, the athlete needs to have a certain level of strength and skill for the training to be safe and beneficial. Chu advices on what volume of complex training an athlete can perform for maximum progress. And...it works. I've tried myself.

Each exercise is described in three or more steps, which provide no clue on the proper execution of exercise. Most of the exercise sketches are flawed and hint to the total lack of experience or exposure of the author to athletic performance.Although the book was first published in 1996, there were then reasonable level of technical skills and knowledge with publishing good illustrations that the author disregarded."},{"Title":"The Hemingway Book Club of Kosovo","review":"There will always be war and consequences: displacement, homelessness, and its most undesirable effect--hatred. Paula Huntley's unintended and unexpected contribution to the restoration of the human soul in Kosovo has exactly the same effect on the reader.

In some ways, it reminded me of Reading Lolita in Tehran. But can we self-centered Americans ever read too much about areas of the world where people don't spend most of their day at the mall or playing Nintendo?"},{"Title":"The Hemingway Book Club of Kosovo","review":"I taught English in Sarajevo for 3 years and so was very excited to read this book. I think English teachers interact with people in a way much different from highly-paid members of the \\"international community\\" who most often write the books and get the attention. I think it's very important for people in the world to hear about Kosovo and the Balkans more generally through real, live individuals.Internationals often like to go on about how people in the Balkans go on about history, won't let it go, etc... but what do they themselves write about? History! Read this book to meet real people just like you who had some very difficult experiences and still move on with life.My reservations about the book are:- While I think on the whole the book is a positive thing, I feel uncomfortable with an English teacher asking students to recount their wartime experiences and then publishing a book about them. I did not raise the topic of the war with my students out of sensitivity - some people may prefer not to talk about it ... also there is a tendency to see people from this region as ONLY survivors of war. People are still individuals, with lives and personalities and experiences that have nothing to do with the war. While some people in a group may be excited to share their experiences, others may feel traumatized again by it. Additionally (and this is a difference between Bosnia and Kosovo, which there are many of), my students were comprised of people of different backgrounds. You don't know what people's experiences - or views - are solely by their ethnic background, and asking a group of people about very sensitive and personal experiences may put some people on the spot in a way you don't realize.- The author was there eight months, right after the height of the conflict. My three years were not enough to speak authoritatively about the region, nor to speak \\"for\\"/on behalf of \\"a people\\". If you are reading this book you should bear this in mind. Many foreigners do try to speak for a whole country/group/etc, some with much less than 8 months... this is a very, very short time.All that said, I think this book is a fascinating read and presents a perspective on one region in the Balkans that is VERY lacking. It is wonderful and rare that she has kept in touch with her students and I encourage you to read this book."},{"Title":"The Hemingway Book Club of Kosovo","review":"First let me say that I have the utmost respect for Paula Huntley and her husband, for what they did, and for the lives they touched. Her writing was just enough to show the day to day lives of these people who have gone through so much. I wish more people would take a more active role in the world around them. It would be a better world if they did.However, the more I read the book the more frustrated I got. The book was a collection of horrific stories. People need to know that this happened. But much was missing. While she provided us with a picture of the crumbling war torn town, she did little to give us any historical background. What was the culture like, who were the famous artists, statesmen, writers? What was Kosovo (and the entire region for that matter) like before the war, befor Tito. What were the politics that lead to decisions years ago which fired up the conflict? And where on earth was a good map of the region? I realize that I was probably asking for too much. But the blurb by Jason Elliot raised my expectations. It is good, esp if you know nothing about the region. But I really did want more."},{"Title":"The Hemingway Book Club of Kosovo","review":"With the review you have given to Paula's book - that is considered an angel for me - you made me laugh despite the sadreality of what you non-sense'd about.\\"Hemingway book club of Kosova\\" a racist book??? No way, in contrary you were recommending a racist book that protects whatSerbs have done to Kosova, Croatia and Bosnia.Goodness me, I can not understand people who make (war) crimesand yet find reasons to justify their ugly deeds. Shame to all of them who do that.Hemingway Book Club of Kosova, is the best book written about KOSOVA so far, that's in my opinion and if since I can make recommendation in here - I'd like to recommend Philip J. Cohen'sbook \\"Serbia's Secret War\\" - that has some similiarities withHemingway book Club of Kosova.Hemingway book Club of Kosova talks about LOVE between Kosovarsand Americans while the \\"Serbia's Secret War\\" talks about theSerbian cooperations with Nazi's throughout the 2-nd world war. And by the way, I am asking you since \\"I have forgotten\\"Who was the person who started the First World War, and those in Slovenia, and Croatia, and Bosnia and Kosova at last.With all due respect to you \\"peace loving person\\" - You have no room to protect the Serbs who have done more then horrible crimesin not less than 4 countries.Now who's the racist here, Mrs Huntley or the Serbs she talked about (even though she didn't generalize them all).God Bless Mrs Huntley and her husband, God Bless U.S.A and allPeace loving people throughout the world - excluding the fake ones."},{"Title":"The Hemingway Book Club of Kosovo","review":"The book was very disturbing to me. I could not believe what I was reading....I have not ever read such a racist book as this one written by Mrs. Huntley. I was very surprised that a person of her age, education, and experience could write and take such a closed minded and racist approach as she did. Many points in this book are inaccurate and simply lies. Throughout the book, she doesn't support her statements and I am sure that even if she tried, she could not. I believe that there is not one entry in her journal where she is not badmouthing Serbs. Even more so, not only is she demonizing Serbs for what happened in Kosovo in '98-'99, but she is even denying much of their history and pride. On the contrary, she very rarely (almost never) accuses Kosovar Albanians for what they had done to Serbs (and still are doing as we speak, due to inadequate protection from the UN forces of few Serbs who are brave enough to stay or unable to leave). A few times, she does mention atrocities that were done by Kosovar Albanians, but then she almost justifies their behavior by explaining that they have done this or that because of what Serbs did to them beforehand to provoke this kind of behavior. What double standard! I could go on-and-on and on about the book and Mrs. Paula, but there is nothing nice that I could say about her or about the book. The reason is her constant demonization of Serbs, usually with no evidence at all (almost all of her judgments and thoughts are based on stories from her students who are Kosovar Albanians who certainly are not objective). In addition, I do not understand what kind of person she is for further instigating hate between Albanians towards Serbs, Serbs towards Albanians, and even the rest of the world towards Serbs. As a rational and peace loving person, I believe that you'll understand my dissatisfaction with the book.Dr. Michael Perenti, Yale graduate in political science, who has done extensive research on the topic and also visited Yugoslavia after the NATO bombing ended is someone you should read if you are interested in the subject. He wrote a book called, \\"To Kill a Nation\\" and is very good reading with finally some justification/support for what he writes."},{"Title":"The Hemingway Book Club of Kosovo","review":"The Hemingway Book Club of Kosovo is a wonderful tale of the virtues and rewards of volunteering to help those in countries less fortunate (at least for the present) than the US; at the same time, it's not exactly great literature or great writing. However, that's not what it's advertised to be, and it's not the aspiration of the author to compete with the writers of great literature. For how it came to be (a collection of emails to friends and family during the 8 months the author spent teaching English in Kosovo), this book more than meets its goal.Paula Huntley went to Kosovo with her husband, who volunteered for an ABA project to help set up a new legal system for the new war-torn country. She took a crash course in teaching English as a second language and, once in Prishtina, Kossovo, quickly found a job teaching the language to a classroom of eager and charming Albanian students.The book begins as Huntley's story but quickly evolves into being the story of the country and its inhabitants, specifically those who were blessed to be her students. Like volunteers everywhere, Huntley quickly learned that she was gaining and receiving far more than she was giving, in terms of compassion, understanding, insight, and personal growth.It's not \`literature,' but it's sure a terrific little book. Don't miss it. I learned a whole, whole lot about a part of the world about which I have very little knowledge."},{"Title":"The Hemingway Book Club of Kosovo","review":"To Paula Huntley's students it's Kosova, not Kosovo, like we Americans like to call that little war-torn country. That's just one of the changes Huntley had to get used to when she began teaching English to a group of Kosovar Albanians. Transplanted from her comfortable San Francisco life to Prishtina, Kosovo, Huntley began keeping a journal to express her struggles and triumphs in her new surroundings. Two years later, that same journal would be published as a book destined to be a bestseller.Paula Huntley is the epitome of a great teacher --- one who goes above and beyond the call of duty to help her students succeed. One of her noble feats is organizing an extracurricular reading group for her students known as the Hemingway Book Club of Kosovo. As her students read Hemingway's THE OLD MAN AND THE SEA, the parallels between their lives and the life of the old man become increasingly evident to both Huntley and her students. Through their interaction, both Huntley and her students learn the lessons of perseverance, faith and hope.THE HEMINGWAY BOOK CLUB OF KOSOVO offers much more than the typical memoir. Through Huntley's masterful writing and reflections, the reader experiences the horrors that her students lived through during the Serbian genocide of Kosovar Albanians. A timely reminder of what war does to a country, THE HEMINGWAY BOOK CLUB OF KOSOVO gives great insights into the injustices occurring throughout the world.This book contains a myriad of emotions. It elicits laughter as Huntley and her students struggle to break down cultural and language barriers. It evokes tears as you read of the losses the Kosovars experienced. It makes you angry, fills you with hope and drowns you in sorrow --- all at the same time. But most of all, it makes you think about all of the things you take for granted that Paula Huntley's students only dream of.--- Reviewed by Melissa Brown"},{"Title":"The Hemingway Book Club of Kosovo","review":"Paula Huntley's remarkable journal of her eight months as a volunteer English teacher in Kosovo is that rare thing: A sympathetic, even loving look at the victims of war - in this case Kosovar Albanians - that does not at the same time demonize those in whose name the war was waged - in this case, the Serbs. Indeed, Huntley reminds us that racial, ethnic or national stereotyping, and the notions of collective guilt and collective innocence that accompany such stereotyping, is frequently at the heart of violence. In a journal entry that recounts her students' unwillingness to believe that any Albanian could have been responsible for the bus bombing that had just killed many Serbian civilians, Huntley comments, \\"Nor, I expect, do most Serbs believe that fellow Serbs could have committed atrocities in Bosnia or Kosovo.\\"Huntley's reminds us not only of our differences, but of our similarities, and of the common humanity that connects us to each other. Her deep belief in the power of human connection is the thread that winds throughout this lovely, moving book."},{"Title":"The Hemingway Book Club of Kosovo","review":"I would like to meet Paula Huntley and her husband. They are very kind and brave people. Paula's journal gives us a snapshot of everyday life for her as an English teacher in Kosovo. She reveals each of her students' stories of the ethnic cleansing by the Serbs, and gets to know them well enough to hear their goals and dreams for their country. She ponders the ancient feuds that continue into the 21st century.Hemingway's *Old Man and the Sea* turned out to be a vehicle for discussions on strength in the face of adversity. After what these students had been through, they very much needed to know that success could be theirs.The reader is also given a tour of Prishtina and the wreckage, filthy conditions, and lack of services.

Ed Huntley desperately wanted to do something to help in the war-torn Balkans. So he volunteered for an American Bar Association project to help rebuild Kosovo's legal system. Paula trained to teach English as a second language, (TESL), while she was still in the States. \\"The Hemingway Book Club Of Kosovo\\" is her memoir of that period, taken from the journal she kept during the eight months they lived and worked in Prishtina. Ms. Huntley movingly writes of her experience, and of the intimate bond she forged with her students.The Huntleys arrived in Prishtina and found that the city had not been totally destroyed. Since the Serbs needed Prishtina, the capital city, they had left most of the buildings intact. However, as in most of Kosovo, there had been massive looting, vandalism and violence, murders were committed on a large scale, as was ethnic cleansing of the Kosovo Albanians. Huntley writes, \\"Most of the destruction in Prishtina was below the surface - in the hearts and minds of the residents. I saw this every day, and I never got used to that destruction.\\"Her students, and every native Albanian, had lost ten years of their lives under the brutal oppression, and apartheid imposed by the Kosovo Serbs. Learning English, in many ways, was key to the economic advancement of the students and their families. Ms. Huntley was deeply touched by the students' eagerness to learn not just English, and grammatical structure, but about the American culture and work ethic. She wanted to provide a safe forum for them to discuss their feelings, and the traumas of the past decade. A book club was established, that met at the Huntley home. The selection was Ernest Hemmingway's \\"The Old Man And The Sea.\\" The club took-off and became so much more. And the book became a vehicle through which the young people could discuss their lives. Hemmingway's book was fairly easy for them to read, but the novel's meaning was far deeper than the relatively simple language. The students identified with the fable of the triumph of hope and courage over adversity.The harrowing stories of the young Albanians, and their courage, and determination, are remarkable, and inspirational. Paula Huntley's memoir is an extraordinary tale of cross-cultural human connections, and bonds forged through literature and loving kindness.

Instead the main character is her husband/fiancee. This work by &quot;Futurian Society&quot; author James Blish suffers not for the passing years in terms of hard science; the technology is kept generalized and deliberatly vauge. So it reads as well today as when it was published. Its most delightful and disappointing fact is that the villian is more three dimensional then the two other main characters. And that is saying something in a novel meant to show the evils of prejudice by pitting normal(evil) humans against genetically manipulated(good) eight foot giants. A quick read, but has some staid plot mechanisms; old but beloved scientist-grandfather type who is murdered by villian in order to set up the climax."},{"Title":"Titans' Daughter","review":"Noted science fiction writer James Blish writes a passible furture tale were genetic engineering has produced a group of nine foot giants that are the objects of ridicule for most of the population. The story suffers from several flaws, It's hard to sympathize with the main characters, they are very two dimensional. The vilain is more interesting but not by much. The story also uses some staid plot mechanims such as &quot;hero is framed for murder he did not commit&quot;. And the title character is not really developed.

It provides methods that are clear, but also explains the reasons for the methods. For example: when is an RNA probe better than a DNA probe and why; when nonisotopic labels can be used effectively. Although there is not a chapter on in situ hybridization, I found the section on probes very helpful. There is also a handy glossary at the end and a primer on RNA at the beginning of the book.

Abode's manual lists the functions of the program but provides little advice as to when to use each function - and this is needed.Mr. Wooldbridge's book attempts, generally successfully, to provide a simple overview of all the key functions in PE2. The book's main asset is, as the title implies, visual - with screenshots of the different steps. For a visual program a visual guide seems logical to me (I have found the lengthy prose-based books less useful).The downside? Basic steps are covered, but not more complex, cumulative approaches (however, it can be argued that the book doesn't claim to do this). The photographs used to illustrate each lesson are truly awful - they are simple snapshots. Not one is a worthwhile photograph. This may or may not matter to you. The author illustrates, for example, how to change colors by changing a house's driveway into a hideous, garish color. (Arguably, this might be an asset - you might feel proud that many of your photographs are considerably better than those in used in your guidebook!) When looking for a guidebook, I hope to get exposed to worthwhile artistic photographs that will inspire some creativity.

Everything was right in front of you - written in short blurbs of 'easy-to-understand' text. And the text was accompanied by large, colorful photo shots of the computer screen. The individual text sections included arrow-like lines pointing from that section of text to a large display of what your computer would be showing you.It was as if you had a personal tutor who thoroughly understood the program sitting right next to you. That tutor person was not only explaining what the program could do, - but was also pointing with a finger to that spot on the computer monitor where it showed the different drop-down menu actions you could take at that point.If you have ever read something in a computer instruction book, and then spent the next ten minutes staring at everything on your computer screen - desperately trying to 'find the place' they were talking about - you can relate to what I consider one of the best features in this book.This book is exceptionally well laid out and each two-page section includes a complete teaching subject. That means you can pick this book up and read just a single two-page spread - and have learned something very important. Each page or two page spread is laid out the same way - with logical step by step directions. And if you want more information on that topic right away, the book tells you - (right on that same page) - what page or chapter you can go to - (either forward or back) to so that you can more thoroughly understand that particular program capability.So instead of the reaction ('oh yeah - I think I remember reading something like that....and wondering where it was) - this book essentially reads your mind and tells you what page had that detailed information already presented.Or, if you read what the program can do on your current page - but you think - ('yes but I really wanted to know about.....')- then the book also seems to read your mind - and tells you that more detailed information on that topic can be found on page ... or in chapter ...I really can't think of anything the publisher and author might have done to make learning easier. And with all the new things we need to learn every day to keep up with so many rapid changes - easier is better!!"},{"Title":"Teach Yourself VISUALLY Photoshop Elements 2.0","review":"This book had not arrived when I fled Katrina Hurricane"},{"Title":"Leyes eternas","review":"IT TOTALLY CHANGED MY LIFE.

The first section regarding the birth and circumstances of Douglass' flight to freedom was full of what I consider &quot;psychobabble&quot;. The author makes too many conjectures concerning the relationship of Douglass with his owner, including possible latent homosexual feelings but never includes any information to back this claim up. The story picks up when Douglass moves to New England and becomes involved in the abolistionist causes. His travels to England and his relationship with women working for the cause of women's suffrage is particularly interesting. However, the remainder of the book seems to meander with no purpose.I am still searching for a biography which puts this man's life into context."},{"Title":"Frederick Douglass","review":"Frederick Douglass is an authentic American and a heroic figure. For those wishing to become aquainted with a chronicle of his life, McFeely's book will do the job.Born a slave in Maryland, Douglass accomplished the difficult task of self education in an era when slaves were not taught under penalty of law. &quot;Running away with himself&quot; (as Southerners used to describe slaves who escaped) twenty years before the Civil War, he became one of our country's great orators in telling the tale of his life as a bondsman and urging that America embrace emancipation of all slaves. He was perhaps the anti-slavery movement's best spokesman. Not only for the sheer eloquence with which he captivated audiences, but as living proof that a black could be educated to a level reached by few people of any race.Douglass did his part for the Union in the Civil War and bought into Republicanism as the best political vehicle for achieving the end of slavery and the leveling up of blacks to their rightful place in American society. His hopes were frustrated after the Civil War when his party turned away from Reconstruction and blacks were subjugated anew by racism, indifference and Jim Crowism.Douglass was an idealist in that he believed that America could be exhorted into granting slaves not only their freedom but their civil rights and social equality. His country failed his vision miserably and he ended his life personnally successful (as successful as his skin color could take him in the 1890's) but very distraught at the chasm between his hopes for a free America and the reality.This is an adequate book, though dry at times. It follows Douglass chronologically. In episodes where his life was a fascinating story -- as a slave, his escape, his establishment in the North, as a politician and as US minister to Haiti -- the book is a fascinating tale. Not so fascinating are long accounts of his work on the road delivering speeches as an agent of the anti-slavery movement. Part of the problem with writing a biography of a man who was in large part a professional orator is that the chapters focusing on that work are not very exciting. Mcfeely spends a lot of ink detailing his journies on the stump and his meetings with many characters who were part of the American and English anti-slavery movements. Douglass's life flow, when examined chronologically, produces a story of varying degrees of drama. Although any biograhpher is limited by his character, I had the feeling throughout that Douglass's life could be told with more verve without sacrificing the facts.What McFeely should have jettisoned were several parts where he delved into psychobabble -- speculations about sexual attraction or the depth of feeling between Douglass and several figures in his life. Human feelings and attractions are an important part of any biography and certainly shaped Douglass's life. McFeeley speculates on several without any facts to support his views. These are relegated to the first half of the book and do not intrude greatly, however.If one needs or wants to learn about the life of this great American, McFeeley's book will fill the bill."},{"Title":"Frederick Douglass","review":"I am curious to know the previous reviewer found William McFeely's observations/analysis of Frederick Douglas racist. I too found a lot of overly subjective tones within the work of Mr. McFeely's analysis of Frederick Douglas, but I also found that his analysis captured, for me, Frederick Douglas' strong positive character, and sense of universal humanity. Mr. McFeely's analysis, while in some instances deductive, yet subjective in others, presented a man - not a God, who held fast to is universal convictions, but who was also subject to human frailties. Mr. McFeely's analysis of Douglas has reinforced my admiration in Frederick Douglas even more."},{"Title":"Frederick Douglass","review":"I have just finished reading this book & as a white person didn't find it at all racist but perhaps I am missing some things? McFeely is a Pulitzer Prize wining author (for his bio of Grant) & a professor of literature at the University Of Georgia..It seemed to me meticulously researched & very scholarly. Much is taken from The writings of Douglass. The author is very discreet about Douglass's personal relationships because there is nothing to factually support anything definitive. His first wife & mother of his 5 children was certainly not his intellectual equal & they had nothing in common except for race & their children.After Lincoln's death, Andrew Johnson became president & he was a real southern bigot. Douglass began seeing all the great hopes he had of moving forward being slowly unravelled.I found it very interesting that all the liberal forward moving attitudes came from the North. The North was not without much de facto segregation , but compared to the South, it was a paradise!The states of the Confederacy have rewritten history & have up to the present time been an albatross around our country's neck.Douglass died just as new laws of Jim Crow were being enacted & right before the Supreme Court said separate but equal was legal. How can one understand why these 9 men (at the time) were so warped in their thinking. How could anything be equal when one group is separated legally from another because of race? What about having separate facilities for blue eyed people & brown eyed people.?I was glad he got a post in Haiti as some sort of recognition but it wasn't the best place for a man of his immense talents.I never heard of Ida B Wells until I read this book but she was the author of legislation to stop lynching and , among others, carried the torch for him after he was too old to go on. Very tragic that he could not have lived to see Obama as our wonderful President.Douglass was for universal human rights but many women suffragists (Susan B Anthony for one) felt that granting males universal suffrage wouldn't be acceptable because half the population would still be disenfranchised. When Douglass married his second wife, Helen Pitts, a white woman who was really his companion & helper, Elizabeth Cady Stanton wrote them a congratulatory letter but Anthony told her not to make it public for fear of losing the support of southern white women. Was Anthony a racist? I really don't think so but she certainly was politically practical about her MAIN goal of the vote for all women equal to men.Within 20 years, slavery by another name was being enforced in the deep South with Jim Crow laws & chain gangs \\"renting out\\" convict labor.I would like someone to tell me what they thought racist in this book because I didn't see it.am I just obtuse?"},{"Title":"Frederick Douglass","review":"I, also, cannot understand why the first reader found this biography on Fredrick Douglass, racist.

While some chapters deal with specific disabilities, others provide more general valuable information for all parents of children with disabilities (e.g. how to deal with emotions, managing the relationships with medical professionals, the education process, legal rights and how to care for your child throughout his/her lifetime).The book provides sound expert advice to all parents of a child with a disability - from choosing and visiting doctors to communicating with and feeding your child to dealing with common and not-so-common medical problems to understanding legal and educational rights and benefits. That advice will help parents to appropriately act on behalf of the child. While providing critical information on caring for your child, the authors let parents know that the parents are in charge because nobody knows our children better. The knowlegde from this book will empower parents to do what they believe is in the best interest of the child.This book is a signifcant resource and a &quot;must read&quot; for any parent of a child with a disability.

Relevant and reliable, it is the most comprehensive overview for parents of special needs children that has been published to date.A well rounded resource like this has been needed for parents for a long time, and Dr. Batshaw has done an remarkable job at fulfilling this need. Crucial topics are covered which are rarely addressed adequately, but are vital to children with special needs - for example, feeding, visual impairment, teeth and dental care.As moderator of mailing lists on Adoption (from Vietnam) and Prematurity, it is rare that I can recommend a book for both groups, but this is one that meets the needs of many parents.When Your Child Has a Disability covers four major areas - Getting the Diagnosis, Growing Up with a Disability, Developmental Disabilities, and a brief section called What the Future Holds. Each chapter in these sections is authored by an experienced practitioner in the field. They provide an concise overview for each subject, an explanation of the terminology, and a number of practical suggestions for your child.The section on Growing Up with a Disability covers topics vital to parents of children with special needs, such as nutrition and feeding, dental care, and encouraging appropriate behavior. Specific disabilities are covered in the Developmental Disability section, including many disabilities linked to prematurity. Twelve developmental disabilities are addressed - cerebral palsy, hearing loss, autism, mental retardation, visual impairment, communication disorders, learning disorders, down syndrome, genetic syndromes, spina bifida, and epilepsy.For parents of children who have special needs (or are &quot;at risk&quot; for developmental disabilities), When Your Child Has a Disability is invaluable. .

The novel is about how Austin grows up and away from his roots of fundamentalist Christianity. His father taught him that anyone named Adams is a direct descendant of Adam and Eve. While teaching Austin to say bedtime prayers his father terrified him with stories of hell's fire and brimstone, which reminded me of a scary childhood prayer in which I asked an angel of God \\"to take me to heaven if I should die before I wake.\\" I cheered Austin as he angered his father with unanswerable questions about Adam and Eve and Neanderthals, and how WAS Noah able to save all the animals in the flood.The story ended in 1984 with the re-election of Ronald Reagan. As each year is introduced we learned of historical events in the United States and the world and how they affected Austin's life and those of his family and friends, or not. I loved tweaking my memory as Austin or his parents listened to the radio, went to the movies, watched TV, or read \\"Life Magazine\\" (while doubting that someone like Austin's father would really allow it in the house.)I taught American history, but there was much I learned in the items Timmons included in the march of history from the thirties to the mid-eighties. For example, how Communism with its atheism caused such fear in the Pope and many of the Christian world that they allied themselves with facsism; how Hitler gained favor with both the Catholic Church and the Protestants by granting them tax privileges and allowing them to teach Christian spirit and moral law in public schools as long as they praised the Reich and the Fuehrer in the churches; how a segment of US population hated Roosevelt; and how our presidents have used alignment and special privileges with Christianity to pursue their political aims.Austin studied the Catholic Church in detail as he romanced a Catholic co-ed at PGSC. He concluded that the Catholic Church invented Christianity. He reminded his Baptist dad who ranted against Catholics that the Bible he put all his faith in would not have existed without the Holy Roman Catholic Church. The people he met led him and us through a study of Judaism, Mormonism, Rosecruceanism, Rastafarianism, existentialism, and Buddhism, and other religious philosophies.His professor,Gus Eriksen, at PGSC taught Austin to evaluate any concept by three rules: 1. Define the terms clearly;(If the hypothesis can't be defined, throw it out.); 2.Is the concept testable?,(If there is no way to test the hypothesis, then throw it out.)and :(3)If there is not enough evidence, or the evidence doesn't support the hypothesis, then throw it out. Could there be a man like Gus teaching at a small state Texas college? Well, people like Gus ARE sometimes found in unusual places as I have discovered in my life.Anyway, I truly enjoyed this novel. It was a wonderful mental experience."},{"Title":"Regarding an Angel's Flight: The vast saga of one man's search for the truth - and of those who tried to stop him","review":"This is a disturbing story of a young man's moral development through his relationship with several emotionally dysfunctional females, a psychologically unstable father who is a minister, his acquaintanes during a stint in the navy, and a college professor whose beliefs are totally out of sync with those in a University, located in a small East Texas town filled with rednecks and anti-intellectual. The story would be best described as the biography of an atheist or the case against Christianity. Major events that reflect the changing moral values of the country are all focused on the small community of Pinegrove and include anti-war demonstrations, civil rights marches, KKK activities and confrontations associated with integration.The author does an interesting job of integrating world events into the story of the disillusionment of a young man on his path to atheism. The current events emphasize the enlightenment of America from a liberal point of view and at the same time takes the reader through a history of the movies and television. A murder mystery is an underlying theme in the story and keeps the reader turning the pages to the very end.This is a shocking story that will shake the faith of any believer. Virtually every religious belief is scrutinized until the story comes to its disturbing conclusion."},{"Title":"Regarding an Angel's Flight: The vast saga of one man's search for the truth - and of those who tried to stop him","review":"This book brilliantly interweaves all the big issues of politics, science, religion, and philosophy, as they have evolved over the last half century, and as they have affected the lives of a colorful and diverse cast of characters.I particularly appreciated the way the author made each character so believable and three-dimensional; I almost felt that I actually knew these people.Those of a certain age should also enjoy remembering &quot;the way we were&quot; -- reflected through movies, radio programs, TV, songs, clothing, cars, architecture, slang, etc.The book was such a feast of sights, sounds and other sensory delights that one reading is not really enough. A very satisfying experience."},{"Title":"Regarding an Angel's Flight: The vast saga of one man's search for the truth - and of those who tried to stop him","review":"Weaving 20th century history with a fictitious biography, a young man goes through a spiritual journey as the nation itself comes of age.

Some of the carefully researched facts have not been previously known by the typical American including myself. It also gave some very interesting facts about many different religions and how they have been used to obtain and hold power. It partly felt like a 1933 - 1984 fictional version of A People's History of the United States. The characters in this book brought the entire scene to life in brilliant color. There are rich descriptions of all aspects of human life!!I highly recommend this book for anyone!"},{"Title":"Regarding an Angel's Flight: The vast saga of one man's search for the truth - and of those who tried to stop him","review":"This grand and sweeping story depicts the decades of the 30s through the 80s in the United States through the eyes of Austin Adams as he grows up and as he grows in understanding.Throughout this whole period, as background for the reader, Adams' personal activities are set against the historical information the author intersperses. This information is helpful even for those who've lived through these times as well as for readers trying to get the whole picture. This is so even as Adams' actions and the settings also give us background and are informative in the various scenes by themselves. The intermittent explanations only add dimension.News clippings and directly quoted material provide a unique take on the period, helping us see how reporters, especially undercover, non mainstream ones have viewed the era as it advances and changes. Quotes from historians only enhance the actions of Adams as he goes through various periods of his life. He's shown as a small boy, as a small town college student, a serviceman, a San Francisco hippie and a Los Angeles Counterculture seeker, among other stages in his quest.The Story of Adams' childhood comes wonderfully alive. We are treated to a portrayal of small town life in Texas in the 30's. Boys will be boys and Austin has a personal life with friends away from his bible-quoting, small-minded, abusive parents. His elaborate \\"fort' serves many purposes in addition to a place to hang out and read comics. It makes a good hiding place, too, when circumstances make that necessary.An early friendship with a young girl becomes a budding romance over time, but it comes to an end in a way that will haunt Adams throughout the rest of his life.Adams life is a journey toward understanding. The many characters he comes across each add to his growing body of philosophical and psychological understandings. Each of the many characters is drawn skillfully by the author. They interact with Adams in realistic ways. They serve to tell his story in full ways, not as mere conduits for the various philosophies they espouse. There is the Brooklyn-accented, existentially inclined girlfriend; the Catholic, oddly inhibited yet uninhibited girlfriend who mystifies him while showing him the pernicious influence of her religion; and many more, both male and female.It's impossible to cover the many characters, but particularly worth noting is the influence of the fellows he meets in the service. Each adds a piece to his personal philosophy and their antics add to his understanding of the human psyche. Each contributes to Adams' leaving his parent's Baptist religion farther and farther behind, as he widens his experiences on his voyage toward rationality.The professor in his small college town plays the biggest part. He is instructor, mentor, and reason for Adams to come near the end of his adventure in California, near the cable cars.If the name of the cable car route shows us that Adams is an innocent angel in a corrupt and incomprehensible world, then the end of this story, back in Texas where he begins his flight, is all too apt.This is a worthwhile book, entertaining and with a point of view. Rationality over superstition is to be sought after no matter what the price or the consequences."},{"Title":"Regarding an Angel's Flight: The vast saga of one man's search for the truth - and of those who tried to stop him","review":"This novel was the fascinating story of a young man's individuation from the values of his family-- and how his views of life and self evolved (and were shaped by) the major world events of his time.

She is not afraid to reveal the ugly underbelly that lies beneath the surface in many families nor does she shy away from taking a shot at the American legal system, which allows divorces to drag on for years.\\"The people, the ones who elect the officials, believe those who should monitor the courts, are judging in behalf of the people's welfare,\\" she says in \`Raging Silence.' \\"No one in the system watches, though, and the big, big mess keeps on spinning.\\"The book is largely character-based with the family dynamic at its centre. It begins shortly after the young couple, Melena and Ernest, have had their first child, Blackwell. Within a few years two more children, Luke and Elizabeth, complete their family. The new mother is full of hope for the future, vowing that she will have a happy family, but her husband's infidelity soon turns her into a bitter, resentful woman with a mind full of thoughts of revenge. Years of turmoil ensue while the Starlings attempt to hide their problems from the outside world; they pretend they are the perfect family, but secrets are tearing them apart.One of these secrets is that Elizabeth is sexually abused as a young girl by her Uncle Leopold, who has Down's syndrome and is seen as a harmless child-like figure by the rest of the family. The secret tears her apart, causing her emotional and physical pain until she finally admits what happened to her after having blocked it out for years.Having lived through similar experiences, Stone is able to put all of her personal pain on the page. She says she hopes that by telling her story, she will give others the courage to come forward with their experience of abuse and start their own journeys towards healing.Having grown up in North Carolina, Stone's southern U.S. influence is strongly apparent in her writing style. As I was reading, the lilting language conjured up images of the South and the narrative spoke to me with a distinctive drawl. I was reminded of other great American authors, such as Barbara Kingsolver, Pat Conroy and Sheri Reynolds... Stone can proudly take her place in their company.\`Raging Silence' is a novel which takes on huge issues and succeeds at sharing a poignant family story. It is highly relatable and beautifully written. The subject matter should not be shoved under the rug and neither should this novel."},{"Title":"Raging Silence: A Novel in Five Acts","review":"In 1964, Melena Dupree Staring is dwelling atop an isolated Appalachian mountain, but she is a city girl, as she informs her infant son, Blackwell. Her husband, Ernest is leaving his family to go to his job, a seemingly normal enough condition, although it will appear excessive and pathologic as this tale progresses. Later that day, Melena tells her only neighbors, two old \\"granny\\" spinsters, about an unusual and frightening event which occurred that morning while she was hanging clothes. She heard noises in the brush and was frightened into running for her porch, where she watched as a red fox came out and stole her nightgown. The shared wisdom of her neighbors is, \\"That's not all you'll likely lose....You live on a living breathing mountain now, darling, not in the city....you have to watch for bears.\\" Ernest has left his family to be eaten by bears. How can Melena forgive him? Forgiveness is to be an issue for Melena.Years pass and children are added to the Starling clan: a middle child, son Luke; and the least one, daughter Elizabeth. Melena's list of Ernest's sins (real and perceived) and her peeves and disappointments with her children also grow over time. Ernest and Melena split up and get back together and somewhat try to maintain a proper public image.Blackwell and Luke have an outlet via racing, a hobby their father shares and one that Melena does not outright deny them. Elizabeth is perpetually denied this outlet, \\"it's not ladylike.\\" Elizabeth, who has always felt like the extra cog in the household, discovers a secret about her birth. This discovery, plus the family's dysfunctions, added to a more intimate family secret, one which she believes is so terrible that she must bear it in silence, sends Elizabeth in new and less conventional directions than her brothers will travel and than her parents can approve.Ernest and Melena eventually engage in the FINAL divorce. It is strategically maneuvered, much like the Seven Years' War, by their apparently interdependent lawyers. It leaves casualties in its wake, much in the same way as did that war and as do all wars. Melena's hatred for Ernest cannot be assuaged and grows more blindly irrational, as she attempts to force the children to chose to side either wholly with her or wholly with Ernest--there can be no middle ground or neutrality.Meanwhile, Elizabeth goes on with her life and discovers some surprising things about relationships and about self. She finds that the entire world is not based on hate and secrets. This knowledge can either overwhelm her or save her.***** I've been reading \\"grown-up\\" books for over forty years...literally, thousands of books from different literary genre, from multiple cultures and differing historical periods. Never in those decades, and never through those thousands of books, plays, poems, and other literary efforts, have I been as emotionally effected as I was by Raging Silence: A Novel In Five Acts. The quote from John Marston's Antonio's Revenge at the beginning of Act I (\\"Never More Woe in Lesser Plot was Found\\") should have been a forewarning. But even having read and recalled Marston's tragedy and its bloody nature did not prepare me for what Amanda Stone was about to do to my psyche.In the beginning of Raging Silence, I sensed I didn't like the book, but could find no firm reason for this. Continuing on, the feelings intensified to those of discomfort and dislike. By the end of the second third of Act I, I hated the book, because I understood what was really happening--the characters and the situations in Raging Silence were akin to those of my own experiences. Amanda Stone was slicing off the emotional scars, peeling away the psychic scabs, and laying raw the parts of my soul that had been traumatically and painfully damaged during my life. These were parts of me I had worked so hard to either heal or to wall off into a state of blessed amnesia-induced analgesia. Now, thanks to Raging Silence, they were ripped open and exposed for me to suffer them anew.I stumbled to the end of Act I and, for the first and only time in my life, was so emotionally overwhelmed by a book I wasn't sure that I'd be able to pick it up and continue reading it!Amanda Stone's novel had proven so emotionally overwhelming that one of my friends couldn't make it past Act I.Raging Silence is a tale of growing up and living in families. Families have rules. Some are overt. Some are unspoken, but just as powerful as and sometimes even more powerful than the enunciated rules. Certain public behaviors are expected, no matter what the stressors are in the supposed privacy of the home. Parents have the illusions or delusions their children exist in a vacuum, oblivious of paternal conflicts and other strife. Parents are often oblivious to the lives of their children, because they cannot accept them as thinking, feeling, independent, and individual human beings. Another anger arising in relationships is the rage smoldering from compromising too often or too much, and from laying aside or sublimating individual dreams and desires to keep peace in the relationship--as Melena was warned when the sly fox stole from her, so it goes with marriage, \\"That's not all you'll likely lose.\\" Ms. Stone's characters show us we often lose a bit of ourselves in so many of life's dealings. Amanda Stone uses Raging Silence to lay bare these family and individual truths and much, much more; just as a skilled surgeon exposes a malignant tumor for what it is. After the reader endures the pain of her exposing this malignant condition, like a good physician or a fine writer, she offers something that we all crave and something that is essential to healing...hope. Not \\"happily every after\\"...just hope. Ultimately, despite all of the rage and pain found within the pages of the book, some of it unconquerable, Amanda Stone's Raging Silence: A Novel In Five Acts is about healing oneself and offering love and healing to those whom you love and care about--it is a book about a future of promise, not about focusing on perpetuating failure.I unreservedly award the highest rating possible to Raging Silence: A Novel In Five Acts by Amanda Stone. This is not just a book of interest for readers of one geographical region, of one specific gender, or of one particular ethnic background. This is an ecumenical book about the hearts and souls of individuals and their universal struggles to live and survive within families. In short, it is a book for all adults and mature teenagers. I eagerly await the next literary offering from Amanda Stone, the only author to ever stop me cold in my tracks with the emotional power of her craft and her tale. *****Reviewed by Dr. Phil Rhyne of Huntress Reviews."},{"Title":"Raging Silence: A Novel in Five Acts","review":"I chose this because the main character shares my name!!

We meetMelena, Ernest and shortly after their three children,Blackwell, Luke and Elizabeth. As with most of us their dream is for a happy healthy family, but this is not to be the case.Deep emotional subjects are laid bare in this work, one being the sexual abuse of Elizabeth and the ripples this caused as the secret is unveiled. This work touches on areas that some may feel uncomfortable with because we, as a society, wish to shove these under the rug and hope they will go away, they will not. The story shows how acts committed on family members and the way they are handled have reaching effects that span through time and touch more than the victim.In \\"Raging Silence,\\" you will find a tale that is open and honest in uncovering the covered; a story of family, love, fear and basically life itself in all its glory.

He remains one of the most philosophical novelists of the late 20th century, and his first novel, The Moviegoer, is widely acknowledged as one of the masterpieces of contemporary literature. This collection covers Percy's major interests over the span of his career: the literally miraculous ability of humans to communicate with language, the unique qualities of Southern writing (and why, for instance, there are no great Los Angeles novelists or Zen Buddhist novelists), and the curious fact that late-twentieth century western man is bored, weary, and sad, despite living in the most affluent period in human history.Like C. S. Lewis, Percy became a Christian after spending his young adult years as a confirmed atheist. For this reason, he is particularly adept at addressing the intellectual impediments to belief. His work is the perfect antidote to those who think that smart people don't believe in God. He was also a scientist, having been trained as a medical doctor. Science, he believed, has discovered how the universe works but has been unable to address the most important fact of our existence: that each of us is a self-aware human being who will one day die. Percy was profoundly influenced by Kierkegaard and thus has been called a Christian existentialist, though he finds the term has become meaningless through overuse.This is a fascinating overview of Percy's ideas.

I happen to think that Percy is one of this country's more underappreciated novelists and men of letters. \\"The Moviegoer\\", in particular, is a classic of American literature from the second half of the 20th Century. But, as these essays demonstrate, Percy was not only a novelist, he was a relatively deep thinker, concerned with science versus art, religion and morality, language and semiotics, psychiatry, the South and \\"the New South\\", as well as literature.The earliest essay in the book is from 1935, the latest from 1990. Most of the essays, and the best of the essays, are from 1968 through 1986. Not surprisingly, some of the essays are, in whole or in part, now rather dated. Percy's \\"essay voice\\" is relatively informal and easy to read, but he does not modulate it very much from piece to piece so that, when three or more pieces are read in succession, a measure of monotony creeps in.Most of us, I suspect, believe we live in unusually unsettled and unsettling times. So it was with Percy too. He believed that \\"the modern world had ended\\" and that \\"society has been overtaken by a sense of malaise rather than exuberance, by fragmentation rather than wholeness.\\" He further believed that the function of art was cognitive, and that the novelist's duty in these troubled times was to engage in a sort of diagnostic enterprise. That perspective informs the title of this collection of essays, which is further explicated in the following quote from Percy: \\"Instead of constructing a plot and creating a cast of characters from a world familiar to everybody, [the novelist] is more apt to set forth with a stranger in a strange land where the signposts are enigmatic but which he sets out to explore nevertheless.\\"Actually, from the retrospective vantage point of 2011, the terrain and many of the signposts encountered in this book are not so very strange. Still, it is a book worth reading, or at least dipping in and sampling. I was not converted by any of Percy's larger philosophical constructs, but many of his \\"smaller\\" and less abstract comments I found worth noting and marking in pencil (I always use pencil), including things he had to say about Charles Sanders Peirce, Soren Kierkegaard, William Faulkner, Herman Melville, Fyodor Dostoevsky, and his own novels (especially \\"The Moviegoer\\"). I also enjoyed a piece he wrote for \\"Esquire\\" on bourbon whiskey, which included the following paragraph:\\"The pleasure of knocking back Bourbon lies in the plane of the aesthetic but at an opposite pole from connoisseurship. My preference for the former is or is not deplorable depending on one's value system--that is to say, how one balances out the Epicurean values of cultivating one's sensory end organs with the greatest discrimination and at least cost to one's health, against the virtue of evocation of time and memory and of the recovery of self and the past from the fogged-in disoriented Western world. In Kierkegaardian terms, the use of Bourbon to such an end is a kind of aestheticized religious mode of existence, whereas connoisseurship * * * is the aesthetic of damnation.\\"If that appeals to you, you are a potential reader of SIGNPOSTS IN A STRANGE LAND. If it doesn't, maybe you should steer clear. But I can vouch for Percy's recipe for mint juleps, which I tried out four days ago at a mini-family gathering after burying my aunt after her 96 years in this strange land."},{"Title":"Signposts in a Strange Land: Essays","review":"a better title for this book might be, strange signposts in an otherwise interesting world.

Of the fourteen stories reprinted in ALFRED HITCHCOCK'S GAMES KILLERS PLAY (1968), only six struck me as well done: August Derleth's \\"The China Cottage\\" (one of his better Solar Pons stories), Helen Nielson's \\"Pattern of Guilt\\" (about a crime reporter with a personal problem), Hal Ellson's \\"Room to Let\\" (about a female serial killer), Talmadge Powell's \\"Heist in Pianissimo\\" (about a clever bank robbery), \\"Richard Hardwick's \\"Wish You Were Here\\" (about a revenge killer), and best of all Henry Slesar's \\"Murder Delayed\\" (about a man with an inoperable bullet in him).Six middling stories are Nedra Tyre's \\"Killed by Kindness\\" (about a discontented married couple), James Holding's \\"You Can't Be Too Careful\\" (about a burglary job that goes bad), Michael Brett's \\"Willie Betts, Banker\\" (about revenge on a loan shark), Donald E. Westlake's \\"The Feel of a Trigger\\" (about a detective's tender sympathies for both victims and killers), Jack Ritchie's \\"Captive Audience\\" (dealing with a man's luck in solving who kidnapped him), and Robert Edmond Alter's \\"Double Trouble\\" (about a wife-killer outsmarting himself). Each of these stories was marred by some excess or defect or factual error, and most were far too predictable in their outcomes.The worst two stories were Duane Decker's \\"Weighty Problem\\" (in which a criminal is overfed at a hospital) and Jonathan Craig's \\"Bus to Chattanooga\\" (in which a beautiful young mountain girl is able to escape her life with an abusive uncle). Both of these stories are so completely implausible that the only real mysteries are why they were ever accepted by the editors of ALFRED HITCHCOCK'S MYSTERY MAGAZINE and why they were chosen to be included in this anthology.Incidentally, despite the clever title of this book--which is a play on the title of a self-help book by Eric Berne, GAMES PEOPLE PLAY (1964)--three of these fourteen stories do NOT involve anyone being killed."},{"Title":"The House Love Built: Foundation for Love/Love's Open Door/Once Upon an Attic/Mending Fences (Inspirational Romance Collection)","review":"Built around the development of this house, four novellas are arranged by four authors who interweave them expertly.

Through short, funny vignettes than span decades, the reader comes to know the Cantonese Lums of Orange County, CA. In this short book, the reader gets to know three decades of the Lum family in surprising detail.Chieng's timeline jumps around. It opens with Louis, the protagonist, adrift and barely thriving in his post-college job as a magazine fact checker. He is forced to move in with his gansta-rap loving dad, Sonny, to keep Sonny from trying to kill the man who accidentally killed his wife in a car accident. When Chieng fills in the backstory of Sonny's boyhood, Sonny's marriage to Louis's mom Mirla, uncle Bo's relationship with Grandma Esther, and the relationship between Granpa Melvin and Esther, the story truly comes alive. The family is unintentionally hilarious on all levels, from Louis's attempts to speak Cantonese with the correct inflection, to Sonny's love of rap, to Grandma Esther's famously dreadful turnip cakes.This book comes highly recommended along with the other Breakout Books of 2005."},{"Title":"A Long Stay in a Distant Land","review":"In this fine debut novel, Chieh Chieng explores the off-beat characters of a Chinese-American family through three generations living in Orange County, California. Louis Lum is a recent college graduate working as an underpaid fact-checker at a hot rod magazine, not the kind of position his mother Mirla had hoped for him. Louis once reveled in rebelling against his mother; however, Mirla has recently died in a car accident, brought on when an overworked medical student, Hersey Collins, fell asleep behind the wheel, and Louis feels guilty at having disappointed her. Louis's father Sonny calls Louis every night and threatens to murder Hersey to avenge Mirla's death. Because Louis does not know how serious his father is about his intentions, he moves in and stays up late with his father, listening to his father's rap records, keeping him from stabbing Hersey, and trying to figure him out. Meanwhile Louis's feisty grandmother Esther is worried about her youngest son Bo, who moved to Hong Kong years ago and who recently has severed all communication with her. Eventually, Esther convinces Louis to travel to Hong Kong to track down Bo to see if he is really \\"alive and in good health\\" while Esther watches over Sonny to make sure he doesn't follow through on his threats.The narrative weaves multiple points-of-view throughout the generations to give a full portrait of this quirky family. The Lums are an eccentric, unintentionally hilarious lot, caught up more in their American life than in their Chinese ancestry. After all, Sonny is more adamant about blacks respecting their culture by listening to gangsta rap than he is about the truths and myths about his own. Louis speaks Cantonese so badly that, for his whole life, he has been unintentionally calling his father \\"Old Bean\\" instead of \\"Old Man.\\" Esther makes the worst turnip cakes ever cooked, botching the traditional recipe so badly that everyone ends up with stomach aches. The story leaps backward and forward in time, from character to character, in a collage that coalesces around Louis, the youngest surviving member of a family prone to premature deaths.Chieh Chieng brings all this together with a dry wit and an eye for the absurd. The understated humor never demeans his characters and instead makes them more lovable. The result is an entertaining, heartfelt book about one family's oddities and how those quirks come to define them."},{"Title":"A Long Stay in a Distant Land","review":"Chieh Chieng's \\"A Long Stay in a Distant Land\\" is written with a structure reminiscent of Faye Myenne Ng's \\"Bone\\", jumping between acts or scenes scattered over many years, but it doesn't have the same narrative flow, the sense of inevitability as Ng's teller decides what more needs to be said at each point, peeling away layers of incident and family history, circling in on the central event of her sister's suicide. Though the chapters here are all related as part of the Lum family story, they are almost independent short stories, vignettes or even sidebars, without a similar central organizing question.Formally, the main character is young Louis Lum, and the book revolves around two problems in the \\"now\\", 2002. Louis's mother Mirla recently died in an accident caused by a sleepy driver, whom his father Sonny is threatening to kill, so Louis moves in with Sonny to prevent his doing something foolish. Also, Sonny's brother Uncle Bo moved to Hong Kong years ago and married there, but after his wife died Bo, never a great communicator, dropped totally out of touch, refusing contact; halfway through the book, Louis volunteers to go to HK and look for Bo.Scattered in among these threads, and at times overwhelming them, we are given snapshots of family history going back to the courting and marriage of Louis's's grandparents, Melvin Lum (long dead) and Esther, now the family matriarch. Melvin's decision, much to the dismay of his family and new bride, to enlist in the army in WWII not only forms a chapter, but is part of the family gestalt.\\"Long Stay\\" is written with humor and a cast of quirky, quietly bizarre characters. Louis is convinced that a personalized Death is stalking his family, unleashing a string of unexpected deaths (listed on page 20) as revenge for the \\"steel rain of death\\" Melvin himself had unleashed during the war. Sonny is an ardent fan of gangsta rap, and a man of \\"unclear livelihood.\\"The writing is fun, but overly clever and self-conscious, striving too hard for effect. E.g., \\"That night, Louis dreamed of Jesus in the corporeal form of Max von Sydow standing in one corner of a boxing ring. ... The Son of Man unleashed a spin kick that landed square on the left side of Death's face....\\" It's a little too obvious that Chieng \\"graduated from a creative writing program\\" (UC Irvine) as the bio says.Still, in all, it's an excellent freshman effort, and Chieng is an author worth watching."},{"Title":"A Long Stay in a Distant Land","review":"I loved this novel. \\"The Lums of Orange County\\" rank up there with \\"The Simpsons\\" as a family epitomizing the adage: truth is stranger than fiction. Unlike the cartoon version, this family is flesh and blood. The descriptions of inter-generational conflicts and culture clashes is superb. For example, Luis who grew up in California likes to eat with a knife and fork, whereas his father insists on the cultural, utilitarian, and aesthetic superiority of chopsticks. This coming from a middle-aged man heavily into rap music, who fantasizes about killing the driver responsible for the accidental death of his wife. It is one of those contradictions that make the characters in this novel so alive. If your family is from another culture and you live in Southern California you will identify with the unassuming, long-suffering Luis. The transition to Hong Kong adds another dimension to this saga, representing as it does a longed-for journey into our lost cultural heritage. Still seductive despite, or because of, the almost certain disillusionment awaiting us there."},{"Title":"A Long Stay in a Distant Land","review":"I enjoyed this book immensely. I bought it because it was recommended in the NY Times book review and am glad I did. Mr. Chieng's characters are complicated but presented simply. His novel has both tragedy and comedy.

The gothic elements are all in place and yet are downplayed, not overemphasized. The suspense starts from the moment of arrival at the \\"dark, gloomy mansion\\", and it comes across like thunder in a rainstorm: you know it's coming, yet when it gets there...wow!The heroine has a personality that guarantees you'll like her from the start, someone you'd want for a friend in real life. Most heroines in these novels are either too sweet and nice (in other words, boring) or too feisty and independent (in other words, bitchy) but in this story she's just naturally likeable, just enough sweetness, just enough spirit, not overdone either way.The dialogue is witty, the author having a sense of humor as well as a good insight into personality and characterization; again, real people no overdone stereotypes.There's some British history thrown in as well.

It's a funny caracature of what really happens in construction equipment sales."},{"Title":"The Starch Blocker Diet","review":"...The book describes a progrom that explains how you can eat carbohydrates like rice, pasta, bread and potatoes and lose weight. You lose the weight by taking a starchblocker. This calorie neutralizing substance called Phase 2 binds with the enzymes that digest starch. So when you take it with your meals most starch passes through your system without releasing calories. Phase 2 is made from white kidney beans and is very safe with no side effects aside from minor bloating or gas for some people.The authors outline a 3 step program. You redistribute your calories so you eat more starchy foods so you will neutralize some of those calories. You learn to take emotional control of your eating and you burn body fat by exercising.The authors state that by taking the correct dose of the product Phase 2. you will negate about 50%-75% of the starch calories in a carbohydrate meal. If you eat carbohydrate rich meals and take the supplement several times per day you will negate those calories thus be eating less calories and lose weight... In one study, patients lost an average of 3.9% of total body weight or an average of 6.45 pounds over 30 days compared to those on a placebo who lost 3 quarters of a pound. Another study shows a weight loss of .5 to 1 pound per week using the starch blockers...The biggest qualm I had with the book is it is not consistent with other informations as to when to take the starch blockers. The book says right before a meal. At the website of the starch blocker the authors sell it says take 30 minutes before (yes the authors sell starch blockers). So exactly when to take it is unclear. And very important for someone to know to have success with the plan.After checking with representatives from several different brands and getting a number of different answers I learned that in the study the supplement was taken 30 minutes before.The authors also make a few errors in the text. They refer to 40% protein 30% fat 30% carbohydrate being a typical low carb diet..when the actual ratios are 40% carb, 30% protein and 30% fat. On p. 69 they refer to gymnema sylvestre as a sugar blocker that is not readily available. Gymnema Sylvestre is marketed not as a sugar blocker but as a way to make it so your taste buds don't taste the sweet so you don't enjoy it. It's still available at health food stores. They suggest you supplement with chromium but do not specify chromium picolinate or chromium polynicotinate. They also tell you not to take more that 6 capsules a day of starch blockers. Yet in examples given they neutralize the calories from 3 meals and 2 snacks each day. Starch blockers have to be taken near the meal to work. So this would have you taking more than 6 starch blockers per day. The authors also suggest you switch your calories to more starchy ones so you can then block them. But this does not teach healthy eating habits. Perhaps it is better to try to control your intake of the energy dense starcy carbs like potatoes and bread and use the blockers as an additional helpmate.The authors email addresses are given at the back of the book and I emailed both of them. But unfortunately, neither returned my emails to answer my questions. Finally I emailed customer service where the Dr. Rosenblatt the author sells his product (starchstoppers are sold under a variety of brand names) and a super representative named Susan answered my questions.Skepticism aside there are a lot of good points in the book. The authors discuss how for many folks starch blockers are very helpful in combating the intolerance to carbohydrates. Many folks bloat up when they eat carbs in reasonable amounts and the authors explain how the blockers can help with this.The book details how to determine your calorie level based on your size and activity. It lists a lot of foods and their starch content so you can plan your own meals. It also rates foods based on how effective they would be on the starch blocker plan. \\"If a food contains a high amount of starch it is given a better grade\\" I did not find this list that useful. For example eggs are given a B but they dont have starch so I think the list is based more on what is healthy for you than the starch content of the item.The book also includes a number of recipes from a French Chef including, hot crab sandwhich, chocolate hazelnut shortcake, chicken paprika, and a number of other tasty meals.I often bloat when I eat small amounts of carbs and my stomach looks it. So I decided to try the starch blocker program. After just a few days on the program I felt less bloated (my imagination perhaps?) but have not lost any weight. However, it does take time. This is not a magic pill, its a helper. Thus it will be a while before I can clearly attest to the book or starchstoppers effectiveness. When I know for sure I will update this review. Meantime I have my fingers crossed and my starchblocker on hand!UPDATE - I personally did not notice any difference after taking the starch blockers except less money in my purse. I feel the best course of action to lose weight is exercise and eating real food in small quantities. There is no magic pill."},{"Title":"The Starch Blocker Diet","review":"If you are tired of low/no carb diets and and still want to lose weight say hooray for this book and starchblockers. The book has some helpful info in it but mostly it serves to motivate you to get started. The effect of taking the starchblockers seems to be:1 you don't absorb the calories from the starchy food we all eat and love2 you seem to crave these foods less and be satisfied with normal size porions. This may also be because you take the starchblockers with a large glass of water before you eat so they probably fill you up some.3 the starchblockers ameliorate adverse reactions to carbs especially bloating and gas.4. The guilt goes away because you can eat what you like without toturing yourself about it. So food becomes just food, not the enemy or the unattainable pleasure.Of course taking the starchblockers is not a oppotunity to just sit around and eat whole loaves of Wonder Bread. The author encourages exercise and balanced eating. And again without a high protein/fat low carb emphasis or any super special meal preparations. Eating in restaurants and packing your sandwhich for lunch once again become doable and fun.I have taken them and they really work. Of course not as dramatcally as they are advertised to but they do work. And that is the good news. The other news is that you have to keep taking them with every starchy meal. I think 3 or 4 times a day for any supplement of this sort is a bit much. You can choose to eat non starch meals (veggies, fruit protein etc) or low starch meals and that way moderate the amount of the starch blockers that you take if you share these concerns.But that is the only down side I have discovered.And yay for being able to eat, happily, and enjoy popcorn and mased potatoes again and still lose weight!"},{"Title":"The Starch Blocker Diet","review":"This is not just another Weight Loss book! It is a guide to healthy eating and living!It is an instruction manual for the body and how different foods affect your energy, mood, alertness and general health. When reading the book I was reminded of the phrase, \\"You Are What You Eat\\". When I first opened the book, I was initially disappointed with what I thought was \\"fluff\\". I thought I was buying a book that would tell me straight out, \\"Eat this or eat that\\". However, after reading the first couple of pages in the introduction, I was glad I didn't get the type of book I had expected-I just could not put it down. The Authors mix health education with mystery and history to make this book a wonderful read. Several times while I was reading, my jaw dropped over some of the information.I had tried Starch Blockers in the 1980's just before the FDA pulled them but I did not know their history (The Howard Hughes and Dead Rats connection). I thought that Starch Blockers were just another gimmick of the \\"Health food\\" industry for a quick fix to overeating. Starch Blockers got a bad (but deserved) rap in the 80's because a few \\"Quick Buck\\" artist produced an inferior product based on solid a research into controlling Blood Sugar Levels (Not Weight Loss) . I found in reading that our blood sugar levels control our moods, energy, alertness and the ability to gain or lose weight. Among other things, I have learned about food allergies and food reactions from this wonderful text.More importantly, I have learned that Starch Blockers by themselves are not a \\"Magic Weight Loss Bullet\\". This book details how (and why) to use Phase 2 in conjunction with proper food selection and exercise to create a non-self defeating weight loss (Not Diet) and wellness program. Reading this book and following its advice will make a program using the Phase 2 Starch Blockers more effective."},{"Title":"The Starch Blocker Diet","review":"Frankly I was not convinced that starch blockers work but after reading Dr. Rosenblatt's book, The Starch Blocker Diet, I am convinced this is a very plausible solution to elimination the majority of starch calories from any diet plan and thus lose weight gradually.

Highly recommended for anyone looking to lose weight simply, safely, and sensibly.

I bought the Phase2 brand recommended by Dr. Rosenblatt. I lost 48 lbs in 49 weeks. I learned to eat correctly, I went to the gym 3X/week with a trainer and another two times for additional cardiovascular and off came the weight. What I totally did not do was starve. I changed my foods and eating habits. Full 5-minute oatmeal in the a.m., Ezekiel bread with all-natural peanut butter and no-sugar jelly at lunch, and a lovely, full great dinner. I always ate meat, chicken, always had a small piece of salmon with whatever I ate to get my daily omegas, big dinner salad with olive oil and vinegar, veggies steamed or bbq-ed, and a huge serving of a full starch like a potato, rice or whole wheat spaghetti and the only lowered calorie worth eating spaghetti sauce and with that starch blocker .. which I only took at dinner .. and all the lifestyle changes .. off came the 48 lbs.That was in 2004.It is Sept 2012 now, nobody has written anything about this book since 7 years ago or so .. and it is still a great book. It works. It is healthy. And I am healthy. I learned to eat, I learned to keep exercise in my life 3X/week and sometimes more cuz I am aging and things creak & hurt ... and I have not gained back one pound in 8 years. NOT ONE.So that says a lot for this book, this way of life. Of all the books out there that I read .. and I read them all .. and I got various pieces of other good information from them .. it was THIS way of living that did it for me.And this way of living is a way that can be with your till the end of your life.I am very thankful for having found this. CHANGED MY LIFE.Also in the book, at that time, if you had questions, you could email Dr. Rosenblatt with comments and questions and he always answered me, sometimes quite in detail, within a day. How is THAT for an author.I still recommend this book. And I see Dr. Rosenblatt has moved on to do additional work with some new products. Just put up a search for him and see what he is up to.

What doesn't make sense about doing low-carb? You do it, it works, you lose weight, you look and feel fantastic and the foods you eat are incredibly delicious. Nuff said, right?! Well, the good doctor in this story wants to go even deeper into the reasons why people are so obese in this country and why they shouldn't turn to the low-carb lifestyle to deal with it.Over half of the population has purportedly been on some kind of low-carb diet at least once in their life and many have lost weight. But Dr. Rosenblatt says: \\"Unfortunately, for many of these people, the weight loss is temporary.\\"This is the biggest excuse I always hear so-called experts in the medical profession bring out when talking about the low-carb lifestyle. You can't keep the weight off when you do it. It must not work because everybody gains back the weight. It's so unhealthy for you anyways, so why don't you just start eating a more \\"balanced\\" low-fat diet instead?UGH! Sound familiar? That's what we've been fed time after time in the media about low-carb. Don't blame the method of losing weight and getting healthy on the failure of individuals to stick with it! The way of eating itself is not only effective, but permanent if it is strictly adhered to. My 180-pound weight loss is staying off for good because I continue to eat low-carb although my \\"diet\\" is over.Does this mean you can never splurge on a carb-loaded meal ever again? Of course not. But you now know you cannot eat that way all the time. It's the same concept with low-fat and low-calorie diets, too, but with low-carb you can actually eat foods that you want and like!Dr. Rosenblatt said Americans are more aware of the \\"problems related to low carb diets than they were about the hazards of the low fat diet.\\"What problems with low-carb? I haven't had any in my experience. It's interesting that he also keenly points out there are also \\"hazards\\" associated with doing a low-fat diet. I wish Dr. Rosenblatt would have expanded upon those comments a little more to reveal what problems exist when doing a low-fat diet. This is something you have never seen in media accounts about low-fat weight loss recommendations. It's yet another example of how medical experts and the media are depriving people of the information they need to make good decisions about their health.He goes on to say that while low-carb will help you lose weight quickly, you can't keep it off and it will cause long-term damage to your health.If you haven't heard this from your friends and family yet, brace yourself for it because it's coming. Oh, that diet is so dangerous, you better be careful. Didn't you know Atkins is a one-way ticket to a grave? Your health will go down the tubes so quickly doing that diet.Again, I must say, UGH! How can so many people be as uneducated about the low-carb lifestyle that they are willing to buy into the propaganda promoted in the media? It only takes a little bit of learning about low-carb and why it works to be convinced of its tremendous health benefits and long-lasting effectiveness.This statement by Dr. Rosenblatt shows just how incredibly ignorant he is about what doing low-carb is in the real world: \\"The simplest reason why low carb diets don't work in the long run is that they're like every other diet: They're boring. After a while, people get tired of them and quit the diet. Unfortunately, after they fall off the diet, former Atkins followers are likely to start eating lots of carbs, yet they keep eating the high levels of protein they've become accustomed to. When they add the buns and fries to those bacon double cheeseburgers, you know what happens: rapid regain of weight.\\"Okay, I'm breathing slowly to keep my blood from boiling. Three, two, one...okay, I'm better now. Let me clearly state that if Atkins ever becomes \\"boring,\\" then you need to start getting a little more creative with the way you prepare the foods you eat. It is NOT boring when you put a little thought into what you can eat and spice it up. I provide several examples in my upcoming book of some quick and easy recipes that are sure to satisfy you completely while doing this eating plan. Let's not blame the diet for any disinterest by its participants.But, while we're on the subject, I'll tell you what's really boring. Stuffing your face with rabbit food and restricting yourself to a certain number of calories or fat grams in a day. Besides being hungry all the time (I did this \\"diet\\" for myself back in 1999), you can't keep it up because the food choices are so mundane.If people get off the Atkins plan, then of course they will gain back the weight. But you can't point the finger at low-carb. People need to be strong and learn to stick with something that's working for them over the long-term. I'm sure many of these people who go back to eating carbs have become so frightened by media accounts of the dangers of low-carb that they decided it wasn't worth it to them. Therefore, we could ostensibly blame so-called health experts and the media for perpetuating the obesity epidemic in the United States!Another popular phrase used by Atkins opponents that Dr. Rosenblatt so graciously repeats here is that doing low-carb \\"causes loss of muscle mass.\\"While I by no means have a bodybuilder figure (yet!), I can say with all integrity that I have never been as strong as I am today. I workout every day and lift weight several times a week as part of livin' la vida low-carb. It is just plain junk science to claim any dangers with exercising and strength training while doing low-carb. I am living proof that this is a big fat lie and is yet another attempt to discourage people from doing the low-carb lifestyle.Addressing the key element of low-carb, Dr. Rosenblatt said ketosis, or the fat burning mode during low-carb, is harmful in various ways:- Insufficient glucose to fuel the brainMy brain and other parts of my body are doing fine without sugar, thank you.- Your body's attempts to eliminate ketones (by-products of ketosis) puts a strain on the kidneys.My kidneys have actually improved since being on low-carb because I'm getting better urination flow (TMI!) from the additional water I am drinking.- Diets high in protein can increase calcium loss from the body, increasing the risk of osteoporosis.Take a pill! You can get all the calcium you need in a supplement.- Diets high in animal protein are usually high in saturated fats, which increase the risk of heart diseases.Who says you only eat animal fat and protein on low-carb?! Nuts are good sources of good fats and so are many other foods. Furthermore, your body needs fat to lose weight (gee, what a concept!) when you are doing a low-carb plan.- Diets low in carbohydrates are usually extremely low in fiber, since carbohydrates from fruits, vegetables and grains provide most of the fiber in our diets. Low fiber diets have been associated with increased risk of type II diabetes, heart disease and certain types of cancer.What evidence is there that eating a low-carb lifestyle has very little fiber. In fact, I'm eating more fiber now than I've ever eaten before. It is a key element to being successful on Atkins. Furthermore, it will help keep you regular and you don't have to count dietary fiber carbohydrates in your total carb intake. In addition, I supplement my eating plan with two daily fiber pills to make sure I'm getting enough fiber on a daily basis. By the way, I don't have diabetes or cancer and actually have a better chance now of never having either of these conditions thanks to the healthy alternative low-carb has offered me.The claim is made in the story that \\"all of us need and want carbs.\\"No, all of us don't want and need carbs, Dr. Rosenblatt. Only people who wish to remain fat and unhealthy want carbs. People who are livin' la vida low-carb have lots of energy and a positive outlook on life because we know we are doing something pro-active about our health without the dangers associated with overconsuming carbs. We are extremely satisfied with the foods we eat on low-carb.At the end of his article, Dr. Rosenblatt peddles a so-called starch blocker supplement as part of his \\"Starch Blocker Diet\\" book. After trashing the low-carb approach for the entire story, it's not until the last few paragraphs that we finally see his true motivation for attempting to discredit the Atkins lifestyle. He's trying to sell his weight loss product and books.I think it is highly unethical for a medical professional to write an article like this one allegedly as a public service to educate the masses about health issues when all he is trying to do is get them to make him money.Shame on you, Dr. Rosenblatt!"},{"Title":"The Starch Blocker Diet","review":"I bought the product and read the book. This book is very motivating and exciting, I enjoyed reading it and learned new ideas about eating differently. I have to admit that the book did confuse me at times. One minute the author is saying....you could lose weight and inches even if you aren't that active, then another section is saying....work out for an hour every day if you can. That is just one example. Anyway, by taking this product I've experienced no weight gain but maintenance for a month. I didn't lose any pounds, so that was disappointing. I felt great after eating starchy meals. I noticed that my moods were stable, I felt less guilty, and I was better able to concentrate on what my body was telling me. Getting a little gassy and bloaty was no big deal either. One downfall to me was that I felt &quot;out of it&quot; at times...maybe because I was taking two at every meal and working out or working all day, so all together it took it's toll on me, I thought it was the starch blockers, &quot;no brain power.&quot; So I suggest to not overdo the blockers. I liked the book, but I really don't know how well these blockers will help you lose the weight you want. I now only take it with my dinner or whenever I have to go out to a restaurant. Looking back, I was probably better off without them...only because at times I felt as if I was thinner before I started even taking Phase 2. If it works for you, that's great, but it is a &quot;money blower&quot; if you ask me, but they do have it's benefits. I'll still purchase them because they are not harmful and to make it worthwile, I'll only take it when I feel a need to, therefore, I won't blow my money on them all the time."},{"Title":"Brothers, Sing On!: My Half-Century Around the World with the Penn Glee Club","review":"Having sung in the 1960's Penn Glee Club, when we didn't dance and didn't travel far from West Philadelphia, this book is an explanation of how the \\"Club\\" survived and thrived in subsequent years.

Seeing his group via TV in Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade was of interest. The recounting in his book of his half-century of performances and creations seems to demonstrate rather convincingly his outstanding musical and directing skills. To be able to compose - invent - new music as well as arrange the work of others; to write transitional or counterpoint melodies and lyrics, surely are gifts that few people have.

She told me that I would pick out the food for one week, and we would eat whatever I bought. We would use our normal grocery budget. Wow! Was I excited! The basket was soon filled with Cokes, candy, sugared cereal, cookies and potato chips. Naturally, there was no meat, fruit, or vegetables. I was asked if I was sure that's what I wanted. Yup! Well, it was heaven for about three days. Then, we started to run out of food. And I got tired of all of the junk food. My mother took pity on me and made some things out of staples at home. At the end of the week, she asked me if I wanted to to do the shopping for the next week. No way! I told her I would be glad to eat whatever she bought.That experience is a mini-lesson of the sort that Dr. Whitcomb feels that each child should have beginning between ages 10 and 13, depending on the child. Dr. Whitcomb learned the benefits of making money mistakes for himself while he was a boarding student. He was given the money to pay all of his expenses. If he ran out, that was his tough luck! His parents before him had had the same lesson applied in the same way.Most young people eventually start to have these experiences when they live away from home, whether for boarding school, college, or moving away to take a job in another area. Dr. Whitcomb points out that learning the lessons earlier and on a smaller scale is a good idea.The book is built around the idea of establishing a budget for something your child needs to pay for, then giving the money to your child, and learning from the school of hard knocks. He has an elaborate set of contracts, ATM account rules, and tracking mechanisms for making this practical. He suggests picking out an approach that works for you and your child. The book has lots of good advice for how to handle the inevitable crash landings.We did something similar to this with our children, and they soon learned to live on the funds they had . . . or to earn some more. They became ingenious at saving money, and finding better ways to earn it. One child, who had been profligate before it became that child's money, totally turned around. So I think the theory works.I would advise starting earlier than he suggests here. Children can take on responsibility for buying family presents much younger than was described in the book. And you don't need an ATM account to do it. When the age is reached to buy one's own lunches, that's another opportunity to install this approach . . . with a fixed weekly allowance. Chores can be used to generate income for &quot;extras&quot; and that helps other lessons be learned.I also suggest starting with investing younger than is indicated here. I started doing that when I was 12 and greatly benefited from that early exposure.I think you will enjoy the book, although I don't think you will follow it exactly.The best part for me was in the sections for helping children learn lessons from their experiences.Where else would advance practice make a good difference? Be sure your child has that practice.Assume that people can learn by doing better than any other way!"},{"Title":"The Sink or Swim Money Program : The 6-Step Plan for Teaching Your Teens Financial Responsibility","review":"We instituted this plan with our daughter almost 2 years ago. The difference was dramatic and immediate. We had not originally allowed enough money to cover all of the expenses we were expecting her to cover. The monthly sessions were very emotional for those first couple of months when there just wasn't enough money. We went through the plan and looked at it together and readjusted her salary. Things became much more manageable and less stressful. I used this experience to explain to her that there are people who feel like that every month. That there just isn't enough money to pay for the things they have to pay for. I did NOT do it on purpose to give her that lesson.She has made great strides in financial responsibility. She got a job when she was old enough. She bought a car, pays for her insurance, tag and car related as well as other expenses from her job. She donated over $500 last year to causes that she finds worthy. Has a long and short term savings accounts. Our next step is to work toward investments and teaching her to be responsible with credit before she leaves for college in just over a year. She was starting 10th grade when we started this. We were worried that we might not have enough time. It had taken years for her dad and I to get to the point where we finally \\"got it\\" financially speaking. She has come so far, so quickly it sometimes seems we've been doing it much longer than we have. I have read other books on this subject over the years, for some reason this one clicked and I knew it was something we could do. I think one of the best things about it is that it is not about being strict or perfect. It is about finding a balance that works and letting kids figure out how to make choices and live with those choices when those choices do not threaten their safety or security. I am thrilled with the progress we have made in our home with this program. I don't really worry about her future financially.

You will definitley have a great time with it. It is kinda funny to read it because it's british, but that's what also makes it really interesting. A british perspective on things. The book has descriptions of all the episodes for the show's first two seasons. Along with each episode, comes a number of categories with it.... which has some of the best of the nasty dialogue. It has critiques and notes from critics including the author. It also features &quot;L.A.

There is even a section dealing with fashion and describes what characters were wearing and if they were good or not. Plus, there is just some dialogue. Topping really outdoes himself getting into the specifics of the mistakes, or just little details in the background or in the forefront. This guy really has a keen eye!. What would've made this book better was if there were some pictures. Nope. Not here. That is the only drawback to this exceptional book. Topping is a fan. He writes as a fan.

It also includes Dudes and Babes which takes a look at the cute guys and girls shown. The Charisma Show relives the funny and cool bits that Cordelia does. LA Speak gives quotes on the street talk seen on teh show. Designer Label highlights the fashion mistakes so when you watch the episode again you cna take a moment to laugh. It catches all the juicy details missing from regular guides and has a unique style.I recommend this book and Slayer ( Buffy version) because of it's uniqueness and is a simply must for any fan."},{"Title":"Orlando, City of Dreams (The Making of America: Florida)","review":"Orlando: City of Dreams is a well researched, fascinating account of pre-Disney Orlando in particular and Florida in general. It leads the reader through Florida history as a frontier land of opportunity where fortunes were made, lost and made again. From Osceola's Head through Civil War battles, hurricanes and killer frosts it reads more like a novel than a history book.The author grew up in Florida, moved out into the world then came back with a new appreciation for the Sunshine State.

He defied tradition and centered worship upon one deity, the sun god Aten. In this book, the author provides a concise, accurate and very readable account of his reign. A summary is also provided of the nineteenth-century scholars (Lepsius and Champollion to name a few) who discovered and first interpreted the ruins of Akhenaten. The author gives a religious background of Akhenaten and his father's beliefs; he also discusses the founding of the city of Akhenaten, the belief in monotheism and the processes by which Tutankhaten becomes Tutankhamen the successor. The book offers an excellent bibliography for further consultation of the subject. It is one of the best books on the subject of this heretic pharaoh. Recommended reading for all."},{"Title":"Akhenaten and the Religion of Light","review":"Although very short and readable, this book is not recommendable to those who never read anything about Pharaoh Akhenaten and his place in Egyptian history. Retrieved from a lecture given by the author, it works best as an inventory of all that was ever written about Egypt's \\"Heretic King\\" and his religious revolution, since his discovery by German scholar Lepsius in 1843, down to 1995, when it was published. And, as its title proclaims, the book focuses on Akhenaten's doctrine, the Amarna theology.Aware that Egyptologists usually infer too much from too little, Herr Hornung is excessively cautious in his approach, always avoiding any labeling of his biographee, whether as the tragic saint glorified by Breasted and Weigall, whether as the decadent fanatic despised by Redford and Aldred, whether as the true founder of Judaism hailed by Freud and the Rosicrucian. He has no opinion about Akhenaten's possible co-regency with his father or with his successor, whoever he (Smenkhkare?), or she (Nefertiti?), might be; he doesn't know what happened in his last years, ignores the debate over the mummy found at Tomb 55 in the Valley of Kings, and has no idea where Tutankhamun came from. He is not sure of anything, though he mentions most of the theories proposed by other authors. All he seems sure of is the basic tenets of Akhenaten's religious ideas.And this is very interesting, because one of the author's most avoided \\"clich&eacute;s\\" is precisely the pre-Christian feature of this very dramatic character. \\"Akhenaten as a pacifist who ruined Egypt as a world power in Dinasty 18, as a king caught up in the unreal, sham world of the Horizon of Aten, his new capital, where he lived out his teaching and conducted his search for the divine - these were clich&eacute;s that would have long-lasting influence. Though Tomas Mann overcame these clich&eacute;s in his nuanced treatment of the king, he succumbed to the parallels with Christianity and attempted to categorize Akhenaten as an early Christian figure.\\" Yet, Akhenaten's religion is based on a Holy Trinity to begin with, composed by Aten, himself and Nefertiti, what drives Hornung to question the monotheistic character of Atenism, although he doesn't seem equally willing to dispute Christianity's monotheism. Besides, Aten, the One God, shines only over the King and his family, and the King and son of God is reported to have said to his Father: \\"There is no other who knows you.\\" Thirteen centuries later, another Son of the One God proclaimed in the very same way: \\"No one comes to the Father but by me.\\"At the Epilogue, the author fell into the precipice of sheer speculation he avoided so carefully, by writing on page 121 that \\"Akhenaten had founded no congregation; he had no disciples or apostles to carry on his work after his death. There was only his small circle of followers, who were now bereft of a reference point.\\" How can he be so sure of that, we wonder, specially since he mentions in the next page some \\"undercurrents that remain hidden to us might certainly have exercised an influence\\"?Hornung's one serious mistake was stating, on page 116, that shortly after Akhenaten's disappearance the royal court moved to Memphis, and he persists on this absurdity by adding, on page 121, that following the abandon of Akhetaten, the new city build by the King, \\"Thebes would never again be the capital\\".His final remarks on the character he treated so impersonally are positive at first. \\"Here we come to the critical point. In Amarna religion, for the first time in history, an attempt was made to explain the entire natural and human world on the basis of a single principle. Like Einstein, Akhenaten made light the absolute reference point, and it is astonishing how clearly and consistently he pursued this concept in the fourteenth century BC, making him in fact the first modern human being. Indeed, modernity also strives to describe the universe with a single formula, to explain it on the basis of a single principle; the attempts to do so do not cease.\\"And then:\\"But Akhenaten demonstrated with unusual clarity that such one-sidedness is doomed to failure; all we repress and ignore will overtake and overshadow us. Akhenaten was perhaps the first fundamentalist in history, and for this reason, he remains even today a very contemporary figure who can scarcely be denied respect and sympathy in any critique of him.\\""},{"Title":"Akhenaten and the Religion of Light","review":"Hornung once again demonstrates his ability to pull together nuances of abstruse facets of Egyptian theology. I only wish this book was about twice as long with more extensive footnotes. Nevertheless, I couldn't put it down until it was finished and it provided me with new ways of looking at Akhenaten's extraordinary reign and its place, not only in Egyptian history, but in world History"},{"Title":"Akhenaten and the Religion of Light","review":"\\"For the first time in history, an attempt was made to explain the entire natural and human world on the basis of a SINGLE principle. Like Einstein, Ahkenaten made light the absolute reference point, and it is astonishing how clearly and consistently he pursued this concept in the 14th century B.C.E., making him in fact the first MODERN human being.\\" (p. 125)Akhenaten's revolutionary change from polytheism to monotheistic belief in only one god helped unify Egypt.The subjective controversy that plagues the history of Akhenaten is an anticipative backlash from exoheretics to the academic practice of historiography. When emotional superfluous definitions to the meaning of heresy are discarded, it becomes obvious (for the right reasons) that Akhenaten was indeed a heretic. As a dissenter from orthodox religious beliefs, he was, by definition, a \\"heretic king\\".Hornung's book delves into Akhenaten's radical dissent from Egypt's traditional polytheism, and his establishment of the world's first instance of monotheism. The belief was in Aten, whom many mistakenly believe was depicted by the solar disk. This book makes it clear that Aten was actually not the sun disk, but rather the LIGHT that is in the sun and which, radiating from it, calls the world to life and keeps it alive. It was no more or less an icon than Judaism's Star of David, or Christianity's Cross of Jesus, or Islam's calligraphic symbol. Early text of a boundary stelae reads, \\"sculptors do not know him.\\"The parallels Hornung draws between today's 3 major monotheistic religions and Akhenaten's precedent are many and presented in clear detail. But the author is careful to emphasize that the temporal interval is too great to infer a DIRECT influence from the Amarna Period on the monotheism of the Hebrew Bible over half a millennium later.Hornung's book is full of interesting details, such as Egypt's use of swine for street-side waste removal, the use of a bread and beer barter system pre-dating coinage, descriptions of Amarna-Period home construction techniques for efficient indoor climate control, the first-time use of the Hyksos-introduced war chariot for peacetime transportation by the Pharoah, the emergence of a new expressionistic art form in place of traditional static deptictions, the rise of new forms of architecture, the increased use of flower offerings in place of animal sacrifices, the meaning and mutation of Akehnaten's name, and much more.In regard to the new impressionistic art form of the Amarna Period, Hornung points out that Akhenaten's supposed \\"sickly\\" depiction in sculpture and painting, with his feminine hips, pot belly, swollen lips and chin, receding forehead, elongated neck and crown can be understood by comp0aring it with schools of modern art that deal freely with the human form. In his sub-chapter on \\"The Grotesque Pharoah\\", Hornung eloquently dispels emotional assumptions that the Pharoah had a \\"sick ugliness and nervous decadence\\" about him. Akhenaten's supposed \\"repulsive ugliness\\" is a result of opinion towards a new impressionistic art form and not a logical analysis of the Pharaoh himself. Hornung explains the motive behind this new art form and the rules that define it.Hornung concludes his book with an analyses of why monotheism failed to catch on after Akhenaten's death. Among them, the radical departure his new religion had with comfortable traditional beliefs of the afterlife, the fact he left no male heir to the throne, and the iconoclasm which in the mind of Egyptians in particular cases meant their own consignment to oblivion, and other things to name a few. Though Akhenaten's monotheism lingered on into Tutankamon's 3rd regnal year, it was simply too radical a departure from the norm given the period's socioeconomic status. In this sense, it was a religion ahead of its time.My only point of contention with this book is the brief chapter titled, \\"Dark Years\\". It is a chapter that deals with Akhenaten's relationship with the mysterious Kiya, the supposed disappearance of Nefertiti, the Dakhamanzu affair, and Akhenaten's marriage to his older daughters to elevate their status in lieu of no male heir to his throne. Though the author clearly focuses on Akhenaten's religion of light, I would have enjoyed reading more into Akhenaten's personal life in these mysterious later years: in context and without slant as other authors have done. But given the author's expressed intent and the title of the book, the lack of this additional information does not degrade the quality of this book as a positive contribution to Egyptian historiography."},{"Title":"Akhenaten and the Religion of Light","review":"This work serves as a very useful overview of the historical progression and the basic tenets of Akhenaten's religion of light. The author punctiliously lists the sources on which his statements are based, which provides a useful reference for the reader who wants to check the ancient sources for themselves. Some of these references, however, assume that the reader will already have some familiarity with the events being narrated and though this is not a major problem, the reader with little knowledge of Akhenaten is sometimes left wishing for a little more background information. The main reason I have given the book only 3 stars ( though its information value certainly warrants at least 4), is that Horning scrupulously avoids making any kind of inference as to the reasons behind Akhenaten's abrupt break with Egypt's traditions until the very last page of the book. In a way, this avoidance is praiseworthy, since Egyptologists often infer too much from too little. On the other hand, I believe that this is precisely the point that most readers are interested in exploring. The avoidance becomes problematic on the final page. Here, Horning suggests that Akhenaten was perhaps the world's first fundamentalist, trying to explain the entire human world based on a single principle. He claims that such a fundamentalist viewpoint will always be doomed to failure and thus we have much to learn from Akhenaten's example. I would have found the book much more interesting and enjoyable if this hypothesis had been introduced from the start and then developed throughout the book. As it is, it is tacked on as a kind of coda, and the reader is left to decide whether any of the evidence given in the book actually supports such an inference or not."},{"Title":"Akhenaten and the Religion of Light","review":"Stories on the ancient Egyptian civilization command the attention of many as no other ancient extinct civilization does, the Mayans, Aztecs and the Hindus included. May be this is ascribable to the relatively recent (less than 200 years) deciphering of the intricate Egyptian hieroglyphic script by the French mathematician Jean-Franois Champollion, a feat which expanded in more than 3.000 years the horizon of humankind, or maybe this is a kind of perverse and doctrinarian boomerang effect of old English colonies against its colonizers, demonstrating that whatever be the powerfull cultures - and armies - behing the colonizing Western powers, they would never attain the magic and the glory Egypt did at its apogee. The names of Cleopatra, Tutankhamen, Ramses, Champollion and many others somehow associated with Egypt culture and its glorious history are almost household names to many of us, demonstrating the intimacy Western and even Eastern (mostly specially Japanese, keen not to accept the supremacy of Chinese over them) readers have vis-'a-vis Egiptology. Sure, beneath all this there is a kind of \\"who first?\\" contest between the peoples, and most especially some governments, vying for the primacy of scientifically establishing who was the first craddle of civilization in the planet. See, in this regard, the recent efforts of the Chinese and even the Israeli government to find the earliest traces of civilization in their territories, thus displacing the Mesopothamia as the incumbent craddle of civilization.\\"Akhenaten and the religion of Light\\", written in the 1990's by the German scholar and Egyptologist Eric Hornung, and magnificently translated into English, is a very small booklet about the cultural revolution brought about by the pharaoh Akhenaten (son of Amenophis III) , who during his 30 + years reign changed many of the religious creeds and cult practices of the time, being referred to by many as the first true monotheistic ruler of the world. To some scholars, he was the first individual of the Planet Earth, in the sense that he made a giant step in the dark in order to advance human understanding about oneself. If this was exactly not so, given that many others scholars point out that Egypt was first and foremost monotheist in its origin before adhering to polytheism, at least the pharaoh Akhenaten was the bold founder of a new religious and cultural movement which sent rippling waves trough years to come, given the huge impact his reforms had in almost every aspects of the daily life of his time. In his view, the only and sole God was the god Aten, represented by the sun rays, being in its essence Light, the creator of all existent creatures of the world. The religious revolution set by Akhenaten (who was called Amenophis IV when ascended to the throne but changed his regal name to Akhenaten, thus dismissing the importance of the heretofore powerfull god Amen) had even a big impact in the concepts of the Egyptian Afterlife, almost debunking Osiris as the god of the heretofore important Egyptian netherworld.Despite all the hoopla that surrounds the very attractive theme of monotheism, being even used by Sigmund Freud in his invenctives against Judaism and Christianism in his book Moses and Monotheism, the life and the death of the pharaoh Akhenaten is shrouded in mistery and secrecy and not too many details of his life and of his royal family are produced out of the excavations made in the territory in Middle Egypt that he designated to be his future home and temple to the God Aten, where he settled with his family and famous first wife Nefertite and harem, living a reclusive life dedicated foremost to religious affairs, almost foregoing important aspects of Egyptian external affairs with its neighbours. In fact, his relics are virtually non-existent and many of the information gathered are collected from burial grounds of his followers in the Egyptian bureaucracy.Despite the conciseness of the text, this is a very invigorating approach to the life of this important pharaoh, who by many was compared with the likes of Saint Paul, Saint Francis and even Albert Einstein, this latter due to the importance both men put in light as an inspirational power to the creation of life on Earth. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did."},{"Title":"Akhenaten and the Religion of Light","review":"Any work by Hornung is always very good. Akhenaten's religion has always been problematic for historians, just as it was for the ancient Egyptians. There is also the modern problem of being biased in favor of monotheism. I found the book profound in the issues it discusses, clarifying and ultimately unconvincing."},{"Title":"Akhenaten and the Religion of Light","review":"Interesting in both detail and the author's opinions. We'll never really know what, why and exactly how the entire &#34;Amarna&#34; period played out since we can't know what the main participants in this strange royal family saga were thinking and feeling, what dynamics they lived in and how they met their final fates. It almost seems that the more detail that is revealed about these people and their lives, the deeper the mystery and the more room for speculation and opinion. It's all a fascinating puzzle with lots of pieces still missing.................It will always hold my interest."},{"Title":"Akhenaten and the Religion of Light","review":"This is a transcription of a lecture of some type by Hornung himself. Characteristic of Hornung, he tends to stick with the facts and tries not to interpret from them too much. If the facts as we know them don't support his theories, then he tends to shy away from personal interpretations. He mentions other people's thoughts, though, and closer to the end Hornung gives us his opinion on Akhenaten. It's a mixture of positive and negative--not uncommon among a lot of people, I've found.I think part of Hornung's reticence is in part because there's a lot of rumors and occasionally outright hysterics surrounding Akhenaten. Sometimes it's hard to get through the fluff that surrounds him. I found myself deeply appreciating the near bare bones facts Hornung presented.Like one or two other reviewers, I also think this isn't a good \\"first book\\" on the subject. Akhenaten's revolution needs to be understood in the context of the New Solar Theology and the other changes in religious thought that were occurring in this time period.For those who are interested in a deeper interpretation of Akhenaten, the Aten, et al, I would recommend Mind of Egypt by Jan Assman. Jan Assman tends to interpret a little too much sometimes, but between him and Hornung, you can get a really good picture of different aspects of ancient Egypt."},{"Title":"Akhenaten and the Religion of Light","review":"To be honest, having read many books on Akhenaten, I don't think this book added any new information (is there any?), yet compiled all that has been said and as a result you get like a summary of all the theories that have been written on him in egyptology.I give it 5 stars because it was an entertaining read and it's always good when it comes from someone like Hornung.

Well, I suppose that much is obvious. And sex always makes for great reading. We are all obsessed and entertained by it. Still, this book took me by surprise. It is not your typical book about sex: offering cheap thrills or mundane, overdigested sociopsychological chatter. It is a unique guided tour of the bizarre world of reproduction throughout the animal kingdom. It is also a glimpse into the odd world of evolutionary biologists, in this case those who spend their lives contemplating the meaning behind all of the bizarre variations on sex in the animal world. Apparently, these highly respected academic scholars go to work each day to figure out such things as why some fruitflies make sperm that are 20 times longer than their bodies and why others produce seminal fluids that are toxic to their mates, why some marine flatworms have dozens of penises, why certain slugs have a penis that is longer than their body and that occassionally become so horrifically tangled about their mate that they must be chewed off, why dunglfies sometimes drown their mates in wet dung, why females of one species of catfish fertilize their eggs by drinking sperm, and why deep-sea anglerfish males bite their mates and never let go. The list goes on and on, preparing me with remarkable ammunition for the next dinner party.Yet this stranger-than-fiction book is not merely a collection of Ripley's sex tales. It is a well-organized treatise of cutting edge science that masterfully instructs the reader as to the common evolutionary threads that define the underlying nature of sex. The reader is left, for example, with an abundant understanding of why sex between men and women is more about conflict than cooperation, which personally clarified much in my life. The first paragraph of the book reads in part, &quot;Status for the Mediterranean male is all-important, and tradition dictates that a man who fails during a hunting expedition can expect his wife to be unfaithful. In parts of Italy it is widely believed that a man must shoot a honey buzzard each year if his wife is to remain faithful. So strong is this belief, and so powerful a motivating force is the idea of female fidelity, that even after they have emigrated to the United States many Italian men return home each year to shoot a honey buzzard. It is not a little ironic that in order to fulfil this ritual a man usually leaves his wife behind. Moreover, in some instances it is the wife who actually encourages him to go!&quot; The remainder of the pages are as engaging as this first one. I recommend this book to anyone that ever has had or ever hopes to have sex."},{"Title":"Promiscuity: An Evolutionary History of Sperm Competition","review":"If you want to be grossed out, amused and steeped in leading scholarship all at the same time, this may be your book. In a fun, concise and well structured book, Birkhead gives us an up-to-date account of sperm competition in animals. The examples used are wide-ranging, from bed bugs to people, and never fail to raise an eyebrow. A Doay sheep female copulated 163 times in five hours and a man eating sushi once learned that the wiggly things in his tongue owed their thanks to a squid spermatophore. Beyond these exemplars of bizarre, though, this book contains cogent arguments for the place of sperm competition. It kindly sandbags the sensational claims of Baker and Bellis (in their Human Sperm Competition), giving us a fairer treatment in its place, both with respect to humans (where sperm competition has been of relatively little recent importance, evidenced by the relatively small testes and poor sperm quality of males) and numerous other taxa. The section on female benefits to multi-male mating is also worth noting. Evidence is amassed for female benefits in obtaining sufficient sperm, resources and improving the genetic quality of their offspring (e.g. through pairing her genes with a good MHC complement). These last ideas on genetic benefits will continue to inspire new research, just as other ideas in the book should too (accessory glands such as the prostate may have originated in the evolutionary battle of the sexes). It could be stated that the book overstates the case for sexual conflict, when benign agreements have been reached; after all, it wouldn't pay over evolutionary time for the faithful California mouse or swan to employ cruel mechanisms at expense to a partner. Yet this book is worth the strange questions and looks you'll get on the bus when people see its cover and look over your should while reading it (just as happened to my yesterday)."},{"Title":"Promiscuity: An Evolutionary History of Sperm Competition","review":"This is a very interesting book on evolution (actually it is one of my favorites).

His review, including some of his own research, illustrates once again themes found pretty much in all evolutionary areas, including some bizarre adaptations which should delight those interested in biological curiosities. Still, I am skeptical that the casual reader is really going to enjoy this book.Survival in the face of disease has long been identified as the likely driver for the origin of sex. There is evidence it plays a role in sexual selection, so that, for example, the length of a swallow's tail seems to correlate with resistance to pathogens. More interesting, is that a female may actually be able to choose sexual partners on the basis of whose genotype will be most different from her own, increasing the odds that the diversity of her offspring will permit some survival in the face of new mutations of viral and bacterial attackers or parasites. Sperm selection can not only occur via choice of mate, but when there are multiple inseminators, by selection of sperm (more research needs to be done to confirm this). Supporting studies have been done on mice as well as fruit flies.We may take for granted that there is a \\"large\\" egg, and a small, mobile sperm, but Birkhead provides theoretical reasons why sex would evolve this way, as contrasted to two equal size gametes fusing."},{"Title":"Promiscuity: An Evolutionary History of Sperm Competition","review":"i hesitate to write a review of this book because it might appear 'pervy' just to comment ;) but in all fairness, this book is worth reading for anyone interested in science, biology, sex, or ourselves :) ..anyone who enjoys this book would also probably enjoy the weekly publication: NewScientist :)"},{"Title":"Promiscuity: An Evolutionary History of Sperm Competition","review":"If you ever wondered about such glorious subjects as...okay, it's a book about sex, but the scholarly parts of sex normally only pondered by zoologists, not the boxing ring style blow-by-blow accounts you might read in novels.

This book, The Not So Wicked Stepmother, A Book for Children and Adults, addresses all the most immediate reactions of a child facing the upheaval of &quot;two&quot; homes, parental dating, and how everything got so &quot;weird&quot;. It helps that the author herself has literal experience with the dynamic, and it shows. The books shows the harshest changes a divorce can create - Dad moving out, the &quot;new&quot; home which must be created for him to share with his children, and all the feelings of anxiety that can visit children; how to sleep at night in a strange place, belongings split between two residences, etc. When Dad starts to explore a new social life with female companions, each step is explored in the most heartfelt, and comic, way. There is a very realistic ending that shows happiness and acceptance to new life and new loves.Most children react suspiciously to strangers these days, none the least of which, may actually become a part of your family! I would recommend this book for Dad's to read to their children BEFORE the dating process has begun, and if possible, before leaving the home they share with their children. My husband and I searched high and low for a book as entertaining, realistic and sympathetic to new beginnings as this one, and wish we had found it sooner. The illustrations will keep your children's attention even when the text hits uncomfortably close to home. My step-daughter was seven when she got this book and it is still one of her favorites. She loves me to read it to her before bedtime, and laughs at the antics of the daughters in the story. I sincerely hope the author writes additional books exploring the subject. This book is worth your purchase - I doubt you will be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Not So Wicked Stepmother, A Book for Children and Adults","review":"I have a background in early childhood education. When my husband and I decided to get married, I wanted to get his then 6 year old daughter a book about stepmothers. I know from experience that this is one of the best ways to introduce kids to ideas. However, I went to the library... typed in \\"stepmother\\"... and all I got were books like Cinderella, Snow White, etc where stepmothers were evil and the villians. After doing A LOT of research, I came across this book. Although the illustrations aren't the best, it definitely is FINALLY a book that explains what happens when \\"dad decides to marry\\" and how stepmothers can be a loving and kind new member of the family. My stepdaughter and I read it together and she liked it a lot. I think it's a great book!"},{"Title":"Bless this Mess","review":"What a delightful, funny book this is.

The authors have taken a clever approach to making fun of so many of the little annoyances in modern life. It reads like a stand-up comedy routine, and it's a load of fun.

I also have never been this experimental before with recipes, but when everything I make is so mouth-watering tasty I have to try more! My husband has also loved everything out of Sarah's book, and he can be pretty \\"picky\\". It has never been this FUN to be vegan! :)"},{"Title":"La Dolce Vegan!: Vegan Livin' Made Easy","review":"I am very, very picky and I absolutely love this book. Having read much of Sarah Kramer's blog, I don't think she is in love with herself or arrogant in any way. She seems like a very kind, sincere, warm person who just wants to share her life. I did not like Vegan with A Vengeance or Dreena Burton's books. They have very complicated recipes that taste terrible, with the exception of the desserts.La Dolce Vegan is the kind of food I like: simple, easy, but very tasty. It is worth the price of the book for the Vegan Cheeseburger Pizza recipe alone. If you like the tastes on a burger, you will love this one. I've made it several times, once for a friend who was visiting from out of town, who flipped for it. The mushroom soup is also really, really good. Another recipe I can't stop making is the peanut butter coconut cereal bars with chocolate topping. I am addicted to these and have brought them into my office a few times. Co-workers have asked for the recipe and get excited when they see me arrive with them.The recipes are also economical. The ingredients you have to buy for the pizza will make three pizzas, the ingredients for the cereal bars will make a couple of batches(with tons of cereal left over).As with any cookbook, there are a few duds. The Simple Oatmeal Cookies were terrible, very plain and tasteless. But that's the only bad one I've found. If you like hearty, American cooking with a fun, amusing style, get this book."},{"Title":"La Dolce Vegan!: Vegan Livin' Made Easy","review":"I have all the cookbooks Kramer has worked on. They are all quite fab. La Dolce Vegan is my favorite though and I use it A LOT! It's wonderful because she generally keeps the recipes between 2-4 servings and about 30 minutes...but tells you with a clock symbol if it takes longer.I have recommended this book to two other friends that are taking a journey down vegan road. They like it too!Thus, if your interested in vegan meals and such I definitely suggest this be the first vegan cookbook you buy!"},{"Title":"La Dolce Vegan!: Vegan Livin' Made Easy","review":"as other's have said, i too admire sarah's commitment to veganism, but, wow, there are so many other cookbooks out there that do a better job. i have owned this book for at least a year and i rarley use it. when i do, it is for one super easy vegan chocolate cake recipe (but i have since found better recipes elsewhere). i guess i just really appreciate cookbook authors that use more creativity and come up with recipes themselves. dreena burton's cookbooks are better by far and so is isa's vegan with a vengence. i am presently awaiting the arrival of veganomicon in the mail and know it will blow this one out of the water!"},{"Title":"La Dolce Vegan!: Vegan Livin' Made Easy","review":"If you weren't thinking about becoming a vegan before reading this cookbook then you will after! Yes, I said \\"reading\\" this cookbook. This is not just a cookbook that you will look up a recipe and put down (though you will do that from time to time) it is more like an inspirational book that you bring to bed with you or on the plane or curl up under a blanket by the fire with.I cannot think of another text that has inspired me as much! Though there are minor mistakes - aren't we all a little fallible at times? That is the point - make mistakes, learn from them, and move on. Sarah is an inspiration for her small carbon footprint and huge compassion - Thank you!"},{"Title":"La Dolce Vegan!: Vegan Livin' Made Easy","review":"The author is really sweet and she has a LOT of recipes. The only problem (which is more on my end) is that I'm not vegan; I just have a lot of stomach issues and vegan food helps in some cases. So I didn't have all the ingredients she needed for her recipes (and I stock a lot of ingredients at my place..), and a lot of her recipes have a high number of them. But the recipes are easy to follow and she has a nice selection.In summary: best if you are a vegan, somewhat helpful if otherwise."},{"Title":"La Dolce Vegan!: Vegan Livin' Made Easy","review":"La Dolce Vegan was the second vegan cookbook I bought myself when I first made the transition to a vegan diet eight years ago. When I purchased it, I was honestly just learning to cook. At that stage of my life, I suppose this wasn't a terrible cookbook. The recipes are super simple, and most of them are quick to prepare and cook. However, now that I've had the opportunity to read more vegan cookbooks, along with the experience I've gained from cooking, I would say that this book isn't worth the money. I would say I've made 40-50% of the recipes in this book, so keep that in mind for the rest of this review.My main gripe with this book is that the recipes feel lazy and uninspired. There's nothing new or out of the ordinary here. You can find these recipes in pretty much every cookbook you pick up. Or, you could honestly come up with a lot of them on your own just using common sense. (Potatoes+oil+seasoning=food?)Second, some of these recipes just don't work. As I've mentioned, I've been cooking for 8+ years now, and I'm considered really adept at it by my friends and family. There are some recipes here I just couldn't fix. Also, all of the seitan recipes are terrible.Third, I hope you like lots of pictures of your cookbook author. I mean, lots. There are absolutely no photographs of the food, but I counted 39 photos of Sarah Kramer. The photos have absolutely nothing to do with anything, most of them are just self-portraits or pictures of her with random people.There is such a plethora of vegan cookbooks on the market that are better than La Dolce Vegan in every way. If you get this cookbook as a gift, congrats. But I wouldn't recommend spending money on it. Buy something like Veganomicon instead."},{"Title":"La Dolce Vegan!: Vegan Livin' Made Easy","review":"I have used recipes from their various books and I have really liked most of them. I need to try out more of their recipes"},{"Title":"La Dolce Vegan!: Vegan Livin' Made Easy","review":"This should be standard issue for all vegans. Fun, truly easy recipes with great advice throughout."},{"Title":"La Dolce Vegan!: Vegan Livin' Made Easy","review":"I love this book, and the two previous ones as well. When I turned vegan earlier this year I wanted a cookbook with recipes that were easy to follow, easy to prepare, that didn't have a long list of ingredients (because frankly, my eyes glaze over after about the fifth one), and one that didn't require me to shop outside of my regular grocery store. I also wanted to be able to make substitutions and not be afraid that the result would be a disaster if I didn't happen to have ingredient x, y or z on hand. Being on a tight budget though I thought it'd be wise to check out a whole bunch of books from the library before committing my dollars, and boy was I glad I did. I ended up disliking a number of the other well known and highly recommended vegan books on Amazon because they were just too exotic for me. If I have to Google an ingredient to find out what it is first, then I'm not likely to have it in the house or be interested in buying it. Plus my eyes glazed over way too many times! I was also surprised by how many vegan cookbooks were so drab and boring in appearance. In contrast, this book is bright, colourful and fun, and while that may not be important to everyone, I find it helps cooking to be more fun too. So what I often end up doing now is looking through all three books (I was so impressed I bought the set) to see which recipe appeals to me the most based on the ingredients I happen to have at hand. In short, I highly recommend this and all her other books."},{"Title":"La Dolce Vegan!: Vegan Livin' Made Easy","review":"I really like a lot of these recipes, but some aren't so hot. It is easy to follow and generally easy to find the ingredients listed, but some recipes are just gross (despite a description that suggests otherwise). One example is the Chocolate Pecan Cookies that contain silken tofu and are described as (paraphrasing here) \\"chewy gooey chocolately\\" yummy. They were really strange and gross, I ended up throwing the batch away (it wasn't the taste as much as the texture and how sick they made me feel). However, as already stated, many recipes are excellent such as the Yellow Cake (which I used to make cupcakes, cooking about 18 minutes)."},{"Title":"La Dolce Vegan!: Vegan Livin' Made Easy","review":"This is an enormously tasty cookbook. My family is not vegan, but we find this cookbook extremely helpful in having healthy, natural foods, and also find that our highly allergic daughter has many choices to enjoy. It is used daily. The desserts are fabulous and HEALTHY!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"La Dolce Vegan!: Vegan Livin' Made Easy","review":"I thought it was a bit interesting that the majority of the recipes were from people other then the author but my main reason for purchasing the book was for the recipes. I don't care who came up with the recipe, if it's good it's good.I've tried about 15 of the recipes thus far and I must say I haven't been disappointed yet. The DIY section was interesting and gave me ideas to work off of for myself.I myself have only been vegan for a little less than a year and I'm still a \\"newbie\\". I still need to find my niche with cooking and this book is really helping me out. It's nice to have recipes that were created by a variety of people b/c we all have different tastes.I give this book a 4 out of 5 stars."},{"Title":"La Dolce Vegan!: Vegan Livin' Made Easy","review":"This is the second best cookbook I own. The first is one of Sarah's other books, How It All Vegan. They both make veganism fun and accesible. And this book in particular makes it easy. Most recipes are very quick to make, so a hectic life is no longer an excuse not to eat well."},{"Title":"La Dolce Vegan!: Vegan Livin' Made Easy","review":"I borrowed this book, used it, and plan to purchase it. I admit I am disappointed with her use of repeating recipes more than once, and on more than one recipe. But this is more than I was disappointed in her using other people's recipes. I agree it does discourage me a bit to know that almost half of them are from people who emailed, predominantly Wolfie, than all from her. But I can really appreciate that she has a big enough following to gather them and that she gruelingly tested them and is sending them our way, as opposed to hogging them since they're not her creations. Don't these people who complain of this realize Betty Crocker's not just one person? I can appreciate others who don't like all the pix of her and none of food, but I don't find it egocentric. One thing about Sarah Kramer is that her cookbooks are fun! Veganism sounds so dull to so many, that I'm not only impressed at how she makes it exciting, but at how she compiles good recipes in a very easy to follow way. My only objection with her foods is that she seems to be heavy handed when it comes to salt. Also, my fake ham and fake fish didn't turn out as great as I'd hoped, but the rest was awesome! Besides, I haven't found any recipes like those anywhere else, or things like how to make her vegan marshmallows. And in her defense, I didn't follow the the ingredients completely, and if that doesn't make the right difference, I'm sure they can be tweaked. It would be nice to have that ahead of time, but that's an opinion and at least I have something to go on, which I find true with most cookbooks anyway. I also love the meatless balls and her choc chip cookies are possibly the best, vegan or non, ones I've found, among many other great recipes."},{"Title":"La Dolce Vegan!: Vegan Livin' Made Easy","review":"The recipes are great, as usual, but the photography in this book made me so annoyed, I gave it to my mother."},{"Title":"La Dolce Vegan!: Vegan Livin' Made Easy","review":"Take this review with a grain (or should that be a pinch?) of salt, because I've only yet tried two of the recipes in this book. But if the Cinnamon Walnut Coffee Cake (which also uses the Faux Sour Cream recipe) is any measure, this cookbook rocks. I've made that cake twice now (one for each time it appears in the book--go figure) and the result was not only the best coffee cake ever to pass my lips, it was at least as good as any cake I've had.Please note that my impression of this book is almost entirely unswayed by the mildly salacious pix of the author showing off her garters."},{"Title":"La Dolce Vegan!: Vegan Livin' Made Easy","review":"Entertaining, cute graphics and photos.

Oh, and I love the recipes too! I am new to this whole \\"no animal product\\" cooking thing, and with this book I was able to dive right in and not miss one thing about my old food life! Thank Sarah for this great book!Have a great day,Sarah K."},{"Title":"La Dolce Vegan!: Vegan Livin' Made Easy","review":"Purchased for my daughter. She loves this book. Has uses it almost daily for various things. She says that anyone who is vegan this is an must."},{"Title":"La Dolce Vegan!: Vegan Livin' Made Easy","review":"Le Dolce Vegan, the third cookbook by Sarah Kramer is a true joy. I have over three hundred cookbooks, but Sarah's blow my socks off. They're also some of the ones I use the most, even when cooking for non-vegans. Why?Her books are not only full of the most delicious, mouthwatering recipes ever, but they are also full of cook cooking tips, nifty crafts, pop culture, and humor. This and the two preceding books she did with Tanya Bernard I have read though and through before I ever cooked out of them, just because they're fun! Sarah is also down to earth, and her books aren't preachy like other vegan books. No guilt trips here. Just good food. How good?Wow! Not only is this book full of many yummy general recipes, the deserts in this book are to die for. Yum! Sarah also tells us how to make our own faux meat from scratch, so no more having to buy the pricey stuff from the heath food store. 95% of the ingredients used are simple things every grocery store has, and when something even semi-exotic is used, a common counterpart that can be substituted is named. Most of the recipes make 4 small or 2 large helpings, and can be made in 20-30 minutes. I appreciate this so much!I know that I'm ranting on and on, I just literally can't say enough about Sarah or this book. If you or someone you know is vegan, or even if you want to eat healthier, I can't recommend this book enough! It's just too much fun!"},{"Title":"La Dolce Vegan!: Vegan Livin' Made Easy","review":"There are lots of reasons to love this cookbook: the aesthetics, the fashion tips, the motivational text. But the real reason you should own this cookbook---and the two previous volumes as well, which were co-authored by Kramer---is the fact that the recipes rock: they are simple, creative, easy and delicious. So many cookbooks are inaccessible in that they are unrealistic: yes, the recipes might be wonderful, fanstastic, even inpirational, but most of us want fast and simple. There are some \\"complex\\" recipes in here, too, but for the most part, these are dishes that are in the 30-minute- or-less range. Sadly, a lot of the better vegan cookbooks out there are very involved, time-consuming and full of obscure ingredients.That said, this cookbook is not perfect. It could stand one more good editing. I could list all of the small mistakes I found (such as places where ingredients were listed, and then not mentioned in the actual part where you assemble/cook the recipe). But these omissions are minor, and there aren't many of them. Little mistakes in cookbooks can spell disaster, but the oversights, at least the ones I've found, are all obvious and inconsequential.My biggest suggestion for this cookbook would be more tips on how to improvise some of the dishes (Vegan With A Vengeance is full of suggestions on how to alter recipes based on what's sitting around in the refrigerator). Several of the recipes I've made lend themselves to a multitude of variations. This would have made an already good cookbook great."},{"Title":"La Dolce Vegan!: Vegan Livin' Made Easy","review":"As an enthusiastic fan of How it all Vegan and Garden of Vegan, I'm sorry to say I was very disappointed with this book. La Dolce Vegan is overloaded with stirfrys and other simple recipes you could pretty much figure out for yourself. There are also a lot redundant recipes for the same dish, and just silly fluff like chocolate-covered pretzels that nobody needs a cookbook to make. There may some gems in this book, but they get lost in a sea of what seems to be filler.Also, I would have to agree that it is pretty obnoxious that there are more pictures of Sarah Kramer being cute and quirky than there are pictures of the actual food, especially since many of the recipes are credited to other people.I was once told that a cookbook is a good purchase if you find just a handful of recipes that you enjoy enough to start making regularly, but I didn't find any such recipes with this book. I didn't even pick up any useful cooking tips. Pick up the first two books from this author if you like, but skip this one."},{"Title":"La Dolce Vegan!: Vegan Livin' Made Easy","review":"So you know how the internet is chock full of weird recipes by everyone and their grandmother involving ketchup and mustard as the main seasoning ingredients and how most of it tastes only palatable?Well, sadly, that's this cookbook in a nutshell.I've tried six of these recipes and they all failed to pass muster in much the same way unrated recipes off the internet tend to. This doesn't surprise me too much since most of the recipes are actually recipes sent to the author by her fans and her friends. A nice thought but she really should have done some serious culinary editing. If a free recipe I've jacked from some website bombs I just shrug my shoulders - I should have known better. If a recipe from a cookbook I've payed about 20 bucks for bombs I get a little tetchy.Sometimes people don't like a vegan or vegetarian recipe because they've never eaten tofu before or think that tahini is the misspelled name of a pacific island and why is it being called for in this recipe?! Sometimes people just aren't used to the way carob chips taste and get testy when they were expecting them to taste EXACTLY like chocolate chips. This is not my problem. I've been vegetarian for 12 years, vegan for 1 year, I grew up in a hippie household eating health food and I've been cooking for myself since I was ten.I feel sad about having to write such an unfavorable review. Sarah seems like someone I would really like and the book does have a section of fun vegan stuff (plus cute retro pics of Sarah) that aren't without merit. However since her book is marketed as a COOKbook and not a neat-vegan-stuff book I feel obligated to warn other not terribly wealthy vegans to save their cash. If you want to know how to make a vinyl cuff that says vegan on it or think pictures of Sarah Kramer being silly are worth 15 dollars than go for it. If you want delicious vegan recipes look elsewhere."},{"Title":"La Dolce Vegan!: Vegan Livin' Made Easy","review":"I used to own all of Sarah Kramer's books, but have given them away. They came highly recommended, but I found them to be too simple, and almost insulting. I mean, does a person really need a burrito recipe, or a fruit smoothie recipe?Plus, many of these recipes were contributed by fans, and since I got iffy results from them (and have friends who got the same iffy results), it makes me wonder if they were even kitchen tested before being considered for the book.Unrelated to the recipes----I would have preferred if investments had been made in a few really nice, color photographs of the FINISHED DISHES, rather than multiple, black & white photos of the author. Is it a cookbook, or a personal photo album?"},{"Title":"La Dolce Vegan!: Vegan Livin' Made Easy","review":"I ordered this book sight unseen, because I have her other two cookbooks, and I was not disappointed. This cookbook is great. I only found one typo (Wolffie's brownies need 1 1/4 cups of flour, not 1 cup; Wolffie let me know herself). Every recipe has been easy and my omni friends and relatives love them and don't even realize they're vegan recipes. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"},{"Title":"La Dolce Vegan!: Vegan Livin' Made Easy","review":"I am a fan of the previous two cookbooks in this series, but this one doesn't have much new to offer. Many of the recipes are from other people and there seems to be a lot of typos, which makes me doubt that all of the recipes were tested. Also the author's photo is on almost every page. Shouldn't the photos be of the food? Or how about no photos at all? It's distracting and self-absorbed. The index, as in the previous two Sarah Kramer vegan cookbooks, is virtually useless. There are no footers on the pages, so you have to page to a section's start page to know where you are in the book. There are some good recipes but I don't think I will buy Kramer's inevitable sequel."},{"Title":"La Dolce Vegan!: Vegan Livin' Made Easy","review":"Not sure exactly where the recent negative feedback is coming from on this book. I've been vegan for over ten years now. When my omnivorous guy and I got engaged, my mother-in-law didn't know anything about veganism or vegan cooking but was incredibly open to it--she thought it was an interesting new culinary challenge (yup, I lucked out in MIL department). This was one of two cookbooks she got.Let me tell you, the recipes out of this book are AMAZING. They are very easy--anything that requires over 30 min of prep time is marked with a little clock, and the ingredients are very accessible. My MIL, with minimal experience cooking vegan, has made incredible feasts with this book.For example, not only did she use it for holidays (Thanksgiving & Christmas); this cookbook was also the basis for a vegan-friendly bachelor party on the request of one of my fiancee's friends--all with fantastic results. Friends of ours have asked for the recipe to the fantastic chocolate frosting that for once isn't made out of chocolate chips, and the cake (a depression-era crazy cake with tofu that even my tofu-phobic brothers enjoyed and asked for more) to go with it. Just a moment ago, I finished a lunch of leftover fantastic peanutty soup that I made from a recipe in this book. I think we've found one recipe in the book that didn't really work well (a pie crust recipe), but everything else we've tried so far has been GREAT. In fact, MIL loaned us the book, and I am hard-pressed to give it back any time soon :)Some recipes make a lot of food, but I like Sarah's idea of just inviting over friends for a dinner party to use it up, or I just freeze/chill it and eat it for lunch at work. I especially appreciate Sarah creating recipes that use whole cans of ingredients. Recipes that require half the can, leaving you to strategize using it up or leaving it to rot forgotten in the back of the fridge, drive me crazy.I also appreciate that Kramer is very down-to-earth and not preachy--being vegan is at least as much about celebrating fantastic food as it is making a political point.Sorry to gush. Yes, the recipes are easy, and sometimes, yes, they could be things that you might come up on your own. But for those of us with \\"cook's block\\", or those new to vegan cooking, this is a very good start."},{"Title":"La Dolce Vegan!: Vegan Livin' Made Easy","review":"I love the overall content of this book. The recipes I've tried have been delicious, it's written in a laid-back, fun kind of way, and the author gives you recipes or substitutions to make a lot of the ingredients that aren't so easy to find (for example, there are five different ways to replace eggs and she actually tells you how to make faux meat from scratch). I don't have a problem with the fact that many of the recipes were written by people besides the author--it doesn't mean they don't taste good! There is just one reason it probably won't get as much use as the other vegan books I've recently... it has just about the worst, most incomplete index I've ever seen It's frustrating because I constantly rely on indexes to find ways to use up food I have that needs to be used up, and indexes are what I use to I find a recipe quickly if I don't remember where I saw it. But when I searched for both \\"garam\\" and \\"masala\\" there was no reference to either of her recipies for the spice mix, and her \\"Simple oatmeal cookies\\" couldn't be found by looking up \\"oats\\" or \\"oatmeal.\\" Oh, and adding nutritional information wouldn't be a bad idea either...."},{"Title":"La Dolce Vegan!: Vegan Livin' Made Easy","review":"I'm not going to rave and rave about this book like everyone else. It is merely \\"aw-ight.\\" I do appreciate Kramer's commitment to veganism and her personal thoughts about that, but the many, MANY pictures of her on, like, every other page get corny after a while. Many of the recipes are things that any halfway creative person that had a clue could pull together on their own. I think the book could have used some editing, both for bulk (like nixing some of these no-brainer recipes) and for correctness: there is a recipe for a sauce that tells the reader to mix two powdered ingredients in a blender and makes no mention of water or any liquid. Hello!?!"},{"Title":"La Dolce Vegan!: Vegan Livin' Made Easy","review":"I just became vegan recently and this book is truly fab! Now I'll never miss my old dishes....sooo many yummy, versatile recipes in this book, as well as vegan versions of classics (\\"meat\\" loaf, carrot cake, etc)Most require little time or very many ingredients and there are so many helpful basic cooking tips (vegan or otherwise)The author has a charming and amusing writing style and this book makes you feel like you have a great friend in the kitchen. Her enthusiasm and passion for veganism is a wonderful inspiration!"},{"Title":"La Dolce Vegan!: Vegan Livin' Made Easy","review":"This is it! The good 'ol standby when you know time is of the essence and you have to have dinner fast. I would compare this to the \\"Betty Crocker\\" in the typical diet world. You know you can turn to it and find a recipe and have dinner on the table in no time. There is a great mix of recipes, but I have to admit I really love her dessert recipes the best. I have taken some cookies to friends and they have commented on how good they were and even asked for the recipe. I explained that they are from a Vegan cookbook, but they didn't care. Unfortunately there are no pictures in this book (if that is something that you must have) but it hasn't stopped me and she hasn't written all of these recipes. Many are credited to other people and not everything is original -- you can find similar things on the internet. All in all a decent book to turn to when you are in a hurry and have some general ingredients on hand."},{"Title":"La Dolce Vegan!: Vegan Livin' Made Easy","review":"I love to cook and I am very critical of cookbooks... and just food in general. The recipes in this book appear to have been submitted by other people via the internet. Furthermore, they don't seem like they were tested. How can put your name on a cookbook when you are just compiling a bunch of recipes submitted by other people.I am a defender of vegan food: it is not boring, bland, or unexciting. You wouldn't know that from this book. There is nothing more disappointing then buying a load of expensive ingredients, following a recipe, then watching it flop. Every recipe I've tried was unappealing to me in either texture or flavor.I didn't even keep this book, I sold it to a used book store.In conclusion, this book looks pretty but doesn't deliver. I like that Sarah Kramer has brought a lot of positive attention to vegans, but if you are putting yourself out there as a cookbook author, how about putting a little more effort into the recipes not the photography.For awesome vegan cookbooks with amazing recipes created by the hardwork of the authors check out any cookbook with Isa Chandra Moskowitz and Terry Hope Romero"},{"Title":"La Dolce Vegan!: Vegan Livin' Made Easy","review":"I was really excited to get this cookbook, but I was disappointed after looking through it. It has some good recipes (the banana bars are the best), but I think the author actually only provided a few of them. It seems like half of the recipes (or more) came from someone in Florida named 'Wolffie'. I recommend 'Vegan With a Vengeance' instead."},{"Title":"La Dolce Vegan!: Vegan Livin' Made Easy","review":"Sarah Kramer is one of my favorite vegan cookbook authors ever. Her books are so user friendly and would be great for a beginner. The back of the book has a wonderful index. Example: You can look up Butternut Squash in the index and it will tell you every recipe that has butternut squash in it. Great for when you have veggies, fruit, etc. that you are trying to get rid of. None of her recipes are too out there like some cookbooks. She tells you what you can replace certain ingredients with too. Of her three full sized books this is the one I seem to go to at least once a week. Vegan A Go Go rocks though!"},{"Title":"La Dolce Vegan!: Vegan Livin' Made Easy","review":"I have to admit, when I first got this cookbook, I wasn't entirely sure I was going to like it. Some of the ingredients seemed a little too American homestyle to really taste good, and I was also surprised that the author had collected these recipes from friends and readers. But recently I decided to try a bunch of her recipes and even when I second guessed the ingredients- I found that the recipes (Wulfie's including) resulted in yummy and satisfying home-cooked dishes perfect for a relatively fast meal. I do a lot of elaborate cooking, vegan and otherwise, and sometimes it's nice to find a collection of recipes that are healthy and nutritious, fast AND *gasp* taste good. On the few nights I don't cook elaborate dinners, I have been guilty of reaching for a box meal or making plain pasta... now, with this collection, I can whip up a fast and tasty meal in the same amount of time. They also went over surprisingly well with my non-vegetarian husband, which is rare for a vegan cookbook. I'll be hanging on to this cookbook for a long time, and giving many more of these recipes a try in the future! I also can't eat wheat or gluten, and found plenty of recipes in here that i could either adapt or were already gluten-free. Yay!"},{"Title":"La Dolce Vegan!: Vegan Livin' Made Easy","review":"I was a little apprehensive after reading some of the other reviews for Sarah's books, but after I had finally purchased my own copy of Vegan Livin' Made Easy, I was thrilled.

All three of the books in which Sarah Kramer has had a hand (\\"How it all Vegan!\\" \\"The Garden of Vegan,\\" and her first solo effort, \\"La Dolce Vegan!\\") are cute, kitschy, and full of fabulous recipes. Like her prior two efforts, there is a chapter in the back that is not food related, this one a crafter's dream, with how to make a custom dressmaker's dummy (for those of you who make your own clothes), items you can use to make a clock, making jewelry with found items, a skirt from a pillowcase, and other fun, funky projects.At 317 pages (excluding the index), \\"La Dolce Vegan!\\" is thicker than her collaborations with Tanya Bernard. And as other reviewers have noted, most of the recipes can be made within 30 minutes, with those that take longer marked with a funky clock icon. However, some of these recipes are just those that require a long cooking time, and you can make your sides while your dish cooks.

So far, everything I've tried has been tasty and very easy to make. I really appreciate a cookbook that contains natural, whole foods cooking that is quick to make and tastes great. The flax bread recipe alone is worth the cost of the book to me.As other reviewers mentioned:There are typos. And at least one error in the index, the Tu-No recipe is nowhere to be found. So I wrote the page number in the index myself. And yes, some of the photos can get irritating with the repetition of Sarah's \\"Betty Boop\\" pursed lips. Pursed lips aside, I wish Sarah would write a fashion book, I love her style! And yes, a portion of the recipes aren't Sarah's, but are from folks who contributed them. SO WHAT?!

While it took about an hour to decide on the other two books, this one jumped out at me from the get-go and introduced me to a new world where becoming vegan wasn't all hard work and having to justify my beliefs and choices.This book, to me, is showing that it can be fun to be vegan. The recipes were more varied than I ever realised when I was a lactovegetarian and as soon as I got home from the bookstore I sifted through the pages with post-its in hand dazzled by all the recipes I wanted to try.So far I have tried a few of the veggie recipes and a muffin recipe and all were top-notch. I can only recommend this book as a new vegan but I highly recommend it for others like me - a new lone vegan in a see of omnivores!"},{"Title":"La Dolce Vegan!: Vegan Livin' Made Easy","review":"Many of the recipes in this book are phenomenal. I would particularly recommend \\"On Golden Pond Mushroom Soup,\\" which instantly became my husband's (and my)absolute favorite soup, though he is not even a vegetarian. I often get asked for the recipe by other non-vegetarians when I make something from this book.Some of the recipes are less inspiring. The stir-fry and pasta dishes I have tried so far have been somewhat bland. Still, it is the first book I open when I am looking for something new to make for dinner.Though this is irrelevant to the quality of the recipes, I find the pictures of Ms. Kramer plastered all over the book to be rather off-putting. Although I have no problem with the fact that the majority of the recipes comes from outside contributors, Ms. Kramer's diminished creative role in preparing the text only serves to give the continual self-reference the unfortunate appearance of an ego run wild.Nonetheless, I am grateful to her for putting this book together. I would just like to see a little less of her face in the next one."},{"Title":"La Dolce Vegan!: Vegan Livin' Made Easy","review":"I own all three of Sarah's cookbooks, and I love them ALL.

I already posted my Amazon Review of this book where it remained on 'MY PROFILE' for a couple of weeks. Now it's gone. To be certain, this is not the first time I've had Reviews zapped into the ether. I've gone back and checked previous reviews and responses. Some reviews seem to be absent and, in a number of cases, preexisting 'votes' have disappeared or, in some cases, changed i.e. 'positive' votes somehow become 'negative' votes. I'm wondering how many other reviewers have experienced these problems?Anyway, I'm attempting another review on 'Voyage of the Damned.' I found it an easy read--a novelistic history--that the authors have carefully documented by first-person accounts and passages from diaries. In terms of 'hard' history, the book suffers from the novelistic approach. Time and again the authors include the details of discussions and thought processes that are beyond the purview of strict scholarship. No matter.Over 900 Jews board the S.S. St. Louis, commanded by one Capt. Schroeder, in an attempt to flee Germany for Cuba. The timing of the voyage is significant. It falls between the date of Kristallnacht [Nov. 9-10, 1938] and the start of WW II [Sept. 30, 1939]. These are people who have experienced official antisemitism followed by the traumatic events of Kristallnacht, at which time approximately 30,000 Jewish men--simply because they were Jews--were sent to Nazi concentration camps. Two things should be noted. At this time the total number of Jews in Germany was perhaps 400,000. Also, most of the 30,000 sent to concentration camps were later freed on the condition that they leave Germany. Some of the St. Louis' passengers were Jews freed from concentration camps under mandates to evacuate Germany.On the other hand, Hitler didn't dictate his 'Final Solution' order until 1941. The Jews on the St. Louis were certainly desperate to leave Germany but had no way of predicting extermination. I believe the authors give the impression that these people were fleeing certain death...but...they had no way of predicting Nazi policy almost two years in the future. At the time of the SS. St. Louis incident, official German policy was to drive Jews out of Germany by a mixture of terror and intimidation. Half or more German Jews fled Germany before the onset of war in September, 1939. The people on this ship were engaged in an operation quite approved of by the Nazis. To be certain the Nazi propaganda machine was delighted by the fact that the 'world', especially Cuba and U.S., refused entry to these star-crossed folks...but this was simple Nazi opportunism.The major criminal in the whole nasty affair was Bru, the Cuban 'president'. It seems that neither the Nazis nor the passengers understood the depth of Latin political corruption. It's an old, old story in many countries including many Latin countries. If you have an opportunity to squeeze a victim for everything he's got then, SQEEEEEEEZZE him hard. If the passengers,and the various Jewish committees understood this, the crisis wouldn't have occurred. They should have been prepared to bribe Bru maximally and quickly. In drawing out the bribery process too long, with [from Bru's pecuniary point of view] insultingly low offers, they finally managed to offend the corrupt but prickly Cuban. The rest is history.The Abwehr story is unpleasant but insignificant. Admiral Canaris, Chief of the Abwehr, was anti-Hitler, anti-Nazi and worked for the Resistance. Many Abwehr operations seem to have gone mysteriously amiss and secret information oftentimes fell into the hands of the Allies. Canaris was executed by Hitler's henchmen.Captain Schoeder seems to have been a decent man who took risks for his Jewish passengers that would have gotten him punished had his actions been contrary to Nazi orders and policy. Significantly, Schroeder wasn't punished likely because--despite all difficulties--he managed to discharge Nazi policy i.e. to get his Jewish passengers out of Germany."},{"Title":"Voyage of the Damned","review":"Possible identity of Julius Otto Ott as Fabio Grobart.Thomas, Gordon and Max Morgan-Witts 2010 (edition) Voyage of the Damned: A Shocking True Story of Hope, Betrayal, and and Nazi Terror.

Through the years, the story of the SS St. Louis has always stayed in my mind, particularly when I teach the Holocaust to my high school US History students every year. As I lost my first copy many years ago while loaning it out, I decided to buy it and read it again. I'm so glad that I did.Whenever I teach my unit on the Holocaust, I am amazed and sickened that mankind can be so cruel. It is so hard to believe that a species that has such a capacity to love and to achieve great things, also has the capacity to hate and do horrible things. And this book has both. It is truly incredible that this is all a true story. The horrors and evils of Nazism are so apparent from the first page onward. I shook my head so many times while reading it. I was appalled and sickened by the Nazi villains, but also gladdened by the humanity shown by the Captain of the ship, Gustav Schroeder, who was a true hero, much like Oskar Schindler. He and many crew members took a big risk in treating the Jews on board with utmost respect, while they were being observed and thwarted, time and time again, by Gestapo and Abwehr members on board. The book has all the elements of a good spy thriller, and you'd swear it was fiction. Unfortunately, all of this really happened.Shakespeare himself could not have written a better story of tragedy, and the triumph of the human spirit, portrayed in these pages. Then, when you consider that it is all true, that makes the story so much more pertinent and poignant.When the ship arrives in Cuba, with the promise of freedom and deliverance right at their feet, you'd be sicked by the outcome. Even more sickening was how the Jews were treated more like cargo than humans, and how corrupt the Cuban government was in their refusal to take them in. On the other hand, there were many good people who worked behind the scenes to make it possible for them to land. But the Cuban authorities were more interested in money and public opinion than in doing the right thing. President Franklin Roosevelt doesn't get off the hook either. This man, so great in so many ways, was not great at all in this sad chapter of history.This book is a page turner, and the authors should be commended for the vast amount of research they have obviously put into the story. I am still amazed by the amount of detail that is included, and as an historian, that is very important to me. The reader can feel confident that he is getting the whole truth, that very little is left out.I recommend this book to any student of history, and to anyone who wants to know the truth about the SS St. Louis. I also saw the 1976 movie of the same name, and it is quite good, and stuck to the facts most of the time... but I sure wish that someone like Steven Spielberg would remake the movie. The Holocaust- the Shoah- must not be forgotten. And I will never forget this tragic story. You won't, either."},{"Title":"Voyage of the Damned","review":"&quot;Voyage of the Damned&quot; is the infamous true story of the ill-fated 1939 voyage of the S.S. St. Louis, which carried 937 Jews who were fleeing Hitler. They hoped for freedom, but found only disappointment and, in some cases, death. The St. Louis made it safely Cuba, but the passengers were turned away under the influence of Hitler's anti-Jewish propaganda. Next, they sailed for the Florida Coast, only to be refused entry into the USA because of immigration quotas. For weeks the St. Louis sailed up and down the coast while Congress debated whether to make an exception and let them in. In the end, even a plea from President Roosevelt could not open America's doors to these refugees. The St.Louis was sent back to Europe, where her passengers were dispersed to France, Belgium, Great Britain, and the Netherlands. Some perished in Hitler's concentration camps. Others lived to tell the story.This tragic event remains an ugly blot on America's past, and is one of the reasons for the &quot;Law of Return&quot; in modern Israel (which allows any Jew who is fleeing persecution in any country to enter Israel immediately upon arrival with no hassles.) It is also the reason that Israel was the first country in the world to grant political asylum to Vietnamese &quot;boat people&quot; fleeing the Communist regime at the end of the Vietnam War. The story also had an effect on America's current immigration laws, which make better provisions for granting asylum.&quot;Voyage of the Damned&quot; was first published in 1974 and became an instant bestseller. It was made into a movie in 1977, and won three Academy Award nominations. It went through a number of printings, and was re-issued in 1994 as a fine &quot;coffee-table&quot; hardcover with 300 pictures, including reproductions of tickets, telegrams, passports, menus, newspaper articles, official documents, etc. as well as photos of the crew and passengers. To make the story more personalized, the 1994 version also features &quot;cameo&quot; photo albums, focusing on three specific families. For sheer wealth of information as well as human interest, the photo edition is the one to buy -- if you can find a copy."},{"Title":"Voyage of the Damned","review":"I was totally absorbed in this narrative history.

I first saw the movie with Fay Dunaway and several other prominent stars of past generation. It was captivating and I just had to read about these poor people who were like pawns being shuffled around from Hamburg to Havana Cuba and then across Atlantic back to England. This was definitely worth buying.

This book would serve as a prime example of why.Over 900 Jews head from Germany to Cuba. They are seeking asylum. The Nazis are using them as a pawn to show the world that they do not stop these people from leaving as they wish.The characters are many and you may have a little problem sorting them all out at times, but do not let this deter you from reading this great work. A few key elements and characters are the S S St. Louis's German (but not Nazi) Captain, a group of Nazi's on board, Cuban Officials with their own agenda (and greed), America's isolationist viewpoint, and of course the innocent Jews that start on a voyage to freedom but soon learn that they are unwanted by the very countries that could save them. Some of there individual stories are gripping if not overwhelming.This is a 'must read' for anyone with an interest in WWII or an interest in man's inhumamity to man. It is filled with heros; it is filled with villans. You will feel the despair of the unfortunates as well as disgust for those that could have saved them.Enough said.

Now, over thirty five years later, I decided to read it again. Time has not diminished the power of the narrative to keep the reader riveted to its pages.This well-researched and superbly written work of non-fiction details the story of the voyage to end all voyages, that of the 1939 sailing of the SS St. Louis. This ship, laden with nine hundred and thirty seven German Jews, was scheduled to go to Cuba. There, the passengers believed, they would disembark, finding surcease from the horror of the Nazi regime and its policies against Jews. It was to be their last chance dance. Unfortunately, everyone, including the Captain of the ship, had been sadly misinformed.What happened when the passengers arrived in Cuba triggered an international crisis that would not reflect well on the world at large. Captain Gustav Shroeder, in whose veins ran the milk of human kindness, vowed not to return his passengers to Germany, where he surmised the fate that would await them. He did this, even though it was apparent to him that there were Gestapo agents aboard his ship.The voyage of the SS St. Louis was to capture the attention of the world. Unfortunately, too little was to be done too late to forestall the eventual final solution that the Nazis had in mind. This book, however, chronicles the triumph of the human spirit at a time when there was little over which to rejoice. It is a book that should be read by all those interested in history, as well as those who are interested in a remarkable true story that almost defies belief. Indeed, truth is sometimes stranger than fiction."},{"Title":"Voyage of the Damned","review":"It always feels strange to say I \\"liked\\" a book about the atrocities of Nazi-torn Germany. This older book was recommended by a friend who shares my interest in that era, though, and I'm glad that I took her advice and read it, because it answered a lot of questions for me.I have always wondered how the rest of the world could sit by for so long and do nothing while hundreds of thousands of Jews were sent to concentration camps and ultimately put to death by the Nazis. This book answers that question. The sad and simple truth is that most of the world's governments either believed the propaganda put forth by the Nazis and judged the Jews by a different standard than the rest of the human race, or simply didn't care and turned a blind eye to their suffering, and that included the United States. Unfortunately, much of the citizenry apparently felt the same way, although at the time of the sailing of the St. Louis, many were unaware of the details of what actually went on in the German concentration camps. Fortunately, there were at least some who sympathized with how the Jews were treated, but not nearly enough, and none that were outspoken enough to deter the rest.Voyage of the Damned follows the plight of the cruise ship St. Louis, which set sail from Hamburg, Germany in May of 1939 with over 900 Jewish refugees, bound for freedom. Hitler allowed this exodus because he could exploit it in the media as a means of convincing the world of his humanity. There was also a Nazi spy ring on board who was using the ship as a \\"cover\\" to carry U.S. war strategy back to Germany. The plan was for the refugees to remain in Cuba only until such time that they would be welcomed into the U.S. The passengers were issued paperwork (for a fee) that was to assure them of their welcome in Cuba, but this paperwork was produced in a less than legal manner and without authority of the Cuban President. Ultimately, President Bru of Cuba issued a proclamation that prohibited the Jews from landing there, and they languished on the ship in Havana's harbor for many days while negotiations were attempted by an American-based refugee assistance organization. The negotiations failed, because this organization was either unable or unwilling to meet President Bru's conditions - namely, pay his price to allow the Jews to come in. Ultimately, they were forced to leave the Cuban waters.What followed was horrific. The thought of being returned to Germany was untenable to these refugees, many of whom had spent time in concentration camps previously, and had no doubt that to return to Germany would mean their certain death. While the ship lay in \\"limbo\\", the sympathetic Captain and crew of the ship and a passenger committee worked to try and boost morale, avoid suicides, and hold the few Nazis on board in check. Various European governments conferred and ultimately, refuge was found in a split of the refugees between Belgium, England, France, and Holland. Although the refugees could not know this at the time, the country that they were assigned to would be the deciding factor in their fate.This book was well-written and interesting, if appalling (as most books of that genre are)."},{"Title":"Voyage of the Damned","review":"In the vein of Walter Lord's A NIGHT TO REMEMBER and DAY OF INFAMY, this wonderful book details the horrific journey of persecuted Jews and their desperate attempt to flee Nazi Germany.

A fascinating and important read, especially for history enthusiasts."},{"Title":"Voyage of the Damned","review":"This is a good book, but gets 3 stars due to length, pace and the amount of typos.Overall the book is a relatively easy read and comes across as a docu-drama to the reader rather than a purely factual history book. Considering the difficult task of objectively narrating a multitude of family histories alongside a complex socio-political historical backdrop, the book can be considered a true success. It's certainly an easy story to make into a movie, which is probably why it's already been done (at least twice).Written in diary format, the book seemed a bit long and slow at times, but nevertheless managed to draw the reader into the story. The authors provide plenty of detail surrounding all aspects of the voyage and ship, as well as its passengers, crew, and the overall political climate of the time, both in Europe and elsewhere. In sum, it is certainly well worth the read and the paperback price if you are interested in this era or the events in question.I particularly enjoyed the epilogue, which provided a well-rounded post-war *how it all turned out in the end* conclusion to the story as a whole. The photographs were also a welcome addition and served to complement the book quite well.On the downside, perhaps due to the diary format, the book was a bit long to get through, even though a page count of 306 is reasonable considering the task at hand. I also found it contained a surprisingly annoying amount of typos, especially when taking into account that it is a revised 2010 edition.For researchers: the book is not indexed, but does include a respectable bibliography and a list of interviewees.The paper and binding are all of good quality, and the font size is decent causing minimal eye strain. Amazon lists it as 320 pages, but the story with epilogue run to 306."},{"Title":"Microstructural Characterization of Materials","review":"this book is good for those who are in teh senior year or first year of gradute school.gives insight(though not extensive) into the many tools which are used by a materials engineer in his research.....should be coupled with a lab experience so that the reader will appreciate the book's content.Overall,recommended for beginers."},{"Title":"Farm Under a Lake","review":"It's alomost impossible to put this book down, so you'll want to have at least a few hours before you get started.

They patter across a wooden floor andrun like water over stones in a stream. She makes storytellingseem effortless, fluid, as most of us would like it to be. Thisstory brings you hard into the center of a young woman's lifeas she confronts grief and lost dreams.Bergland's prose simply left me breathless. I read it twice in my first sitting. That shehas not yet produced a second novel or other work is as closeto real tragedy as you'll find in the literary world.

Her writing is breathtaking. The dignity and tragedy of her characters is rendered so lovingly and with such grace. It is a quiet book, but one which resonates with you long after you've finished reading it. I cannot recommend it highly enough!"},{"Title":"Harvest: A Novel","review":"For anyone who has grown up on or near farm country -- particularly in Tennessee -- Catherine Landis' novel 'Harvest' will almost certainly hold some resonance. For others, it will perhaps offer insight into a likely story of how a farming family develops over the course of four generations after being forced from their land to make way for the Tennessee Valley Authority's dam project during the 1930s.The story of the Greene family is, while not surprising, a compelling one. Ms. Landis' narrative style is both genuine and detailed without becoming overly descriptive as each chapter shifts the story's emphasis from one character to another. The reader begins the story amid the family's exodus from the old farm to the new one, as experienced by the young child Arliss. As the novel progresses, the reader witnesses the parallel lives of the Greene farm and the Greene people as older family die, young ones are born, and urban development encroaches.While most of the characters are ultimately undeserving of the reader's sympathy, there are times throughout the novel when one hopes for the best. As Arliss becomes older and watches his children and grandchildren become detached from the farm, the reader begins to realize that the story's theme is bigger than any of its characters: we are losing our heartlands, and even the purest of heart are unable to stop it. While the story's heroine, Leda, strives to preserve the farm (as well as Arliss' heritage), her battle is complicated by the family's inability to grasp the value of such things.Finally, the recurring theme of the Greene family's penchant for not communicating with (and sometimes, caring for) one another will strike some as stereotypical, and rightly so. And, while this ignorance factor may suggest William Faulkner's Snopes family, Arliss turns out to be more emotionally cognizant than Abner -- he just doesn't know how to show it."},{"Title":"Chains of Command [Unabridged]","review":"The writing was just bad. The author may be a veteran of the NYPD, but he is just not a convincing writer. A lot of the word choice was inappropriate. The writing struck me as forced. The plot, particularly the ending, was wholly unbelievable. There are better books out there. Give this one a miss."},{"Title":"Chains of Command [Unabridged]","review":"I have read all of Caunitz's other books, however I thought that I read his last with Pigtown. Sometimes publisher's print questionable efforts after an author's death just because they can get away with it. Chains of Command is one of Caunitz's best books."},{"Title":"Chains of Command [Unabridged]","review":"The bad news here is that the author died while working on this book and it was skillfully completed by Christopher Newman. Nevertheless it snaps and crackles with the dialogue and insider information that only Caunitz (a 30-year cop) could provide. You can read all of the police novels you want but you will NEVER find an author that gives you as much of the inside scoop on police work, language, and character. His plots are fascinating, his characters different yet utterly believable, and his mastery of giving a lot of information in a few words is unmatched. Caunitz was, quite simply, the best of them all at this kind of a novel. Rest In Peace, William J. Caunitz...I'll be re-reading your books from time to time until (hopefully) we meet in the beyond."},{"Title":"Chains of Command [Unabridged]","review":"Read this book quickly or you might lose track of the plot. It is a bit confusing and maybe not all that believable. I've really enjoyed Caunitz's other books. I don't know how much of this was finished before he died and I'm not a reader of Newman but it is not quite up to One Police Plaza, Black Sand and Pigtown. If you like NYPD books though it's well worth the price of a paperback."},{"Title":"Chains of Command [Unabridged]","review":"Before I wrote this, I read a lot of my fellow reviewers notes & their is a lot of apt criticism. I have read several of Caunitz's books. He is an old time Hollywood script writer who dabbled as a successful novelist on the side. His work, as far as I have read, always reads like a good action movie from the middle 80's. The characters are no more complex than Bruce Willis in Die Hard or Charleston Heston in Earthquake.The criticism here is pretty harsh. People are blasting the writing, the story, the racism and sexism. All of this is at fault to one degree or another. Caunitz basically pulls out every minority and stereotypes them into criminal types. And of course it seems that the white guys are the good police officers saving the day. But beyond all of this, Chains of Command is a fairly decent pop corn thriller that sweeps across a epic story.This book follows several characters. Like a miniseries on TV, you follow story arcs that intersect and eventually merge into one. Its kind of nice to see all of this flow.I would not recommend this story to anyone. Its not that good. But if your looking for a breezy action book to pass some time with, you could do a lot worse than Chains of Command."},{"Title":"Chains of Command [Unabridged]","review":"Chains of Command was my first book that I read by William J. Caunitz and I could not put it down. I loved it from the begining to the end and could not point out a boring part of the book or a dry part. Caunitz escribed Lt. Matthew Stuart to be a real charmed police officer who allowed me to feel how Matt was feeling and to see what Matt was seeing, as if you were actually there with the lieutenant. I really loved the book and would suggest it to anyone who enjoys a good mystery/police novel. Matt Stuart was a real good guy."},{"Title":"Chains of Command [Unabridged]","review":"I really like cop novels and authors like Ed Dee and John Mackie. Understood Caunitz to beof this standard. Seems Caunitz died while this novel was not finished. This novel is halfgood, the first half. The second half of this novel introduces a new character every two pagesand it gets more and more involved. All of the personality is lost amid this confusing drugfiasco until we give up - exhausted."},{"Title":"Chains of Command [Unabridged]","review":"I had mixed results on previous books with this author. I absolutely loved Pigtown and One Police Plaza but could not even finish Exceptional Clearance. I had purchased this book, Chains of Command, before I had read some of the reviews here--and before I realized that he died halfway through writing it. I probably would have passed. But since I had the book I finally decided to read it and I found it a crisp entertaining read. I could not detect where the authors changed and so kudos to the guy who finished it...nice job. After I finished it I kept it for a re-read in ten or fifteen years. I guess that is how I gauge a books value to me--do I want to keep it and possibly re-read it? I kept it, and I recommend it, especially if you liked some of his other work."},{"Title":"Chains of Command [Unabridged]","review":"In my humbler opinion, this book is a piece of garbage, finished by another writer because the publisher was sure that he could palm it off on the public. A First Deputy Commissioner in line for the top job and who is a woman? And is not Irish? And has a publicized love affair with a lieutenant? And her mafia-connection background was never checked out? Come on! Get real! And then she drives off all over the place in her own car, without an escort? These things do not happen in the real life of the NYPD. Besides, that constant cop talk - whether true or invented - really gets on your nerves and surely is overdone. Forget about this one."},{"Title":"Chains of Command [Unabridged]","review":"I must agree with Ikvley from CT. There are too many unbelievable plot elements. Such as, a half-black, half-italian, blond, dreadlocked &quot;undercover&quot; cop who drives a blue cab? Could he get any more distinctive or stand out any more?Also, how does the mafia boss blackmail the deputy commissioner? By threatening to tell that she has withheld evidence that would send him to prison?"},{"Title":"Chains of Command [Unabridged]","review":"Somehow I know people are going to say I took this too seriously, but this book was bad. What made it worse is that the writer paints anyone and everyone of color in this books as animalistic and sub-human. I dare anyone to show me one positive reference to a african american in this book. Can you use the [N-word] more !?! It uses all of the stereotypes that plauge our police forces today and makes no excuses for them. He seems to embrace them. Perhaps if the writer (an x-police officer) actually knew some real black or hispanic people (away from the police force) his book could actually be something better than the bad rantings and fantsies of a x NY cop. Really, anyone in this book that ancestory was anything other than northern european is portrayed as inheriently flawed to down right scum. This was my first and last book by W. Caunitz and if I could get my [money] back I would. If I wanted to hear myself (yes I am an african american male) portrayed as blacks were in this book, I'd go to my local Klan rally. In my opinion this book is no better than the god awful black gangster rap music video that portray black people in this same unrealistic manner. Maybe if Mr. Caunitz wants to meet real black people he'll drop me a note. I can introduce him to the doctors, lawyers, garbage men, Secratries, construction workers and cops who he seems to have no regard for. Well now that I've ventend I think I'll go read something that is both entertaining and realistic. Hey can I get my [money] back.. I'll even take pennies and you know everybody hates pennies.

Shannon Drake puts everything you could ever ask for in a romance book; deceit, revenge, love, jealousy, steamy sex scenes, family, and a baby. What more could you ask for. The plot is very interesting and enjoyable to read. This book inspired me to read more romance novels and to start to write one of my own. Since I have read this book, I have bought all of her other novels and enjoyed them immensely. I would suggest to anyone to read this book, it really is a keepsake."},{"Title":"Bride of the Wind","review":"I've read this book a number of times. Shannon Drake a.k.a Heather Graham is definitely one of my favorite authors. The novel features a headstrong but passionate heroine who is caught in a gently horrid nightmare that sees to the end of her innocence. The hero is pure male. Bold, brilliant and utterly smitten, he struggles to balance his suspicions of the girl with his lust for her. If you enjoy the concept \\"break up to make up,\\" you'll love Rose and Pierce's story about two people who struggle to let go and let love. A must read, indeed."},{"Title":"Bride of the Wind","review":"I enjoyed this book but it was not one of my favorites. The story kept you going but it was NOT something you just couldn't put down.

No crack on men just the truth as I see it."},{"Title":"Bride of the Wind","review":"I actually enjoyed this Shannon Drake novel, and believe me, I've been disappointed in other Drake novels, but this one captured my attention. I fell in love with the hero of the novel. I relished his strength and his love for protection of his 'unwilling' colonial bride. The plot was quite far-fetched, but Shannon Drake managed to entwine the far-fetched plot with sinister murders, framed for murder, and of course, the ever present loyal friendship of King Charles II. I've rated 'Bride of the Wind' a 3 1/2, only because I've compared it to other novels written by another favorite author of mine whom sets many of her novels during this particular era. I am a loyal fan of Heather Graham, but as Drake, she has been disappointing at times, however, 'Bride of the Wind' and 'Princess of Fire' are now two of my favorite novels by 'Graham' as 'Drake'."},{"Title":"Bride of the Wind","review":"I'm a great fan of Shannon Drake.

You will definitely enjoy her books.She is my favourite author of historical romance."},{"Title":"Bride of the Wind","review":"A real stinker! I love Shannon Drake, but I could barely finish this book. I liked the female character okay in the beginning, but she quickly degenerated in my eyes when she put off letting the male character see his child for no apparent reason other than her own petty revenge. I won't spoil the book, but her reaction when she finds that her dead husband is alive is contrived and shallow. Of course, I also could not stand the snotty Pierce, who aided the thin plot by just blindly blaming the female character for all ills that befall him. He seemed a little thick (dumb - I hate dumb men!), and not not as vibrant and intelligent as Drake's usual male protagonists. The dialog and thin plot were not up to her standards, and this book seemed hurriedly written. Maybe to fulfill contract obligation? Stock and thinly developed. If you read this one, please don't judge all of Drake's books by it. When she's on, she's really on - particularly with her medieval books like \\"Princess of Fire\\" and \\"Lie down in Roses\\"."},{"Title":"Bride of the Wind","review":"Shannon Drake's Bride of the Wind is a fast reading historical drama of jolly old England in the time of King Charles II. Her heroines are always beautiful and strong willed and her heros handsome, brave and powerful. Such is the case with red-headed Rose, the daughter of an American Colony Baron and silver eyed Lord Pierce DeForte. Of course, their relationship is tumultuous, full of misconceptions and arguments that tear them apart time and time again. There is murder, a treacherous villain, and the usual royal codes of the era that threaten to throw anyone into the Tower at any given time, whether innocent or guilty. I love these firey historical novels by Shannon Drake. All are enjoyable and fun to read.

The Confessions is also a sort of aesthetic precursor to Flaubert and Proust, a kind of interior amalgam of social reflection. Rousseau lived as exciting a life as practically anyone-he was friendly with the giants of his era, Voltaire, Diderot, D'lambert. He was also a bitter and paranoid provocateur who split with these figures as well as the enlightenment project as a whole. I honestly found sections of this text hard going, but I find it fascinating for its preoccupation with the text itself. Rousseau indicates that his life had been meaningless until he had begun writing his 'Confessions,' an admission of the centrality of this project to his life as a whole. Rousseau remains an admirable thinker for his clarity and honesty. Although he was pretty insane by the time he wrote the 'Confessions,' it remains a wildly entertaining and illuminating entry into the mind of one of our greatest minds."},{"Title":"The Confessions of Jean-Jacques Rousseau","review":"In his essay \\"On Rhetoric\\", Stanley Corngold addresses the rhetorical signs of autobiographical elements, and the use of language to create disruption, confusion, clarity or a sense of authenticity in the text, whether or not it actually is autobiographical or \\"a fictive chronicle of memory\\". Written elements of fiction can still function as an authentically constructed memory, and here Corngold makes a distinction between the lie and the fiction; an all important distinction for reading autobiographies like Rousseau's The Confessions. Figurative writing that refers to certain authentic emotions or personal imaginations of the writer, is considered fiction, whereas the conscious addition of a written element that does not belong to the memory or experiences of the author, is a lie.Corngold considers the imagination to be superior over fulfillment. However, when a text is confessional in nature, the justification of the own identity and self by showcasing its sincerity and integrity, and thus its contrast to the imagination, is at stake. Corngold states that the rhetoric as Rousseau uses it in his Confessions, promises a truthful description of emotions. Corngold points out that abstractions like emotions and sensations are impossible to accurately describe in words, especially when one considers the possibility of the narrator's own memory deceiving him. He discusses the Rousseau's intent when he wrote his autobiography, and concludes that the question of whether this was a cognitive or confessional intent is problematic but can be analyzed by studying Rousseau's use of rhetoric.Rousseau focuses mainly on his memories of moods in his autobiography The Confessions. One of the defining personal aspects that guide him in this is a sense of self-loss, and Rousseau seems to attempt to find and present himself by as accurately and truthful as possible describing his past actions and the sensation that caused and were caused by them.An air of a self-indulgent narcissitic, yet apologetic and insecure personality surrounds Rousseau's autobiography, but nevertheless it is this underlying sense of this personality that the reader gets from this work that may very well be the most truthful autobiographical element of The Confessions.Rousseau makes a distinction between his moods at the time of writing his autobiography and the past emotions he describes in his work, but doesn't openly acknowledge the likely possibility of the present mood influencing the memory of past sensations. However, I do value Rousseau's autobiography as authentic, as the emotions that he describes in his work were indeed descriptive of the sensations he must have felt while writing down his memories. In this regard, I think that the authenticity I perceive in Rousseau's work may not be the authenticity he intended to be perceived by a reader. In my opinion, it is impossible to narrate one's memories and past emotions as they actually were, without any influence of the present perceptions and moods of the narrator, and without taking into account that moods and moments sometimes last only seconds. However, I do agree with Corngold when it comes to prioritizing the imagination over the actual fulfillment and am convinced that Rousseau's imaginations about himself were not lies, but authentic fictions of and about himself."},{"Title":"The Confessions of Jean-Jacques Rousseau","review":"Very entertaining journey into the life of Rousseau. I can(and I think most people would) identify with a great deal of what Rousseau says. Granted, some of Rousseau's confessions are a bit bizarre, but considering how decadent most &quot;literature&quot; is these days, you shouldn't be too appalled. Despite Rousseau's occasional lapses, his insights into human nature are certainly worth a look, whether or not you ultimately agree with them.At any rate, the Oxford World Classic series, is once again, your best bet as far as translations are concerned. Very helpful notes at the back of the book explain obscure allusions and correct the record of Rousseau's life(he is not entirely accurate)."},{"Title":"The Confessions of Jean-Jacques Rousseau","review":"My feelings when reading this unusual autobiography was one of identification with the writer - I suspect that there are behavioural and biological reasons for this, not ones that can be explained by psychology. The effect on me of the feelings Rousseau generated are indeed strange. I have immense sympathy with the man and yet I have a total lack of understanding of how he could give up his five children shortly after their births - and impose that on his partner too! He certainly fails to provide a satisfactory explanation for me. (Unless, of course, there simply weren't any children but he was unable to confess to that!)I also felt (feelings again!) that at times Rousseau was quite paranoid. Repeatedly the disasters he presaged were less troubling than I had feared. Over and over we come across what he describes as some of his best times of life. He did have a remarkable way of holding on to the light, even when regrets and threats existed, which tended to lighten some of the darkest times.His love of women was truly extraordinary - perhaps it was generated by his own childhood experience of being propositioned by a man; perhaps not. It was certainly love - if we believe these are true confessions - and not lust, despite what was going on in the French high society he hovered around.Perhaps the most interesting thing for me is that a very gifted philosopher can be wracked by self doubts and uncertainties.Other recommendations:'Diaries' - Alma Schindler (Mahler-Werfel)'Memoirs' - Hector Berlioz'Memoirs of a Revolutionist' - Peter Kroptkin'Memoirs of the Author of a Vindication of the Rights of Woman' - William Godwin"},{"Title":"The Confessions of Jean-Jacques Rousseau","review":"This one will have you in stitches.

The book is entertaining and the prose brilliant.Rousseau seems to have written this book believing he is the first to make such an endeavor (that of a completely honest auto-biography). Though, I am very sure he is most definitely not the first to make such an attempt (e.g. Augustine's Confessions, etc), he is the first that I have enjoyed reading to such a degree. Sometimes Rousseau makes me cringe while reading of his hapless encounters with trouble and his naivete when faced with some deviant (for those days) behavior, and sometimes hard headed pursuit and/or belief in himself.This book is great fun, and I would definitely recommend this book.(To fans of Rousseau- after reading this book, I believe you might gain a greater/deeper understanding of his novel and characters in his book Emile)."},{"Title":"The Confessions of Jean-Jacques Rousseau","review":"Maybe you read Rousseau in college and your teacher mentioned EMILE.

I started reading excerpts from this book at our meetings. Everyone wanted to know what I was reading from.

I suspect his philosophy is too passionate and subversive for a school curiculum, but nevertheless to deprive children of this knowledge is horrible. I was amazed when I questioned my professors and found that THEY have little to no knowledge of Rousseau. But I suppose I should not really be surprised. The Confessions is filled with so many memorable incidents of Rousseau's life. You really feel like you know the man. I found the first book, detailing his early years, infinitly more enjoyable than the second book, but this is how it must be. He admits that he himself enjoyed with pleasure writing the first book, but found the second much more grueling and difficult, because of the tragic quality of it all.

Not only is Rousseau a good writer, he has a very sly wit that keeps cropping up in these pages. You have to read carefully to catch his wit because it is so understated. The book is a really good picture of the people that lived during Mr. Rousseau's lifetime. (1712-1778). He holds nothing back when he describes what these people did and how they lived. The book is very sensual, if not licentious, and Rousseau holds nothing back. It is truly an intimate look at Rousseau and the many people that he came in contact with during his lifetime.

While being hailed as one of the intellectual fathers of modern democracy, Rousseau also has a very interesting personality.I highly recommend Confessions, many lovely short stories are so vivid that a reader almost feels being there with Rousseau."},{"Title":"The Confessions of Jean-Jacques Rousseau","review":"I absolutely despise most of what this book puts forth. This book, the very bed rock of Romantic thought, is (in my opinion) the root of many of our modern problems because it begins unraveling of the basic thesis of the Enlightenment: cultivate reason and be wholey guided by it. That being said a person cannot fully understand the Romantics, and by extension our own society, without first reading and understanding Rousseau. The veneration of nature, the noble savage, all of the things that the Romantics aspired to or believed in has its seed in this book, so if you are a romantic or if you just want to understand more about this philosophical era, then this is the book for you."},{"Title":"The Confessions of Jean-Jacques Rousseau","review":"&quot;Rousseau is not one of the world's most famous political and social commentators...&quot;?!?!?!?!?!?C'mon, New Jersey -- I think a bit more respect is due to the man who brought you the Social Contract...Anyway, read this book."},{"Title":"The Confessions of Jean-Jacques Rousseau","review":"I found this book extremely boring. While there are few interesting parts, Rousseau found it necessary to relate detail after monotonous detail. Composing over 600 pages, this book would of been less tiring given half the length."},{"Title":"The Confessions of Jean-Jacques Rousseau","review":"Rousseau's Confessions had been on my book shelf for at least two years before I got motivated to read it. I had started it a few times, but never got beyond the first chapter. I read quite alot, though, and the Confessions seemed to pop up everywhere, in History, Philosophy, and especially in articles on influences in Literature. Flipping through it, it seemed dry and the passages boring and out-of date. But I told myself I must read it, if only to better understand the references that kept drawing from it.Once I got past the first chapter, I found I simply could not put it down. Admittedly, I had the extra advantage of knowing alot about the period in history and the life of Rousseau himself, but that wasn't the magic of the book. It was Rousseau himself who seemed to come alive through the pages. The tortured honesty on every page which excited and shocked me kept me up late every night until I was finished. There were times I simply had to put the book down, catch my breath a little, and think, &quot;Oh My God! I can't believe it!&quot; After, I realized I had finished one of the best reading experiences of my life. It ranked right up there with &quot;The Red and The Black&quot;, &quot;Les Mis&quot;, &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot; and &quot;Anna Karenina&quot;. This book will live through the ages, I had read a hundred times but dismissed it. I only hope you are more trustful than I."},{"Title":"The Confessions of Jean-Jacques Rousseau","review":"There are certain books that are cornerstones in your life. This is one of mine. A lot of the Romantic self-centerdness that marks my character can be traced directly back to this guy. But then again, whatever my expansive vision and love of variety and the vagaries of human nature can also be traced back to this cynical, but at the same time genial soul.Rousseau, like Voltaire and Diderot, his contemporaries, could look upon his fellow man and himself with both a frown and a smile. He claims at the outset of the work that he is going to show you himself as he honestly is, warts and all. Don't believe him! But don't turn your back on him either, or dismiss him as a liar! You would be denying yourself the company of one of the most charming alluring reconteurs in all of literature, should you do so.Monsieur Rousseau absolutely loves talking about himself. That sounds like a recipe for boredom, I know. But the trouble is, he's got such a fascinating subject. He knew everyone who was anyone in the 18th century. The women, in particular, were the actual movers and shakers of fin de siecle France. They were figures who presided over literary salons when there actually were literary salons. Madame de Stael is only one matron who looms large in the account. France was basically ruled by powerful and cunning women in that era. Rousseau was there, mentally recording every intimate bon mot and detail.Then there is his infectious, expansive nature to win you over! Try as you might, self centered as the man is, you can't help liking the guy! He is the ultimate Romantic, in the best sense of the word. He believes in his soul that mankind is noble, that we were put here on earth to enact a divine plan for the benefit of all. That the French Revolution would show a different, Hobbesian side to his theory doesn't really diminish his optimistic, humanistic influence on the Romantic movement and ultimately 19th century literature, in general. He's one of those seminal figures without whom Goethe, the Romantic poets, Blake, Emerson, Whitman, etc. wouldn't have been possible.This is a great book. Liar, hedger, whatever, you really will get to know this character in all his colors, subterfuges, moods, etc. Love him or hate him, you will have to admit that he's like no one you have ever met. Unfortunately.BEK"},{"Title":"The Confessions of Jean-Jacques Rousseau","review":"I'm thrilled to see Amazon books' celebration of Rousseau'sbirthday because his writings not only transformedEnlightenment thought, but also prefigured the emergence ofRomanticism in the nineteenth century. But Rousseau's Confessionsis not just a work for historians. This work is stunning inits honesty, even to a jaded twentieth-century reader. Thepsychological insight is remarkable: As the narrativeprogresses, Rousseau's suspicious nature moves into achilling paranoia, yet one cannot help but feel compassionfor such a brilliant and beleagered man. Even paranoidshave enemies, and Rousseau certainly had plenty, and hisConfessions provide an insiders view of the Enlightenment,with all the rivalries and quarrels."},{"Title":"The Confessions of Jean-Jacques Rousseau","review":"Prior to the appearance of Jean-Jacques Rousseau's 'Confessions,' there existed very few real autobiographies. The few that did exist were like St. Augustine's 'Confessions,' designed to impart a religious or moral lesson instead of to exhibit or try to justify one's life. By the time Rousseau came along, however, people had begun to see themselves as individuals, not members of a society governed based on religious or monarchical precepts. So though writing one's autobiography may be old hat now, this was a revolutionary thing in the 18th century. This autobiography is also special in that Jean-Jacques reveals himself warts and all. He doesn't gloss over faults or embarrassing incidents; he exhibits all of himself, both the good and the bad.This book was highly recommended by the wonderful History of the Enlightenment professor I had my senior year of college, and I was thrilled to find a copy (for only 50 cents!) about 5 years later. I'd been eager to read it based on the professor's lurid descriptions of it. He told us that, among other things, Rousseau revealed that he liked to be spanked, he described his sex life, and he had a very interesting problem centered in his midsection, manifested in how he had urinary problems that always seemed to crop up whenever he was about to be integrated into society, such as one time when he was going to be given some money by the king to further his writing, but his problem struck, and he excused himself and went out into the hall, where he ended up urinating on the floor, unable to hold himself, and was laughed at by the servant-women. I was kind of disappointed that the book didn't turn out as spicy as my professor had made it out to be, but I still loved every moment of it just the same. My professor's teasers of what the book contains were just the tip of the iceberg. Among many other fascinating stories and tidbits, we also learn about such things as his extreme shyness with women he was attracted to, how he was a late bloomer who didn't lose his virginity till he was in his early twenties, how several of the women he was attracted to and had relationships with were older women (among them his first lover, Mme. de Warens, who was far more than just a lover but also his teacher, his mentor, and his patron), how he was beaten horribly by the man he was apprenticed to in Geneva as a teenager, the real story behind why he gave all 5 of his kids away to foundling hospitals, the increasing persecutions and exiles he endured, how he engaged in self-gratification, and how, as a young man, he had advances made to him by two other men (one of them a priest). Although one wonders how much paranoia might have played into these growing conspiracies against him he laments. While there is ample evidence that a number of his former friends turned against him (to say nothing of how he was thrown out of a lot of places he tried to find refuge in after 'The Social Contract' and '&Eacute;mile' were banned), it also seems kind of weird that so many people would form all of these vast far-reaching conspiracies against him out of nowhere. Still, Jean-Jacques comes across as such an interesting likeable person, whom just about anyone can relate to, that this obsession with these alleged conspiracies can be overlooked. One wishes that the book covered his whole life and not just from 1712 to 1765, since he's just such an interesting character!My translation is the one by J.M. Cohen, which is over 50 years old now, but gets the job done in spite of a few dated spots. The basic story remains the same in spite of some dated phrases and language (e.g., does anyone under the age of 100 still use diminutive words like \\"authoress\\" or \\"patroness\\" anymore?). I also wish there had been an index, particularly since what with so many people coming and going in Jean-Jacques's life (he knew so many famous and prominent people in Enlightenment Europe!), it can be kind of hard to keep track of just who's whom. Still, minor quibbles aside, he was a truly fascinating person, and this classic work of autobiography and the Enlightenment is not to be missed."},{"Title":"The Confessions of Jean-Jacques Rousseau","review":"Autobiographies are inherently unreliable. We all want to gloss over the embarrassing or wrongful moments in our lives and present ourselves as engaging \\"packages\\" to our contemporaries and to posterity. In Jean-Jacques Rousseau's CONFESSIONS, we have an autobiographer who is willing to show you his life -- warts and all.What strikes many contemporary readers as somewhat whack about Rousseau is that he gave several of his own children up for adoption, thinking they would be better cared for by a charitable institution than at home. Although he never \\"officially\\" tied the knot with Th&eacute;r&egrave;se Levasseur in a religious or civil marriage, he was at the very least what we would today call her common law husband.As with Montaigne in his essay \\"Of Experience,\\" we are introduced to Rousseau's painful urinary problems. He had to catheterize himself frequently to be able to urinate at all; and toward the end of the book, he talks about adopting an Armenian garb because he could no longer comfortably wear trousers.Even more painful than the physical was that Rousseau appeared to be a trusting person who tried to make friends, but was frequently betrayed by them. Some of the betrayers include such famous contemporaries of the author's as Denis Diderot and Jean Le Rond d'Alembert. It is possible that Rousseau had a strong streak of paranoia, as it is unlikely that so many of his ex-friends would form conspiracies against him.Perhaps in no other book is there such stress laid on the perils of having to seek patronage rather than earning money on one's own merits. I know that, if I were living in 18th century France under the old r&eacute;gime, I, too, would have difficulties because of my own blunt personality. One had to have the manners of a dancing master and the insincerity of a groupie dealing with the notoriously unreliable French nobility of the day.Although Rousseau earned some money earlier in his career teaching and copying music, he earned little or nothing from his books. In fact, he was frequently cheated by his business partners, some of whom plagiarized and published his texts under their own names.In the end, we have a great writer telling of his few halcyon moments and the slow downward spiral of his life. Fortunately for us, Jean-Jacques managed to turn the story of his life into one of the greatest autobiographies ever written -- and perhaps the greatest work to come from France in the 18th century, a time crowded with great literary talent.Cohen's translation dates back many years, but is completely adequate to the purpose."},{"Title":"The Confessions of Jean-Jacques Rousseau","review":"This book is a revelation as it seemed to me a portrait, or perhaps a mask, of the heightened sensibilities of the interior monologue of a genius. \\"Since my name is certain to live on among men, I do not want the reputation it transmits to be a false one.\\" Indeed, his honesty is remarkable as he writes about the abandonment of his children, his relationship with lovers and his intimate proclivities. Rousseau's life was a fascinating study of an extraordinary and innovative mind. He dined \\"sometime with princes at noon and supped with peasants at night.\\" Musically self-taught, he invented an alphabetical code for writing music and wrote an opera performed with it in \\"The Village Soothsayer.\\" His \\"Social Contract\\" inspired constitutions in nations struggling with revolution against monarchies to become democracies which earned him threats of sedition and cruel acts of political scorn. His books were burned, the church sought to excommunicate him, his house was stoned and he escaped in exile en route to Berlin through the good graces of philosopher David Hume to England toward the end of his life. At times, often enough, he seems the narcissist subtly engrossed in his many virtues masked in false humility and yet the final, lasting impression is of a masterpiece forged from the crucible of a tormented soul bent upon the diligent and inspired study of the journey of the maturing human heart. Like Voltaire toward the end of his life but before his exile, we find Rousseau living on a lake isle longing only to finish his life in the practice of avid gardening and intellectual pursuits. The translation here by Angela Scholar is richly, gorgeous prose which reminded me of Proust, who I'm confident must have been influenced by Rousseau. This book is, as Rousseau described it, the \\"most secret history of my soul\\" and ranks highly on my Top 25 Novels of All Time among the holy literary trinity of France's Proust in \\"The Remembrance of Lost Time\\" and Balzac's \\"Lost Illusions.\\" I really can't urge you strongly enough to carve out the time to read this brilliantly conceived autobiography."},{"Title":"The Confessions of Jean-Jacques Rousseau","review":"Rousseau was a great genius, and one element of that genius is present in this work. He seems to be more honest in confessing his faults and sins, more relentlessly petty in finding faults in himself than anyone had ever been before. He concentrates on himself without that dimension of connection to higher questions and realities that Augustine has. He also reveals himself to be in many incidents most especially in relation to the mother of his children and his children a quite contemptible human being. For me the most memorable incident in the Confessions is when Rousseau wagers with himself and wins the wager not by throwing the rock at the tree from the distance as he was originally to test himself by doing, but rather by going up to the tree and making sure he does not miss. The Rousseauian wager that is one conducted in fundamental dishonesty with a goal of pettily promoting one's own self- interest. And this is the writer who most historians believe did more than anyone else to bring about the French Revolution."},{"Title":"The Confessions of Jean-Jacques Rousseau","review":"While I was actually reading this book, I blogged quite a bit about the reading experience. Rousseau is hands-down the most irritating narrator that I have read since A la Recherche du Temps Perdu. Rousseau is so self-absorbed that he moves past pathetic into loathesome and back again. He starts his career as an exhibitionist, moves into petty theft, buys an 11 year old girl for unpleasant purposes, forces his mistress to abandon their children at a foundling's home, alienates everyone who tries to help him, and generally seems lost in paranoia and self-aggrandizement.I've read a lot of reviews of this book where people refer to his excesses in a \\"gee, shucks\\" kind of way and then to go on and note that by the end of the book, they had actually come to like the guy. I have to say that this wasn't at all my experience. By the time that I finished the book, I had a strong desire to take a hot bath.None of which is to say that I think that you should skip The Confessions. On the contrary. I understand why it is an important book, and it isn't always necessary to like the narrator in order to get something out of the reading experience. (If that were the case, nobody would ever read Proust again.)So why should you read The Confessions? You should read it if you have an interest in autobiography-- it is the first major secular biography produced by the west. You should read it if you have any interest in the history or philosophy of the Enlightenment. Here is the core of so much of those ideas. Finally, you should read it if you're interested in people. Rousseau is, if nothing else, quite a character. And you've got to give him credit for being willing to be so honest about his flaws and failings.(This said, I have the distinct impression that he probably would have been shocked by the response to his little peccadillos. Perspective didn't seem to be one of his key strengths. At the end of The Confessions, he says: \\"For my part, I publicly and fearlessly declare that anyone, even if he has not read my writings, who will examine my nature, my character, my morals, my likings, my pleasures, and my habits with his own eyes and can still believe me a dishonourable man, is a man who deserves to be stifled.\\")I read the Penguin Classics edition, which is translated and introduced by J.M. Cohen. I appreciated that they left the notes in situ, but I occasionally wished that there had been more of them-- particularly when it came to mentions of writers and thinkers who had been important to Rousseau's development."},{"Title":"The Confessions of Jean-Jacques Rousseau","review":"this is a classic tell-all, coming of age story in 1700's europe: rousseaus' mother dies at an early age, and through his imagination and melancholic pursuits, and once his father's hands-off approach ensues, he is left to seek beauty and justice elsewhere.rich with detailed observations of life, people and his place in the world, it is a wonderful introduction to the man rousseau.persecuted for later writings and publishment of his philosophy, i.e. the social contract, among others (and much like de sade and huxley} he still found a small niche of support in his time.other related authors/books i would recommend: the first man, albert camus; aldous huxley; mario vargas llosa."},{"Title":"The Confessions of Jean-Jacques Rousseau","review":"Rousseau claims that he may have the most intense passions, feelings and sentiments of any man to have ever lived. After you read this book, it is tempting to believe him.Rousseau claims that his goal is to portray a man honestly with all his virtue and all his vice. While he doctors the facts, Rousseau leaves the reader with the most complete understanding of human sentiment possible. The book adheres to Rousseau's philosophy that humans are controlled by their passions rather than by reason. To prove this point Rousseau articulately describes the feelings and passions that he has felt throughout his life and what they caused him to do.Rousseau is a master of rhetoric. He describes the passions and sentiments commone to all people in vivid language that will leave you both laughing and longing. You want to experience life as Rousseau experienced it--no thoughts just the pure sentiment of every moment. Rousseau is not honest about the events of his life, but he is honest about his feelings. And he expresses these feelings with the art of an excellent writer. This book is required reading for any romantic, any philosopher, and any lover of great literature. No matter your interests, I guarantee that several of Rousseau's well-turned stories of passion will stick with you."},{"Title":"Corporate Power Driven by Greed","review":"Corporate Power Driven By Greed by Jessica I. Luke is a sharply worded and quite articulate challenge against the commonly held idea that the bottom line is all that matters in business. Stressing that human resources are what truly matters, and that providing incentive, recognition and a good work environment is what keeps productive employees producing, as well as attracting the best possible new employees, Corporate Power Driven By Greed is a persuasive, point-by-point primer to successfully stimulating worker morale. Jessica Luke deftly emphasizes her points with wry humor and amusing black-and-white illustrations. Corporate Power Driven By Greed is highly recommended reading for anyone charged with the responsibility for ensuring the strong economic health and success of their corporate enterprise."},{"Title":"Corporate Power Driven by Greed","review":"&quot;Our American dream is falling apart. The road to success is not as clear-cut as we were led to believe as children growing up in American society. We were taught to better ourselves and work towards pursuing a career and finally, having a family. The ideal of the American dream is being distorted by the organizations we work for. Family values are diminishing, and two incomes are needed where thirty years ago, one wage earner was more than adequate. Work ethics and business practices put pressure on us to be more committed to our jobs and less to our lives.&quot;So begins a philosophical journey through one segment of today's corporate landscape, as viewed by author Jessica Luke, a former IBM software application developer. The range of the book is broad; it covers the history of labor relations and a critique of current human resource management (personality types, stress, burnout, depression, time management, technology, innovation, communication, teamwork, motivation, incentives, performance evaluation, and training). She also touches briefly on executive compensation, the recent corporate accounting scandals, and the 90's practice of downsizing and outsourcing. This commentary is set against the book's thesis which seems to be that &quot;the unscrupulous power of corporate greed&quot; causes management to make decisions that do not value the individuality of workers.While practically each subject covered could be a book in itself, there's no denying the sea-change in many of our working lives that has occurred in the last three or four decades (or the 20th century, for that matter). Luke's experience working in corporate America, while not discussed directly, seems to be summed up in the following line: &quot;Business organizations shamefully continue to operate with the same uncivilized, barbarian and rigid mindset that prevailed at the beginning of the century.&quot;Despite this indictment, her broader points seem to be: who bears the responsibility for employee satisfaction - management or the employee? How does one maintain a sense of self in our increasingly institutionalized world? Can individuals have a voice in bureaucracies?As worldwide population continues to increase, these are questions we will struggle with over the next decade, maybe longer. And I suspect we'll hear more from Luke on this subject, too; I distinctly heard a personal story shadowing the corporate analysis. In the meantime, she seems to have begun her journey at a place anyone in this writers' association can appreciate; with pen and paper and the fire of one's own thoughts."},{"Title":"Corporate Power Driven by Greed","review":"Jessica's smart, thoughtful, innovative look at the corporate world has it all, including those glass ceilings we need to make sure we got our underwear on for!

Luke comes at a very appropriate moment during these moments of hard economical times. The goal of this book is examine the relationship between companies and their employees, and to expose what is greed compared to true profitability. The book goes into: leadership, bad top management, downsizing, outsourcing, resistance to change, creativity, strategies, people's attitude, time management, communication, effective management, importance of technology, importance of innovation and conveying positive change. The book is 124 pages long. The book defines each topic clearly, succinctly and in simple terms. This is a welcome change from all those huge dreary business books. The book provides clear solutions on what is good and bad. Looking at the downsizing chapter, it reminds me of what is going on at my current employer. I am witnessing the results of the procedure in the mind of people left behind. It also define, as I always said in my current position, the importance of technology.

C. Also, perhaps the most entertaining aspect, were the inclusion of reviews that came out at the time. Many reflecting how W. C. Fields made a mundane movie something special and therefore worth the time to watch and in some cases rewatch to make sure you didn't miss any of his under-his-breath muttering which was a hallmark of his mastery.This book not only describes the movies, but takes it further to reveal certain sexual innuendo and alcoholic behavior which not only adds to the humor of the movies but reflects the morals of the day. The sexual humor is hidden behind much double entendre while the alcoholic humor (much like the \\"Thin Man\\" movies) is very obvious and never attempts to be \\"politically correct\\".It is a truly enjoyable book which explains the man but also his effect on his time period."},{"Title":"The films of W.

It seems very old fashioned. Also in general the authors don't seem to have much scientific backing for many of their statements about all topics. Also, their know-it-all condescending tone is really a turn off after a few chapters. I actually refer to the authors as \\"those skinny b*****s and the book as \\"the skinny b*****s' book\\"I think What to Expect the First Year is even worst.

After I had my baby, I read the entire book (Okay, I admit it, I'm a nut, but I was bored and there was nothing else in the house to read) and I have to say I found it very scary. It made me think that if I didn't eat enough kale I would have a baby with birth defects! But so many pregnancy books are like that. The chapters on labor were absolutely spot-on correct and you should read this book just for those chapters. I recommend What to Expect the First Year and What to Expect the Toddler Years. Those books are very helpful. And the 7th edition of Dr. Spock is amazing. He is right: you know more than you think you do. This goes for pregnant women as well.

However, I certainly never avoided sugars and the like. Don't we all have the common sense to know to eat a healthy, well-balanced diet of fruits, veggies, whole grains and the like? And if we do that MOST of the time, how can an occasional (ok, everyday for those in the last trimester) treat like ice cream or chocolate hurt? In fact, I would be willing to prove it's HELPFUL. We're pregnant, after all, not stupid. The rest of the book was well worthwhile. Dietary advice here is well-meant but overdue as it was written for a woman pregnant during the 1950's. Educate yourself, and use this book as a reference tool...and please don't make it your onlly book! Visit Parent Soup's website for supportive chat groups and discussion boards on every imaginable topic, and listen to what your own body tells you is right. Bottome line is, use this book while thinking for yourself, and you will be thoroughly entertained and educated at the same time. As for the condescending tones, I didn't see it. Think of it this way: how long has it been since these women gave birth (have they ever?); could they do anything less as responsible authors than advocate what is OPTIMAL (yet maybe sometimes unrealistic) and present it as a GUIDE for moms-to-be? AT only $11, add it to your pregnancy library. And by all means don't forget your practitioner! They are probably your best overall source, if not as convenient asa the book when it's 3am and you're worried about the sushi you just ate in your first trimester (I did this, and Maddie is a happy, very healthy and smart 15-month old!). One thing I should add: I can see where single moms and those moms who are not in the main-stream or &quot;the norm&quot; would feel left out some times. If you are one of them, don't take it to heart: you are the most important person to your baby and that's that....no book can tell you anything about loving and doing &quot;what's right&quot; for your baby that you don't already know, or have an inkling about. Enough already. Too many moms were too tough on this book....it has to be read with an open mind. It is up to us to educate ourselves, and anyone who takes a single book for its meaning VERBATIM is selling themselves very short. Supplement your reading, mommies! And happy pregnancies....you'll never have a more special time in your life (and get rid of the matronly looking puffymama on the cover.....dollbaby-fashion maternity is out! Borrow your husband's clothes, invest in some cheap Target maternity leggings and tops, and get with the style! WOuldn't it be more realistic to have an obviously-pregnant momma on the cover taking a walk...anything but reclining in an uncomfortable-looking antique rocker .......ha! : )"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I am expecting my first child and purchased this book b/c it's well-known among expectant mothers. I began reading this book and it terrified me! It does not tell of the joys that you will experience as an expectant mother, but of the horrifying things that could happen to you and your unborn child! I began reading Your Pregnancy Week by Week, which is wonderfully written and takes expectant moms' feelings into careful consideration. If you are a first time mom like me, I don't advise investing the time or money in this book, no matter what your friends say."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"On a friend's recommendation, I purchased this book while pregnant with our first child. I must say how banal and condescending I thought the tone of the book was. I found that the tone of the book and the quality of the writing bordered on the insulting. It's like a pregancy guide written for the absoloute lowest common denominator...as if no one reading the book would have finished the seventh grade. Bleck! Honestly, the writers put forth information as if everyone picking up this book hasn't bothered to pick up a pamphlet in their doctor's office and has never ever bothered to crack open another book. Furthermore, their nutrition and recipie section is completely out of whack. Let's jut say every other publication that I read during my preganacy was more helpful and better written than this one. And as an added bonus, no other book available assumes that the reader has an I.Q. lower than their shoe size. Do yourself a favor and skip this garbage."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This book is a wonderful example of what's wrong with childbirth in this country -- the pregnant woman is expected to be a passive, compliant patient, trusting her doctor to have all the right answers. The truth is that the only person who cares enough about your unborn child to make the right decisions is you (and your partner)and this book will NOT help you make good decisions. This book will help you be a good patient, like there is something wrong with you and only the expert doctor can fix you. Save your money, save your birth, save your baby. Buy something like Henci Goer's &quot;The Thinking Woman's Guide to A Better Birth&quot; and find out what you really should expect while you're expecting! If you are interested in what's happening with your baby developmentally, there are lots of great picture books out there that don't have the underlying message that you are in danger by being pregnant. I'm glad I bought this used and didn't waste a lot of money on it."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I can't imagine why this book is viewed as a standard for every pregnant woman. It is stuffed with each possible negative scenario. I don't want to think like an obstetrician, aware of every remotely possible complication.I want a healthy outlook. Let's face it, pregnancy is a sign of overall health and should be treated as such. Ban the scary texts! If I have a specific risk, the multitude of tests I undergo at the doc's should reveal it. Otherwise, the female body is evolved to birth. It is our most biologically important function & we are well equipped to take on the task.Since I received 3 of these as gifts, I read through a copy and found contradictions in information from one page to another. Sorry I don't remember specifics since I've had two boys since then, but it made the info appear so untrustworthy that I threw them all in the recycle instead of giving them to the next mom as I do with everything else."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"As a first-time expectant mom, I bought this book as I had heard it described as an \\"excellent\\", \\"helpful\\" and \\"wonderful\\" guide to pregnancy.I am almost 30 years old, and I am no idiot. However, the authors of \\"What to Expect\\" seem to assume that the reader is a young, immature girl who needs a lot of \\"bootcamp\\" style, strict rules, and a preachy, motherly tone. They imply that if the expectant mom does not follow their \\"Pregnancy Diet\\", her baby will have a low birthweight, be sickly, mentally challenged, or who knows what. They make every abdominal cramp, slight twinge, or spot of blood into a major medical emergency! They devote an entire chapter to \\"When there's a problem\\", discussing miscarriages and other abnormalities, giving the expectant mom (or dad, or domestic partner) a terrible scare and a large dose of paranoia. They also state several times that the best \\"cure\\" for a miscarriage or stillbirth is to \\"get pregnant again as soon as possible\\". Unbelievable!This book is made up almost entirely of questions they supposedly have received from readers of past editions, although I suspect most are made up.I was looking for a book with a week-by-week description of the baby's development. You won't find that here. They have a vague, generalized \\"month-by-month\\" guide of what you \\"may\\" look like, what you \\"may\\" be feeling, and a couple of points regarding the baby's development.Take my advice and skip this book altogether. It does not even deserve one star. In regards to your diet, don't force yourself to eat. When you CAN eat, eat. When you can't, don't. Be sensible about what you eat, but don't feel guilty about the occasional fast food, cake or ice cream. Don't smoke, don't drink. If you have any questions, ask your doctor. Above all, use common sense, and you and your baby will be fine."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"You know, the book is okay. And I would recommend it as a very comprehensive reference guide for questions that may crop up thruout your pregnancy. But for heaven's sake, I don't see the need to read page after page of something that MIGHT go wrong with a perfectly normal bodily function. I found myself fretting more while trying to read this book than at any other time during my pregnancy. The few times I did find it helpful were when I already felt something new and potentially concerning. I was able to look up the symptoms in the book and either check them with my doctor, or realise that it was just, say, heartburn. No big deal!The book also has a tendencey to recommend that you do...pretty much nothing while you are pregnant. A common quote I found thruout the book is, \\"There is no proof that doing ___ will harm your baby, but we recommend that you avoid it anyway.\\" I agree that I want to take care of my body and my baby, but I'm not an invalid just because I'm pregnant!Again, it's not bad as a reference guide, but don't let it be your only view into pregnancy."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This book is great to put you in state of panic - whether it's about everything you could be doing \\"wrong\\" (even when you're doing everything \\"right\\") or about your soon-to-be-terrible new lifestyle with baby. When I was pregnant, I had a natural knack to be worried as well as a complete transition with lifestyle. Reading this book before going to sleep would give me nightmares and wake me up with panic. I feel it's so anti-woman that it's phenomenal to me it's a bestseller. I still shudder remembering how I felt reading this book.Personally, I had wanted to do a natural birth but was petrified about it - if I'd kept reading this book, I never would have developed the confidence needed in my body to give birth naturally - which I did, and beautifully and \\"easily\\".Also, my husband and I are huge travelers, and from reading this book, you'd think all that would end suddenly. No it didn't, and my son has more stamps in his passport and more miles driven in this continent than most adults have.I'm not sure who this book is really for, but it's not for confident adventurous women who are both thoughtful/analytical and emotional, and so it's disheartening to think that this book appeals to most women."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This is a WONDERFUL book! My husband got it for me with our first baby, and what a life saver it was. I brought it with me wherever I went.

It's a great book for rookie parents or experienced ones. I highley recommend it.

I read this book for a class that I took in university, as I am studying child and family studies. My professor and many of the students agreed that the best thing about this book is everything is in it. It says almost everything you need to know. The downside is that everything is in it. It says everything that can possibly go wrong. But here's some very good news. This book is organized in a way so that you can select information. You don't have to read the whole book, so you don't need to read all of the negativities and be worried. Just read what interests you the most. In fact, it also tells you some worry wart advice and wives tales that you should not listen to (Such as how well you're \\"carrying\\" or fainting \\"spells\\").Besides, why get several books about pregnancy when you can find all of the information in one book? (I like this book a lot better than that \\"Weekly Guide\\". Monthly guides are better.) This book tells everything from choosing a practitioner to the steps of labor. You can just look at the sample pages in this store. The pregnancy diet, your monthly check ups, weith gain, twins, intimacy issues, safe exercises, not to mention morning sickness, fatigue, dizziness, blood pressure, you name it and it's here. One thing that I especially love about this book is that it explains how not every pregnancy is the same, so no woman goes through the same feelings or issues. There's even helpful information for fathers. It tells you loads of information about labor and delivery, including caesareans, pain medications, and labor induction. It tells you about postpartum and breastfeeding. Don't listen to what one reviewer said about breastfeeding. The book doesn't say that you're selfish if you don't breastfeed. It says that the reason why breastfeeding is so popular nowadays is that women know breastfeeding is better for themselves and their babies(read that whole section to see what I mean). You might not want to read the section about illness during pregnancy, since it says just about every possible illness anyone can get. But it also says what you should know about using medicine or herbal remedies. There is information that can make you scared, but can also be important to know about, such as ectopic pregnancies, possible risks to premature births, miscarriages, and even pregnancy loss. I think that what shows how caring the authors of the book really are is the section about coping with the unlikely event of death to the born child. Even though some of the information is scary, does book does explain that many pregnancy problems are uncommon. It also lists information about childbirth organizations, finding a doula, and finding different types of obstricians.I highly recommend this book whether you are an expecting mother or a student in the field, like me. Read it while enrolled in a childbirth class. Read a lot, but be selctive."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I really loved this book along with the other millon that I purchased. This book is really informative."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This book is great and it is organized month by month. Very clear and easy to understand. I am not yet pregnant, but I understand the realities of what will happen to me and my baby when the time comes."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"The books cover the basics of what happens when you are expecting a baby.

I read the Chinese translation of the 1991 edition of &quot;What to Expect When You're expecting&quot;, published in Taiwan.It's the best book concerning pregnancy I've ever seen. My wife and I read it carefully and did what the authers told us, now our baby is growing healthily. I want to introduce this book to a publisher in mainland China. I found the 1996 revised edition of the book from Amazon, I think it would be better han the 1991 edition."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"It's not too hot for first time moms, but it's not too bad once you've had a couple of children. It did scare me the first time and I just knew that I would eat, do and sleep the wrong way for the first baby. My fear of becoming a fatty patty was driving my husband nuts as well as myself. But after a few babies (2) I picked it up one day and looked it over again and thought - hey now this makes a little more sense. What I wished I would have done while I was pregnant with my first child was to read other books to prepare me for the toddler stage while I still had the time. The first year really passes quickly and then there's no time left. Do yourself a favor, read a variety of books on pregnancy, and then go directly to the toddler and preschooler books as almost all have a little on babies anyway (or at least for the first year). My favorites are: The Everything Baby's First Year Food Book, by Janet Mason Tarlov (this one is pretty new), What to Expect With Your Toddler, and Mommy-CEO, Revised Edition (lots of tips and fun topics on family life)by Jodie Lynn. They are all great books to have around and are easy to read and easy to follow. If I had it to do over again, I'd read at least the last two before baby comes and be better prepared before life becomes nuts with family."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I bought this during my first pregnancy and really regretted it! It has a thoroughly negative outlook on pregnancy and birth (i.e. what 'could' go wrong)This book gave me the feeling I would have lots of (unneccesary) interventions- IV, episiotomy, epidural,etc. in birth.This is the perfect hypochondriac's directory --you think you have all the ailments described in the book after reading about all the very commonplace symptoms fo pregnany. This book doesn't begin to address natural childbirth or complementary healthcare. Buy &quot;Gentle Birth Choices&quot; by Barbara Harper and &quot;The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding&quot; by LLL and anything by Sheila Kitzinger for a much more postive view of pregnancy and birth."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I bought this book because I kept hearing about how GREAT it was and how informative it was, but I found it to be kind of boring. It's suppose to go by how many weeks/months along you are, and tell you what to expect, but I found it to kind of jump from question to question, not focusing on certain topics. I can't return the book, but I might sell it!"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I also believe that &quot;Girlfriends guide&quot; and &quot;Babytales&quot; as well as the &quot; The Baby book&quot; are better choices.

What I'm expecting when I'm expecting is not to buy or recieve this book."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This book is a good primer to pregnancy. It provides info about the basics, and covers a lot of what you can expect to feel. However, the authors' diet is totally unrealistic (especially with women who have morning sickness), the book is way too focused on your weight, and makes it sound like if you take medicine during the pregnancy your child is going to be crippled for life.This book was my pregnancy bible, and I wish it hadn't been. It caused a lot of guilt and worry that was unnecessary."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"Heaven forbid that a woman actually enjoys her pregnancy. The women who wrote this book presented the information in an &quot;alarmist&quot; format--not very pleasing. Only use this book as a reference guide. Otherwise, live your pregnancy in a plastic bubble!!"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"While I found that this book had a lot of information, I also found that it was condescending and put a lot of focus on blaming the mother for everything. Some of the information is also contradictory. For example, the book chastizes women who gain &quot;too much&quot; weight during pregnancy, but says that only &quot;trained athletes&quot; should exercise. The book also claims that if you really want to, you can drop the weigth six weeks postpartum. Well, I'm sure most women would LIKE to do that, but it isn't always feasible. I bought this book as soon as I discovered I was pregnant, and was horrified by the Best Odds Diet, and admonition to think about each bite &quot;Is this the best bite for my baby?&quot; when I couldn't choke down much besides crackers. I would not recommend this book; I would instead recommend Pregnancy for Dummies, which has almost as much information, a lighter attitude, and a realization of the fact that being pregnant is not easy, and that we do the best we can to create healthy babies."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This book is unimaginative, uninformative, patronising, repetitive and boring.

It amazes me that every pg person I know has read this and only tells me NOW how much they DID NOT like it! It's approach was frightening and made me feel inadequate - esp. when I was not able to follow the &quot;Best Odds Diet&quot; [which was quoted in another book about the diet used by 3rd world countries to torture prisoners].It did not thoroughly address issues such as expanding waistline and gas and bloating, but emphasized a 3-POUND ONLY weight gain for the first trimester. (Not, of course, mentioning the diffences between individual pregnancies.)I found Sears book to be a much more realistic approach to pregnancy. One I could read and feel GOOD about myself and my pregnancy with. I no longer cried over my 6 pound weight gain and waistline that had grown 3 inches in the first 9 weeks of PG. Plus, it told me WHY things were good and bad and WHY I should do things in pregnancy."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This book is for conventional parents - parents who think artificial feeding and breastfeeding are one in the same, who think extended breastfeeding is distasteful and a minipulation of a mother by her nursling, and parents who believe it is OK to let a baby cry herself to sleep in an isolated crib down the hall. These authors actually state (in so many words) that breastmilk is basically useless after one year, and that sleeping with your infant in a family bed is not desirable. If you want a better guide for instinctual parenting from the heart, read &quot;The Continuum Concept&quot; by Jan Leidloff, or &quot;Attachment Parenting&quot; by Katie Allison Granju."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"&quot;What to Expect...&quot; does give the essentials of pregnancy, but is too flawed to be an enjoyable read or serious reference.The book's patronizing voice annoyed me on more than one occasion. The tone recalls the how-to books of the 50s, which gave simple directions and lots of reassurance but little engaging discussion. Some things are simply proscribed without any explanation: &quot;A lay midwife cannot provide you with optimal care.&quot; Why? Or: protein powder supplements &quot;may be harmful.&quot; Oh? One doesn't reason with a toddler about running into the street; nor does one reason with a simple-minded lady about dangers to her fetus, it seems. The most patronizing line I read was, &quot;Ask yourself: 'Is this the best bite I can take for baby?'&quot; I doubt male readers are ever addressed in this tone of voice (&quot;Before lifting the nozzle, ask yourself: is this the best gasoline I can feed my Camaro?&quot;)About nutrition: my OB, a conventional MD, told me to ignore their nutrition advice. &quot;No one eats that way,&quot; she said (meaning measuring portions), &quot;and it's way too many calories.&quot;And, if it were up to me, I'd lose the cover illustration, which conveys the idea of woman as soft, sweet, blank, and having nothing to do but wait for baby to arrive.I did pick up a little information, but am still looking for a thorough and intelligent guide to pregnancy and childbirth."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I was told this was THE book to get if you were expecting. I'm only 6 weeks along and already have grown very tired of this book and it's condescending tone. There is some useful information and that is why I gave it 2 stars, but nothing you couldn't find in a much better book (I prefer the Mayo Clinic book) or somewhere online. I have had some morning sickness, but my biggest problem has been terrible heartburn. I referenced this book to see if there were any suggestions for heartburn, and it basically told me that the heartburn was all my fault for overindulging in fried and fatty foods. Yeah, right! At this point the only thing I can keep down is oatmeal and plain toast. Since when are those overindulgences?! The Mayo Clinic book on the other hand, explains that heartburn is a very common side effect due to hormones and gives sound advice."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"Overall, not a bad book. It presents very basic information in a nonjudgemental way all in a Q&A; format, which drove me a little nuts after a while. Most of the questions are of the \\"I'm worried that I've done X, will it hurt the baby?\\" format, where X is the old wives tale. I found the book surprisingly short on labor and delivery information and very vague about specific proven techniques such as perineal massage (I know that a depiction of this may be perceived as indelicate, but come on, a diagram is necessary for the uninitiated). The nutrition information was generally helpful. Certain topics just weren't covered in the amount of detail that I would have liked or were hardly covered at all (i.e. if you are seriously under or overweight, the section on weight gain will have very little helpful information for you.) Obviously, if you have specific questions and you or your pregnancy are outside the norm, you should be talking to your practitioner; however, I would have preferred a little more information beyond the \\"this is what happens usually\\" variety.On a similar note, to respond to the gentleman who states that his spouse became a paranoid basket case after reading every worst-case scenario in the book, I would argue that this book is incredibly reassuring to someone of sound mind. It's emphasis is on normal pregnancy and normal expectations. There is a section at the end of the book that covers every pregnancy complication but I would advise that these sections be skipped unless you are suffering from one of the diagnoses and would like more information. If you are prone to paranoia, you will surely find enough fodder to give you nightmares whether you read this book or not."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"While this book is very informative and an excellent resource, I would not recommend sitting down and reading it cover to cover like I did. Being a first time mom when I picked this one up I was already afraid of every little thing that could possibly go wrong. This book really helped me along in my paranoia, and my husband eventually threw it away. There are actually sections in this book with a disclaimer that says if you do not have this condition do not read this chapter, it will only freak you out. If you have a specific question or do face a challenge during your pregnancy this book is very informative and helpful, but for your own sanity do not read any more of it than you have to!"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"It is a great source of information, but also a great source of paranoia. I only recommend this book to women who are hard headed (or can just pick the right information & omit the ones that are too exaggerated), or those who already ahve been through this before but are brushing up on their info.I tried to practice self control and not fall in the trap of fear. I must admit though that the last 2 months of my pregnancy, I stopped reading it, cause I couldn't deal with it any longer."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"As many of the reviewer's point out, this is a very comprehensive book - a bit too comprehensive frankly. At times, the book relies on junk science when making recommendations or diagnosing potential problems during the pregnancy. Normally a very calm person, the only anxiety my wife has displayed during her pregnancy occured after reading this book. As an example, I came home just last week to find my wife deeply concerned about the positioning of the umbilical cord around our babies neck. She thought our daughter may be suffocating... why, because What to Expect informed her that a baby that hiccups longer than 15 minutes in the womb may have the umbilicle cord wrapped around her neck. I knew this was ridiculous and had it confirmed when our doctor (a top rated OB/GYN in San Francisco and former Chief of Staff of the hospital) stated that the diagnosis was \\"junk science\\" and then when on to ask whether we should do a C-section every time someone's baby hiccups longer than 15 minutes in the womb. The book has confounded others, such as Dr. Drew on the infamous radio program \\"Lovelines\\", with its assertion that oral sex performed on a pregnant woman may lead to an air embolism for both the mother and fetus! These are just a couple of examples - the list is quite long.So, my advice to everyone entering into the exciting and stressful world of pregnancy is to read many other books and take the advice in What to Expect with an extreme grain of salt. Partners beware - this book may unreasonably transform your otherwise calm and relaxed wife into an anxious wreck!"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This has got to be one of the most miserable and depressing books out there! Don't believe me? Before you buy it, read a few pages on the beginning of each month. It gives you a huge list miseries you should expect for that month. Yeah, women do go through alot durring pregnancy but had I not read it on my fourth month, I wouldn't of even noticed some of the symptoms because I was focused more on the wonder inside of me rather than the constipation, hemmroids, swollen feet, veins, vomiting, irrability, mood swings, lack of concentration and the other horrible things this book tells you to expect. If you look up the word \\"expect\\" it the dictionary, it says: to rely on or look forward in recieving. Who looks forward to 9 months of misery?! I would recommend this book to young girls to scare them out of getting pregnant!"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"My mom bought this book for me when she found out I was pregnant and I love it. It's set up in an easy-to-read, month-by-month format. \\"What to expect...\\" covers a lot of the questions \\"moms-to-be\\" have to ask. I'd recommend it to anyone!"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I agree with the other reviewers that this book should be called &quot;What to worry about when you're expecting&quot;. It's great to have a guidebook that answers all your questions about what's going on, but I found that it worried me more than I should have. This is my first pregnancy, I'm now 18 weeks. Nobody has a perfect pregnancy, but the worst thing you want to do is go &quot;hhhmmm, I wonder why I'm having these symptoms&quot; and then look up to read that it could be nothing or it could be some horrible complication that you might need to go to the ER over. Pregnant women are like sponges soaking up information, at least all first time mothers that I talked to are.Furthermore, the maternity clothing advice was awful!!! Let me give you an example: it says your husbands wardrobe is your best friend &quot;take an oversized t-shirt and put a belt around the bottom of your belly for an interesting effect&quot; Ok ladies, I don't know about you, but I'm trying my damdest not to be frumpville. One word for you: EBAY. They have really cute maternity clothes for really cheap. Even Amazon has cute maternity clothes if you can afford it.The other thing I have to talk about is this godawful &quot;best odds diet&quot;. Nobody who has had morning sickness (as I did) can even imagine sticking to a diet this regimental. My doctor told me to eat whatever went down and stayed down. I'm trusting my doctor, not some book author. You do your best, and that's all you can do. But you don't want a guilt trip from a book.I shelved this book. There's much better ones out there. Even the pregnancy book that my doctor gave me from the hospital was better than this."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"When I first found out I was pregnant, I went out and bought about three or four books. Then a couple friends of mine reccomended me What To Expect When Expecting and I retired ALL the other books for the rest of my pregnancy. You'll find all the aswers to your questions on this easy to read book. My husband and I refer to it as our &quot;pregnancy Bible&quot; and we already bought &quot;What to Expect For The First Year&quot; a wonderful guide on how to take care of your new baby. If you don't want to spend money on tons of books and if you don't want to waste time searching for answers in different books, GET THIS ONE!"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"Bought this book when we learned we were expecting because it was \\"the thing to do\\". It contains good information, but after reading the first few chapters, it seems to offer little new information as you progress through the months. I wish it had more detail on a week-to-week basis, but overall it is a good resource."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I agree with Ron's posting that this book, while informative, definately supports the phrase \\"a little knowledge is a dangerous thing\\". To be honest I found \\"The Girlfriend's Guide to Pregnancy\\" much more supportive of my actual experience.This book is a good resource if used in conjunction with OB/GYN visits, to stimulate conversation and assist in asking questions that you may not think to ask. However, if you are even slightly given to assuming the worst case, I would steer clear and enjoy your pregnancy as it unfolds."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I just gave birth to my first baby on May 27. I read a few pregnancy books, and this one was BY FAR the most helpful and thorough book out there. It's got the answer to every single question I could have asked myself. The morning I went in to labor, I grabbed the book and started reading about false labor and contractions to see if I was really in labor or not.The book is broken down in to sections by each month of pregnancy. The author describes what is going on with the baby during each month, what kind of symptoms you may/may not be having, and gives a list of what to expect at your doctor's appointment that month. Everything was pretty accurate and helped me to understand what changes my body was going through. It was also neat to read about what my baby looked like and how she was developing as each month passed.Also in each section is a \\"frequently asked questions\\" type of format that had every single question and answer I could possibly think of - and tons I would never have thought of. Any time I had a question, I broke out this book and was able to find the answer. And every time I asked my doctor a question, he gave me an answer almost exactly the same as the book.I highly recommend this book to any pregnant woman, especially first-timers like myself This book helped me through a lot of anxiety and worry about my baby. Now I've moved on to \\"What to Expect the First Year\\" and it is just as wonderful. Definitely worth all five of the stars I'm giving it!"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I bought this book, assuming it was the authority on pregnancy since it's so well-known. I was extremely disappointed. I found the author's style to be condescending, and her perspectives are outdated. More importantly, the format of the book (organized according to stage of pregnancy) assumes every reader will experience a particular symptom or concern at the \\"textbook\\" moment. I encourage you to save your money and buy \\"The Mother of All Pregnancy Books\\" instead. That has been my real pregnancy resource."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I know this book is the most famous pregnancy book, yet most people seem to not like it for some reason.This was my favorite book, and there was NOTHING I experienced during pregnancy that this book didn't address. Other books were good, but didn't even mention some issues/symptoms, etc. This book is written in an interesting Q&A; format and calms you about anything you can imagine."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This book was given to me with the best of intentions by my sister-in-law who remembered this book from her high school days when one of her friends was pregnant. Apparently, it was considered informative and an excellent resource back then. But high school was almost twenty years ago, and with the amount of health information available to us now, and people's just plain being more educated nowadays, I don't see much use for this book anymore. Overall, I think the information is too simplified and simplistic, which gives it a condescending, \\"cause I said so\\" sort of tone. For example, there is no real medical explanation behind the Best Odds Diet this book puts forth; the only thing that could be said is that it's a relatively sensible diet given what we already know about nutrition.As for the previous reviews describing this book as opinionated and preachy - I agree. If you don't want to get aggravated, stay away from the section on the Pros and Cons of Breastfeeding, which offers all the usual Pros, blah blah blah, but when it comes to the Cons, there are explanations such as some women feel it gets in the way of their sex lives, some women simply have an aversion to breastfeeding, etc. So in short, you're a good mother if you do, you're a selfish woman with \\"issues\\" if you don't. Hey, I'm all for breastfeeding, and I plan to do it as long as I can once my baby is born, but there are other more legitimate reasons why some women don't or can't.In general, I would recommend this book only for: a) anyone who for some reason does not already know most of what this book tells you to expect, b) someone who for some reason has no other resources, or c) someone who needs a reality check such as a pregnant, uninformed teenager who needs a slap upside the head."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"As a first time parent I was looking for something informative and to help me understand what my body was going through. As this book has lots of information, I felt that it did not give me all of the information I needed and expected. I guess it was the format of the book that I did not like. I was looking for a book that gave me more information on the development of the baby etc. This book I felt focused on the negative issues.....things that could go wrong. In short it wasn't what I expected while I was expecting....So I found other resourses that gave me the information I needed."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"Unless you are willing to follow the very strict diet and exercise guidelines in this book, you shouldn't buy it. Even if you are willing to follow it, the advice is so unrealistic that most women who are pregnant will not be able to follow it because they will just feel too lousy. It really will just make you feel guilty and frustrated, which pregnant women really don't need. The medical information is very general, and was of little help to me during my pregnancy. Anything that I really wanted information on, I had to look up on the Internet. The only really valuable part of the book is the information on fetal development each month, and some of the information on how chemicals and certain foods affect the baby, which you could probably find on-line too. &quot;What to Expect the First Year&quot; is similarly strict and frustrating, and in some ways even insulting as to the advice it gives. Fortunately, I received both books as gifts and didn't waste my own money on them."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"After hearing so much about this book, I was so excited to receive it as a gift when I found out I was pregnant. But the content is very weak, and the &quot;Question &amp; Answer&quot; format condescending and annoying. I found &quot;The Unofficial Guide ...&quot; and &quot;Advice from a Pregnant OB&quot; much more intelligent reading. I would not even recommend this as a backup book, except for someone who wants some very light reading, and doesn\`t like an academic, purer approach and will appreciate the Q&amp;As.I was very surprised that this is &quot;the bible&quot; for pregnancies -- it really makes you wonder."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I read this book during my first pregnancy and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone -- I have a hard time believing it makes the bestseller list. There are three basic problems with this book. First, it promotes a philosophy that you are actively in control of the outcome of the pregnancy, as if pregnancy complications can be eliminated by being a control freak during pregnancy. Second, rather than being informative or reassuring it sent me to my doctor TWICE for no good reason, after reading the Q&A section for the month. Finally the diet recommend is much stricter than required for any normal pregnancy...no doubt if you can follow it you will be healthier, but pregnancy is a time of high stress and this book is only going to add to it. I would recommend \\"The Well Pregnancy Book\\" over \\"What to Expect\\"."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"i don't care what anyone says whether you are a pro at being pregnant or not! this book was well informing exspecially for first time pregnancies. it told you every ache and pain and what you will most likely be feeling. also i took you through every inch of labor and told you ... well what to expect. i recomend this book to anyone that is pregnant or getting ready to be. also after the baby is born there are also what to expect the first years and what to expect the toddler years. also great reads and great deals of helpfulness"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I got this book from my OB doctor, and I like it a lot!.

I have no idea what some ladies expected to find in a book called What To Expect When You're Expecting!!! This book is honest and holds up to its title. One of thing I liked about it is that fact that it tells you exactly what is good for you and your baby and what is not. Why was that condescending, rude, and hard to hear/handle to some? I don't know! Refined sugars, bleached flour, deep fried foods, and exposure to harmful chemicals are not good for you whether you're pregnant or not, and this book stresses these facts and guides you to a healthy pregnancy and life style in general. If you expect emotional support and someone to hold your hand, talk to your partner and save your bucks. This book is not for girlfriends talk, it is very practical, right to the point, and it tells you exactly what to expect when you're expecting. Amazing huh?? If you expect an honest advice and no beating around the bush, this is the book for you. The book includes sections in nutrition, exercise, and expected symptoms that may apply to you, or you may skip through them. It also covers pregnancy month by month symptoms and how to deal with them. In addition to providing you with guidelines to leading a healthy pregnancy and a healthy life style, it will also answer a number of common questions, that will save you a lot of phone calls to your OB/GYN. It is no joke...this book is awesome!"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"... I am now going on my 39th week of pregnancy and I have referred to this book hundreds of times! As with EVERYTHING you should question information, as everyone had their own ideas. But this book provides you with all the answers to those questions you may feel silly calling your Dr about at 3am! I found it very helpful and informative! The month by month breakdown wasn't &quot;scary&quot; it was very insiteful! It provided me with a good base of pregnancy. I knew what to expect and what to question! I HIGHLY RECOMMMEND THIS BOOK!- ESPECIALLY TO A FIRST TIME MOM!"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This is the best most informative book that I have ever seen on pregnancy. I'm due any day now, and I have read every page of this book multiple times. It answers all of the questions that pregnant women have, as well as giving up to date and intelligent advice. I highly recommend this to anyone even thinking of getting pregnant. It has been my greatest source for pregnancy and childbirth knowledge."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"You should only read/use this book if you are a masochist with no interest in food as pleasure, and if you are prepared for a lot of guilt. No other medical professionals that I know of would recommend such a strict and bizarre diet, and for women to give themselves over completely to their pregnancy with no concern for the rest of life. Many of the book's prescriptions seem bizarre and unsubstantiated. And, like the other books in this series, it's very hetero/marriage oriented, which always makes me want to puke, even though I'm straight and married. It felt arrogant and not at all inclusive or accepting or anything but their rigid paradigm."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"Should have called this book &quot;Expecting the Worst&quot;.

This book is all hype. For a thorough and informative book check out Dr. William Sears' THE PREGNANCY BOOK. And THE BREASTFEEDING BOOK by Sears is also great."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I got this book when pregnant with my first child, and religiously read it for the first several months. Then, as I was also becoming educated through other means, I began to see that this book tends to be alarmist and narrow-minded. The chapter on each month of pregnancy is a neat idea, but the book doesn't provide in-depth information. I found myself searching the web for more scoop on what my unborn baby was &quot;like&quot; at each month, because the book only gives a bit of information. The book tries to be a reference for your various ailments, but you can find that free on-line, and in more depth. I didn't find the tone of the book to be very friendly toward babies, ironically, and this impression was greatly strengthened when I read the book on the baby's first year. Finally, I actually found some of the information to be incorrect and misleading. This book tries to be all things and thus is too shallow in every aspect. There are better, more comprehensive books and websites out there. Pregnancy is not an illness, but these authors seem to think it is."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"My husband is so sweet. He said that he researched pregnancy books, read the reviews, and then made an order. As you can guess, he went with What to expect when you're expecting. So he surprised me when the Amazon order arrived, and then said he wanted us to read it together. I am a little nervous about my first pregnancy, so I just thank God for this man. Although I don't have anything to compare it to, I am surprised that I just read some negative comments. Myself, I loved the book, and so did my David. So if you are expecting, and want some solid information and great tips, I would certainly say to buy this book. And I hope this doesn't offend anyone, but I wanted to mention that my husband read in one of the reviews for this book, about a book called Passenger's Side. He got that too. We are currently almost done with it. I wanted to say that it turned out to be a blessing in disguise for him to stumble across it. It's a truly special Christian book. I highly recommend both of these books.Good luck to all of you with your babies!"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This book was my guide through my first pregnancy. Although I guess I ignored what others are calling the &quot;doctor-oriented&quot; advice because I told the delivering OB and her side-kick &quot;expert&quot; to get lost when they recommended an emergency C-section. My son's head was tipped. So what? We - the nurses and I - &quot;talked&quot; him into tucking his head and I had my baby vaginally an hour later.I referred to it a few times during pregnancy number 2, but I didn't let the diet and &quot;what you may (or *must*) be feeling&quot; parts get to me like they did the first time. The diet will indeed whip some guilt on you. Ignore it. Eat well, but have a good time, too.I gave the book away because I thought I wouldn't get pregnant again and...well...the best laid plans...But I'm not re-purchasing this book. It was a good referece for first time moms, especially if you're like me and you don't scare easily. The folks who say it is condescending and scary are right. I'm fortunate that my mom is an RN and taught me through example to question the medical community.For an experienced, educated mom, the book is not a worthwhile reference. I'm going to take some of the other recommendations and buy &quot;The Girlfriend's Guide...&quot; this time and have some *fun*!"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"Where do you discuss the side of effects of epidurals and pain medication?

We have two (after a friend gave us an old copy) and comparing the two you can really see the updates are relevant and well worth including.

As an avid reader and seeing a volume of \\"What to Expect\\" books, I rushed to purchase it. While it helped solve some of our preliminary questions, afterwards it did nothing but instill fear into our minds.The book is not really organized in any reasonable way to ascertain the answers to specific questions, unless you want to wade through the index. It does answer many questions you might have, but it is impossible to find the answers sometimes.I was looking forward to a book that would really explain what to expect during each week or pregnancy, but I found this simply a huge FAQ book. I think it is best to just be read casually and not as a go to guide for certain questions you might have.I would not recommend this book and would urge you to find something more comprehensive. I hope this book gets less press as more options become available."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"When we first learned my wife was pregnant, I rushed here to purchase this book, assuming it was \\"The\\" book on pregnancy. [Due to _Nine Months_, no doubt.] I was shocked by the number of negative reviews, so I borrowed it from our library instead to decide whether to purchase it. While overall we did not feel it is a *bad* book, we didn't purchasing it due to feeling that the authors were \\"amateurs\\" and we didn't trust their knowledge and judgement regarding medical issues.Pregnancy books should provide two types of information: personal information, such as expected symptoms and how to deal with it, and medical information, such as biological changes, potential problems, and the state of the fetus. The personal information was pretty good, about on the same level as other books. The medical information, however, I found quite lacking. This book is obviously (to me) written by people without any serious medical training, which I feel is a significant problem. This is not snobbery on my part, but rather there is so much incomplete and contradictory information regarding pregnancy that I need someone that has the background to truly understand the limits of different studies and what the study really proves. I did not trust that these authors had that knowledge.Since I am not a MD, and you may wonder on what I base this; I base this on the overall tone, and on some so-obvious errors that it makes we worried. The most egregious of these is on page 69 about microwave oven radiation \\"at twenty inches you get 100 percent less exposure than at two inches\\". This worries me. First, to still be worried about microwaves leaking radiation is so late 1980's. I get the feeling that one author heard a rumor from a friend many years ago and put it into the book, without any critical judgement on whether it is still truly an issue. In addition, the quoted sentence is just flat out *wrong* scientifically. I know what they think they're trying to say: however, even if you replace the \\"100 percent less\\" (100 percent less means none!) with \\"100x less\\" (via the inverse square law), this is valid only IF the oven is a point source (which it's not) and if you're a point (which a pregnant woman most certainly is not!). Anyone with the least science understanding would not make that mistake, and would understand that the inverse square law doesn't apply that strictly here. This is admittedly a minor mistake, and you probably think I'm being petty; if this were the only example, I would agree. However, it's not the only example, and it's indicative of the book overall that it's written by people repeating what they are told without *truly* understanding.My other criticism with this book is that much of the information seems forced into the month-by-month format; for example, traveling when pregnant is in chapter 5, labor pain medicine in chapter 7. What if you want to travel before month 5? What if you plan to travel after month 5, and don't realize the issues until too late?In the book's defense, I do think that many other reviews' opinion that the information provided in this book causes unnecessary alarm and that this books should be avoided is overblown. Overall, I found the information reassuring and complete, although at times would prefer more information on how common (or uncommon) it is. I do think that the book made a major mistake in concentrating all the problems into one chapter (chapter 20), and including the very rare cases. I would prefer the information to be spread out throughout the chapters in which the problem may occur, where it's more useful. I do admit that reading page after page of potential problems can get to one. While there are many things that *can* go wrong during a pregnancy (but almost never do), not mentioning them is not going to make them go away. And if this is your first awareness of the potential pregnancy problems and that scares you, don't get made at this book for your ignorance, blame yourself."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This was the best book, buy it.

Considering most of their instructions were off-base, I suppose most of us were asking for trouble with anything we did?

As someone who studied nutrition and diet, found the diet advice to be misleading/wrong/dated in some cases. Otherwise, found everything accurate/helpfull. &quot;What to expect when Expecting&quot; is the best of the series-- Watch out for &quot;What to Expect the First Year&quot;--I felt it had BAD breastfeeding advice. They encouraged early weaning/to start weaning by 6 months so child is weaned by a year. Book assumes that most babies are on bottles after 6 months. Subsequently, book had me worried if I was doing right thing. I breastfed for 20 months until my guy naturally weaned. Turns out I did the right thing--Now the AAP recommends breastfeeding for a year and beyond! So glad I trusted my instincts, but the book made me worry a lot (next one, I'll know better).

I really don't understand why it received any low scores. I read it cover to cover through out my nine months of pregnancy. I did not find it depressing in any way. I loved the question and answer format of the book. Many of the questions asked where the same questions I had. No, it is not directed to single mother ( which I was, and still am), but I still found it very very very very very useful. I highly recomend this novel! I loved it!"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I found the best way to use this book is as a reference guide. It does not give the best week-by-week or month-by-month descriptions. It's geared toward question/answer format. I would not read it cover to cover but have used it as a reference guide to research topics. It gives thorough and accurate explanations about medical conditions and tips on when to call your Dr. but I wouldn't want to read about all those problems if I weren't experiencing symptoms."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This is a very easy to follow, comprehensive book for those who are going through pregnancy for the first time. I am a little distressed by a couple of the other reviews. Let me make note of a couple of things. First, for those of us about to enter the 21st century, and the 97% of us who live in urban/suburban areas, a hospital birth is considered *normal.* People who hang out in health food stores and want to have their children in log cabins, apparently, should be reading the &quot;Foxfire&quot; series of books, rather than trying to get pregnant and then endangering their future children by attempting to have them at home. And, it should be noted, the book does an excellent job of explaining what to do in the case of an emergency childbirth. Second, as for the accusations that the book has a &quot;pro-doctor&quot; or &quot;pro-hospital&quot; bias, that's like saying non-smokers have a &quot;pro-health&quot; bias. Third, as for the accusation that this book is too directed at two-parent/heterosexual families, all I can say is, get over it. If you want a childbirth book that is pro-feminist and anti-male, then read Sheila Kitzinger's &quot;Complete Guide to Pregnancy and Childbirth&quot; instead. But don't whine and carp about this book. For regular people this book is simply the best."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I enjoyed the month-by-month format but I did sense a know-it-all attitude; it is very suburban in its outlook and heaven help you if you're single, a lesbian, a rural parent or poor and are looking for concrete advice.

They obviously are a pro-hospital birth book and I do not recall home birth being mentioned in a good light. And, if you aren't going to breastfeed, well then you may as well prepare for a sickly child according to their stance.

Presents multiple views on many issues, such as breast vs. bottle, without making judgments. Month-by-month format is good for first-time expectant parents, but makes it difficult at times to find specific information. Good as an overall, reassuring guide. Once you figure out your preferences on certain issues, you should look for books that go deeper. The follow-up book on baby's first year is similar and helpful."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"As long as you ignore the eating plan, it's a good book for an idea of what's happening each month."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"here is what my wife says:It is a very good book. Deserves 5 stars. Every expecting couple should read this. The next book &quot;What to expect in the first year&quot; is also very good. This book has relieved anxiety many a time for us, especially at 3 AM. Also answered a lot of questions that I could not ask my doctor. Small questions that are not doctor worthy but you need to know.Must buy."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This book provides answers from A to Z about pregnancy issues.

I highly recommend this book to every pregnant woman, especially the first time!"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This is by far my favorite pregnancy book, it is comprehensive, fun and easy reading. The only thing I would like to see changed about this book is it goes month by month rather than week by week. It has great information from everything from pregnancy diet, what symptoms to expect and how to treat them and birth, also great sections on \\"When things go wrong\\" and postpartum - The issue I think most new moms are not educated enough on. Yes there Is a lot in the book on diet but It was very helpful, If you want just skip that chapter the rest of the book is a god send. This book is my pregnancy bible!!!"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"My title says it all. This is an easy reading book with excellent advice and information. My doctor, one of the top doctors in Manhattan recommended it so it can't be bad! Get the other books if you have no life and want to read and research all day. Most of us don't have that luxury."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This is the most useful book for new moms available. Before and after the birth, almost every conceivable question is addressed. You could buy ten other pregnancy books and still not cover everything in this one."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This book has a wonderful month-by-month analogy of what is going on with your body during pregnancy. It shows where the baby is in development, what to expect at each prenatal exam, and answered every type of question a nervous mother-to-be would have about delivery. I liked the idea that it was written by medical professionals and it examined possible complications during pregnancy, the birth and postpartum. It also outlines helpful excercises, has diet recommendations and recipes. A great learning tool for the first-time mother!"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"MY MOTHER IS NO LONGER LIVING, MY IN-LAWS LIVE VERY FAR AWAY, AND MY GRANDMOTHER IS IN HER 70'S, THERE WAS NO ONE I COULD ASK ABOUT PREGNANCY THINGS, THIS BOOK WAS A GODSEND.

It is fun, practical and extrememly helpful and informative in every detail of pregnancy. This is a must book for every expecting family. I would highly recommend this book to anyone expecting a baby. It makes a great shower gift!!I also enjoyed the Five Love Languages of Children by Gary Chapman, the Five Love Languages of Teens well as The Five and Mom by Holly Anderson. These book stand out as unforgettable. They all put something in me to make me a wiser, compassionate and more loving mother!"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"By far the best pregnancy book out there!

My daughter is only 7 mo, so I haven't gotten to What to Expect...The Toddler Years, but I am looking forward to its informative help!"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I have had a copy of this book for every pregnancy. It give a gret breakdown month by month as to whats going on. However, there are better books out there.

But it is still really great book to have for parents as a refrence."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I love this book.

People either love or hate this book. I am in the middle. It has pretty comprehensive coverage, but I agree the nutrition section is impossible. It was the best ten years ago, but now there are other great books out there. Best to get information from many different sources. I agree that The Pregnancy Book by the Sears is good for day to day concerns. If you want an interesting perspective of what is really going on in there, the best is How Life Begins--The Science of Life in the Womb by Chris Vaughan. This is particularly good for fathers who have trouble connecting to the day-to-day diet and exercise stuff."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This book was a great guide to pregnancy, it literally answered every question I had. Including the ones I was afraid to ask anyone because I thought they were stupid. The best odds diet is a little extreme but if you use it as a guide and not a bible it helps. You also may not wish to read the sections on what could go wrong unless there is a reason to because it is a little scary (but for anyone who has any of these problems it probably very helpful)."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"When I had my first baby this book was okay. Actually 10 years ago it was a great book. However it hasn't revised to keep up with the times there are other books that are far better. I agree with the other comments about the nutrition section. A bit unrealistic. I become a childbirth educator after my second baby and have read many books. I am also a Doula, trained labor support person and look for helpful and informative books for me and my clients. Even though the book has been revised it still isn't current with other printed material. If anyone is interested in other books they can e-mail me and I can refer them to a book that might suite them. I read a few of the comments and some other books listed that I will read to get a feel of the information. If you want a general book What to Expect is okay. But for more informative books with a more upbeat tone. There are others that can do better."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"Overall this book was pretty good. This is my first child so i like the part at the beginning of each month. However i dont like the best odds diet section. Im sure if i followed that i would be ill. I think you just need to be sensible and try to eat more fruit and veg. There is no need to go over the top. the book makes it sound if you dont eat all that you are a bad person."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I am six months into my pregnancy and have been reading many books. What to Expect has lots of information and seems to have an answer to every question imagineable. I have found it to be very useful. However, I can relate better to a book like We're Pregnant! that gives lots of information but from a more personal viewpoint. My goal has been to find a book that gives a very detailed accounting of the delivery process - What to Expect answers questions relating to the delivery but again, I preferred the more detailed, true-to-life description in We're Pregnant! Still, I would recommend What to Expect as a good reference book."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"Definitely include this book in your pregnancy library, but read it with a grain of salt. It provides plenty of useful information, but it will also scare you out of your wits if you take it too seriously. For levity, read the Girlfriend's Guide to Pregnancy by Vicky Iovine. There are lots of other informative books that are more positive and respect your ability to think and make choices other than what the author thinks is right."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I read What to Expect when I was pregnant for the first time. While I thought it contained a great deal of information, there seemed to be an emphasis on all the things that could go wrong. I wanted to be informed, but not knowing myself what to expect, I would have preferred more focus on the positive aspects of pregnancy. Still, this book is great if you have a question on a certain topic - it seems to cover them all. I would have liked the book much better if it were more personal."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I found this book somewhat informative, being completely clueless about pregnancy. But I must say that the first time I picked it up and started to read it, I was scared out of having kids for 2 years. My doctor says the key to reading this book is to not read too far ahead of where you are in your pregnancy. It could use a bit more of a positive twist.As far as the Best-Odds diet, I think it could be revised a bit. It's important to try to eat as healthy as you can, but in the first trimester, I think just getting anything down is an important step. So, I took the diet with a grain of salt and just tried to eat sensibly without going overboard. If I felt like having a scoop of ice cream, I had one."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I bought this book before any other based on all the hoopla I had heard before I was pregnant. Although I found all the Q &amp; A's very helpful, I was not impressed with The Best Odds Diet. The book made me feel like a horrible person just because I ate healthy all day, but may have snacked on a piece of chocolate or something. Although it taught me a lot on what I should be eating, I have also never been so paranoid about my diet in my life! What I really found lacking was what was going on in my body. For each month, there was a small chart on what to expect and a 2 sentence explanation on how my baby was growing. I want to know specifically what is going on in my body step by step. This is the reason I am going to buy a week-by-week book that has been recommended by several others. Since this is my first baby, any information I can get is great, but I've been told there's much better books out there."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"So many of the reviewers here who negatively rate this book really do miss the point bigtime. The book does NOT, as some claim, dwell on the negative, or potential negative scenarios or outcomes. It factually MENTIONS them, as any complete, informative, and fair book on pregnancy SHOULD! The author even goes as far as responsibly mentioning that many negative scenarios like 'pre-eclampsia' or 'placenta previa' are indeed rare, and don't happen that often, thus alleviating unfounded fear. So the false assertion by some reviewers here that this book tends to 'scare you' is in fact more a reflection on some people's paranoia, and most certainly not an accurate assessment of the unbiased, factual nature of this book. The author tells it like it is, and does NOT promote any one specific modality of childbirth. She distinctly states that no 2 pregnancies are alike, and that there are advantages of both 'natural' and/or 'drugged' or 'c-section' deliveries, based on many varying factors or needs of the mom-to-be. If anything, this book is very unbiased and amazingly complete and factual! This is one of the very best books on pregnancy ever written, certainly in my 'top 3' list. A classic, and then some."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This book always seemed to give the worst case scenerio about my questions about pregnancy. For example it said that I shouldn't go camping up in the mountains when my doctor said it was fine. It made me paranoid about how often my baby hiccuped and said that she could be strangling herself on her umbilical cord if she did it too often, when my doctor assured me hiccups are good and mean the baby is practicing breathing. There are many more examples, but it did not make me a relaxed pregnant woman about normal occurances during pregnancy. It is very clinical and not human enough for my taste. I much preferred &quot;The Pregnancy Book&quot; by Martha and Dr Sears to this one and if I had to recommend one pregnancy book (I ended up buying many)it would not be the &quot;What to Expect&quot; series. Save your money and your sanity and pass on this book."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":".....a little on the condescending and preachy side. I'm so glad to see that other reviewers agree. My OB hands this book out at your first visit, so I felt their must be something wrong with me for not liking it.I do give it three stars, but one is based purely on it's informative nature. It has saved me a few calls to the OB, which is probably why they hand it out. However, I find myself wanting to track down the author and slap her on a regular basis. The pregnancy diet will make you feel like a failure right off the bat because it is hopelessly unrealistic and nearly impossible for any real, human, twinkie and pickle craving pregnant woman to follow. And the harping.....from all sides and topics......about diet. Do you have heartburn? Forget some comforting nugget to make you feel better, the first line she gives you suggests that you brought it on yourself by &quot;overindulging&quot;. It comes from everywhere, and yes, it is extremely annoying.So my advice is, if you've got thick skin go for it. Parts of it are informative. However, if you are like 99.999% of pregnant woman (myself included) and are feeling a little sensitive, find something else. Pregnancy is hard enough without a book to make you feel bad about yourself."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"Pregnancy should be fun, and wonderful. It isn't always. Some problems are merely uncomfortable. Others are much more serious. This book describes the good and the bad.It's important to know what's normal what's not, and how best to determine which is which.Granted, it's not warm and fuzzy to learn that excruciating cramps and bleeding might mean an ectopic pregnancy. But such advice--which this book contains--could very possibly save your life.Fortunately, this book precisely and accurately described the symptoms of that condition, as a result of which, I lived to tell the tale.This book is a potential life saver. It saved mine.---Alyssa A. Lappen"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"Even though this book is well organized and easy to read with its month by month format, I found it to be a bit misleading as it does not give risks, side affects and alternatives to many medical procedures and medications. It encourages kind of a wait and see attitute instead of providing all the information so that informed parents can make informed decisions as they make plans for their birth. Perhaps a better name for this book would be Expecting...Expect a Ceserean. Birth is a normal, natural event in a women's life in most cases - not a surgical procedure. A bit misleading and somewhat irresponsible."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"When I was pregnant with my first child, I had this book, and I even had the follow-ups as my son grew. I have to say in hindsight, do NOT get this book. There are so many books that are tremendously good, more caring, and full of BETTER advice. The William and Martha Sears books for instance are wonderful. What to expect will leave you clueless when you're facing important decisions, and often more anxious than you need to be. The section on breastfeeding is particularly bad, and will have you wondering which end is up, and weaning your baby far sooner than recommended. Instead, try something by Katherine Dettwyler on breastfeeding, or the Sears Complete Pregnancy Book. You'll be much happier and better informed."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I liked this book - it was informative and provided lots of information in a month by month format (which I found most useful). I don't get the &quot;it's too scary&quot; comments - isn't knowledge power? Don't you want to know about things that can go wrong, and be able to potentially recongnize a problem earlier? I find the more I know, the better I feel. &quot;It's too scary&quot; complaints look almost childish! Grow up, ladies! I remember reading the diet section, but I don't recall that it left a lasting impression on me. If you can't follow their particular diet, don't! The book is not supposed to provide you with a day-to-day menue, it just gives you basic guidelines of what kinds of things you should be eating. Too many times, women think that pregnancy is their ticket to eat ice cream by the gallons, and the book emphasizes that healthy eating is important in pregnancy, as well as healthy weight gain. So, don't take everything that's in this book literally, but remember that it does contain useful tips."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This is a great book to look things up in when you have a question. However, I would NOT suggest reading this book cover-to-cover. This book is quite in-depth, which is exactly what can make it scary for a mom-to-be or new mom. If your pregnancy is fairly uneventful and/or your child is fairly healthy, there is plenty here that will terrify you: no sense reading all the details about stillbirth, or gestational diabetes, or deformities if those things aren't a pressing concern in your situation. Again, though, if you did need to know about those things, this book covers it. Great to have in the house for times of need- just think of it as an encyclopedia or reference book, rather than a sit-down-and-read-it book."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I rushed out and bought this book the day I found out I was pregnant because it has a good reputation. Once I got it home and started into it, I found it to be uninteresting and not a good preparation for the coming months. The authors focused way too much on diet- which during your first trimester when morning sickness runs rampant, diet advice is not what you need. Also, there was a lot of &quot;what if this happens..&quot; and moms-to-be do not need more things to worry about. There are far better books out there for pregnant women who don't want to worry about everything for 9 months."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I just found out I was pregnant and bought this book by recommendation. While I found a lot of information therin, I do not love the format. I bought some other pregnancy books that were easier reads. I want to comment on those who are upset about this book because they got scared reading about potential complications of a pregnancy. People who get scared about facts need to work on themselves. Facts are just facts. This books is not a novel. It is not supposed to make you feel happy, sad, fearful or confident about your pregnancy. It is supposed to provide some information you do not already have. I believe What to Expect does what it's supposed to do."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This book is preachy and filled with biased notions of what women should do during pregnancy and childbirth. It's condescending.A much better book is Henci Goer's The Thinking Woman's Guide to Better Birth!"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"Am I the only person in the world who loathed this book? I found the syrupy-sweet tone cloying and irritating. The structure -- organizing topics via what month of pregnancy you're in -- was, to me, difficult to navigate; I seemed to spend an awful lot of time paging through the book to find what I was looking for, since my questions didn't tally precisely with the authors' timetable. While there is some good solid medical information, the book doesn't do a good job of helping you realize how likely or unlikely certain conditions are, or otherwise put the scary stuff in perspective. (And the authors' insistence that their Nazi-ish diet will solve all manner of problems is absurd.) In addition, I found the book's attempt to help you deal with the emotional aspects of pregnancy unhelpful and unrealistic, while the patronizing and preachy tone grates. Worst of all is the authors' nutty &quot;food police&quot; mentality: the chapter on the &quot;Best odds diet&quot; is downright scary. Can you imagine seriously suggesting to someone (anyone, not just a pregnant woman) that they should forgo all sweets and then, maybe, once a month they can have half a bagel for a &quot;treat&quot;?!"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"or see if you can get someone to give you a copy if you feel the need to keep this &quot;pregnancy bible&quot; close at hand.The month-by-month format is helpful (then again, your experiences may vary somewhat).However, like many readers here, what really annoys me about this book is the tone in which it is written -- like all pregnant women are morons who jettisoned their sense of humor the minute the test came back positive.And the nutrition section is kind of a joke. I went from four months of morning sickness straight into persistent heartburn, so I made food choices based on what (1) didn't make me gag or (2) didn't keep me up all night belching. (Sometimes it was grapefruit, sometimes it was potato chips.)Relax a little bit -- constantly worrying about your weight or if you stood downwind from a car with a bad exhaust system isn't good for the baby either."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"If there is one thing I wish I had been told when I first got pregnant and would share with any newly pregnant woman, it would be not to buy or read this book. This is a book full of &quot;advice&quot; which is designed to make any woman feel inadequate. The recommended &quot;best odds&quot; diet is just that, a diet. It is overly focused on avoding fats and sugars and establsihes ridiculous standards for the amount of food one &quot;should&quot; be eating. For example, the authors' idea of a &quot;special&quot; treat is to allow oneself a bagel once a week. It utilizes scare tactics which can give a new mother the feeling that if she does eat ice cream, white flour, or refined sugar, her precious baby will be forever damaged. The advice on washing fresh fruits and vegetables with dish soap is similarly ridiculous. In addition the advice on avoiding pollutants and other supposed but unproven toxins--preservatives, all cleaning fluids--is incrediably biased toward middle-class, suburban, married women. For example women are advised to exercise outside but to avoid all exhaust fumes; not practical for those of us who live in cities. Likewise we are advised to stay inside during high pollution days, also not practical for most people who have jobs/responsibilities. The same goes for the advice on leaving the cleaning to someone else; what about women who don't have partners and can't afford housekeepers? The worst aspect of the book is that it is written in a tone that suggests that if a woman does not follow the book's dictates that she is a negligent mother-to-be."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This book is a good reference to have around to read about general things that you can expect during each month of pregnancy, to look up symptoms and to look up all those off-the-wall old wives' tales and horror stories that EVERYONE YOU KNOW (just trust me on this) will bombard you with the moment you get pregnant.However, it has some major drawbacks. First, it's overly preachy when it comes to diet and nutrition. Downright Fascist, really. You are led to believe that you should feed yourself and your unborn baby only fruits, veggies and the leanest of meats. Don't dare to enjoy some ice cream or a burger. How about a nice stalk of broccoli instead? The book does not explain how exactly you are expected to gain the 25-35 pounds recommended during pregnancy if you never, ever eat anything fattening.Also, this book will annoy you greatly if you are planning a natural childbirth. It has an attitude that you're insane if you dare to forego such modern inventions as epidurals, and the author seems to be of the belief that birth is not a natural process, but a medical procedure. I would recommend Martha Sears and Dr. William Sears' \\"The Pregnancy Book\\" and \\"The Birth Book\\" instead."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This book is a guide to pregnancy and childbirth for women who really don't care to be truly informed. It is only slightly more information than the average doctor will divulge, and glosses over many of the risks of some of the procedures discussed. In particular, it doesn't give an adequate description of the risks a cesarian has for the mom and baby, and also for future pregnancies and deliveries. It also has misinformation regarding breastfeeding. When I was pregnant with my first, I bought this book thinking it was the &quot;bible&quot; of childbirth books. After my first birth, and my subsequent research, I won't even *give* it away-- I don't want anyone else running around with this kind of misinformation at her fingertips. A much better book for those who truly want to be informed is Henci Goer's &quot;Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Childbirth.&quot;"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I don't understand why this book is so popular. I found the health and well-being information lacking. There is also an abundance of &quot;scary&quot; information each month - &quot;things you should worry about&quot; that frankly, dont apply to 95% of us and I just don't need to know. I found the Pregnancy book by Dr. Sears MUCH better - more informative, more helpful, and more realistic. Of course, I also loved the Girlfriend's Guide - it's great for a laugh."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"After going through two years of infertility, I was so excited to settle down with this book and learn all about &quot;What to expect&quot;. This book was a waste of time and money, especially in the first trimester when everything changes so quickly that you can't possibly expect to cover issues on a monthly basis. Also, even though I found it alarmist (Uhoh! I looked at a muffin! My baby will be born with two heads!), I also thought that it didn't cover some very basic information. For example, nowhere in the book does it indicate that symptoms will come and go, and that this is normal. Instead, it says that if your symptoms disappear you are likely having a miscarriage and should call your doctor. That's baloney. In the end, I realized I could find all of the information I wanted simply by doing a simple online search. I will never recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I found the tone to be condescending and insulting to the intelligence of women. The approach was negative and its focus was shallow. I would recommend instead &quot;Pregnancy and Birth - Your Questions Answered&quot; by Dr. Karina Reynolds, Dr. Christoph Lees and Grainne McCartan."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"While this book is obviously packed with loads of helpful information, I echo the reviewers who note that there is a decidedly negative tone to the book. After starting to read it, I began scanning ahead, trying to see if the style of the book changed with later pregnancy, but it did not. I became frustrated that the book is styled like an advice column with all topics covered with the assumption that someone out there is worried about it. For example, instead of covering the topic of weight gain (or lack thereof) in several pages, the book first poses the hypothetical question, &quot;I've gained X pounds - should I be concerned?&quot; After addressing that question, it then poses the question, &quot;I have NOT gained X pounds - should I be concerned?&quot; It's as though you everything you experience with pregnancy has the potential to be a concern.I was SO anxious and worried the first few weeks of my pregnancy, and I grasped at every shred of information I could get. Eventually I learned that putting down the books and turning off the computer allowed me to get my brain out of its rut and start concentrating on the fun stuff like perusing lists of names with my husband.It's great to have books around for when you have specific questions, but I don't recommend sitting down to read them cover to cover from week 1.I also found this book to lean towards suggesting that you should abstain from just about everything unnatural. If you are interested in keeping your body medication and chemical free while you are pregnant, more power to you. But if you aren't, be warned that this book will make you feel guilty about every aspirin you've popped or cup of coffee you've drunk."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This book helped and answered many of my questions and problem during my pregnancy, I cant even imagine being pregnant without this book, definitely a MUST BUY for all expected moms"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This book is a must have for expecting mothers, especially the first one. It answers pretty much any question one could have and while it seems like a huge book, it's divided into time periods so it can be read throughout the pregnancy while the information is relevant."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I love this book. It walked me through every stage of my pregnancy and made me feel comfortable asking my doctor questions about things that I had read and about all of the tests and warnings to look out for. I probably would not have known to avoid sushi and yogurt, or anything unpasteurized, such as some organic foods if I had not had this book to guide me. I have kept it as a keepsake and will use it for all of my future pregnancies and I highly recommend it to everyone. Even dads should read it, just so that they can know how the baby is developing and not feel left out."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"Amazon won't allow zero stars it turns out, but that is what this book deserves.When your midwife tells you to throw the book out, then you know it's a bad book. I won't even give it away. This and its companion of what to eat when expecting need to be gotten rid of. This book is a large volume of anxiety and unless you want to be freaked out during your pregnancy, avoid it like the plague. I have no idea how it gets re-published, why it is even in print to begin with. The woman is no authority but acts like she is some sort of expert with a preachy tone and inaccurate information.Please, do yourself and your loved ones, and your future baby a favor and read anything written by Dr. Sears. Even Jill Iovine's Girlfriend's Guide to Pregnancy is way better and entertaining too."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I was very excited when I first found out I was expecting. Then I read this book. I started to become very anxious, because pregnancy was treated as a disease and not a natural life function. The book's focus, tone, and approach is negative and much of the information is undocumented and incorrect. By the time I got to the absolutely ridiculous best bets diet (which would most certainly be extremely unhealthy eating, if followed) I knew this book would undermine my confidence and joy in being pregnant. Like so many others, I refuse to sell it to a used bookstore, regift it. I consider the book to be poisoinous and harmful.I wondered how the book had ever survived any type of peer review, and then I was shocked to learn that Ms. Murkoff is not a health professional. This is a parody of a quote from the book: \\"Wanting ice cream when you know empty calories are a no-no??....nosh on apples and crunchy walnuts instead.\\" The author has made no effort to discern from necessary foods and behaviors to avoid and mistakenly informs readers that feta and brie are \\"don'ts\\" because they're unpasteurized. (Well, not if you buy them in the US, they're not, but that's another matter). I opened the book to the middle while in the bookstore and just so happened to flip to a page that said \\"this book is for you\\" and asked nontraditional families to bear with use of \\"husband\\" or \\"spouse\\" -- and ensured these readers that the shorthand was in no way meant to make them feel disconnected. Yet, nothing in the book lived up to that promise of modern thinking. Unfortunately, this book is not for you, unless you prefer to let unqualified people do your thinking for you."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I was not thrilled when I found out I was pregnant at 21 but I was determined to make the best of it. I was terrified and knew nothing about what I should or shouldn't do while I was pregnant. The night I found out I was pregnant I bought this book and read it cover to cover over the next few days. For someone who knows NOTHING about pregnancy this was an excellent book and I clung to it daily to make sure I knew what to expect next. It really helped answer a lot of my questions and made me a little more confident. I even tried to follow the diet but that sort of didn't happen since you pretty much need to eat the things you WANT during pregancy otherwise you will be a nervous wreck. The best way to manage your diet is to eat a variety of foods, take your prenatal vitamins, and avoid caffiene and excessive amounts of sweets. This book is great when paired with good prenantal care. It is not meant to apply specifically to everyone's individual needs but contains a lot of various scenarios in case you are someone experiencing that problem. I just skipped over the parts that didnt apply to me, no need to give a bad review for extra information, its better to have more information than less I think. You should never use only one source for advice on your pregnancy, there are several other great pregancy books that should be included in your pregnancy library too, some internet sites are helpful too and will give you personalized week by week pregnancy tips. Overall I think this book was a lot of help."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"an absolute must for expecting moms. i read this book constantly and it answered almost all of my questions, as well as all the ones i forgot when at the doctor. BUY IT"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I strongly recommend this book - but READ IT from start to finish (don't jump from subject to subject). WTEWYE was given to me as a gift early in my pregnancy (about 5 weeks in). I started reading from the first chapter and continued to read throughout my pregnancy. While it discuss the \\"worse case\\" it also discussed the \\"best case\\". At the start of each chapter it clearly states that not all women experience the same thing and every woman and every pregnancy is different. I read some negative reviews about this book and I can see how jumping from chapter to chapter or subject to subject could \\"upset\\" some moms-to-be. I will say that I read every word - even the sections that I didn't think applied to me - including the sections on pre-term labor and delivery. And I am sure glad I did - when I went into to labor at 33 weeks I knew what was going on and was prepared for what happened at the hospital and while my son was in the NICU. I know that reading this book helped prepare me for the unexpected. I now have a healthy baby boy at home and received What to Expect the First Year as a shower gift. This too has been a great resource."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I picked up \\"What to Expect\\" the moment I found out I was expecting. At first, I thought I should read it cover-to-cover, and then realized how big it was. That quickly turned into reading the month-by-month scenarios, which gave me a little something to look forward to as I crossed into each month... until I figured out there was a world of websites out there that did the same thing, and they sent it to my email automatically! This book has very little sense of humor, and really is a worst-case-scenario synopsis. I have been using it lately as more of a guide book for a specific question (i.e. can I eat ____, etc.) but then I still turn around and look up the same question on the web. I would recommend Girlfriend's Guide to Pregnancy, or Hello, My Name is Mommy over this book any day! My partner actually asked me, as his nose was in a Dad-To-Be book, what I was learning about how to take care of a baby, and I replied NOTHING! You have to get the next WTE book for that! He then took me to the bookstore to find a replacement. I'd join the website and save your money from the book. Same info a lot cheaper."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This is my first pregnancy at 36 years old. A friend of mine let me borrow this book after I'd already read a whole bunch of Your Pregnancy Week by Week. I like that one much better. I found it an easier read. What to Expect When You're Expecting, is good but the picture of the pregnant lady on the front of this version is scary. This is the one I was lent. She looks tired and sad. I hate that! It make me feel like I will be tired and sad if I read it. I guess they thought she looked peaceful, but I think she is sorry and sad. Too much information for me. I guess I'd already found so much on the Internet and from reading the Week by Week book that I felt like I was having to read too many things that didn't pertain to me. It's organized that way to include all possibilities within each week."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"Let's face it, we've all got our own personal biases when writing these reviews (otherwise, we wouldn't be writing them at all). I admit that while I don't like a lot of things about this book, there were definitely things that I found informative and helpful at the time.When I was given this book, I read it cover to cover over the course of two of three days. Throughout my pregnancy, I rifled through if a question came up that I'd remembered being addressed in this book. I wouldn't necessarily recommend the book (I'm fairly neutral, hence the three star rating), but I wouldn't tell you to throw it out if you've received it as a gift.I'll weigh the pros and cons as I see them and you can make the decision for yourself whether this is the sort of book you are looking for:PROS:* This book addressed a range of different topics, some of which similar books did not address* I personally liked the question/answer format (not the layout itself)* Appendix listing of common tests during pregnancy and what purposes those tests serve is helpful* The Best Odds Diet may be extremely unrealistic, but that doesn't mean the information is useless. It's good to have a general idea of what sort of things you should try to avoid. I have a terrible sweet tooth so I knew I couldn't avoid sweets during my pregnancy, but it is helpful to see what things are best for you and your growing baby.* The &quot;what you may be feeling&quot; section at the beginning of each chapter was informative - it's nice to know you're not the only one going through these crazy bodily changes (and it's nice to show your husband in case yours happens to think you're exaggerating)CONS:* My biggest issue with this book ins't even the content. The layout is terribly hard to follow and you'll spend an eternity trying to find what you are looking for. The index isn't even entirely helpful in locating things in the book* The next biggest issue is the subtle negative tone of the book. I personally didn't take issue with the way in which the information was presented, but I can see how it could easily make any expectant mother anxious, nervous, and down-right paranoid. The intention was probably not to make us feel inadequate, but there is a definite undertone in the book that feeds into that fear.* The book reads like a textbook that you'd rather throw out your window than read for another minute. The wording is stale and uninteresting. I read it because I wanted to know &quot;what to expect&quot;, but I didn't find the reading engaging.All in all, I'd say that there are probably better books out there to act as general pregnancy guides, but I wouldn't toss this one aside completely.If I could've given &quot;What to Expect...&quot; 2.5 stars, I would have, but I gave the book the benefit of the doubt and pushed my rating up to 3."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"A couple people (new parents) actually recommended this book when I found out I was pregnant, but thankfully, it was a waste of my time. Unless you know NOTHING about pregnancy and common-sense nutrition, this book will only list 50,000 questions and outdated answers in a weird format instead of actually teaching you anything.Also avoid this book if you plan on doing a natural home birth.I will be so happy when this is no longer considered the Be All End All Pregnancy Handbook.I recommend, instead, The Whole Pregnancy Handbook : An Obstetrician's Guide to Integrating Conventional and Alternative Medicine Before, During, and After Pregnancy by Joel Evans and Robin Aronson; and Special Delivery by Rahima Baldwin, if you're considering home birth."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I always expected to have this book to refer to when I was pregnant, my aunts used it and my cousins too. I was loaned a copy by a friend as soon as I found out I was pregnant. I was quickly disappointed with what it contained. The pictures were nice, and the one or two sentences about the development, athough they didn't really give me any information I didn't know.What was most disappointing to me was that instead of talking about what is happening and the excitement of it all, every month was filled with pages of what could go wrong. The changes in me and my baby were just a list and the rest of each month was indepth discussions on all the discomforts and problems of being pregnant. I didn't have any of the symptoms or problems she talked about, and the questions I did have were no where to be found. I glanced ahead and found the advice on labor to be less useful than the pregnancy information. So I gave the book back to my friend in my fifth month, it wasn't even worth my bothering to read it anymore. I got better information from the online week by week and month by month guides, and those were free."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I am a pediatrician and expecting my 2nd child. The diet advice in this book is so preachy. When you're sick and or in the throes of a craving the last thing you worry about is sticking to a rigid diet. This book actually made me feel depressed because I ate some McDonald's this morning. If I didn't know better because I am a physician, I would be very fearful that I am harming my baby (which I am NOT). In the edition I have, the one before this one, they actually recommend that a husband signal to his wife if she orders something &quot;unhealthy&quot; in a restaurant. I would hit my husband with a fork if he did such a thing! (not really, but he would regret it.) I sincerely hope they removed this advice from the current addition. The Girlfriend's guide by Vicki Iovine gave me a good laugh and made me feel a lot better about my dietary indiscretions.."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I found this book to be full of impossible and sometimes ridiculous standards that no normal woman could meet. It also has far too much negative and scary information that was just plain upsetting. After three months of anxiety about my pregnancy I mentioned to my doctor how troubling the information in this book was to me. She (also pregnant) agreed completely and added that no doctor in their large practice felt it was a good reference for pregnancy. She advised me to get rid of it, which I did as soon as I got home. I never thought I would destroy a book, but I gained much relief as each page of &quot;What To Expect While You're Expecting&quot; curled into flames! Don't read this book if you have even the slightest anxiety about your pregnancy!"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This is a great book if this is your first pregnancy, and you want to be reassured that whatever your OB tells you is God's Absolute Truth and that all you have to do is trust the men and women in the white coats and they'll take care of you and do what's in your baby's best interest.I read this book with my first pregnancy and ended up allowing myself to be induced early, and had a &quot;perfect&quot; but disappointing birth. Go ahead, buy this book, but also buy Our Bodies Ourselves (or some of the other books recommended), to get the other half of the story. With my second baby I had the courage to wait until she was actually *due* (not when the doctors said she was) and had a *much* more satisfying birth.Doctors and hospitals want you to abide by their rules, which is fine, if you think you want to give up control of what could be the most important event of your life. This book will help you be at ease with this mentality. But please, don't consider this the Bible of how to be pregnant and give birth, because it will come up short."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"There are better books out there. I personally recommend the Unofficial Guide to Having a Baby, which is not nearly as doctor-centered. The authors seem to imply that no educated woman would have a home birth, use a midwife, or do a lot of other things that are known as &quot;alternative&quot; choices. Instead of presenting real facts, they quickly dismiss these options and definitely try to scare the reader into feeling an ob/gyn and hospital birth is the only way to go.I did enjoy the section at the beginning of each chapter that showed what the baby looked like and listed its development for that month. You can also get a newsletter detailing these developments from many baby websites, though, so to me that didn't make it worthwhile to buy the book.I didn't feel particularly guilty after reading the sections on diet (which, by the way, are outrageously difficult to follow and seemed designed for women who can sit at home and make marks on a dietary checklist). However, the part that scared me was reading the &quot;baby roulette&quot; section. I had a migraine for three days and didn't take anything for it because I was afraid it would hurt my baby. Now, looking back, I think the huge amounts of stress hormones that were released in my bloodstream from the pain were probably just as bad as a few Excedrin would've been.In short, this information is available in far more friendly formats in The Unofficial Guide To Having a Baby and The Pregnancy Book by the Sears. I recommend them."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I received WTEWYE as a gift from a friend. All my friends had enjoyed it to one degree or another, plus my OB recommended it. (She did tell me not to read the chapter &quot;When Something Goes Wrong&quot; unless she actually told me I had something going wrong.) So I did not read that chapter and refrained from giving into the temptation to do so.I'll be a first-time mom in 12/99 at age 37 and find the book easy to read, full of answers to common questions and not the least bit condescending. I've been reading each chapter as I enter the corresponding month and like having an idea of what I *may* expect, what my body *may* look like and what my baby looks like.Having common sense, I take what I think will work (some of the Best Odds recipes, not the whole Best Odds diet)and ignore what does not apply to me. No book can be a be-all end-all to me, and that's why this is just ONE of my resources. (I also love V. Iovine's Girlfriend's Guide to Pregnancy, The Everything Guide to Pregnancy and The Nursing Mother's Companion.)I also like the chapter for fathers. My husband is not one to read an entire book, but he got a lot out of that chapter and has been moved to read shorter books like &quot;She's Having a Baby and I'm Having a Meltdown&quot; as a result. He feels more informed and included during the time when the focus has mostly been on me and the baby.Quite frankly, if someone tells me NOT to read a book, I *want* to read it to find out what the freak-out is all about. I must say I don't quite understand the vociferous opposition to this book. As many books do, it has its good points and its weaknesses; if there was something I questioned or felt strange about, I would ask my OB (doula/midwife/healthcare practitioner), check other medical resources and apply my own common sense. If this book doesn't suit your philosophy, that's FINE...don't apply it to your family. But trashing the book doesn't automatically make it worthless to others who may find it--as I have--to be a good source of information, help and reassurance."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"My pregnancy started out a little bumpy, so needless to say I was always worried that something would go wrong. This book did nothing to calm my fears, it only exacerbated them. It made me feel like I could do nothing right, especially my diet. Just about everything I was eating was a \\"no no\\" according to this book, but then to others my diet was fine. I have heard this book called \\"What to FEAR when you're expecting\\" and I could'nt agree with that title more. I now have a wonderful happy 2 year old and I wish I had enjoyed my pregnancy more. There has got to be a better book out there."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"Long Story Short: My husband had to hide this book from me because it was making me so nuts. Just notice the look on the mother-to-be's face on the front cover...that's how the book makes you feel.Long Story: I was given this book by my best friend as a MUST READ as soon as we found out I was pregnant w/ our first child. Immediately I poured through it. It's laid out in sections ala: what to expect each month with a Q&A; format as well as tips. The Index is very through. Sounds good right?Here's the kicker...after reading several chapters I began to get the not-so-subtle undertone: \\"Every move you make will have a direct effect as to whether or not your child will be healthy.\\" The nutritional seciton made me paranoid. Example: \\"As you raise fork to mouth, consider: 'Is this a bite that will benefit my baby?'\\" This book lists just about every medical complication and problem that exists in pregnancy. As a first time mom, I read it frequently to \\"diagonse\\" all of those new pains and wierd things. This book has kept me up at night wondering if I'm suffering from some pretty rare things. This book claims to be \\"reassuring.\\" I have found it to be anything but that. The best source of information you can get while pregnant is from your doctor or midwife. For some extra piece of mind, steer clear from this popular book."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I liked the book in general, it provides good information and i consider it as a reference for the new mom but not the only reference ofcourse, It describes all pregnancy stages and weeks in details and even describes and discusses main pregnancy risks and problems in details, so as new mother you can have very good expectation about you may feel or face in the comming weeks and discuss the labour in details which is sometimes good to know what you may experience. In addition to that the book may help you also after the delivery especailly for the first month after delivery. It was not my only reference during my pregnancy but it was one of the best ones. I recommend the book alos for the father to be to help him better understands the feelings and the fears his wife could have during pregnancy."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I bought this for my daughter and she was thrilled! I heard on Dr. Phil's show that this is the new 'Bible' for pregnant women so I had to buy it. She is reading it as her pregnancy progresses. She says it goes into more detail on all subjects that other books she bought just mention lightly and go on to something else. She loves the depth of coverage on different aspects of pregnancy, what to expect, what is normal/abnormal. It's a GREAT book for the first time expecting mother."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"When I was pregnant 15 years ago I read this book and realized I had the symptoms of Deep Vein Thrombosis. My Obstetrician said I had a pinched nerve, even though my leg was swollen and I could not put my leg down on the floor without agonizing pain. I asked him if it could possibly be a Blood Clot in my leg and after looking at my leg for about 2 seconds he said: \\"No, your leg is fine.\\" I changed obstetricians and told my new dr. about my experience. He sent me to a specialist who sent me for a doppler sonogram of the leg. Diagnosis: Deep Vein Thrombosis. I was then admitted to the hospital for one week and put on IV Heparin. I had had this condition for over a month, and was lucky not to have died from it. So, I have to say this book did help me; I realized the symptoms in the book were spot on in my case and it may have saved my life. I had to take anti-coagulant medication for the rest of the pregnancy (heparin via twice daily injections.)

However, I want to point out to expectant mothers and their mates that pre-eclampsia - a dangerous and surprisingly common condition that befalls pregnant women - is woefully under-emphasized in this text. The book adequately deals with the disease and even lists key facts (including how shockingly common it is), but it does not sound the alarms like it should. Up to 10 percent of first-time moms get pre-eclampsia; my wife did; and it can be a real shock to the system if you've never heard of it and aren't prepared for it."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This book has very useful information!

I just bought a new copy of the revised book and was happy to see it was still around and had a few updated points.The authors have done a good job but I think as an older mom, with this pregnancy ten years later, I wanted to skip straight to the Q and A of things that might crop up. When I discussed this with my doctor, he suggested that I not read this section.His feeling was that if a pregnant mom projects too much on possible upcoming challenges, we can begin to think ourselves right into the problem. This made perfect sense to me, so I stopped trying to find an answer for every little physical pain or discomfort.I have a girlfriend who is also pregnant and she spends her day trying to label each tiny pinch or movement she feels each day. I told her about what the doctor said and think that she too feels better by not looking for answers to what is truly a normal feeling during pregnancy.By accident, we both found a new book that has a chapter on pregnancy and it does go into some areas that most new moms-to-be, or even before getting pregnant, covers. I would suggest using it along with What to Expect -- especially for a more positive outlook: Mom CEO (Chief Everything Officer) - Having, Doing and Surviving It All is incredible and would be perfect for moms wanting to become pregnant and who already are there. It's really the perfect companion for What to Expect and describes how to get prepared for childbirth.Just remember, while emotions run high and low during pregnancy, it's really best to listen to your doctor and to your own body and accept that your pregnancy will not be like everyone else's."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I got this book when I was pregnant with my first child, and now on the fourth, I still turn to it for a quick overview of what to expect this month and how the baby is developing.

And of course the book &quot;What to Expect the First Year&quot; marked with notes from my first child appears shortly before each birth. I am now expecting our third (and LAST) child. I can't applaud this series enough! Every time I read these books I learn something new to assist with the daily tasks of growing, birthing, and raising children. My husband also enjoys reading these books right along with me. He has NEVER felt put down or left out-quite the opposite-the first book helps to explain all of the 'behind the scenes' changes so he better understands what I am going through while I still look 'normal.'I have purchased these books numerous times as gifts for friends and family who are expecting-and I will continue to do so. While these books are NOT all-inclusive, and in no way replace qualified medical advice, they are a great resource for any expectant parents and/or parents of infants!Congratulations to everyone who is reading this review who has just found out they are pregnant--you are in for the best time of your life!"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"Great book! Really Helped me thru nine months of pregnancy and my doctor probably loved it too since I called less frequently than I might if I hadn't had this book. ;-) But, what little information I had abut emergency C-Section did come from this book, yet I was still COMPLETELY unprepared for it. Info on C-section was a little TOO clinical. Like the other sections, a bit about &quot;how it feels, how you feel, etc&quot; would have been helpful. Additionally, saying &quot;you can sit, but your tummy hurts&quot; is the only difference between vaginal and c-section delivery is VERY false and misleading. Assuming that the majority of readers don't need that information is also false. There is other information in the book that is less common, yet addressed more thoroughly.

And while the diet recommended in the book is best taken with a grain of salt, it is a must-have for health-conscious mommies like me who want to do the utmost to ensure their babies are totally healthy. Although I wouldn't make this my only pregnancy book, as it seems more of a general reference and informational guide, it is an important building block for any conscientous expectant parent.

In fact, the only way that I knew I was in labor was from a clue that this book gave me."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"What to Expect has lots of information that I found useful during my pregnancy. I spent a lot of time looking up topics in the index - I almost always found something about the subject I was searching for from heartburn to irritability to fatigue. What to Expect, along with We're Pregnant! (a much more personal account of the whole pregnancy process from both an expecting mom and dad) and She's Having a Baby and I'm Having a Breakdown (an expecting dad's point of view) made for quite a pregnancy book collection and provided me with a wealth of information. I highly recommend all three."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I loved this book for all those inbetween visit questions this is the book to go to. Anything and everything is in this book. The way the book is layed out my husband thought it was a delight everything was easy to find.

Complete with information on choosing a caregiver, prenatal diagnosis, exercise, childbirth options, second pregnancies, twins, making love during pregnancy, having a cesarean and practical tips on coping with common and not-so-common pregnancy symptoms. This is a nonsense book; a great reference and a comforting guide. What to Expect when you are expecting calms women's nerves and provides assurance that everything is going to be fine.

Yes, reading some things in this book, or any pregnancy book, can make anyone nervous but I would like to know what could happen to my body or to my baby along the way. I also want to be careful of what I do so I can have a healthy baby and this book helps me make good decisions.This was the first book I had to have when I found out I was pregnant. I read this book a few years ago when I wasn't pregnant because I had heard such good things about it. I loved it then and I love it now.I am almost 23 weeks along and this book has kept me abreast of the changes going on with my body and it has been so helpful for me.If you want to be well informed about your pregnancy, this book is for you.

Luckly, I found this book from internet, so I bought one immediately. Then I began to know what my wife should feel, what is normal, what is abnormal and what to avoid. Especially in the first two month, it's important for you to have some knowledge of pregnancy before you meet your OB. And I am so surprise that my OB also know this book very well. I think I am a little bit later to get this book (I got this at the fifth week). I would say, if you are planning to get a baby, buy this book now."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This is a really great book, especially for new moms.

If you only get one pregnancy book, then this really isn't the one for you. Although I do find it useful, it's more towards looking up one thing here or another issue there. It's dense and very \\"politically correct\\"."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I wouldn't recommend this book to the obsessive or extremely emotionally fragile. That said, I felt the book was sufficient simply as a reference text, not a pregnancy bible. Some of its info resonated with me, some of it did not, but it's information reassured me for the most part, and when it did not, I sought further information from my doctor."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I had been warned that this book would make me paranoid or anxious about my first pregnancy, but I have found it to be a great tool. The book is complete and thorough and covers almost every topic I've needed during my first pregnancy. You need to have a good attitude througout your pregnancy: Do not let things you read/hear about make you terrified that the same will happen to you. If you have a healthy mindset, What to Expect is an excellent source of information."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I recieved this book as a gift from my mother in-law because I am expecting my first child. Some other reviewers have stated that they found it negative, and that all the information is meant to scare you. Well I did not find that to be the case. I agree that it does describe a lot of different and sometimes very rare pregnancy complications, most of which no one will experience. However, I took that as comforting to know that if I did have any of the weird symtoms that it was probably normal, and NOT a reason to think something was wrong. (I was having nosebleeds every morning but the book said that it is very common) It is a little simplistic though. I would prefer something that came from more of a medical perspective. This book comes off as more \\"friendly advice\\"."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This is a good book that covers your developing pregnancy. It's a biology based book and hence a little dry. I found it best to read one month at a time and to use as reference when I had basic questions."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"After reading some of the reviews for this book, I decided to buy another at the same time in case I disliked it as others had. (That other book was \\"The Mother of all Pregnancy Books\\" by Ann Douglas). This is my first pregnancy so I'm hungry for knowledge, so I began reading both books simultaneously... I have now rejected the other and am sticking with WTEWYE.Both books comprehensively covered all the same information but WTEWYE is written in a clear, sensible style that presents all the information, even scary stuff, in a calm factual manner. On the other hand, the Ann Douglas book kept dropping little fear bombs in the form of chummy asides (what finally made me put it down was the little \\"Did you know?\\" factbox that informed me that I should be glad I have serious morning sickness as women who don't are two to three more times likely to miscarry. Well, I just happen to have very little morning sickness, so not only do I feel excluded but now I have something else to worry about.)Anyway, I just wanted to add my review to the many others here in defense of WTEWYE as I appreciate its tone and presentation of the information."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I am pregnant with my first child. This book has answered all of my questions and I love it! This is a \\"must have\\" in every pregnant woman's library!"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I bought this book with my first pregnancy, since it was recommended by my OB at the time, and since I'd heard it touted as THE essential pregnancy book to read. I found a lot of the information in the book to be incredibly frightening, and just stressed me out even more! The only parts I found to be even somewhat &quot;reassuring&quot; where the sections that tell how big the baby is and what is developing. However, like I said earlier, if you want to be scared to death over what can go wrong then you might just want to pick this book up anyways. I would not recommend this book to any of my friends or family. I only gave it three stars because it is jam-packed with information. However I did not find much of it to be of use. If you want a good pregnancy book, there are plenty of others out there, as some of the other reviewers suggested. Despite its popularity, though, I do not think &quot;What to Expect&quot; is one of them. If you must read it, borrow it from the library or a friend-save your money."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This book is a lifesaver. Keep one handy at all times during pregnancy. Nearly every expectant mom I know used this book because it is so good. Helps also to prepare you for doctor visits by making you more informed and helping you to ask good questions. Great! Also read EFFORTLESS WELLBEING: The Missing Ingredients for Authentic Wellness, by Evan Finer, for an amazing book about overall wellness -- can easily be applied to keeping calm and centered during pregnancy and parenting.... Highly recommended!! Great gifts!"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I found this book to have a lot of useful information, but it starts off very wordy. I read a little bit each night, instead of sitting down and trying to read large sections of the book. I would get bored and forget what I'd read.The Pregnancy DietThere is a recipe section, that if I had the time, may be of some use. However, making cream of tomato soup from scratch is time consuming and more expensive that buying the can and adding milk. All of the recipes in that section need to be made from scratch, even the French fries, not a practical suggestion for someone who has a job.Part 2 - Nine Months &amp; CountingThe Question &amp; Answer format was really helpful. Most of the questions give you about half a page of really useful information, with facts, but not overstating the answer to the question presented.Part 3From postpartum to breastfeeding to Daddy, the section mixes the Q &amp; A format with the informational format from the 1st section of the book. This section is very useful for understand your postpartum 1-6 weeks and tips for breastfeeding holds. The &quot;Expectant Father&quot; section is in the Q &amp; A format, and may have some things that Mommy hasn't realized about Daddy. You're husband or partner may not read the whole book, but is 1 chapter really gonna hurt him?Part 4 - Special ConcernsThis was something that had never even crossed my mind until I read this book. From common colds to measles, as well as how to deal with symptoms of illness. &quot;I have a fever, should I take aspirin?&quot; and a bunch of other questions like that. It is an informative section that some may not even think about when they are expecting.Pregnancy Notes sectionI think that this is a very creative section because you have 2 pages to write down your personal notes for each month. The book also suggests that you show the notes to your doctor, so they know what's going on, since they can't be with you 24/7."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"Good book to calm your worries. A go-to guide for pregnancy. Highly recommended addition to your baby book collection."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"Heidi Murkoff uses humor and reality to inform women about the trials and joys of pregnancy. This book is great because it breaks down the symptoms felt by months in which you are most likely to have the problems. The book is written in a question answer format so you can easily skip over the information that doesn't apply to you or indulge in the information if you have the time. This book helps you to understand why you go through so many pregancy symptoms and helps you to remedy the problems and helps you know when to call your midwife/doctor. What to Expect: The First Year is also an outstanding book."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This has been a great resource for my daughter as she went through her 9 months of pregnancy"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"excellent book, a lot of information and even better if you get it before or right when you get pregnant."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I bought What to Expect When You're Expecting back in the mid 80's when it first came out. At the time, I just picked it off the bookstore shelf, not knowing anything about it. It proved invaluable for me.Over the next decade or so, I added dozens of pregnancy books to my library. I also gave birth to six beautiful children. I must say, out of ALL my pregnancy books, What to Expect When You're Expecting is still my #1 all-time, can't-live-without, favorite pregnancy book.If you're not sure whether to get it or not, read all the five star ratings. Then read all the one star ratings. Then take the word of a friend who actually used the book for more than one pregnancy. Each pregnancy is different. I had two induced births, two normal births, and two home births. What to Expect When You're Expecting is filled with practical advice no matter what kind of pregnancy you are experiencing. The reason it is so popular is because it's actually a great book."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"The book is not as I expected, I heard alot about it therefore I thought it was much more than that. It's a good one though, I give it a 3."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"The book has a lot of information very useful, especially because it is my first pregnancy.

I love the section for future dads, too!"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I am amazed at the number of degrating reviews this book has received. I bought this book while I was pregnant with my SECOND child and it became my bible. Yes, it can instill some unnecessary fear, but that is the price you pay for knowledge...the more you know, the less you have to wonder. I relied on this book as an alternative to asking my doctor about every little question I had. I also had a high risk pregnancy and this book provided me with information I would not have known otherwise. Just ask yourself this, would you like the facts to be sugar coated or do you want the cold hard truth? If you answered- the cold hard truth, then you want this book.I can tell you that there is nothing bubble gum about having a baby, and you need to be informed, whether this is your first or your fifth. Each pregnancy is different, as is each woman, and the more facts you know, then the healthier your child will be. I only wish that I had this book to refer to when I was young and pregnant with my first and suffering from Toxemia. I was naive and unaware that anything was wrong. Had I owned this book, alot of unnecessary complications could have been avoided; I would have been aware of the situation at hand and informed on how to correct it. I recommend this book based exclusively on its educational purpose."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"Whatever you do, don't read it cover to cover. You'll be paralyzed with fear. However, it's good when you feel a pain, or have a rash, or anything else that makes you panic, because you can easily find your symptom, and see the benign problems that could be causing it. However, it also mentions several terrifying conditions that have that symptom, so be sure to keep in mind that it mentions many incredibly rare diseases."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"The book lacks an easily accessible organization and a wholesome approach--apart from being flawed and, in many places, plain wrong. You may, for instance, have symptoms in the second month that only show up in the book's fifth or sixth month; so the month-by-month approach this book takes (and which had attracted me to it) turns out to be of no use at all and even quite disorienting. It also concentrates on all kinds of problems--some of them rather silly, others rather exotic medical conditions. The result is that you feel sick and silly after reading the book, not more informed and more in control of your life and able to make good choices.One of the books erroneous presumptions is that the only safe place to have a baby is the United States of America. Never mind the greater availability of organic food, the huge variety of wholegrain products, the stricter environmental standards and the free health care in most European states. Before you follow the book's advice and only frequent \\"American restaurants\\" to avoid all those empty starches and greasy foods, ask yourself, why such a great percentage of Americans are overweight and obese and Europeans are not. For authors, there is no excuse for assuming such blatant ignorance in their readership."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This book should be burned and never reprinted. If you ever get this for a shower present, gracefully accept and then burn it! The info in this book tries to undermine the natural ability of women to give birth and plays into the fear factor of first time moms. It doesn't even begin to address the rising c-section rate and how each intervention brings on a higher risk of fetal death and c-section. Not to mention drug use! It tells you that you can't have drugs during pregnancy, but have a back cocktail while in labor to drug not only you but your baby. If you are not scared of your body and you believe in it's strength and power to not only grow your baby inside you but birth it as well, then don't even touch this book."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I read this book and found it mediocre at best. I don't even have any kids and I already knew everything in it. It covers basics that I consider to be common sense. I could have just talked with any mother (or a decent doctor) for half an hour to cover everything in the book, it's practically useless unless you are absolutely clueless and don't know anyone who has had a child that you can talk with."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"Someone bought me this book 10 years ago when I was expecting my first child, and it was priceless! Month-by-month everything is explained from what changes to expect in your body, to what is happening with your baby. The frequently asked questions/answers were soooooooo helpful. I passed this book on to a pregnant friend when I was done. But when my husband and I decided to have another baby I immediately bought another copy. It is the pregnant woman's bible to all things baby!"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This is the book you need to answer all those embarrassing questions. AND, stuff you didn't even think about. You will be so happy you got it. I highly highly highly recommend!"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This book helped me through my first pregnancy. I had a lot of questions and this book answered all of them and brought up a few issues that I never thought about. I recommend it to anyone who is pregnant or planning to have a baby.This book didn't make me paranoid it kept me informed."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I also feel compelled to come to the defense of this excellent book. Pregnancy is a time of enormous and sometimes mysterious changes in your body. Every time I look up a particular symptom in What to Expect, I find that it is a. included and b. normal. I had originally purchased another book that I thought would be more \\"with it\\" and interesting to read, only to find that it was poorly organized (you don't need ALL the information at once--breaking it down into monthly chunks is a much less overwhelming approach) and didn't adequately address my concerns. For example, when I was about 8 weeks pregnant I was convinced that I had somehow had a miscarriage without knowing it. I picked up What to Expect and soon flipped to the page that assured me it was extremely rare to miscarry without any associated symptoms. Most people worry somewhat during their pregnancies, but I found this book to be a calm source of information and support, easing my fears rather than fueling them."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I've recommended this book to friends only to have other friends say, \\"No way! It's condescending and scary!!!\\", but I guess it all depends on the reader.I consider myself a worrier...but this book didn't worry me much. The book is literally packed with great information. It contains a very helpful section (near the back of the book and totallly avoidable if you don't wish to read it) about when things go wrong with your pregnancy, which is what I'm guessing has scared some people. Myself, I found it useful quite a few times. Hey, you never know what might happen, but it's always wise to be prepared. Don't NOT buy this book because you heard it was scary. The \\"scary\\" part is in the back...and only refer to it if you need it, which you probably won't. I needed it... and I was very glad it was there in my time of need. It gives you the 'Worst Case Scenerio' but if you, like me, become addicted to the scary pregnancy shows on the Discovery Health Channel...then relax! You've already probably seen far worse.The rest of the book, however, has all the necessary information and is very well-organized. Just about everything you need is in here. I would love it if this book included a section about your baby's development week-by-week, but it doesn't. You also won't find pictures of what your baby might look like in the womb enclosed...I had to buy another book for that also (It was my first baby...and I was infinitely curious!). If it had those two things, I wouldn't feel like I needed any other books.I did feel like the section on eating right during pregnancy was a little far-fetched. It makes those of us who don't eat a 110% strict healthy diet feel like crap. I was all worried that my baby would turn out deformed because I ate a Dorito. That was the only part that truly scared me. It turns out, everything was fine. I was fine. My baby was healthy even if I didn't follow a strict tofu & veggie diet. I did the best I could.This definitely is one of the books I would consider a pregnancy bible. I'd advise you to buy more than one and compare notes and decide for yourself on some of the 'Iffy' issues. Out of all the pregnacy books I own (and I own a lot), I would say this one has been the most helpful and the one I'd refer to the most, even if it came across as being a little preachy at times. I still consider it a tried-and-true classic."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I'm a first-time pregnant mom, and have bought a number of books to figure out what's what in pregnancy. I bought this book along with some others, and also bought What to Expect pregnancy nutrition/diet book. After looking at the nutrition book, I disliked it so much that I returned it the next day. This book I have kept, reluctantly. I find the structure, pedantic tone, perfectionist attitude, and the entire book irritating. I thought it was THE book to get before becoming pregnant, but now I think it's the book NOT to get. I've no idea why people like it so much. It is organized in a very frustrating way so that you have to look up everything in the index. For example, swelling of the feet (which of course the author must call by its medical term, \\"edema,\\" which I did not know to look for) is found inside one of the months of pregnancy. The sections on nutrition are the most annoying of all. I feel as if the author is one of those \\"perfect\\" people who does not live in the real world with real people, and expects that \\"every bite must count\\" is a reasonable thing to write. Intelligent women can make reasonable choices about nutrition, of course, trying to eat in a healthy way. I also think the book is alarmist in nature, pointing out every possible problem one can have.I can't zero in on what it is exactly, but I just dislike this book. I have enjoyed The Mayo Clinic Guide to a Healthy Pregnancy much more, and have recently ordered the Sears book after having it recommended."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"Yes, the other reviews are correct: This book will most likely cause you to panic, worry, and lose sleep for nine months. It's filled with information, and chances are, you'll find that both good and bad. It's good, because a lot of the handy tips will help you (and your significant other) in a difficult, stressful time; it's bad, because a lot of the material here will only cause you to think, 'great, something else to worry about.' But here's the rub: In today's health care system, where your OB is under all sorts of pressure (from insurers, and from his or her own pocketbook) to spend as little time with patients as possible, this BOOK -- and not your doctor -- may, sadly, become your main source of information. My wife and I used an OB that was highly recommended and practiced at a major metropolitan teaching hospital. And, indeed, she was proabaly an excellent technical doctor. But like all too many doctors, she seemed to dread every little question we had as would-be first-time parents. She was so put out, we stopped asking the questions, which is the worst thing any patient can do. We had already put her out enough. Eight months into the pregancy, at a time when expectant parents are most anxious, worrying that every pain, movement, or contraction is cause for alarm, our OB was telling us when NOT to call her. Two weeks later, when my wife just didn't feel right, we hesitated to call, figuring we'd only upset the doctor over nothing. Fortunately, my wife went with her gut, pulled out this book, and discovered that what she was experiencing WAS cause for alarm (almost as alarming: This was something our doctor had NEVER warned us about). It was a Sunday night, we called the OB's service, and were connected with the doctor on call -- not our regular OB. He had us come into the hospital. Within a minute of hooking my wife up to a fetal monitor, the triage nurse was sounding alarms and had about a dozen doctors and nurses in the room. The baby's heartrate was dropping, and my wife was rushed into surgery for an emergency caesarian. The OB on call told us that if we had waited another hour, 'there wouldn't have been a happy ending.' Our daughter was born that evening, alert and healthy -- all because a book told us something our doctor never did. So, yes, I will recommend this often annoying and anxiety-inducing tome."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This book was lent to me by a friend a few weeks before I found out I was pregnant. I have always assumed that it was THE book women read when they are expecting, and it seems to be, but this book is certainly not for me.I found that each time I picked it up I discovered some new way that my unborn baby could be damaged or even killed. There seems to be an unbalanced focus on scarring the living daylights out of new moms-to-be. I realize that there are many things that can go wrong in a pregnancy, but it doesn't seem like women (or their men) need this pointed out at every turn. It was enough to make me crazy, I stopped reading it before I got to the third month. My husband agreed that this book was doing me more harm than good.I also felt that the writers of the book were sending the message that once you become pregnant, the rest of your life stops mattering, you are no longer a person or a woman so much as you are an incubator for your baby. I am thrilled to be pregnant, and take pride in taking excellent care of myself for the baby, but I don't need this crap!If you are looking for information on the developmental stages your baby is going through, I suggest getting info from you doctor, or even a medical textbook. If you are looking for a less judgmental (and less terrifying) guide to pregnancy, try Vicki Iovine's Girlfriends' Guide to Pregnancy. It's funny, informative and down-to earth."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I am truly irritated with this book, and I love books. I bought it because EVERYBODY says to, but I submit that the Pregnancy Journal (which gives a day-by-day account) is much better written, less scary, and more organized.My BIGGEST problem is that at least one topic in the index is mislabeled, leaving me leafing through the entire book and coming up with nothing. I find that HIGHLY unnacceptable after THREE DIFFERENT REVISIONS to the text have been made. They're making money, but they don't seem to care about their product being organized well.Also, you can't turn a page without being assaulted by talk of death, either with the baby or yourself. Who needs to read junk like that when they're feeling kinda emotionally drained anyway? They should have a section where they deal with the worst of the negative stuff so that readers aren't assaulted with negativity on every page. The page that dealt with hiccups (supposedly)actually talked about how the umbilical cord could fall out of you. Yeah, that's just lovely.TERRIBLY DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS BOOK."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"When we were pregnant with our first, we went and purchased what seems like a truckload of books on pregnancy- books for moms, books for dads, books for both, etc. I wasn't disappointed with this book, as it does provide a lot of information, but I haven't looked at it since our first baby. We are now on baby #3 and the books that I still refer to are \\"Your Pregnancy Week by Week\\" and \\"The Girfriend's Guide to Pregnancy\\". These two combined provide the same basic info as WTEWYE, but also provide more information on mom (TGGTP) and on the weekly growth of baby (YPWBW). I wouldn't necessarily NOT get \\"What to Expect...\\", as it does have a lot of information in it, but the nature of most of its info is such that the book is non-essential for rounds 2 and above."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"When I was pregnant with my first child, I picked up nearly every book on the bookstore shelves having to do with pregnancy and childbirth. I wanted comfort, a friend in the form of a book, a companion to hold my hand and let me know everything was going to be okay.This book was not that friend.Instead, everytime I read this book, I found myself getting more and more agitated. It exposed me to almost TOO much information, verging on the point of overload. You know how medical students become convinced they have every wacky and rare disease they learn about in med school? That's how I felt when I read this book. After each chapter, I became convinced my child had Downs Syndrome, that I had placenta previa, that I was suffering from gestational diabetes, etc., etc.Now that I have three children, I feel like I'm in the position to make a recommendation -- get this book if you must, but don't read it cover to cover. Use it as a resource if one of the other books you read (I suggest \\"The Mother of All Pregnancy Books\\" by Ann Douglas) leaves you wanting more information.By the way, I didn't follow the \\"Best Odds Diet\\" and my kids still turned out fine. :)"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I bought this book for my then-expecting wife about two years ago. At first, I thought the book was \\"OK.\\" But as time passed and I perused through it, I realized that most of the information is in \\"bits\\" with little substance and the depth is lacking. It looks more like a compilation of obstetricians' scientific journal articles than a real guide for pregnancy. Then there's the seeming condescending and feel-good voice of the authors. One thing is trying to be sensitive to the expectant mother another is to patronize her. I have no idea how has this book become so well known, but I really discourage anyone from spending their money in this primer. I highly suggest getting a different book. A real book, not this patchwork."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"It seems as if the author expects every pregnant woman to abide by strict standards in order to have a healthy baby. Yes, if a woman is carrying a baby, she should be extra careful, but this is ridiculous. Women have odd cravings sometimes, and sometimes, they can only keep down certain foods, even if those foods are not completely healthy. This book made me very stressed out while I was pregnant. She made me feel as if I was going to have a deformed child if I did not adhere to a strict diet. But, thank you, my son was perfectly healthy, and my diet was less than perfect. If you must get this book, buy it used or borrow it."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"Like many people, I bought this book at the beginning of my pregnancy because I had vaguely remembered seeing the book before and assuming it must be pretty good.Unfortunately, even though this book has gone through multiple editions, the information and tone of the book has changed little. I figured this out by reading other books, and while the information in the book was fairly progressive in the early 80's when it was originally written, many changes have taken place in ob/gyn practice and pregnancy care since then so many things are outdated.The diet and weigth gain information in particular is unrealistic (the most recent edition has revised this info. so it may be more realistic than it was in the past.) There is no need to eat solely whole grains - folic acid supplements are commonplace in cereals and white grains and have been used since 1998. Also there is no correlation between many pregnancy complications and eating habits/weight gain (with gestational diabetes being one major exception), which the book implies in some of the question and answer sections. The hormones of pregnancy play a MUCH bigger factor in the development of pregnancy complications, which makes sense when you think about how dramatically the levels are changing in your body. Most of this information is either in the medical literature or inferred through it so it is troubling that the authors are ignoring the facts and resorting to finger-wagging and scare tactics for mothers-to-be.Also the delivery section seems outdated but since I haven't delivered yet I don't have any first-hand experience. There is little to no mention of doulas or other &quot;alternative&quot; birthing procedures which are available and offered at the hospital where I'm due to deliver!I would recommend a more recently updated pregnancy guide which has more information on alternative birthing methods and de-emphasizes diet and weight gain issues. The book supplied by my OB/GYN's office which is put out by the Association of OB/GYNs (it has a pink background cover) was the best overall source I read. There was MUCH more balanced and non-judgemental information presented, and gave more realistic information I have used throughout my pregnancy so far."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"It is insulting to any woman with the ability to think for herself. Between the patronizing 'doctor knows best' tone and the advice that you should measure your thighs when you find out you're pregnant so you can make sure they don't expand - it's ridiculous. It hardly addresses any other birthing options, aside from medicated hospital births. Anything outside of the norm is regarded as dangerous to the mother and the baby.This is a horribly disgusting book that does nothing more than scare or guilt a newly expectant mother into submission."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I am a doula and I always get worried when someone tells me they are reading this book. It makes you afraid of being pregnant. The diet they ask you to follow is nearly impossible. I think this book makes you fearful and guilty. I highly recommend Dr. Sears' books on pregnancy and childbirth"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"When I got pregnant, my husband's cousin gave us this book and said, \\"take everything in it with a grain of salt\\". She was right. After reading through the first two chapters, I put the book away and only read the developmental milestones each month. This book is packed with \\"things that may go wrong\\", that you spend the duration between OBGYN visits wondering, \\"could this/that be wrong with my baby?\\". If you buy this book, please follow our cousin's advice and take the information with a grain of salt-but have your OBGYN's number handy, just in case."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This book focuses on basic info, which may be helpful if you are completely clueless about pregnancy, and then focuses on all the probelms that might occur at each stage.The author is also opinionated and critical of diets. Her healthy pregnancy diet recomendations would make almost any woman (pregnant or not) toss the book across the room. I think the title is so catchy and that is why it sells so well. There are many other books which are more informative and more positive as well.I personally liked, \\"Pregnancy, Childbirth, and the Newborn, Revised and Updated : The Complete Guide\\" by Penny Simkin."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I read this book during my first pregnancy. Needless to say, everything in it scared me. I would close the book and begin to cry because I was afraid that everything I felt was a sign I would lose the baby!This book is informative, but it's all based on negativity and worry. It's so clinical that it feels cold, and when it does provide you with symptoms that should make you worry, it's vague. For example, it might tell you that if you have increased bathroom issues to call the doctor right away because it's a sign of a miscarriage. They NEVER ONCE explained that it might be because your hormones are doubling at such a rapid rate for your body that sometimes going to the bathroom a lot is a symptom!My Doctor recommended that I stop reading the book, and read something more friendly, such as The Girlfriend's Guide to Pregnancy by Vicki Iovine. What a difference! She was frank, funny, and actually had a more positive outlook on pregnancy.I would NEVER recommend What to Expect When You're Expecting."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This book does little but defend the medical community in the United States, and scare the living _______ out of expecting mothers. It leaves out very important information about how labor and delivery work physically, thus its explanations of why things are done--like encouraging women to lie on their backs during delivery--are utterly incomplete. They say it's easier for the doctors, failing to mention that it also literally impedes pelvic and tailbone movement, narrowing the the birth canal and making delivery harder. Very incomplete, very medical-oriented, and full of what to be afraid of, rather than what to expect."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I am amazed at how many people think this book is terrible. The diet suggestions are almost impossible for an ordinary human to stick with; but taking them as just suggestions and not an absolute is the best way.Some people felt this book was alarmist and that it made them paranoid. For me, it had the exact opposite effect. Penny Simkin's book, \\"Pregnancy, Childbirth & the Newborn\\" gives an excellent description of the medical aspects of birth, but glosses over the everyday worries and concerns that a woman encounters when something strange starts happening during her pregnancy. (For me, it was nose bleeds. What to Expect talks more about what a woman might feel, what strange and seemingly unrelated symptoms might mean, and when it's time to actually worry.Also, I've had three pregnancies and every single one came with 'complications:' Preterm labor, threatened miscarriage, pre-eclampsia, post-partum hemorrhage, and labor induction for a seriously post-due pregnancy. I hope 99% of women out there never have to go through even one of these or any other of the many potential complications of pregnancy & birth. But if you do, this is the ONLY book I've found that actually describes the condition and what an OB may do to treat it. When I was stuck in the hospital with progressing preterm contractions, this was the only book that got me through those dark hours.It is 'preachy' and old-fashioned, but it wasn't designed to be read straight through from cover to cover. As a guide to what to happens to a woman's body during pregnancy, it is excellent--especially when suplemented with a second or third book."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"The month by month format of this book is of no help. My OB (as most do) calculates by weeks. Also, they start their OB visits at month 1-I did not see my OB until week 9 which is pretty normal-so which OB visit applys when?This book assumes you have a perfect body and perfect pregnancy: it does not have a basis in reality for most women.Buy something else."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I too, like so many others, was completely annoyed by this book. I did enjoy the opening of each monthly chapter where it summarizes the changes that are happening with your baby's growth, but as I read other sources, the information in this book doesn't even seem to be accurate.I only read up to the 4th month, skipping over much of it, and from what I read, the whole tone of the book is very one-sided. Options are rarely presented, and you are only given one choice, the author's choice, in most situations. A lot of the text seems full of elitism and snobbery, as if the author is telling you \\"You must do it my way because it is the best way.\\" It speaks to you like you are an idiot that can do no thinking for yourself.Also, you often feel like you are being lectured and made to feel afraid of being pregnant. The author makes it seem like pregnancy is a terrifying experience in which you should walk on eggshells for 9 months. It doesn't make you feel happy and excited about this magical time, it does just the opposite. It has the potential to depress you, frighten you, and make you second-guess everything you thought you knew about being a mother.You are much better off talking to your friends and family and learning their experiences. Chances are, they or someone they know has experienced whatever it is that may have you concerned. And if not, that's why you have a doctor that invites you to call anytime you need something. Take advantage of that offer if you're ever scared. You'll feel much better than had you opened this book to find your answers.This book also portrays strangers who, upon seeing that you are pregnant, come up and talk to you in a store or on the street as nosy and mean-spirited. This is my first child, and I was surprised to see how many people come up to me with smiling faces and ask me how I am doing. That doesn't tick me off, as the author suggests it should. My heart is warmed by this. It is usually a woman with her own child in her arms, or who is expecting herself. I take the opportunity to get advice and have a nice conversation with a kind person. And I have never had anyone come up to me and touch my belly. This book suggests that it's inevitable and that in retaliation you should touch that person's belly right back. That's mature! What a great start to teaching your child the ways of life. \\"If someone does something you don't like, just do it right back!\\" I'm sorry, but that is not how I live my life and not how I will raise my baby to live hers.Aside from the general tone of the book, one part in particular really bothered me. It was in the 4th month with a question from a \\"mother-to-be\\" about whether or not it was normal to feel \\"antagonistic\\" toward her and her husband's PLANNED but unborn child. The author's response was that it is completely normal to have negative feelings toward your child, and refers to the child as an \\"intruder\\" that is \\"depriving\\" you of the things you enjoy.Call me crazy, but I can't be the only mother who thinks this is completely ridiculous. I found out I was pregnant at 6 weeks. At that exact moment, my whole life changed. The purpose of my life changed, for the better! Where previously I was living a life in which I could afford to indulge myself and my husband in whatever we desired, suddenly my perspective did a complete 180, and I haven't had a single thought of myself since that day.Everything is about our baby, and what we can do to make our baby's life as full and joyous as possible. And I know I'm not the only one. To suggest that it's ok to think of my baby as an \\"intruder\\" that is stealing my freedom is insane. A mother who loves and wants her baby will not have those thoughts. The book should read that if you are having these feelings at this point in your pregnancy, you should talk to someone and not just go on hating your baby because it's \\"normal\\". Give me a break!Go ahead and read it if you must, but be warned, it is EXTREMELY one-sided and narrow-minded, and geared at women who need some \\"authority figure\\" to make all her decisions for her."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This book is horrid! It sickens me. I think I was around 5 months along when I noticed to my horror that my thighs were growing thicker. The book says to diet when this happens which is absolutely INSANE! I quit smoking when I found out I was pregnant and also had GD so I ended up being *70 lbs* over my pre-pregnancy weight when I gave birth. Fortunately the book was in the TRASH by month 6. I did, unfortuantely, read it cover to cover and I noticed the following themes:-Pregnant women must learn how to be good patients and never question anything their docs tell them. Doctor=GOD.-TEE HE HEE! Here's a nifty little ~for explectant fathers section **gag**~-Eat bizarre quantities of stuff, never indulge, and become neurotic as humanly possible because it's your sexiness that is always the most important thing.-Birth is a medical procedure.And I saw no mention (or merely a silly side note) of:-Same sex partners as parents-single moms-home births or birth centers-HIV and pregnancy-coping with pain without epidurals-refusing vaccinations-midwives-insanely high cesarian rate in most hospitals (30%)-doulas-water birthing-herbsStupid book. It is perfect if you are insipid. Otherwise do yourself a favor and buy something that wont patronise you and dismis your unique circumstances. Every birth is different. Every pregnancy is different. The only thing that you can be sure of through all of this is your own instincts and your support network. Remember this process is natural and works best when you are relaxed and happy. Try Dr. Sears's pregnancy book. And for heck's sake DO NOT MEASURE YOUR THIGHS!"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"OK, this was a little better than it's counterpart \\"what to eat..\\" which I swear was written by sado-masochists, but it still wasn't great. It does have some informative information that has come in helpful to me, although I will admit I haven't used the book very much. Two negative aspects of this book are as follows: #1, it is CONDESCENDING! I don't know whether the author really felt this way, but the impression I got was that everything SHE ever did during her pregnancy was perfect and should be copied by all others, and anything she avoided during her pregnancy was evil and anyone who does it is a failure. Personally, I don't need to be made to feel like a failure for enjoyng Carvel ice cream or continuing to excercize during my pregnancy. Caution #2, ladies, DO NOT let your spouse read this. Mine got a hold of it and read the section on sex and refused to touch me for a week because he was convinced that \\"somthing bad\\" might be going on down there. Bottom line, it's not all bad, but it could be lots better and lots less judgmental."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This book is passable at best. As far as a broad overview of pregnancy, it has merit, and I really liked the month-by-month format, particularly the listings of what the mother may be experiencing physically and emotionally. On the other hand, the book is too general for many mothers who will want all the facts about what's happening to them and their babies. The book had the annoying combination of being medically vague while maintaining a clinical, detached tone. Furthermore, the question and answer style of the book wasn't very helpful; it would have been easier to follow with a better method of categorization, although I admit it did have a good index.Most women will find the Best Odds Diet unrealistic, if not impossible. I must say, though, that I followed it as closely as possible because it was excellent for managing an insulin disorder I have. Mothers with gestational diabetes would do very well with the Best Odds Diet also. It's nutritionally balanced and certainly would be good for mother and baby. The problem is that it doesn't allow for any indulgence, and some older editions of the book even provide advice for dads on how to correct wives who commit the cardinal sin of ordering breaded/fried chicken in a restaurant--horrors!For many mothers, the most offensive aspect of this book is that it implies that mothers should meekly agree to whatever the doctor, nurses, and hospital policy dictates. Those who believe in natural childbirth and minimal intervention will be disappointed by the brief section on medication-free labor/delivery; furthermore, the different methods of handling natural childbirth are not explored. Instead, the greater focus is on drugs and epidural, along with induction and c-sections. The authors fail to mention how frequently epidurals make c-sections necessary, since they often stall labor. One gathers that mothers are expected to be submissive, quiet patients who will accept whatever drugs the medical staff offers. I think the authors do a disservice to mothers in failing to adequately explain all the various methods of delivery available to mothers today.That being said, I recommend Henci Goer's \\"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth\\" for an intelligent alternative!"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This book has a reputation that precedes it. Being around for so many years, many think that it is THE AUTHORITY on what to expect when you're expecting. While it may have been true when it first came out, I felt this book took the joy and excitement out of pregnancy. As many other reviewers commented, it scares you unecessarily with things that can go wrong, gives a &quot;martial law&quot; diet that they term a &quot;best-odds&quot; diet, and basically instructs you in an almost guilt-inducing manner with every single aspect of pregnancy. While this guidance may be welcome to those who are on their first pregnancy and are anxious about it ( just as I am ), I found their style and tone to be remniscent of that of the &quot;church lady&quot; from Saturday Night Live! And that cover picuture! That should clue you in on the frame of mind these people are writing from.I gave the book 2 stars as there are SOME parts that are helpful, as in the general information. But when it comes do the rigid details in how to do everything from your best odds diet, to the 1970s exercises, to how to stand while you are in the kitchen cooking, it just didn't appeal to me. I believe there are far more updated, positive books out there &quot;The Girlfriends Guide to Pregnancy&quot; By Vicki Iovine, while it not may be a medically based book filled with photos of your uterus at so many months, it is a humorous, and HONEST book of what really to expect. I felt more in touch with that style of writing, it was simply more updated and refreshing.There are so many pregnancy books out there today. Skip over this outdated &quot;favorite&quot; and dip into something more millenium and something more likely relatable to you. If you still feel compelled to buy this book, buy it USED. Don't waste your money on a mint copy like I did, you'll regret it!"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I have read this and countless other books on the subject of pregnancy. The title alone is scary. No book can tell you what to expect. A book can merely be a guide and this is not the book I would recmmend to guide you through yor pregnancy. The nutritional information is lacking at best. What really smacked me in the face was the sentence that describes giving birth with epidural anesthesia as a form &quot;natural&quot; childbirth. Need I say more? This book is way off the mark. Too many women leave most of the very important decisions during pregnancy and childbirth to a virtual or complete stranger(their doctor)this book only encourages that cow-like behavior. Real information about pregnancy and childbirth that can make women the educated consumers they should be is out there and it's not hard to find. Just look past the cheesy displays of this book. Do yourself and your baby a favor, buy The Thinking Womans Guide to a Better Birth by Henci Goer. For the intelligent woman the title says it all."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This book revolutionized pregnancy manuals the same way that USA Today revolutionized the newspaper industry: by creating pages full of graphics instead of text. The pages are even organized into columns to encourage readers to feel that they are looking at a magazine rather than a book. Ten years ago, it was the only pregnancy book that looked like this but now most of them do. The problem is, alot of people who don't consider themselves 'good readers would buy this book and be intimidated by the authors' incredibly preachy tone!The main problem is that the authors do not have alot of compassion. If you are disappointed or even heartbroken by something that happens during the course of your pregnancy or childbirth than the only words of comfort you will find here is to &quot;grow up and be happy&quot; that you have a healthy baby.If you want to breastfeed in church, well, they must be praying to the God who invented formula companies because they don't think it is appropriate.If you want to eat comfort food every once in a while STAY FAR AWAY from this book because you will feel very guilty and paranoid about that decision! And remember the words of Katherine Hepburn, &quot;A pregnant woman needs a good piece of chocolate every day&quot;.Please, treat yourself to anything by Sheila Kitzinger, Elizabeth Noble, Robin Lim, or the Sears' instead of this!!"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"While I agree with several of the other reviews regarding the information on diet, overall this was a _very_ helpful and above all reassuring resource. This is my first pregnancy. When I experienced something strange, it was easy to look in the book, find a description of what was going on and discover whether or not it was normal or I should be worried. By reading a little ahead (as I imagine most nervous first-timers do!) I was able to be prepared for many changes I would otherwise never have expected.Throughout the book, the authors remind you that each person and pregnancy is different and that you may experience different things at different times. To me, this meant you should read ahead and use this as a guide to what may happen but when in doubt, call the doctor.Overall, this was very helpful in preparing for the changes and also in helping relieve much of the stress of not-knowing-enough that I experienced. Instead of calling the doctor's office every 5 minutes, I was able to get general answers that helped a great deal!"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"Wow. Having just finished reading most of the other reviews I must say I am extremely happy to find that I am not the only one who thought the &quot;Best Odds Diet&quot; was completely unreasonable. I bought the &quot;What to Expect/What to Eat&quot; books in the one volume. Of course, I read the What to Expect section first and by the time I got to the What to Eat section I was so evangelistic about the whole thing, despite it being my second baby and previously thinking I pretty much knew what I was doing. I started to panic about what I WASN'T giving my child in terms of nutrition (I was about 10 weeks pregnant at this stage)that I actually spent a weekend typing up the recipes included in What to Eat and taping them to the fridge. I also typed out the Foods To Avoid passage and the Daily Dozen Passages and went about religiously planning out my first weeks' menu of the &quot;Best Odds Diet&quot;, including itemising every single portion of food and writing down &quot;what it could offer my child&quot; I even wrote down the &quot;Is this forkful the best thing I can give to my baby...&quot; quote and carried it around with me to remind me of the evils of white bread over wholegrain. In short, I was the biggest fool ever.I lasted one day. And the rest is history. I put the book away and came up with my own healthy eating plan. I didn't consult a doctor/nutritionist etc...I just planned a simple breakfast/lunch/dinner/snacks combination which included mostly chicken and beef, some brown bread, lots of dairy and fruit and vegetables. And the best thing of all, is that what I figured out myself after I finally discounted most of what I'd read in What to Eat has worked out much better for me (and, I don't doubt for a second, my baby).Bottom line is this: Read both books and promptly forget about 75% of what you read. To be fair, the book is a good &quot;reference&quot; and offers some good nutritional tips - but IN GENERAL. If, like me, you are struggling with the &quot;one yellow, one green, and one raw&quot; or the &quot;sprinkle wheat germ on everything&quot; rules (and they DO seem like rules), forget about the book and read something else, like Sheila Kitzinger's &quot;The New Pregnancy and Childbirth&quot;, which I found much more &quot;woman-oriented&quot;."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"Pregnancy and Birth are completely natural. This book treats you like a patient instead of a woman. While this book mentions most everything that can cause concern in pregnancy, and has symptoms that you can check out, its advice is not very practical or in-depth. It is convenient to refer to for complications and other side effects of pregnancy.The Diet is a joke. The section on morning sickness is a joke. The information on giving birth is sketchy at best. This book is slanted for those who give the responsibility of their care completely into the hands of the doctors instead of for those who want to research everything and find a doctor or midwife who suits them.I shudder at all the reviews that call this the Pregnancy Bible. There are many better books out there that encourage you to be a full participant in your pregnancy care and that describe labor fully so that it is no longer frightening."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I believe many people pick up and buy this book because it happens to have the best title. I also suspect those who gave it 5 stars have not read many other books about pregnancy. Unfortunately, I too bought this book and &quot;What to Expect the First Year&quot; because of the clever titles and nice cover designs.I would instead suggest books like The Pregnancy Book, The Birth Book, and the Baby Book by William Sears. Or Natural Birth the Bradley Way. Also, Spiritual Midwifery, which is the best to build confidence for a natural birth.&quot;What to Expect&quot; implies that &quot;your doctor will tell you if you need drugs during delivery&quot;, and that you have very little control and few choices. Books like the Searses, Natural Birth the Bradley Way, or A Good Birth, A Safe Birth, on the other hand, try to inform you of your choices and the downsides of certain procedures. For example, there are several advantages to not using an IV or being strapped to a EFM for the entire labor. Also, a doula (birth assistant) can be a great help to women, and I don't think WTEWYE covers this. There is little or no coverage of birth plans, birth centers, midwives, or lactation consultants. If you want to know how to better your chances of giving birth without an epiosiotomy or drugs, or of breastfeeding successfully, WTEWYE is not the book to buy.I felt the authors' opinions on co-sleeping with your baby and breastfeeding for more than a year were misinformed and outdated.Because of this book's incredible popularity with new mothers, I feel it is a real impediment to progress in educating mothers about their choices and about breastfeeding. From reading this book alone, expectant moms wouldn't know that they have the option to: write a birth plan, hire a doula, not allow their baby to be taken to the nursery (unless an emergency), not allow the baby to be given sugar water, sleep with their baby in the hospital with a note from their pediatrician, not wear an IV or EFM continually in labor (unless risk factors warrant it), drink water or juice during labor (and eat during early labor), labor or deliver out of bed if desired (in normal births), etc..I recommend books by authors who love and find beauty and joy in the cycle of birth, motherhood, nursing, etc.. because they focus on the positive and get one very psyched up, even for labor. In contrast, WTEWYE is cold, clinical, and devoid of joy. It describes birth as a medical procedure rather than a natural process that most (but not all) women can handle on their own, if they have enough support during labor."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"Many reviewers here have pointed out the flaws of this book--unrealistic advice about diet and a condescending tone being the most annoying--but of the handful of pregnancy books I've got I've reached for this the most often (along with Your Pregnancy Week to Week, which shows fetal development). When I first bought it I thought, boy, this is really negative, pointing out all the problems you could have. But then all those weird hormonal things started happening to me--shortness of breath, itchy palms, nosebleeds--and rather than bother my doctor between visits I could look it up and sure enough, there was a reassuring passage that it was, once again, my body doing normal if wacky things. For me, it's been worth it just for the amount of territory it covers, which other books slight (e.g, the Kitzinger doesn't even tell you how much calcium you should have per day--pretty big oversight!). As for the tone, well, I've yet to find a pregnancy book that isn't either paternalistic and pro-doctor/anti-midwife, or vehemently anti-medical establishment, so I just ignore the tone of these books altogether."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I HATE this book. I got it on my second pregnancy and was flabbergasted by the preachy tones and downright bad advice given. If you want to be a skinny, malnourished doormat then this is the book for you. The diet section is beyond belief. Ok so you eat healthily when you're pregnant (I think that goes without saying) but the idea that you need to religiously watch your weight gain went out with beehive haircuts and the Twist. And the assumption that your doctor is God and you should just lie back and think of your country is astonishingly dated. Most parents want to be informed and involved in their care, not have it dictated to them.I've read a lot of reviews that find the so-called focus on negative &quot;things that can go wrong&quot; disturbing and scary. I've been through a stillbirth and an incredibly complicated subsequent pregnancy and I can say with all honesty that this book is about as helpful as Cosmopolitan in that area. Everything is glossed over, and the section on loss is profoundly inadequate, guilt-causing and unsympathetic. I know pregnancy books shouldn't be all about death and the possibility of death, but if you're going to do it do it right.All in all, a total waste of trees. Buy a Miriam Stoppard book instead."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This was a great book. My sister used it when she was pregant years ago so when I found out I was, I purchased it as well. The book is easy to read. Broken down into question and answer form. I live in Japan and my doctor doesn\`t speak much english making my pregancy stressful when questions arise. Since I have no family here either and my in-laws don\`t speak english as well, this book as become my pregancy bible. Since this was our first child my husband become jumpy every time I had pain or my body changed in ways we didn\`t expect it too. I would simply look up in the book my concern or question and find an answer instead of running to the doctor every week. Then on our schedualed appointments we would explain what happened to our doctor and he would agree that we were right. Not only has this book calmed my fears about being pregant but my husbands. The book can be started or stopped at any part. It was good to read both sides of breast feeding to bottle, vaginal delivery to c-section, ect. Getting both sides of the story allowed me to make the best choice for me and my baby."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I used this book in my first pregnancy and I am now using it again 3 years later for my second. It answers every question I have ever had about my pregnancy on a level I can understand. It is also fun to see how my baby is developing as my pregnany progresses."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"Although I found this book to be helpful when looking for information about something, I did not find the tone of the book reassuring. Much of it is written in question and answer format, and the majority of the questions have the tone of a mother who is worrying. This format sends the message that panic and constant worry are appropriate responses to pregnancy. Even though worry is certainly a part of being pregnant, I felt that the presuppositon of worry often exacerbated my own worries and was leading me in the direction of worrying excessively - which is easy enough to do in the first place. I give it two stars because it is informative, but would recommend looking for a book with a more reassuring tone."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"The book is well structured but the information concentrates too much on the mother eating habits. I had the impression I was reading a book about diet. It lacks information about the baby, that's what the pregnancy is about."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I have owned 2 copies of this book -- one for each of my first two pregnancies. I devoured it during my first pregnancy, but ended up tossing it because of how &quot;tsk-tsk&quot; the authors are toward women who might even consider eating a piece of chocolate cake (all that sugar? Think of the baby!), during pregnancy (even if that's all you can manage to keep down during the first trimester). Once you've actually been through a real pregnancy, you realize how differently reality is from the ideal. You eat WHAT you can, WHEN you can. And if your midwife gives you a prescription to help relieve your nausea, YOU TAKE IT, with gratitude!At the start of my second pregnancy, however, I realized how easy it was to find things in What to Expect, that the chronological layout really is quite useful. So I ended up buying another copy (used).All in all, I do recommend it as one of the better pregnancy reference books, although I do have reservations about it simply due to the guilt-inducing nature of the opinions of the authors. Be forewarned: the authors seem to think we are all capable of eating a perfectly balanced diet everyday (morning sickness anyone?), we should not even CONSIDER taking anything that might help relieve nausea, and we should all expect to have a perfectly wonderful pregnancy experience! All of this can be a little heavy handed, especially for women in their first pregnancy who find that pregnancy is not always all it's idealized to be.I am in my third pregnancy (I have 2 wonderful, healthy children) and will probably not need to resort to pregnancy books this time. Unless someone happens to give me a used copy of What to Expect When You're Expecting."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I am on my 4th pregnancy, and it was the first book I bought with my first. Definately the \\"Best Odds Diet\\" is extreme. The author alots you ONE dessert or \\"splurge\\" per month. And then to ruin the excitement of splurging she tells you to pick something semi nutritious like carrot cake. The book acts like your child will be deficient if you take one bite of anything with sugar, deep fried or salty. Ridiculous!!! I spent the better half of my first pregnancy in fear of eating sweets or processed meats! This diet will ruin any special occasion dinner, vacation or treat.There is some good info in the book, but I wish there was more on the development of the baby. I wish it told you what weeks lined up with the nine months."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"After reading some of the other reviews on this book, I have to weigh in on the subject. Yes, the &quot;Best Odds Diet&quot; is a joke (my friends and I refer to the authors as the Food Nazis - a bagel for a treat?? what about a quart of Haagen Dazs!), and it is true that they have an alarmist approach, but the book does have a lot of good information. I assume that, like me, most expecting moms have a pile of books and I think this one has a place in that pile (along with The Girlfriends Guide and anything by William &amp; Martha Sears - also consider Spock and the Portable Pediatrician for Parents for after the baby is born). Sometimes I just want a paragraph or two on a subject and I think What to Expect When You're Expecting does a good job of covering a lot of ground in an accessible way. It certainly can't hurt to shoot for 1000 grams of protein and 65 servings of leafy greens every day, even if you don't get there!"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"Do NOT buy this book. Here is a choice examples of advice in this stupid book: on &quot;eating well&quot; - you may occasionally treat yourself to a plain bagel, but everything else you eat must be much more unreasonably disgusting. Puh-leez. This book will list all the things that could go wrong at every stage of pregnancy, all the harm you are doing to your fetus every time you twitch a muscle, and much of it is highly unreasonable and overblown. If you want to stay up all night worrying that your baby will be deformed because of something that you did, go ahead and read it. But I would suggest: INSTEAD of this book, consult your doctor about any medical concerns, buy Dr. Spock's books, and buy the Girlfriend's Guide to Pregnancy (and to surviving the first year, and to toddlers, etc) by vicki iovine. You will get better-founded medical information and vicki iovine is also highly entertaining."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"Although I went through the first several months of my pregnancy hating this book because of its &quot;doomsday&quot; outlook on everything that could possibly go wrong, in the end I was very glad I had it. The section on knowing if you're going into labor is the best I've seen, and the book is a good place to go if you are having symptoms you aren't sure about - it is a great reference to have around. Although I wouldn't recommend reading the section &quot;When something goes wrong&quot; unless you have to, I was definitely glad I had it. The month by month section is not as easy to read, and things aren't always where you would need them. I liked &quot;Your Pregnancy Week by Week&quot; for that sort of information better."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"These people are obsesessed with detailed descriptions and pictures of problems that no one can predict, prevent, or correct (especially downs syndrome). It is extremely frightning and doesn't even give good descriptions of normal ups and downs of pregnancy.

I'm pregnant again, and I will NOT be without this very valuable book! It's a gold mine of information, and it was a comfort to have so much information right at my fingertips during my last pregnancy.At one point, I was having braxton hicks contractions, but because of the book, I knew what they really were so did not waste my time going to the hospital. The book very clearly told me what I was feeling and it was right. I'm not a doctor, and I never would have known about braxton hicks contractions without this book. And so much else! It's the pregnant woman's bible!It's like having an owner's manual for your pregnant body."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This book takes all the joy out of pregnancy and puts all the terror in it. It harps on all the things that can possibly go wrong with your developing fetus and makes you cringe with terror at leaving home even. A much better book, is \\"Your Pregnancy Week by Week\\" by Da Capo books. It shows how the fetus is developing each week (size of a garbanzo, ears forming..ej) with illustrations, as well as a week-by-week summary of what's happening to the mother's body. My husband and I relished reading it each Saturday morning in bed, it became a pleasant ritual as we became accustomed to the idea of our growing child. And it makes pregnancy fun, not dreadful!"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"in an effort to be fair, this book reads someone who read a few pregnancy books decided to write a pregnancy book.what i wanted was a description of what my baby and body were going through at least month by month. this book gives you hardly a page of information, half of which is \\"your baby is getting bigger,\\" and then follows with a \\"what you probably feel like\\" section, which reads like \\"you probably feel sick, or big, and maybe you're hormonal.\\" not only do the month to month descriptions seem partial and bland, but it repeats much of its subject matter the next month, and the next month, so you just skip ahead. but alas--each month section is only a couple pages long, filled up mostly by worries in question answer format that are really out of your hands. i mean, how many times are you going to tell me that \\"what i should expect at my next visit\\" is for my doctor to check my height and weight and i could ask them questions? every. month.also, i've seen some reviews who dub it \\"non-judgmental,\\" thus giving it an air of professionalism women can trust (and buy). i'm a working class mother and college student. i waitress, and my husband works in an industrial shop. nowhere in this book were concerns that come along with a lower income environment--like cleaning chemicals, or standing on your feet all day, or not having insurance or the capability for maternity leave. i had the feeling that the target audience was upper/middle class women in their 30's, and i often ended up even feeling bad about myself because the book addressed its audience as though it \\"expected\\" it to have priviliges it otherwise would think basic health care, education, or money.not that this would affect you if you are of that group, obviously, or that it should deter you from purchasing the book.the point is that this book is very well marketed and it would be hard to resist it. however, i also got the book \\"great expectations: you're all in one resource for pregnancy and childbirth\\" as a gift and think that book more accurately deserves the title \\"the pregnancy bible.\\" i read them in tandem, and if you want to give a loved one or yourself something truly educational about the magic growing inside of you, about epidurals and crib safety, i would opt for it rather than \\"great expectations.\\""},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This is my very favorite pregnancy book. I also have the mother of All Pregnancy Books. This book, 'What to Expect' actually did a lot better job of calming my fears than the other book. \\"The Mother of All Pregnancy Books' scared me a little more.(but that is still a good book and I am glad I have both) This one assures you that why you need to be careful and wise, that the chances of something bad happening are still pretty low. I don't get that other people think this book makes them paranoid or its negative. I can't figure it out. I guess everyones thinking works differently. Go figure. I do enjoy both of my books and am re-reading them for my third pregnancy. Its nice to have on hand for subsequent pregnancies. I can't imagine being pregnant without this book.Its got a lot of positive and helpful and wise info, and is very encouraging."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"Since this is considered to be one of the \\"must-have\\" books during pregnancy, I received a copy, pretty much to find what I expected...pages and pages of things to make you think that, at any moment, something could be seriously wrong with your pregnancy. Same goes for the \\"...First Year\\" book from the same author. No matter the topic, pregnancy paranoia can set in, making the interpretation traumatic. It is nice to have for very basic reference, such as how big the baby is getting, what to expect at appointments, and if you have a specific concern, although I found that with both the pregnancy and first year books, anything that makes you concerned enough to look it up is answered in a way that can make you concerned enough to call the doctor, unless you are able to keep things in perspective or have someone else to keep you in check. If you do not fit into one of those categories and get it, read just the first few pages for each month, then shut it immediately to keep your sanity!"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"Honestly my favorite part of the book is the drawing of the pregnant lady. It's cool to compare the changes in your body!It's also a decent reference tool but not readable month to month. Some articles don't even relate to the month you are in!

I understand the importance of being well-educated in order to have the best possible pregnancy and birth, but instead of being re-assuring and helpful it only made me worry... about everything!! Being pregnant is stressful enough and I felt this book only made things worse. It made me feel that my baby was surely going to be born with some disease or birth-defect of some kind or another (which is no laughing matter), and my husband finally had to take it away from me (thank God!). I recommend only reading this book if you want to be a paranoid freak during these 9 looong months."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This book has it's place. It's a quick reference guide and has everything imaginable in it. If used with a good dose of perspective and not read cover-to-cover over and over then you should be fine. This book should be balanced with a good assortment of books that are more balanced and deal with the overall picture of parenting. Something more encouraging and uplifting wouldn't hurt either.Enjoying the Ride"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"A friend lent me this book when I became pregnant, and it ended up being one of the two that I read the most.

I didn't follow every suggestion (including diet) but found it vert helpful regardless."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This is the one book I knew I had to have when I found out I was pregnant. I was kinda disappointed. It's almost scary for a first time pregnant woman. It talks about all the things that could be wrong when you're just having normal pregnancy \\"things\\". Very informative about the possible complications of pregnancy, but it kinda takes away from the joy of being pregnant."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"Sure there is a lot of information in this book, but it's not worth all the feelings of inadequacy that comes with it. It's broken into month by month sections, Best Odds Diet, and Q & A formatted general pregnancy/birth info (that some times can go to some pretty worse-case-scenario places). It's a guide book that seems to take the fear route to teaching. The Best Odds Diet can be best described as fascist. The hard-line on their rules are just a little too unrealistic for most moms-to-be. While the month to month information is helpful, I'm sure there is another book out there spelling out the basics of prenatal development without the fire and brimstone judgemental approach. My doctor even told me to ignore a lot of this book. For some reason this is considered the pregnancy book to get, even though every woman I've talked to said they hated it. In any case, this book is okay as a resource guide only and I would never ever even recommend it for that to any mom with paranoia tendencies (and really, isn't that all of us)."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This book so put me off to pregnancy advice books that I've never attempted to read another. This book is preachy, extremist, alarmist, and way too rigid. It made me feel that if my pregnancy didn't progress exactly to their timeline than I was doing something wrong and harming my baby. The first chapters are especially irritating when talking about morning sickness and the Best_Odds diet. Basically with it telling me that whether I am sick or not I should be eating square meals. With me, that just wasn't going to happen and my baby is healthly, strong, and alert. My advice is find a good, experienced doctor that you feel comfortable with because they are going to give you the best advice that is suited to you and your specific needs. If you want a book to reference, I recommend a more medical oriented one like the Mayo Clinic book than an advice book."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I finally achieved pregnancy after 3 1/2 years of infertility treatment. I was told this is a must have book so I dug out my copy and read it. I could not believe how fatalistic this book was! It scared the pants off me! Especially when I started experiencing pre-term labor...the impression that I got was that I was surely going to lose my twins, no if's and's or but's! Guess what? I did not lose them and they are healthy 10 month old boys.Oh, and my OB totally did not recommend the best odds diet, especially with being pregnant with twins...she said it was one of the most unhealthy diets for a pregnant woman and should be taken off the market. The caloric intake was inadequate and again, a lot of fear instilled about how bad so many foods were during pregnancy...it made me feel that if I ate 1/2 a cookie in one month, I was going to lose my twins or gain 30 lbs in a day!NOT RECOMMENDED AT ALL!"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I am so relieved to read other people's reviews of WTEWYE and realize that I am not the only person with a negative experience. In general, I would say that this book puts a ridiculous burden on pregnant women. The book is laughable in its extreme ethnocentrism, as well. The Best Odds Diet is just plain insanity. The idea that if a woman eats a piece of French bread that she is hurting her unborn baby is ridiculous. The book promotes the idea that women cannot be healthy without being lean, even when pregnant.This book is also rife with inconsistency, for instance, telling you that if you drank before you found out you were pregnant, not to worry about it but then suggesting that if you drink one sip of wine during the pregnancy that your baby will \\"suffer\\" for it. Similarly, every women of child-bearing age should take folic acid daily before they get pregnant, because folic acid is a water soluble vitamin and needs to be replenished daily, treating the readers as if they can't handle the truth about folic acid, namely that deficiency is associated with a genetic condition or alcoholism and that if conception occurs, it needs to be supplied immediately thereafter, meaning that if you're the kind of woman who goes around getting pregnant unexpectedly AND doesn't figure it out until you're three months pregnant AND you're an alcoholic or have that genetic condition, then you better be taking those prenatal vitamins. The book also contains a lot of information which just seems old. This book also neglects to include a lot of pretty run of the mill pregnancy symptoms, such as backache in the first month, cramping sensations, intestinal upset and pinching sensations in the pelvis.In my own experience, I had two \\"missed abortions\\" in a row. \\"Missed abortion\\" occurs when the fetus dies and is not expelled is an event that WTEWYE describes as incredibly rare, which it is not. The book provides inadequate information about spotting and bleeding, never telling the reader that fifty percent of the women who experience spotting go on to carry to term, but that any kind of blood tinged discharge should be checked out by an OB/GYN in the next few days. It's also really annoying the way the book is divided by months as opposed to weeks. How long is a month? Forty weeks divided by nine months is 4.444 weeks. What month am I at thirteen and a half weeks?Look for a better book than this. If you still want to buy it, you can get it at virtually any yard sale in suburbia for [a really low price]."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I read this book when I first got engaged, trying to figure out when and how kids were going to fit into my life. It very nearly caused a vasectomy. This book makes an excellent birth control option. Just reading it was enough to put me off sex for weeks.There are a lot of problems with this book, so I'll be brief. Firstly, it assumes a lot. It assumes you're happy to be pregnant, that you're a middle-class, straight, married woman, and that you are constantly thinking about your uterus squatter in the most gushingly positive terms possible. I'm just guessing here, but I have to assume that most women are at least a little more ambivalent than that. Secondly, the book claims to be a reassuring guide to blah blah blah. The fact of the matter is that if you find it reassuring to read a page long description of a serious medical problem followed by a sentence or two of \\"but don't worry, it's probably not going to happen to you, although it might\\", then this is the book for you. I skimmed a lot of these, so there might be a complication that causes Cthulhu to emerge triumphant from betwixt my legs- I'll never know. Thirdly, it is a bit dismissive of some alternative birth options, but it makes up for it in its insane dedication to the diet from hell and entirely unfounded assumptions that a pregnant woman will catch on fire if she uses an electric blanket, give birth to Toxie if she dyes her hair, and is Satan Incarnate if she eats refined sugar. It actually says that if there isn't research to say that such and such is safe, you're better off avoiding it completely. I myself have never read any peer-reviewed articles stating that breathing during the third trimester is completely safe, so I urge all of you out there who are expecting to abstain. Finally, the book's format is ridiculous, based on totally arbitrary placement of burning questions like \\"what should I name my baby?\\" which of course could only be asked during the sixth month. These questions by the way range from the laughably stupid myths which are debunked (\\"If I spin around really fast, can I make sure it's a boy?\\") to the laughably stupid myths which are supported (\\"Is exercise during pregnancy bad for you?\\" A: Just don't do it until you're tired, or sweaty, or warm, or have in any way exercised).In conclusion, this book is dumb. Look elsewhere for enlightenment."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This book is good for someone who knows absolutely nothing about pregnancy or birth as I did at the beginning and at least want something to start with. It gives you a month by month account of what may or may not happen to you when you are pregnant, and some info about birth. But this book (just as all books in this series) has some serious flaws, and a lot of information there is not informative. Among the things I particularly didn't like in it are the following:- the book keeps repeating how important it is to choose your doctor carefully, but does not give adequate information to actually enable you to do that (I found the same problem in \\"what to expect the first year\\", only there they talk about choosing a pediatrician). The authors even provide a very long list of questions to ask your doctor, answers to which will be absolutely meaningless to you usless you understand their implications (which the book doesn't provide). For example: how often a doctor does an episiotomy. Apparently, you'd want to choose a doctor who doesn't do many, but then you go on-line and read how episiotomy helps you avoid tears, so you wonder - why would I object to having one? This book mentions none of rather serious side effects that an episiotomy can have. So asking questions to your practitioner, answers to which you can not properly interpret, will only make you feel uncomfortable and annoy him/her, and in the end you may still end up with a bad doctor, because you just don't know what to look for.- the chapter about labor and delivery is totally inept. It tells you about the procedures and interventions in birth process that hospitals employ, explaining why they do it, but it doesn't mention at all that most of those interventions in most cases are not only unnecessary but quite dangerous, and that they are used routinely for the sole reason of convenience of the doctor and the hospital stuff rather than you. As a result you get a wrong impresion that they must be done and you can't avoid them, but you don't understand why it is so, and how risky they are. This chapter is quite useless for anyone who cares about what kind of birth experience they want. My advice is - don't read this chapter at all and get a better book on birthing.- nutrition: I tried to follow their guidelines and quickly found that they are ridiculous. There is no way that a normal person (not an elephant) can possibly eat that much food in one day. I wonder if authors have actually tried to follow their own recommendations...- exersise: not very useful, because, again, no explanation of the benefits of the exercises that the authors recommend. It is very hard to follow a recommendation if you don't understand the purpose of it. I didn't take them seriously until I read in other books why they may actually be helpful.The point is, if you just want to read something (anything) about pregnancy, read this book. But if you really care how you are going to have your baby, this book is not adequate. It's a good idea to read it quick and then put it back on the shelf for occasional reference, and look for better books on childbirth. There are tons of them out there, much more helpful and informative than this one. I would recommend W.Sears's books and references therein. \\"The birth book\\" is pretty good."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"The first book I went for when I found out I was pregnant was this one - mainly because it came so highly recommended. By the time I gave birth, my husband was ready to burn it. I really found it useful as a reference, but found some of the advice contained within the book to be condescending (the section on eating), while others confirmed my daily fears that there was something wrong with me or with my baby. The monthly sections on \\"what to expect\\" are great - but my suggestion is to remove the section entitled \\"When Something Goes Wrong\\" and put it in a safe place for use when/if you have symptoms that something might be wrong. This section contains information about medical conditions that occur during pregnancy - and if you are getting good prenatal care, most of this will be explained to you by your doctor anyway. I found this section, read it, and referred to it several times, each time absolutely sure that I (or my baby) had whatever condition I was reading about at that time.The book is a good reference, but beware - it is also a guidebook for hypochondriacs. If you just want to know, in layman's terms, what is happening, how it will feel, and what you can do with basic pregnancy issues - I highly recommend Vicki Iovine's \\"Girlfriend's Guide to Pregnancy.\\" It's much less scary, a lot more fun, and your husband won't want to burn it after nine months!"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"After choking through the first few chapters of this book and skimming over the rest I had to politely place it in my bookcase, vowing never to pick it up again. As someone who was pregnant for the first time I thought it would be the Bible of the maternal world. Unfortunately it was quite the contrary. One annoyance was the constant plug for the &quot;Best Odds Diet,&quot; making you feel paranoid if you didn't eat 2.5 ounces of this or a 8 ounces of that everyday. The authors made it sound like if you ate everything on their menu then you would have a perfect baby. Pregnant women don't need scare tactics!I didn't like the layout either, how it was a Q&amp;A setup for each chapter. There were MANY questions I had that were not addressed, but I guess the author must have only included questions that she had during her pregnancy or something.The writing style is dummied down, like they think the reader needs to start from &quot;when a man and a woman really love each other....&quot; No need to talk down to us, just provide the information. Unfortunately it wasn't the information I needed."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I saw another reviewer call this book non-judgemental... I wonder if we were reading the same book??? Overall, it's informative. HOWEVER, I found certain elements fairly preachy and judgemental, if not flat-out offensive, specifically regarding morning sickness and weight gain. This book actually says that morning sickness is a result of \\"cultural expectations\\" and a woman's mental state, which IMO smacks of Victorian-era misogyny (the fact that many women experience nausea before even knowing that they're pregnant is apparently irrelevant - somehow it's still a state of mind). The other problem is with weight gain. Most women I know have gained anywhere from 5-10 pounds in the first trimester, but this book actually says that if you gain that much you're overeating and better put the brakes on (and put 'em on FAST otherwise you might get FAT). Some women gain most of their weight in the beginning and then slow down in the end, but that's not even addressed here. According to this book, if you gain over the recommended amount for each trimester, you must be stuffing your face like a pig and better start using their best-odds diet or your going to end up obese. I find that mentality ridiculous and unhealthy and ultimately think these authors ought to know better. There are plenty of books out there that don't treat you like a naughty child if your pregnancy doesn't progress like medical text book - buy one of those instead."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"Hate is a very strong word, but wow, my wife and I really hated this book. In fact, it breaks what should be the first rule of pregnancy and child rearing books -- do no harm. What to expect, in almost every situation, will give you the disaster scenario of what could be wrong. Cramps? The baby could be kicking or you could have a massive hemorrhage! Feet swelling? Could be normal pregnancy symptoms or you could have blood clots! Seriously, the book drove my wife and I crazy during our first pregnancy. Indeed, it's the only book I've thrown away in recent memory.Pregnancy books should be calming and fun, not scary. We enjoyed the Girl Friends Guide, which was better written, more accessible, and less likely to lead to panic in the middle of the night."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"The drawback for this book is it clearly explains almost every possible complication. With the monthly format it is a lot to read at a time. The list of complications and possible symptoms each moth can be very daunting. Yet with all of that the book is also a great resource. It gives you many things to consider that you may never have thought of. It is much more comprehensive than many other pregnancy books. It has some nice charts in the back to help you keep track of weight, size and other notes for the Doctor's or Midwives. It also has a section for coping with pregnancy loss and also preparing for the next child. A good resource for any couple expecting a child. With over 12 Million copies sold this book now, in it's 3rd edition has been trusted by many people. The authors have also written:What to Expect the First YearWhat to Expect the Toddler YearsWhat to Expect Eating Well When You're ExpectingThe What to Expect When You're Expecting Pregnancy Organizer"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This was &quot;THE BOOK&quot; everyone told me to get when I got pregnant for the first time. So, of course, I ran out and bought it the moment my pregnancy test was positive! But, honestly, I didn't think it was that helpful.The second chapter is titled &quot;Now that you are Pregnant&quot; and most of that chapter deals with &quot;what you may be concerned about&quot; which could also be titled &quot;everything that could possibly go horribly wrong with your pregnancy&quot; and it scared me half to death. I think it increased the amount of worrying I was doing exponentially [which couldn't have been a good thing!].I also thought the diet portion was pretty ridiculous. I agree that we need to eat very healthily, especially during pregnancy. I eat very well and I ate especially well when pregnant. However, no human being I've ever met could [or would] stick to this diet plan. It was so strict as to be useless, in my opinion. I think people do much better with a &quot;eat well 90% of the time and let yourself fudge a little the other 10%&quot; kind of plan. But the diet stuff DID succeed in making me feel really, really guilty for the duration of my pregnancy if I ate anything that was not whole grain, organic, and laced with a heaping spoonful of Wheat Germ.I also didn't think this was a very good guide to the &quot;labor and delivery&quot; part of the pregnancy, which was a big concern for me. This book was very &quot;medical&quot; in its outlook on labor and delivery and didn't go into very much detail about the process, really. I found &quot;A Good Birth, A Safe Birth&quot; to be much more useful, as well as &quot;The Birth Book&quot; by Sears.All in all, this would be a good book to have on hand as a reference, just in case there were problems with the pregnancy, but I wouldn't buy it as your primary guide to pregnancy. For my second pregnancy, a friend recommended &quot;The Pregnancy Book&quot; by Sears and I found that MUCH more helpful honestly."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"When we decided to get pregnant, we read something like 25 books. One year and one baby later, I kind of feel like an expert in baby books. So let me say that this book is far and away the best pregnancy book and it is no surprise that it has been a bestseller for many years.This book is a complete, professional, non-judgemental reference. A lot of books try too hard to be funny or cute. WTE is not humorless, but it deals with subject matter in a refreshingly straightforward way. The advice and help given echoes what our doctors have said and answered most of our questions before we even saw our Obstetritian (no, it's not a substitute).This book covered EVERYTHING. It answered all our questions about diet, medication, flu shots, cat ownership, false labor, vitamin supplements, cramps, ultrasound, breastfeeding or how to judge your OB/GYN. All the answers were in here, along with tons of other stuff we didn't think about until we came across it here.Most importantly, this book isn't judgemental. There are a ton of controversial issues associated with pregnancy (medication, breast feeding, circumcision). Lots of books out make a lot of assumptions about religion, single parents, \\"modern times\\" or they just avoid some issues entirely. This book assumes you can make up your own mind once you're presented with all the information. This book wasn't a replacement for our doctors, but it gave us a lot of really useful information without taking a side.If the book has a flaw, it is the diet section. Do yourself a favor and skip that section. In all fairness, this is a flaw of a lot of the books we read (some of them reading like 1950s \\"Keep Young And Beautiful\\" rants). Our doctor gave us a 10 page handout that gave us all the information we needed.Like I say, we read a lot of pregnancy books. It's pretty shocking how many we found to be completly WORTHLESS! I don't want to name names, and I've already written a couple of negative reviews, but I'm thinking particularly of the ones full of Erma Bombeck-esque anecdotes about La Maz classes, the \\"staying chic while you're pregnant\\" fashion mag type, the old-fashioned preachy church-lady books, or--worst of all--the \\"nutrition\\" books that focused almost entirely on weight. Some of these books are written by people with no medical qualifications at all!A good rule of thumb: if the author has no medical qualifications, the book will be useless from a medical standpoint. Would you allow a fashion magazine editor to make up your mind about having an epidural?Just about every pregnancy book uses the \\"What Nobody Will Tell You\\" tagline. Once you've read this book, there will be very few surprises left. There isn't a topic that isn't touched on and just about everything you need is covered in depth. That's not to say this is the only book you need, but it goes a long, long way.I'm only harping on this because I was pretty shocked to read some of the negative reviews that complained about WTE containing a lot of information on rare pregnancy situations, saying that such information was \\"scary\\" and \\"unnecessary\\". WTE gives plenty of information on what is serious as opposed to what is a false alarm. Nobody PLANS on having a troubled pregnancy! Aren't you better off knowing what's involved and how to detect and prevent such things? I suppose for some people ignorance is bliss, but we were MUCH happier being prepared. When we went into labor 5 weeks early, we felt at least somewhat prepared for it because it was extensively covered in the book!If you're looking for entertainment, pick up something else or rent a movie. But if you're looking for a complete, professional, and useful reference book, What To Expect While You're Expecting is THE BEST and it will be the standard for years to come."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"Like so many women, I started with this book. I wish I had never seen it.Minor quibble: I hated the bossy and condescending tone.Major problem: You will never be able to live up to this book. It made me feel like a complete failure, at only 6 weeks along! I suffer from terrible morning sickness, and sometimes I am lucky if I can keep food down at all. I could not live up to this book's constant hectoring to think about \\"baby\\" and follow the recommended diet no matter how I feel. But there is no way I can eat 75 grams of protein a day in my current state; there aren't enough saltines in the world. There certainly aren't any whole-wheat saltines at all, but according to this book, you are abusing \\"baby\\" if you let refined flour pass your lips. After several days of throwing up the approved whole-wheat crackers, I decided to listen to my body instead of this stupid book.This book almost ruined my pleasure at being pregnant. Luckily I found Ann Douglas's Unofficial Guide to Having a Baby, and Sheila Katzinger's Complete Book of Pregnancy and Childbirth. They are straightforward, written for adults not imbeciles. And neither suggests you force-feed yourself 75 grams of protein a day at any time during the pregnancy, let alone while suffering from morningsickness. Judging from a quick survey of pregnancy books at the bookstore \\"What to Expect\\" is a radical outlier in some of its nutrition recommendations.I almost threw this book out, but in the end, I put it in our donation bag for the charity shop. I guess it is better than nothing - but I would steer clear."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I was 22 years old, in my second to last semester in college, about to receive my BA in Literature, sitting in my doctors office in tears and terrified to find that I was pregnant. Once the family was told, the first thing I received was this book. I am a read-a-hollic and always want to know as much about something as I can, so I dove into this book as much as my school work permitted...the further into the book I got the less I wanted to read it. This book petrified me. I was about to turn into the world's WORST mother. I am unmarried (but in a very loving, long relationship), young, work in retail (so I can finish school), can't afford to NOT work and I can't even put food in my mouth that I'm not craving. This book made me so upset and angry that I did (in a more hormonal moment) actually throw it across the room. I found that many of the Q&A sections had nothing to do with me or my pregnancy and many of my concerns were never addressed. I felt inadequate because I had not planned my pregnancy or married my \\"partner\\" before hand and found the diet plan impossible to follow. When I looked on line to find a replacement for this book I was horrified at how many people gave this book five stars. Currently, there are 801 reviews about this book and I read about half of them. Pay attention to what the low and middle ratings say, many have excellent points. My advice to mothers to be and well wishing gift givers is to pass on this book. I found it to be insulting to my intelligence, lacking in truly or current scientific backing, and inattentive to the world that most women live in (one that requires a woman to work, especially at a job that she may find fulfilling.) Don't give the gift of guilt, don't give this book."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"If you want your pregnancy to be monitored by a group of control freaks, then this is the book for you. While every pregnancy book will encourage you to eat a healthy, well-balanced diet, this one goes further, urging you to develop &quot;discplined&quot; and &quot;virtuous&quot; eating habits. With _every_ bite that goes into your mouth, you should be thinking of the health of your baby. But it is not simply, or not merely, a question of health. You should also be worrying about your figure. In the section dealing with father's concerns, they print the following (real or hypothetical) question, &quot;As petty as this might seem, I'm afraid my wife's going to get fat and flabby during pregnancy, and stay that way afterwards.&quot; Do they tell this father-to-be where to go? No. They reassure him that his concern is not &quot;petty,&quot; since it's a question of health. And they offer a list of suggestions for the father-to-be who wants to keep his wife trim and slim post-pregrancy. &quot;Lead her not into temptation,&quot; they write. &quot;Practise what you preach&quot; but &quot;don't be too preachy&quot; -- for example, &quot;signal her quietly when in public, rather than making a pointed announcement to all within earshot about her ordering chicken breaded and fried&quot;. I am not making this up, I am quoting directly from the book. This is a new form of puritanism."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I have to agree with other reviewers that the focus of this book oftentimes seemed to be educating you about all the things that could go wrong. While this is good information to have, as a first-time mother I was more interested in wellness information and was getting information on complications and testing from my midwife anyway. Their idea of wellness was the &quot;Best Odds Diet&quot; which odds are no pregnant woman can stick to. They absolutely forbid sweets and set up a fairly rigid daily list of food choices. Since the title of the diet was &quot;Best Odds&quot; and the text carried on about the optimum health of your baby, I became a little annoyed at the notion that one cookie when I craved it would adversely affect my child. I used the information given in childbirth classes about nutrition and found it much more realistic. There are numerous free sources online that will give you the developmental information and information on changes in your body that this book contains as well as allowing you to customize for your due date and I found them more helpful. If you would like good information on prenatal exercises and wellness as well as changes in your body and fetal development, Sheila Kitzinger's Complete Book of Pregnancy and Childbirth is a much better buy. She gives much more comprehensive information on pregnancy and birth and includes beautiful pictures as well. I gave my copy of this book to a newly pregnant friend midway through my pregnancy and kept my copy of the Kitzinger text. If this book is regarded as the Pregnancy Bible I think that is only because of widespread promoting of the text as compared to others."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"Books I recommend instead:The Mother of All Pregnancy Books by Ann Douglas (a great general guide)The Pregnancy Book by William Sears, MD (more of a natural approach)The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth by Henci Goer (discusses/explains your options for labor/delivery)I didn't get too far with this book. I like to research and make informed decisions about issues that affect my child and me. I felt that this book talks down to expectant mothers. Not to mention it gives you all these \\"worst case scenarios\\" to worry about. For example, I looked up an issue about using electric blankets. It listed all these things that could go wrong, and then they say, but if you already did that don't worry about it now the baby is probably fine. NOT helpful. BTW, I asked my dr and she said the electric blanket was fine to use.Get another pregnancy book instead."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"Having no scientific data and no relevant expertise on many of the matters discussed in the book certainly doesn't stop its authors from telling you that nearly everything in your life is unsafe for one reason or another. Virtually all of the modern hysteria associated with pregnancy can be traced back to this nightmarish excuse of a book.Further, WTEWYE proposes an unrealistically restrained diet and suggests child abuse of anyone who doesn't follow it. The authors tell you that, since you wouldn't give your baby a doughnut, you shouldn't eat one yourself. Does that mean I should revert to a diet of breast milk and formula for the duration of my pregnancy because it's what I plan to feed my child when it is born?I have recommendations for use of this book: It works well to fix wobbly tables, as scrap paper due to the white space in the margins, or as starter fuel for a fire or barbecue. Otherwise, its monthly milestones are now available on the Internet and any lunatic on the street can give you equally good advice.Avoid, avoid, avoid. Please. Don't drive yourself crazy for no reason."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I am a mother of 4 children. I am an avid reader and have read many pregancy, birthing, baby, and childcare books and magazines, over the years. I don't consider myself an expert, but I do know what a good pregnancy book is, and this isn't one.I borrowed this book from my SIL who used it through her pregnancy. My sister swore by it, as well. I had heard nothing but great reviews. Well, I was highly disappointed. I didn't agree with many of her discussions she brought up. While much of the books was interesting and helpful in a general information of what was going on, it didn't give me any real answers! My OB and friends who have already given birth gave me all the information this book gave me. I am glad I didn't purchase it!I highly recommend: Your Pregnancy Week by Week. It gives you great descriptions for what is going on inside your body, what changes you'll face and are facing, why certain things happen, what your baby looks like, what size your baby is, what is happening to your baby, when certain things develop, why you feel this or that, what this pain is, what that feeling is, etc. It's incredible!If you want a great book that is similar to What to Expect... then get The Pregnancy Book by Dr. William Sears and Martha Sears, RN. Dr. Sears is a Pediatrician with a great website. Martha is a Pediatric Nurse and La Leche League leader. They have had 8 children together and practice what they preach. I have this in my permanent library and recommend it to friends who are moms-to-be quite frequently.I don't recommend any of the What to Expect books... Dr. Sears has great books that are all great alternatives to What to Expect... What to Expect was so popular because it was the first and only book of its kind for so long. Now there are a ton of great options out there. It filled a need, but now it's no longer needed!"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I would be willing to bet 50 people pushed this book onto me when I found out I was expecting. So, being hungry to learn anything and everything about this great unknown thing that is pregnancy, I snapped it up and began to read.. Before long, I discovered what many others have - this book was written not really to inform but to terrify the expectant mother.For the first three months - any twinge or hint of pain and I was on the phone to my ob/gyn. Finally, he recommended I stop reading this book because it disturbed me. He recommended Pregnancy for Dummies. In it, I found answers to questions I didn't even know to ask and, instead of frightening me with way too much information and a lot of &quot;worst-case&quot; scenarios, Dummies just laid it out in plain language.I have had an exceptionally easy pregnancy and it has only gotten easier and LESS stressful since I put down this book.I have several friends that are also expecting and I have strongly recommended AGAINST buying What to Expect because I am confident that there are better resources out there than this book."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This is positively the worst pregnancy book out there. It is condescending and alarmist about every single aspect of pregnancy, without seriously dealing with many of the common ailments (nausea, for instance). The &quot;best odds&quot; diet is unrealistic and unpalatable for most women with morning sickness.Every single person I know who has read this book has been made more nervous, not less, by reading it. Pregnant women would do better listening to their mother's old wives tales than reading &quot;What to Expect&quot;."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This book is like a mixed bag of jellybeans, heavily weighted toward your least favorite flavor. Every now and then there is something good, but generally it is not enjoyable. Yes, it's nice to read that nosebleeds are normal, but more often I felt the expectations on the mother were unrealistic. Worst of all is the medical misinformation!Several times during my pregnancy I raised concerns with my doctor based on something in &quot;What to Expect...&quot; Every time the book was wrong! I had worried needlessly. There are better books out there for your medical information, and the Girlfriend's Guide for the practical (and funny) advice on hair and husbands.

The index isn't much help.My second biggest gripe: Although its premise is very sensible indeed, the specific suggestions of the Best-Odds Diet are damn near impossible to follow in the real world. This is not to say we should all throw up our hands and eat at McDonald's... just that there are common-sense, healthy approaches to eating that aren't so restrictive that a real person can't possibly follow them. I think it's interesting that [someone] said this book made her feel like a failure. It's easy to see where she's coming from. On second thought, maybe this is my biggest gripe.Another gripe: There isn't enough information about the BABY. How big is it now? How 'bout now? Does it have toes, organs, what?On the up side, the information about what you may be experiencing in a given month is useful.Bottom line: don't take for granted this will be the one book you'll really use and need.

It presents the things that can go wrong in pregnancy as if they were frequent occurances, and it presents obstetric interventions and practices as if they were always necessary and beneficial.

I realize it's important to eat well when you're pregnant, but the authors really do get carried away, making it sound as if eating a hot fudge sundae will irreparably damage your unborn child.

This book discusses that non-issue for several paragraphs, before concluding that no, you probably shouldn't be afraid of your microwave. That embodies what's wrong with this book. It pretends to be reassuring while actually planting a bunch of paranoid ideas. It also assumes that you, the reader, are the mother-to-be, while having very little to say to your partner, in a way that I find subtly sexist. Overall, it has plenty to make you extra-worried. For instance, it advises posting pictures of healthy babies all around your house (on the door, in the kitchen, on the bathroom mirror, really, all around your house), in order to continually remind yourself to eat a very rigid diet -- as if the bump in your belly wasn't already making you worry quite enough. If you think that it would be helpful to post a nagging sign on your front-door to ask you daily, \\"Have you fed your baby breakfast today?\\" then you may like this book.Personally, I found that _What to Expext_ left me alarmed about microwaves & air pollution & ambient noise & even exercise in ways that were not helpful. For a book so full of information, it also, curiously, failed to address any of my specific questions. How soon should I begin taking folic acid or other prenatal vitamins: as soon as I start trying to get pregnant, or only after the pregnancy-test comes back positive? Is there anything I can do to increase my odds of getting pregnant? What are those odds, anyway, for a woman my age? These seemed like reasonable questions to me, but to find answers, I had to look in the far-more-helpful book by Ann Douglas, _The Mother of All Pregnancy Books_ -- which also features a nifty week-by-week what's-happening-inside-your-body chart that I love. The other book I highly recommend is Armin Brott's _The Expectant Father_, which has terrific & reasonable advice you won't find elsewhere. By those two, not this one."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"Okay, I think this book is very informative, but Ron Sullivan (his review) is VERY right.

When I get pregnant again, I will not be reading this book, it's way too stressful. I'm sure there are many other informative books out there that don't stress you out as much.

Most exasperating, though, was the \\"organization.\\" Symptoms that can arise during varying parts of pregnancy are scattered haphazardly amongst the monthly chapters. This means that the book must be read cover to cover and all material retained in memory if hunting through the index and flipping back and forth between sections doesn't sound appealing.Enter the \\"Mayo Clinic Guide to a Healthy Pregnancy.\\" Hallelujah! Not wanting to suffer through another mediocre guide to pregnancy, I looked through every book I could get my hands on, and this was the only one that satisfied my criteria.

Instead of having to take a wild guess at which chapter (or, more likely, chapters) cramping might have landed in in \\"What to Expect\\" or searching the entire index, I could find it, along with all the other things I might be wondering about, in the reference guide.

My doctor rolled her eyes and said, \\"We used to issue that book, but it caused so many expectant mothers to freak out over the slightest thing, that we couldn't handle all the calls from fearful women.\\" I told her that a friend had given me a copy to read before I had ever conceived and she said, \\"Please, please -- read it with a grain of salt if you must read it at all.\\" She went on to say that it does have some very helpful information, but unfortunately it's mixed in with so much overly-exaggerated worst-case-scenarios, it's hard to discern between the two.I read it anyway, and now am sorry I did. I've read several other books that are much better, both in content and in more real-life scenarios. Sure, there are LOTS of things that could go wrong, and LOTS of things expectant mothers have to be worried about, but this book only serves to exacerbate stress and worry which are NOT good for your baby.Dr. Miriam Stoppard's books are far and away a better choice. \\"Conception, Pregnancy & Birth\\" covers everything you need to know in a much more practical and less scary context."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"If you get pregnant it's virtually impossible to avoid having this book shoved at you, as a gift, or from friends who were given an extra copy (\\"I know, it's awful, but I got two so I brought it over,\\" they'll say, as though they secretly want you to share the torment.) And although you've been warned, like Pandora and her box, you'll be tempted to crack it open, and then you'll hit it again and again, like a self destructive addict.What made it so destructive for me, was not, as it seems to be for some reviewers, the free hand with possible medical problems, which I found generally somewhat helpful, if often innacurate or incomplete, but the punitive, finger waving tone. According to Mirkoff, et al, you can have ice-cream 9 times in your pregnancy, if you MUST at all, the rest of the time you have to eat like your on one of the most rigorous diets of your life. Fun and indulgence are not part of a healthy pregnancy. It's all about constantly policing yourself.She tells you about the weight gain schedule you should be on -- 1 pound per week -- as though not being on it guarantees a future of obesity. Women should gain 25-35 pounds, she tells you at the beginning, and if you're larger boned you'll gain towards the higher end. Fine. Then at the end of the book she tells you that if you gained 35 or more, as opposed to the 25 or less women, it will take you far longer to lose your baby weight. So big boned women take longer to lose their baby weight? Why? I'd like to see some kindof statistical back-up for this pyschologically damaging \\"fact.\\" This kindof information makes you feel like it's hopeless from the start -- and it's hardly useful, since a larger women can't help gaining more unless she calorie restricts, which Murkoff forbids (although the punitive nature of her recomended diet feels like a weight loss diet).These depressing, unsubstantiated claims are sprinkled throughout the book, which at it's core, while appearing to be objective, is guided by an oppressive \\"right behavior\\" versus \\"wrong behavior\\" morality.She also ascribes to the school of thought that \\"if it might be bad for you, you shouldn't do it.\\" Rather than the more healthy approach, in this age of excessive paranoia:\\"understand the medical communities claims about why something might be bad for you, and make your own decisions.\\" For instance, she says excercising on your back is bad for you and the baby, without giving any explanation. I asked several doctors about this and they said it's a slight concern to lie on your back for hours at a time, mostly because it could cut off your circulation depending on where the baby is lying in relation to a vein that runs up your back, but it's just not a big deal to do some stomach excercises on your back, unless you find yourself getting really dizzy.And then there's the depressing cover, with a smug-faced woman in a rocker who looks like the sort of person who turns their cheap, new, faux Victorian style sub-division house near some overdeveloped, once beautiful lake into a B & B with hideous, dust covered potpourri on the fake antique dressers, and polyester eyelet sheets. Just looking at it will make you wish you hadn't gotten pregnant in the first place."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"Not a bad book, really...but not a great book, either.LOTS of information, much of it helpful, but a lot of it rather worrisome. I just don't like the tone of the book; basically, that if you don't do what it says, you're not doing what's best for your baby.The meal plans and ideas were not very realistic for anyone who might suffer from morning sickness (which fortunately I did not)."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"When I bought the book it said it was a Revised Edition, that is dishonest, it should say something like used or something to let people know it is a second hand book, I thought it was a newer version, that's why I've sent an email to my friends and placed on my facebook about the terrible service you provided."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This book arrived in excellent condition as promised. This book has been very helpful and is very handy in so many ways for expecting mothers and fathers to be. I highly reccomend this book as your pregnancy bible."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I bought this book because I wanted as much information as possible for my first pregnancy. The layout made it difficult to quickly find information and the writing of the book is horrible. All the cutesy analogies and comments were annoying and unnecessary.I was surprised to hear others comment that they found the book to have too much information that they found scary. Since I was looking for as much information as possible, I didn't mind that they covered every possibility since I knew that was what they were doing. I wanted to know about all the scenarios, good or bad, so I could be knowledgeable about my body's signals.Like I mentioned before, the book is very poorly organized and very very poorly written. An example of the poorly organized aspect of the book is that they talk about the importance of exercise along with diagrams of suggested exercises that are good for you quite late into the book when an exercise regimen can and should be followed in the first trimester."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"Great book and helpful for question that you might not want to ask or have between visits."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"Book is great in any edition!

I highly recommend to have it around. I refer to it for any little questions I have."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I often took this book with me to the rest room and in the bath and found myself reading it on my lunch hour. It's nice to read another woman's perspective on pregnancy. I never had any morning sickness or back aches or similar discomforts and my pregnancy was actually quite uneventful, as was the delivery. But I did have emotional mood swings. I didn't understand why I cried because we didn't get any mail that day or because I couldn't for the life of me remember the last place I put the remote.But reading this book puts it out there on the table, and when you understand why things are happening it's easier to deal with and control. You make an effort to be nicer and more understanding.Yes, there are a lot of terrible things that can go wrong, I had the worst night mares about the band-syndrome where the babies lose fingers and toes due to being wrapped up in the amniotic bands in the womb. Not to mention, the extensive discussion about the risks of miscarriage, down syndrome, brain damage due to uterine compression and lack of oxygen during delivery, jaundice, and a host of other horrible diseases and afflictions, the risks of which are increased by the mother's age, weight, and medical history.But we do need to know about those things, and it goes on to say that you have a greater chance of having a perfect healthy baby.. which I did. My little girl was born 5 days before her due date and it was a what I consider to be a breeze. I kept a lot of my water all through the birth and she came sliding out about 8 hours after I started labor. So.. worrying was for naught. What made it easy for me I think was that my daughter was planned and that I stayed positive the whole time and encouraged myself that everything would be ok. Personally I believe 90% of complications in pregnancy result from stress and negative feelings and environments."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"Great book - it has been real helpful for my wife pregnant w/our first child."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I was very impressed with the great detail this book gives to women who are new to motherhood. This is my first pregnancy and I am clueless. I gain great insight when I use the book to take me through each week of my pregnancy. This book was recommended to me by my doctor, since there are so many pregnancy books on the market. My doctor wanted to be sure I had the best with the most accurate information. It definitely is the best!"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"If you have read Kelly-Icce's review already, then you know exactly how I felt.I kinda skimmed the whole book in one sitting, and walked away with the feeling that the entire book was a guilt trip on eating properly, and how \\"if (because you are so nauseous) you can't convince yourself to eat frequently and only put healthy stuff in your mouth, you are a bad, selfish mother.\\" Never mind that healthy babies have been being born for millenia, even to women who vomit up everything, including water, for the entirety of their pregnancy (such as a friend of mine who did it THREE times believe it or not), and even before nutritionists were around to throw guilt trips on people. I certainly do understand the importance of eating healthy and steadily, but the tone of this book came across to me as condescending and judgemental.I also walked away depressed from the \\"what could go wrong\\" chapter. They do balance the alarmist news with stats, but frankly i'd rather not hear about all the details. Tell me what could be bad signs and direct me to my doctor.There wasn't anything cool in this book (development pictures, descriptions of pregnancy symptoms) that you couldn't find online."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"It saved me from being worried about so many things - I am first time gregant"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I think this is a great book to have handy as a newly pregnant woman. I will admit that it got me a little paranoid at first but as my pregnancy went on I realized that this is only a guideline. Its a really great book to have for any little question you have that you don't want to call your doctor about. I am still refering to this book for answers and I am 8 months pregnant. Its not the kind of book that you need to read front to back but it's just great to have it just in case."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"Very interesting information yet a bit scary . I also read and listened to The Leclaire Hypnobirthing Bundle for Happy Hypnomoms and Blissful Hypnobabies. Together they gave me all the physiological and factual info plus all the psychological ,bonding and relaxing education that I needed. I let go of all the uneeeded info and focused on the power of my mind and the ease of my body. I found both extremely helpful in very different ways ."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I read A LOT of pregnancy books, and let me tell you, this is the best out of all the ones I've come across. This book does a great job of answering most of the questions you will have, and a lot of others you hadn't thought of. I really like how the complications are in their own seperate section- if you don't want to read them, they don't force them on you. In my experience, thats the main flaw of many other books. The eating plan was a little ridculous- skip it.In conclusion, I read a lot of other books, but I kept coming back to this one. No book is ever going to be perfect, but this is definately a must read for any pregnant woman."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"My OB gave me this book at my first prenatal visit and I probably leafed through it almost everyday of my pregnancy. Although I agree with many of the other reviewers that the book is fairly basic and deals primarily with the physical and medical aspects of pregnancy, I found the information contained in it to be quite accurate. In fact it helped me not to stress out about certain symptoms that I experienced and aided me in asking specific questions during my routine OB visits. Also, the format of the book makes it really easy to locate answers to specific questions. Still, this is a very basic, outline-type book and most women will benefit from reading another pregnancy book that moves beyond mere medical facts and what-if situations in addition to this one (this is where it comes in handy to develop a pregnancy and childbirth philosophy of your own along with your doctor/midwife and then read up accordingly). I also recommend that you look elsewhere for a more detailed pregnancy nutrition guide, as I found this one to be a bit confusing and uninformative. All in all, if you are looking for a general pregnancy guideline or starting point, this is the book for you."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I really like this book. My cousin gave me her copy (the newest edition) after she had her baby. She and I say that although the book may contain some scary material, it has been very helpful in many ways. If something came up during the night, we could look in the book and know whether we could wait overnight or to call the doctor immediately. This book has also saved us from having to call the doctor over the littlest things. Also, this book addresses many fathers-to-be concerns, and it contains helpful indexes, such as what to do if you're sick and what to expect postpartum. So even though the book may be a little scary, we still highly recommend it."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This book isn't meant to be read from cover to cover. It's like a dictionary - have it around to look up the topics or questions you have. It is not 100% perfect on every issue, but I don't think any book is, so you should have other books as well to create balance. It is helpful when you have concerns about a particular issue and need some general advice. Another book to read NOW is The No Cry Sleep Solution: Gentle Ways to Help Your Baby Sleep. The only thing that puts a dark cloud over life with a newborn is being woken up every hour and this book has a great section about getting a newborn to sleep better."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I really like this book! It's very informative and I've used it as a resource book as well as have read each chapter as I go through the pregnancy. I don't think it provides too much information...that depends on how much info the person wants and I like to have as much info as possible. I didn't find it scary or bossy or anything like that. It's a very honest, truthful account of being pregnant. I would definitely tell friends and family to read it as well as other books and information sources to obtain a good idea of what you're going through. This book has stood the test of time and revisions and has shown to outlast many other pregnancy books. My mother read this book when she was pregnant with me! I suggest buying the book and making up your own mind on what you think of it. I think alot of the other reviewers are being a bit too hard and need to lighten up."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"As soon as I found out I was pregnant, this was one of the first books I read, knowing it was one of the &quot;must reads&quot; for a mother-to-be. I think the book is a good reference point and a good place to start to someone who has no idea what dilation, meconium, or Braxton-Hicks means. The tone is slightly annoying, leaving something to be desired and the diet is a bit unrealistic (though I hear they changed it in the latest edition). Still, the information is formatted well and at least I seem to match up with all the symptoms as they typically arise. I'd say read this book and then research others that may be better suited to your philosophy (I like the Sears and Sheila Kitzinger personally). But knowing many pregnant women, including several of my friends, you don't read just one of these books anyway. :)"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I think it's always good to get a few books on any subject for crossreference and this one is definitely a good reference one to have.I went through a miscarriage and also am pregnant again and the book has addressed so much of what went on with me during the miscarriage and is giving me a heads up and explaining things during my current pregnancy.I found the book far from preachy and condescending. It was really informative, reassuring, and I kept an open mind and have read many other references online on the same subject. When I had a few symptoms that worried me, I went to the month I was in and lo and behold, that is what I was experiencing...talk about peace of mind! Not having to call my doctor about things helped me not feel so paranoid when I could read this in the comfort of my own home. It gives a lot of what is best case scenerio type stuff on what you should go for instead of something else to eat or what not, but I never found it to really say you HAD to do it. The diet is *just* a reference..nothing more..nothing less...and it's what my nutritionist gave me /shrug on a separate piece of paper. Do I follow it to the letter? No, but I do my best and that is all you can do. I'm thinking people who felt the book was talking down to them and that it is against mothers or something took things a little too much to heart and personal. It is easy to feel paranoid during pregnancy and guiltridden if you don't follow stuff that you read or are told to the letter. I felt a lot of it was merely a reference and I took it as such. Anyone looking for *the bible* on something like this, be wary of! I never look at information as the bible..I always cross reference :) just to be more safe.As in any reference book I've had in the past, I can read a bit then I have to put it down due to information overload. Then pick it up again and thumb through it to the area of interest. I felt this book helped keep my sanity.Definitely a great read!"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"A friend gave me this book during the first month of my pregnancy and I read it religiously throughout the next nine months. I love the way it is divided into sections month-by-month, and I found that the question and answer format covered almost every topic imaginable. Everyday I found myself consulting this book for the answer to one question or other (some that were extremely obscure, but that the book still managed to provide an answer to nevertheless)! I read this book alongside several others in order to be sure that I was receiving the most well-rounded outlook possible on the ins and outs of pregnancy, but overall I found this book to be the most useful."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I would recomend this book for anyone with a first time pregnancy. I thought it was very informative and helpful in a lot of situations. You are not going to call you Doctor at a every little pain or disturbance, you just open the book and read it and in most cases it's very soothing. I don't know about other people that thought it was a disturbing book, or with too much information. there is never TOO MUCH information. I think it's helpful to know MORE that you are suppose too."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I found that even though this book is well organized and is easy to read, it does not provide risks, side affects, and natural alternatives for many medical procedures presented. It encourages kind of a wait and see attitude in terms of preparing for labor and birth instead of really providing the information in a factual way so that women and think about and make the best informed decisions regarding procedures and meds. I found that to be somewhat irresponsible."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This book had every piece of information I needed when I was pregnant. It identified growth stages of the fetus by chapter so that I always knew how my baby was evolving that month. I didn't read the diet thing. My pregancy diet strategy: eat what I wanted. It was the only time in my life I was allowed to do that. So I put on a little weight. I lost it later. No biggie.Anyway, this book helped a lot when I was worried about things going on with my body. Toward the end of my pregnancy, I read and re-read the delivery chapter, and felt prepared. If you want tried and true advice and reliable medical information, this is the book for you."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"The free book the doctor gave me at my first appointment gave me more useful information than this book(and all the baby websites have more info as well). I didn't see the point in separating each month out. The what to expect this month were basically the same every month. There were questions and answers that should be organized by category not month. I did not read the entire book because I got bored with it but I do not remember any section on single mothers. Some of us are single not by choice and don't like reading about husbands and wives all the time."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I remember the first thing I did when I discovered I was pregnant with my first son was go out a purchase a copy of What to Expect When You're Expecting. This is a terrific resource for an expectant mother whether this is your first pregnancy or 4th. At times the book is a little clinical but the information is essential. I especially enjoyed the description of all the physical changes each month. I had the book with me throughout my whole pregnancy. In addition I used book to help me prepare any questions I might have prior to my doctors appointments."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I have found as a first time mother that WTEWYE was informative. However, it scared me more than helping me along the way. I became more frightened for my baby then before I read the book."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"The basic information and the organization of this book is OK, but it encourages too much pampering. Like other reviewers, I found it annoying and patronizing. Seems to cater mostly to stay at home suburban moms and moms-to-be, but I have a full time job/career and live in the city. The book needs to get real."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"We are halfway through our first pregnancy. Four months ago, we bought this book, along with Pregnancy, Childbirth, and the Newborn (Simkin) and Your Pregnancy Week-by-Week book (Curtis). Of the three, we like Simkin's book best, and Curtis's book the least. The What to Expect book, while not as informative as the Simkin's book, is in our opinion very good.Many of the things the other reviewers said about this book are true: the authors' diet suggestions border on the fanatical (it seems as if they are writing for obese parents-to-be), and the tone of the book is definitely patronizing. The amount of knowledge about the biological aspects of pregnancy is also minimal---the book is very light on technical terms and diagrams.However, if you click on the image of the book at the top of the screen, you will notice a sentence that highlights the strongest point of the book: &quot;...reassuringly answers the concerns of mothers- and father-to-be.&quot; We couldn't agree more.Several times throughout the pregnancy, my wife has had various symptoms that, while quite normal, were alarming for a first-time pregnant couple. Neither of the other two books said very much about these symptoms, but the What to Expect book reassuringly and accurately helped us evaluate whether the symptoms were anything to worry about. Examples are: Is extreme fatigue a sign of danger? Are nosebleeds anything to worry about? What about abdominal cramps during the second trimester? In most cases, the What to Expect was the best book of the three, allowing us to quickly find these concerns in the index, and read about them at length.Most importantly, the What to Expect book described the symptoms in sufficient detail to allow us to distinguish them from the truly serious.In short: there are many problems with this book. The month-by-month organization is not very useful, and there just isn't very much information about the biological aspects of pregnancy (Simkin's books provide that information very well). Sometimes, though, some of us just need to put that little bit of worry in our heads to rest. And this book helped us do just that.On a side note, I noticed that many reviewers accused this book of being alarmist. I found that the Curtis book was much more alarmist than the What to Expect book. Curtis's book might as well be named &quot;What Could Be Wrong with Your Pregnancy Week-by-Week.&quot; The What to Expect book at least groups the most fear-inspiring stuff towards the end, in a separate chapter."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I am an avid reader but I could not force myself to actually sit down & read this book. Pregnancy is an important event in a woman's life but that dosen't mean that all of the important information need to be presented in such a dull & drab way. I want humor, entertainment. The book is a good reference for individual questions but not a sit-down read."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This is the &quot;mother&quot; of all pregnancy books...and it talks as if it is your mother, guilt and all.

I don't really understand the negative reviews - it seems to me people are a. immediately assuming just because the book discusses problems in pregnancy that the book is implying that you should be worried about these things, and b. upset because the book doesn't discuss in detail things that come at the end of the pregnancy like breast-feeding and C-sections (this is because it is a book largely about pregnancy!)The only reason that I gave it four stars rather than five was because of the relentless emphasis on their Pregnancy Diet, which I thought was ridiculous. Obviously, you don't want to be eating a lot of junk food through the pregnancy, but the diet they propose is completely unrealistic. Otherwise, I would recommend this book highly!!!"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"Like any book, you must sift through things you agree with and things you don't. Filled with great bits of information for pregnancy, month by month - both typical and unusual. Easy to read and handy to reference.

A few others to pick up now: Baby Bargains, Baby Signs, and The No-Cry Sleep Solution."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I bought this book because I wanted something that would be a good resource and because I'd heard people rave about it. It was really helpful. I loved the information about what was going on each month as far as the baby's development. And the questions and answers really helped alleviate a lot of my concerns, as well as letting me know when I should think about contacting my doctor.My main complaint about the book was that a lot of the questions seemd to be sort of randomly distributed---what I was experiencing at four months was talked about in the seventh month. I realize every pregnancy is different, but it seemed that it might be better to address things by topic rather than by month.Overall, however, I was very happy with the purchase and would recommend it as one resource in your pregnancy collection."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"With doctors always rushing you at appointments, it's a lot easier to find answers to your questions in this book! Also, you don't have to be embarrassed. I absolutely loved it! It was very organized, and I'm shocked that there were some negative reviews at all. This book is a godsend, really. I found an answer to EVERY question I had, and I learned a LOT. I could probably write my own book now!!"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"Not a replacement for your doctor, but the closest you'll get. By that I mean no book will replace your obstetrition, but this book answers more questions then I thought possible.

I guess if you still have your &quot;pregnancy innocence&quot; it could be shocking to discover that problems can arise. However, I went through 3 years of infertility prior to conceiving our first baby. I was already well aware that things can and do go wrong in reproduction, so I entered pregnancy scared and paranoid. This book helped calm my fears. It addresses symptoms and problems in a clear, calm manner.In other books I've read, I felt like the authors were very condescending and &quot;patting me on the head&quot; saying &quot;don't worry your pretty little head about that. That rarely happens.&quot; WTEWYE doesn't do that. They clearly explain &quot;normal pregnancy&quot; while realizing that not all pregnancies are without some complications. The attitude is more like: &quot;Yes, most pregnancies are low-risk and perfect. Yours probably will be too. BUT, sometimes problems occur. These are the symptoms. Here's what can be done about it.&quot; Forewarned is forearmed.The diet section is MUCH improved over earlier editions. It's a kinder, gentler and far more realistic view of pregnancy nutrition. They acknowledge the psychological need for treats and that having a donut isn't going to doom your pregnancy. :)"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This book scratches the surface of what is is like to experience pregnancy.....keep looking"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This book was extremely helpful all during my pregnancy &amp; delivery.

This book can be very reassuring for the first time mother who is not familiar with all the changes her body may be going through. It is also a very helpful reference if you suspect that something may be seriously wrong with you. Of course, the authors suggest seeing a physician immediately if something should go wrong- and this book is not intended to take the place of adequate medical care. The only thing this book really lacks is an adequate description of what the actual birth experience is like; for this I recommend, The Girlfriend's Guide to Pregnancy (Iovine, 1995). This book is user friendly, and provides vicarious details of countless other women and their birth experiences. A good read."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"THIS BOOK REALLY HELPED ME WHILE I WAS HAVING AN ETOPIC PREGNANCY. I WAS AT HOME HAVING THE WORST UNBARABLE PAIN.

I couldnot put it down. I slept with this book. I carried it everywhere i went. This book was accurate and to the point with my pregnancy. I learned alot from it. I highly recommend this book. Unfortunately i don't have it anymore, but this is why i'm in Amazon.com so i can order it again. For a good reason of cause, I'm pregnant again!!!!"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"The explanations are simple and easy to follow. In contrast to the reactions of some other reviewers, we found this book to be upbeat, and much less judgmental than the other pregnancy books. This book was actually reassuring compared to Lamaze, etc. Our doctor was a real jerk who believed in hiding any negative contingencies from the mother -- the &quot;Don't worry your pretty little head&quot; factor -- and it was a great comfort to have an objective resource to double check with, at our leisure and in a comfortable setting. As to a &quot;pro-doctor&quot; bias, I found this book to be tolerant of alternative medical care, as well as tolerant in general. It is written so that ANY person can take something away from it -- without feeling guilty about their own personal decisions -- and is not aimed at a niche audience."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I got this book from my health insurance company (!) when I became pregnant for the first time. It was a starting point for my research about myself and my then unborn baby. Sufficed to say, I wasted a lot of money on books that weren't nearly as good and reassuring as this one.Simply stated, &quot;everyone's pregnancy is different&quot; - this book assured me that I was not a (completely) insane and to &quot;hang in there&quot; and ride the storm.I have few negative comments about the book - I'm actually struggling to find one to prove I've actually read it - trust me, though - I have - and you really must!!!I've lent my book out so many times (and never got it back) that I finally just started buying it for friends whenever they said they were pregnant - or even just thinking about it.Seriously though, buy it, read it and good luck with your pregnancy."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This is a must own book for all first time expecting couples. Not only is it wonderful for the expecting mothers, butfor the fathers too. It gives them a step by step of what ishappening to their spouses body. It has wonderful month bymonth pictures detailing the monthly changes. It also helpsexpecting moms to have on hands access to others first timemothers questions and answer. This book was very comfortingto me because as I am sure most new mothers feel, they have noclue as to whats happening to their body. WONDERFUL!!!"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I am newly preg too. I went out and got this book without reading any reviews. I sum it up this way: a pompous composition of contradiction and condescension. I can't stand the tone and the constant jabs seemingly mocking you and having a GREAT OLD TIME enjoying those pains you will be feeling! IE ..And all those trips to the bathroom to hug the toilet. Ha ha ha...Last night, I'm reading her stupid book and I get some good advice on what to do with your friends who are smokers. I would just not be near them while they smoke. Period. She says to threaten them with the law that protects non-smokers. Good idea...If that doesn't work, Ask them ALL TO QUIT because YOU are pregnant. And if that doesn't work try being nice. I don't know many smokers but I don't know even one who would smoke in a house or one who would smoke outside and blow the smoke in my face. Another comment that really got me..Take a good look at your slim waistline because won't see it for a LONG TIME! (Implied: OR Ever!) I take pride in keeping myself fit. I am a little freaked about the weight issue. I find that comment insensitive to a point of being twisted. What about the first-timers who are also former eating disorders --like me.Even the woman on the cover of this book looks like a Stepford Wife."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"An absolute must for the intelligent parent. This series is not for the paranoid (it will only make you more paranoid). This great easy to read book series (what to expect when you are expecting,... the first year... the toddler years) does just what it says it does. It is an incredible intelligent and often fun guide and if you have a medical problem it may help to ease your mind, it may not (that depends on your situation). However, If you can be rational and want to be aware, then run to get it,I love it."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I got this when I was pregnant with my 1st baby(1992). I found the info very comforting- as I am the type who sleeps better at night if I feel like I am well informed whatever is going on in my life- or with my body!!This book was SO extremely helpful to a mom-to-be who knew nothing except all the stories everyone else tells you about their pregnancies!! (my advise- don't listen!) Your pregnancy will be as individual as you are! Don't go into this with pre-concieved ideasfrom other people!!!I have had two healthy wonderful girls, and yes- I read the chapter on still birth- I wanted to be-- or at least TRY to be prepared for the worst case senario. Like I said facts and info are comforting to me- your imagination can be your worst enemy!! Both of my pregnancies were considered high risk...but this book comforted me with all the terrific info.I am now 42, and on the verge of becomming a mommy again for the 3rd time. I sold my WTEWYE book- thinking I was done having kids!(oops!!) Well, here I am on Amazon- buying this book AGAIN!! (It's that good!) Fads come and go -but facts get continually updated and an educated mommy is the very best kind!You cannot go wrong with this book! Cudos to the authors for putting together such a helpful resource! They have helped more pregnant women than they will ever know!!! I am extremely grateful!!"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This is indeed a great book that I think every expecting women should have. It can answer all my questons and concern.Some minor problems: the author says if air gets into your v...it will enter your bloodstream and make you sick, even die. I cannot understand how that happens so I asked my OB, and my OB agreed with me that no way this can happen."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I purposefully avoided this book when I got pregnant after reading and hearing so many negative things about it, but a friend had a copy and she gave it to me. I wouldn't call it my \\"Bible,\\" but it has been really useful. Yes, it's pretty medically-oriented and the diet is still overly restrictive, but I found the question/answer portions really helpful and they have added a section on complementary alternative medicine. I was also pleasantly surprised to find a really candid section on sex during pregnancy.Unlike others this didn't make me worried about everything that could go wrong. I found everything to be presented more of less matter of factly and without hysteria.All in all, I'm sorry I didn't have it from the beginning of my pregnancy. I find it to be a great resource and the most complete book I have."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"Anyone who is expecting a baby should have this book on hand. However!!!!For REALLY enjoyable reading about becoming a parent (and lots of laughs) I would highly recommend:\\"The Girlfriends' Guide to Surviving the First Year of Motherhood\\" by Vicki Iovineor\\"Be Prepared; A Practical Handbook for New Dads\\" Both of these books present most of the info you will need in a funny, lighthearted and much more digestible way."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"My OB/GYN gave this book when I became pregnant, like I think a lot of other doctors do across the country. I think it's kind of the bible for pregnancy. I poured over the book with each new day and feeling. I was interested in everything and this book gave me my fill of information (and more). It started to scare me and I found I was being over sensitive. Once I stopped reading every word, I appreciated it as a reference only. Then I relaxed and took everything in stride.When my son was born then I was given The What to Expect for First Year of Life. I use that as a reference as well - which is just as well as I don't have the same amount of time to read, with a little one."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I would recommend this book. I was given 2 when I got pregnant, and the information in it is good. I didn't like the diet the author wants us all to follow, because sometimes there's only certain things you can eat. Other than that, I'd say it's a good book overall."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I bought this book because I thought everyone bought this book when they find out they're pregnant. Isn't it the pregnancy bible or something?I found this book to be very helpful and very informative. Almost too informative...because a lot of the information scared me and made me overly anxious when certain things would take place in my pregnancy. It has a great index and a good format for going back to look up information. I was fine with the month to month format, but some people like week to week better. It all depends on your style and how you like to learn information.Even if you don't read every single word in this book, I would recommend taking a glance through it or having it for reference. It's got some great information and a lot of reading to lay the ground work for the beginning of preganancy. However, if you don't want to know all of the information EVER learned about pregnancy...then don't read this book."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"Everybody seems to know this book so I got one too. It's very average -- not the most technical, but not the most dumbed-down either. The tone is friendly and humorous, nice for when I wanted humor and compassion about my body during pregnancy. The month-by-month format was fun and gave me something to look forward to as I progressed through my pregnancy. In general, some of the information was helpful, but when I had a burning question I usually preferred the more thorough discussions in Penny Simkin's Pregnancy, Childbirth, and the Newborn."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"A friend gave me this book during the first month of my pregnancy and I read it religiously throughout the next nine months. I love the way it is divided into sections month-by-month, and I found that the question and answer format covered almost every topic imaginable. Everyday I found myself consulting this book for the answer to one question or other (some that were extremely obscure, but that the book still managed to provide an answer to nevertheless)! I read this book alongside several others in order to be sure that I was receiving the most well-rounded outlook possible on the ins and outs of pregnancy, but overall I found this book to be the most useful."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I really don't understand why this book has become &quot;the book&quot; to have. It's very basic and doesn't go into as much depth as I would like."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"At almost 600 page thick, WHAT TO EXPECT WHEN YOU'RE EXPECTING covers everything in a clear, month-by-month format starting from In The Beginning to Nine Months and Counting; from Last But Not Least to Of Special Concern to The Next Baby.Each section contains information on What You Can Expect; What You May Be Feeling; What You May Be Concerned About, &amp; What It's Important to Know.A worthy effort, impossible to rate because WHAT TO EXPECT WHEN YOU'RE EXPECTING is a fount of information, all you'll ever need to know &amp; then some!A great companion for everyone involved in the anticipation &amp; progress of this wondrous event, so you can all be on the same page, so to speak."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This was my BIBLE for my pregnancy. Everytime I had a question about something I just used the book for reference. This book follows your pregnancy month by month, and answers common questions that go along with the big event. Well laid out and organized, I recommend this book to every woman expecting."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"Everyone I know who has gotten pregnant in the last year, including myself, has not liked this book. My OB/GYN told me to take everything with a grain of salt. If you buy it, my advice would be to avoid reading the section concerning the rare complications that possibly could arise in pregnancy. If something goes wrong, you and your doctor will know and he/she will advise you. Also, avoid reading the diet section, unless you like diets and enjoy strict guidelines on what to eat. We all know what makes a healthy diet. You know better than to eat a box of cookies or a pint of ice cream a day, and if you do, so what. You don't need to constantly read that excessive weight gain is hard to lose. You know that too, and you're pregnant.I did like to look at this book on a monthly basis to get an idea of &quot;what to expect.&quot; There are some helpful Q&amp;As. Some, of course, are insipid and/or judgmental--remember that grain of salt.Also, don't pack everything for the hospital that this book suggests. Think about what you personally need. For example, do you really need a copy of &quot;What to Expect in the First Year&quot;?"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"Every question that needed to be asked, the book answered. There were no late night frights, waiting for doctors responses. I knew what was happening because the book was so informative. Books cannot include everything, but this one sure answered everything I needed to know, and made my pregnancy very comfortable. I was also alerted to troubles during pregnancy and when to call a doctor. I recommed this book to every pregnant woman I know, and gave mine to a friend."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"Almost every question you have will be asked and answered here. From what to expect while you're pregnant, what to eat, how to exercise, what to expect during labor and so on. This book has questions I never even thought of asking. Of course it's not going to fit everyone perfectly. That would be as impossible as having the perfect pregnancy and childbirth every woman desires. However this book covers alot and it's very easy to read because of it's format. My librarian who has three children recommended it to me and I have to pass along the recommendation."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I found this book very helpful when I was pregnant. I could find an answer to each question I had in mind (as that white fluid in the 4th or 5th month, or that glass of wine that I drank when I didn't know I was pregnant or what cerclage is). I liked also the way it explains each stage of the pregnancy.What it's absurd is the diet they suggest. It's simply unrealistic. You can omit that and the rest of the book is great."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I bought this book because a friend of mine had it when she had her kids. I figured I would get it and some of the stuff in it might be helpful. Everything was totally on track.. If I had questions, i didn't bother with asking other people, I went to my book first. My husband and I are working on baby # 2 and to better prepare our son for this blessed event, we ordered 2 books jsut for him from the same authors, &quot;what to expect when your mommy's having a baby&quot; and &quot;what to expect when the new baby comes home&quot;. I recommend this book to anyone and everyone."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This is the best book available on the subject . All through my pregnancy I was literally guided at every step . Questions and problems which baffelled even by doctor had their answer in the book . The layout of the book is most helpful especially for a first timer like me . I especially recommend the best odds food plan provided in the book . I started as an under weight mother and by simply following the diet guidelines in the book I was able to deliver a 3.2kg baby with myself in perfect health . Now I recommend this book to all my friends."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This book has an answer for ALL of your pregancy questions. I had a bit of bleeding during the first three months of my pregnancy and this book was the only one that explained why (and that 20% of women DO in fact bleed a bit during the first trimester). All other books pretty much prepared me for a miscarriage. Don't wait to give this book as a shower gift, get it as soon as the doctor says &quot;Yes, you're going to have a baby!&quot; It'll be your most calming friend."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This book certainly gives a lot of information, but it is biased against certain professionals. For instance, laboratory professionals are portrayed as mistake-makers (these are the people that do all your blood tests, etc.) The laboratory professionals I know are people with graduate degrees. I notice that 2 of the authors are nurses- they never once say that the nursing profession makes mistakes.I also agree with another reviewer that it has an alarmist attitude and the authors definately have their own ideas of what is right and wrong to do during a pregnancy. You'd think that drinking a soda or getting your hair highlighted is tantamount to shooting heroin in their eyes! Lighten up- pregnancy lasts 9 months, what's wrong with a glass of wine once in a while?"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"When I found out that I was expecting, this is the first book that I purchased. I didn't really like the book - the information seems a bit dated (like the information on exercise). I treated the book more like a reference book and used it to look up things like swollen ankles and feet or safe medications to take. Of all the books I purchased, I liked Your Pregnancy Week by Week by Glade B. Curtis and Judith Schuler. That book was a bit more informative."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"The writers of this book are very incredibly bossy and theysometimes don't seem to know what they are talking about. I found this book very frustrating. Their attitude is disturbing enough for me to give a negative review. Don't bother with this book. To give you an idea even the woman on the cover looksreally bummed out; probably from reading this book."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I was thoroughly disappointed in the quality of information in this book. The majority of it is common sense and I have only been able to refer to it a few times. When I purchased this book, I also bought \\"The Expectant Father,\\" (Brott/Ash) and found it to be much more useful. My spouse and I have even argued over who got to read it when because it is so interesting. Plus, I prefer the layout much more than the question-answer layout of \\"What to Expect...\\""},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"i felt like i was repeatedly being bashed over the head: &quot;you are a rotten mother and the baby hasn't even been born yet!&quot; i'm working hard to be a good mother and i don't need a lot of guilt for being less than perfect. i was extremely disapointed with this book. try your pregnancy week by week for info on the baby and the girlfriend's guide for useful, REAL info on what's happening to you."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I found the tone of this book condescending and sanctimonious, and the recommendations overly paranoid, as if they are afraid someone might sue them. Frequently they state that there is &quot;no known risk&quot; to something but then tell you not to do it anyway. That's my choice, a book should just tell me the risks or lack thereof! I have found much more balanced, sane advice in the book my OB gave me (some offical pub of the OB-GYN association). Also think they should reference weeks pregnant vs. months as no doc I know refers to months. The food info is highly paranoid. You can eat a very healthy diet and still allow yourself a treat now and then, all without putting your baby at risk!"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I bought this book last year when I was pregnant with my first child becuase that is what you are &quot;supposed&quot; to do, right? While I did eagerly look forward to checking what my baby would look like every month, and what organs (and such) were developing), I did not put too much faith into the book. The diet that it expects you to follow is rediculous (who doesn't eat any sugar or white flour for 9 months?). Plus, the information on breastfeeding is so outdated as to be dangerous (the book actually says that you should wean by 12 months because the baby will not get adequit nutrition after that. This is ABSOLUTELY FALSE! The American Academy of Pediatrics reccomends breastfeeding for AT LEAST 12 months and for as long afterward as both the baby and mother want to). I feel if this book really wanted to do some good, it wouldn't preach about every little thing you eat when pregnant, and would be more encouraging about breastfeeding. I mean, come on, let's get our priorities straight!"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"Having read all the reviews on this book and many others I purchased 4 books. I read this one first and wish I hadn't read it at all. This is my first baby so I wanted to learn as much as possible. However this book has done nothing but scare me to death about the months ahead. It concentrates on everything that can go wrong or already has gone wrong in a previous pregnancy and what to expect next. Yes I want to know what's in store but this book is not encouraging in the slightest. If you do actually have problems it is probably very informative. First chance I get I am selling this to the secondhand book store. I would not recommend any first timers to read this."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I'm actually throwing this book away. I'm not even pregnant yet, just trying, and I already feel like I've screwed up my pregnancy. I have been advocating a more natural birth for myself, without doctors and IVs and the typical interventions, and this book has made me feel that unless I consent to invasive procedures, receiving pain medications, allowing my labor to be measured by everyone else's standards, or being cut wide open, that I will have somehow &quot;let down the team&quot;, or will bring on the horrible situations outlined in the book that can go wrong as a result.I'm going to try Dr. Sears' book; it has been highly recommended for women like me who want to try for a natural birth if it's possible. I don't want to feel guilty or worried to death about my choice, and that's exactly how this book made me feel!"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I loved the book What to Expect When You're Expecting ... reading it cover to cover through BOTH of my pregnancies ... referring to it often ... recommending it to friends. I truly enjoyed following the month by month outline of 'what to expect'. And I found answers to many small questions that I never seemed to remember to ask when at the doctors office.BUT!!!!! The more I've learned about breastfeeding ... and the longer that I've breastfed ... the less and less I like the &quot;What to Expect&quot; series information on nursing. To me it seems VERY inaccurate and even misleading at times. I find it hard to beleive that an author who is so knowledgeable about prenatal health and general nutrition can be so ill informed about breastfeeding. I would think that much of the information would be discouraging to new moms and to mothers who encounter difficulties. Rather than encouraging us to find alternatives or solutions to problems the books seem to say ... &quot;Oh well, it may not work for you.&quot;So while I do feel that this book and it's follow-up books are valuable prenatal and childcare resources, the amount of incorrect information they contain concerning breastfeeding prevents me from buying the book for friends who are expecting, or even from recommending the book to them. I hope that the author will consider providing more factual breastfeeding information to her readers in future editions of the book ... or at least leaving out the negative misinformation."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I honestly don't know how this book got so popular, as a labor doula, I can honestly say that Naomi Wolfe and others are right about this book. IT's alarmist and condescending and woefully incomplete."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I had already bought this book before my OB warned me to stay away from it. After reading it, I understand why she dislikes it. There is a lot of factually incorrect information in the book. For example, the author tells you to consider getting rid of any pets you may have before the baby is born, because pets will cause the baby to have allergies. I guess she knows more than the American Medical Association, which has stated that having at least two pets during your baby's first year will make her immune to pet allergies. I wonder how many pets have been dumped off at the pound thanks to Murkoff's irresponsible journalism.Also, I found Murkoff's &quot;Best Odds&quot; diet, completely unrealistic. Most women can barely stomach food during their first trimester let alone eat all the fruit, vegetables, milk, meat, etc. that Murkoff says you must eat to give your baby the best chance for health. She also tells vegetarians they need to eat almost six servings of beans a day, and as a vegetarian, I can attest that this isn't possible. Pregnancy is the one time in your life that you should be able to indulge a little without feeling guilty, so enjoy it!Finally, what my OB says she dislikes most about this book, is that Murkoff makes women feel bad by telling them exactly how much they should gain each trimester, and warning them that if they go over that amount they are overeating, being irresponsible and will have a very hard time losing it. My OB says she has had women cry in her office after being weighed in, because the book made them feel so guilty. You have enough to worry about when you're pregnant besides every pound you gain, and weight gain during pregnancy varies widely among women. During my sister's pregnancy, she gained 27 lbs., her best friend gained 50, and her coworker gained 70. A year later, they are all at their pre-pregnancy weight and have healthy babies.If you're looking for a good book with accurate information, I recommend &quot;The Mayo Clinic's Guide to Pregnancy and the First Year&quot; instead."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I HATE this book. I rushed out to buy it when my husband and I were trying for #1 (who is now 21 months old). It is practically militant in its views about diet- in what universe is a bagel a once-a-week treat?? This book did not help me at all. Its tone is condescending, its answers pat, and basically, while reading it I felt like there was no way I could ever be a good mom. I know it's the one everyone buys, but I think it's just because they don't know better. Even my OB said she doesn't recommend it to patients because it freaks too many of them out!We're expecting #2 now, and I got this book out again, but as you can see I'm back on Amazon looking for a better book this time around."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This book is mostly other peoples questions and simple answers to them. It may be somewhat helpful to a first time mother with no experience but definitely not helpful to a second time Mom or someone more experienced looking for deeper answers to not so common questions. This book also says practically nothing about the growing baby inside you, the thing that interests me the most!"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This was the first book I went out and got when I found out I was pregnant, despite some of the reviews I've read here. I wouldn't say I regret doing so, but I will say that I do not think this book is the be-all, end-all, nor does it live up to all the hype!I did not care so much for the question and answer format of each Chapter. The only nice thing about it is that I could easily skip through questions that did not pertain to me or that I knew the answer to etc. To be honest- I did a LOT of skipping through this book. There seemed to be a lot of information that just plain did not apply to me or for that matter a lot of people. I have to agree with those who said this book is filled with a lot of \\"problem pregnancy\\" situations. Quite a lot. Did it scare me? Maybe a little at first, but now it just makes me so glad I've had such an easy going pregnancy overall!I'm not sure if I'd really recommend this book to someone, I don't think so. I think instead I'd recommed Pregnancy- Week by Week or The Mother of All Pregnancy books. Those I pretty much read cover to cover and found about everything useful."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"The readers that say this book will scare you are right. The diet recommendations are absolutely impossible to follow (who can eat 11 servings of grains, 3 servings of protein, 4 glasses of milk and still have room for various fruit and vegetables, all in one day?). The Question+Answer format was not my favorite. This is my first pregnancy and I wanted a guide through the different stages of my body changing and my baby growing. \\"The mother of all pregnancy books\\" was a bit more helpful in this respect. I still think that \\"what to expect...\\" is a good reference manual, but I got bored pretty fast when going through it. I wouldn't recommend it as the sole book you want to read."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This book is highly overrated. I was very disappointed---it seems to need updating in many areas. If you are wanting info on natural childbirth stay far away from this book--it approaches pregnancy and birth from a very &quot;medical&quot; viewpoint.Dr. Sears books....like The Birth Book is SOOO much better---It is more up to date and very unbiased."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"As far as some of the medical info goes, this book can be helpful if you cant get a hold of your doctor and something is worrying you. Plus, the section at the beginning of each month can be fun to read through and to compare what your tummy looks like compared to the illustration. BUT- like a lot of the other moms have said in ther reviews- Why in the world are they trying to terrify poor pregnant women? The whole book made me uneasy during my first pregnancy. I can have this kind of red dye in foods, but not this other kind because it will cause cancer? Dont eat grilled foods? Dont eat anything with white flour or suger because all these awful things will happen? Come on. Billions of pregnant women have eaten pretty much what they wanted fromt he beginning of time, and thier babies were just fine. As long as you use common sense when it comes to eating (meaning, eat some veggies and make sure you get some protien and calcium in there) you'll be fine. If in a moment of weakness you eat three peices of cheesecake for dessert, the only one that will suffer from it is you. The baby will be fine and dandy. Somehow, even though the tone seems friendly, the authors of this book can make you feel like a failure. I would go to the bookstore and page through some pregnancy books before buying this one. There are far better ones out there then this, despite the popularity. And I absolutely reccomend A Girlfriends Guide to Pregnancy. Now that book tells it like it really is. Some women may not agree with EVERYTHING it says, but it is definately realistic."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"With the benefit of hindsight, this was by far the worst book that my wife and I read before our triplets were born. I recommend if you want to know everything that might go wrong and need a reason(s) to visit the doctor for mood altering perscriptions. Honestly, this book was a waste of space. We actually threw it out. One star is way to many."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"Here it is plain and simple. This book spoon-feeds information and does not provide accurate details regarding the risks of standard medical care.Read Henci Goer The Thinking Woman's Guide to Pregnancy, and Janet Balaskas' Active Birth and you will be done, and educated. Half the battle is finding evidence based information that cites reliable sources (I know, I just said the same thing twice!) It is not as easy, but you can do it, and it is the beginning of a lifetime of making truly informed decisions about your baby and your body. Or if you really want to get educated, read this and the others I recommend and take notes on the areas where they differ, then go take a look at the sources and read those."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"After seeing so many horrid reviews of this book, I had decided not to read it. Then a friend gave it to me, and I'm so glad she did! I can honestly say that I got much more information out of this book than from any of the others I read.One of the major criticisms of &quot;What to Expect&quot; has been that it has &quot;too much&quot; information, listing every possible pregnancy complication. I call that being comprehensive, not scary. It's very frusterating to have a question and NOT be able to find an answer in your reference book. Yes, this book lists every possible symptom and complication under the sun, but that doesn't means you have to read about them! The format makes it easy to skip topics that do not relate to you personally. And the really scary stuff is confined to a chapter labeled, &quot;When There's a Problem.&quot; Chances are, you won't need this chapter, and if not, don't read it! But if you do end up facing a complication, you'll be happy to have the information handy. No pregnancy book is going to be custom-fit to your experience, addressing only the things YOU want to hear about and leaving out the rest. Frankly, I'd rather have too much information rather than too little.I found that this book had a reference to almost any question I had, and for the most part, it was addressed in a factual, non-biased tone. If the authors have strong opinions on such controversial topics as pain relief and breastfeeding, I couldn't tell. I appreciated that they presented both sides of the arguement and trusted me to make the decision.The one problem with this book is the nutrition section. If you read it at all, skim it. I had real difficulty eating during my entire pregnancy, and just couldn't choke down the minimum amounts of protein, veggies, etc. I talked to my doctor about it, and she told me that if you ate everything the book says to eat, you'll gain 500 pounds. My baby was a healthy eight pounds, even though I gained less than twenty.Another thing really appreciated was the discussion of miscarriage. Yes, it's the last thing you want to read about when you're pregnant, but I had a friend who was due the same time as me and lost her baby at twelve weeks. The book gave me some insight as to how she might be feeling and ways to comfort her. Relating to a friend who has miscarried is something we (as a society) really don't talk about much, but most of us who are of childbearing age will probably face at some point. I also thought that the inclusion of the subject would help a mom who has miscarried not to feel &quot;abandoned&quot; by the book after she gets the sad news.The bottom line is, &quot;What to Expect&quot; is probably not the best for those who are choosing to have an alternative delivery. There are much better books out there for those who want to have an unmedicated birth, no testing, etc. But for the vast majority of pregnant women (in America, anyway) who plan to give birth in a hospital with an MD in attendance, this book is a great reference, and will probably answer every question. I read it in conjunction with &quot;The Pregnancy Book&quot; (Sears) and found this one to be much more informative on a much wider range of topics."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This book is terrible. Alarmist and very &quot;doctor knows best&quot; and treats moms-to-be as if they can't think for themselves. Completely ignores hollistic and natural pregnancy approaches; has only 2 paragraphs on home birth in all 600 pages. Very much a &quot;pat on the shoulder&quot; attitude like you'd get from the architypical elderly male OB. Still assumes you're going to give birth in a hospital, on your back. Don't bother with this one."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I got this book when pregnant for the first time. That pregnancy ended in miscarriage--a lot of these reviews mention that the book is not helpful or misleading when dealing with miscarriage symptoms/dignosis--but miscarriage is very mysterious, and no book can cover all possible miscarriage situations, that's what your Dr. is for .Now that I'm pregnant again, I find this book helpful as a reference for symptoms and very thorough in covering what to expect in labor.I don't agree with their preachy approach to pregnancy eating--even when they say you can cheat, they recommend a &quot;muffin flavored with natural fruit juice...&quot; Come on! Pregnancy is hard enough without denying yourself occasional cookies or ice cream. The implication that every bite of junk food you eat could be harmful to your baby is over the top and unrealistic.I recommend it as a reference for how you may be feeling during pregnancy, physically and mentally, as it's been very accurate in my case, but some of the advice is a bit too rigid for me."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This book is over the limit. I would like to meet one person who actually followed the best odds diet. I bought this book first after knowing i was pregnant and until I read all these other reviews, I used to agonise that something was wrong with me because I couldnt possibly eat all that is recommended in the&quot;Best odds&quot; diet. She makes it sound as though it is a crime to indulge once in a while on pizzas and a dessert. I literallywalked around the first 2 mnths with this book in my handwhile doing grocery shopping !The other thing that drove me nuts is that there is hardlyany information on how the baby is developing etc. I am stilllooking for a better book that is more down to earth..."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This book was a big disapointment! it focuses almost entirely on the mother and nothing on the baby. The main thrust of this book is that almost anything can happen in a pregnancy, but it's nothing to cause worry....&quot;i have morning sickness,&quot; &quot; i don't have morning sickness&quot; blah blah blah. I would have liked to find out what was going on with my baby, how big is it, does it have fingers yet? This book made me feel like I was gearing up for nine months of medical maladies, not a wonderful blessing. Focus on the baby, or at least mention it please!!!!"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I am a first time mother-to-be, so I wouldn't agree that this books helps first time mothers in any way. The book offers SOME useful information, but is so focused on the diet that you feel like you are reading a &quot;how to diet when you are pregnant&quot; book. Please...you are pregnant for the first time, working, and throwing up all day-- do you really say, &quot;no, I won't eat ice cream, because my baby will hate me&quot;? No, not if you are normal. This book was recommended to me by people, but I have not been blown away-- the questions that they talk about are basic questions that you can get answers to off of websites like www.babycenter.com or others. Plus, the focus is so much on diet that you feel like you're doing something wrong throughout the day and isn't being pregnant stressful enough? If you want to read a book that focusses on the SAME issues in a good way, read &quot;advice from a pregnant ob&quot;. AWESOME book and talks about all the stuff this one does, but in a more down to earth way. This author (who is a doctor) actually eats ice cream, drinks soft drinks, etc. She advises healthy eating in a way that easier to follow w/out feeling horrible all the time."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This book was extremely helpful to a 1st Time Mother like myself. However, it wasn't till I started looking at other books that I realized this is just a start. A book on Pregnancy Week By Week gave me more information and details which helped me along my pregnancy. &quot;What to expect....&quot; was worth the money I spent but I suggest looking at other books that talk about the same topic to get a more rounded view."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I have to admit, I was browsing Amazon.com for books about pregnancy, and when I saw all the bad reviews about this book, I decided not to buy it.Then one day I was in the grocery store in line and they had the book for sale so I picked it up and started looking at it, got interested, and ultimately took it home to discover...That I don't understand what the problem is! My honest opinion is that this is an excellent book with more information than most pregnancy books. I have to say that those who believe that this book makes you feel guilty, is unrealistic about diet and medications, etc., are simply people who don't want to subordinate their interests to those of the baby. I HATE wheat bread but I'm eating it because I know I need the vitamins and nutrients.SO MUCH ABOUT PREGNANCY IS A MEDICAL MYSTERY SO THE UTMOST OF CAUTION IS BEST, AND THAT IS WHAT THIS BOOK RIGHTFULLY ADVOCATES, CAUTION. A CHILD IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IN THE WORLD, IF WE ARE NOT WILLING TO MAKE SOME MINOR (OR MAJOR) LIFESTYLE CHANGES FOR THE HEALTH OF OUR CHILDREN THEN WE DON'T DESERVE CHILDREN IN THE FIRST PLACE.This book deserves more credit than it is getting."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I am SO glad that I read this book at a friend's house! It kept me from spending the money on something that would have gone straight into the trash can anyway.This book is biased toward the &quot;trust your doctor and the hospital blindly, no matter what insane procedures and interventions they want you to have&quot; context, instead of listing and going over the pros and cons of every option, such as hospitals, birth centers, homebirth, pain meds versus natural childbirth, waterbirth, the Leboyer method, etc. Actually, she does mention home and water births briefly, but only to basically say that you shouldn't have either one. She actually says that you shouldn't have a waterbirth because of the risk of the baby drowning. I admit, when I first heard about waterbirth a few years ago, I thought the same thing, but now that I know more about the mechanics of birth and have seen and heard of many a safe, joyous waterbirth, my mind has been changed. The risk of the baby drowning is practically nil, and it's probably a lot safer for a baby to be gently born in a tub of warm water in a dimly-lit room and being handed right to the mother instead of being yanked by the head into bright flourescent lights with a pair of salad tongs and slammed onto a cold, metal scale. I'll bet Ms. Aisenberg didn't even do any research on the safety of waterbirth. It just differed too much from what she considers a &quot;normal&quot; birth, so it must be wrong, in her eyes. She also flat out says that a lay midwife will not give you optimal care, but doesn't even go on to say why she believes that. (Personally, I think a lot of lay midwives have more brains than OB doctors when it comes to the physiology and mechanics of birth. At least they aren't ruled by fear like many OBs are.) She makes you feel like you are selfish if you want to labor walking around instead of hooked up to an EFM for hours, as if you dare to step out of that belt for even a second, your baby will surely shrivel up and die and it'll be all your fault.And she DOES mention the increasing C-section rate, but get this, she decries people who point out that bad medicine causes high C-section rates, and actually says that it is because of GOOD medicine that more C-sections are performed. Anyone who truly believes that 1 in 4 women cannot give birth the way God intended is insane. Period. In 1970, the C-section rate was 1 in 20, and the infant and maternal mortality rates then aren't much different from the ones now. And countries with LOW C-section rates actually have some of the LOWEST infant and maternal mortality rates in the world. What does that tell you? Obviously, there are very serious risks to having a C-section, but Ms. Aisenberg would rather not cover them. She'd rather just present a C-section as an alternative way for a baby to be delivered, and not as an emergency procedure to be used as a last resort and only when absolutely necessary. (A C-section is MAJOR ABDOMINAL SURGERY, by the way. You wouldn't think so from reading Ms. Aisenberg's presentation of it.)First-time mothers, please, please, PLEASE leave this book on the shelf. The only reason that everyone buys it is because it has the catchiest title. If you are a first-time mother (like I am hoping to be soon), and you TRULY want to know ALL your options as far as birth goes, such as hospital birth, birth centers, homebirth, waterbirth, doctors versus midwives, pain meds versus natural birth methods, prenatal testing such as ultrasound and amniocentesis as well as the honest truth about the risks and benefits of each choice and procedure, get &quot;The Complete Guide to Pregnancy and Birth&quot; by Sheila Kitzinger. She has great details, and I thought that she was very unbiased. She also talks to you like you are a competent adult capable of making informed decisions. Another good book is Dr. Sears &quot;The Birth Book&quot;.Do yourself a favor. Stay away from this book. Pregnancy is not a disease (for most people), and childbirth is not a big disaster waiting to happen (95% of all births progress normally, IF you don't intervene with them). Enjoy your pregnancy, and the birth of your baby."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I had this book in my pregnancy/ birth library and I did refer to it. I admit that I liked the information on what was going on with baby. But, beyond that I really didn't get much out of this book. I assumed that this book was all I needed (heck, many of my friends only read this one) but I soon realized we were all wrong!There are *Better,* *More complete,* *More helpful pregnancy books out there!! The 2 that come to mind are \\"The Pregnancy Book\\" by Dr. Sears and \\"Pregnancy, Childbirth and the Newborn\\" by Penny Simkin. Both will tell you much more than this book and should be the go-to books for expectant moms. I am sure that some moms will dismiss those suggestions because they fear they are \\"biased\\" and won't be helpful but they should know that this book is biased too. And this book also has some holes and faulty information. Those other 2 are much more solid.The authors are not birth or medical professionals. They do not provide research to back up their opinions either.I think there are some moms that don't want to be informed or involved in their pregnancies and birth beyond the superficial. I know that that works for a lot of moms- they can't miss what they don't know. It didn't work for me though. I will always be grateful to my friend for lending me the Dr. Sears' book and Penny Simkin's book. I loved learning as much as I could about this experience. \\"What to Expect...\\" was just not enough for me."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This is really a terrible book. I feel so sorry for young, impressionable women who read and believe the junk written in it. The only women who would really find this helpful are ones who do not feel the need to think or decide things for themselves, who would rather have someone just tell them what to do than actually consider what they want.I bought this book, like every other first time mother that I know - prior to my first child's birth 19 years ago. Luckily, it wasn't the only one I bought! The cover and title looked homespun and comforting, the contents initially scared the daylights out of me, then just made me really angry.This book treats pregancy and childbirth like a disease, fraught with perils and suffering. Furthermore, it treats it like a disease you're far too stupid and ill-equipped to cope with on your own. There is no empowerment to trust your own body or spirit. There is no encouragement to see the beauty and power and the great things about being pregant and becoming a mother.I recommend \\"The Complete Book of Pregnancy and Childbirth\\" by Sheila Kitzinger. I admit it's a little \\"hippie\\", but it empowered me to have three healthy pregancies and three natural childbirths free of medical interventions."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"Although this book contains a lot of information, much of it is delivered in a preachy, finger-pointing, and condescending way. I'm a perfectionist and want to be the best mom I can be, but there is no way I could do everything this book suggested. And by the time I finished reading the different concerns/complications of every possible problem that could arise, I was nearly panicked. It was overwhelming for me, being a first-time mom, and already worried about everything anyway... It just didn't seem to be based in reality."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"There is a lot of good medical information in this book, however there is so much information on things that could go wrong that it could leave a first time mom worried. The information on breastfeeding is inadequate at best and moms who plan to breastfeed should not rely on this book."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I bought this book because it was one of the first things I heard when someone learned we were pregnant for the first time. I hated it and put it down almost immediately. It should be titled &quot;What might go wrong with your pregnancy - you better start worrying now!&quot; Pregnancy is a wonderfully exciting time. Moms-to-be need positive information and support because everyting is so new and unfamilar. I strongly recommend The Pregnancy Book (Sears) or Your Pregnancy:Week by week (Curtis) for moms to keep track of how the baby is developing over the pregnancy. What's the point of being negative and scary?"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I was given this book by a friend and in the early weeks of pregnancy found it useful. However, the sections on healthy eating - the Best Odds Diet - can leave you feeling anxious and that you are failing. The authors gloss over the fact that many women suffer sickness that makes any eating almost impossible and the Best Odds Diet a joke! A section on how to deal with morning sickness and nutrition before giving lists of foods that you must eat, would reassure women who struggle to eat anything, let alone a Daily Dozen. Buy this book and use it for reference, but read lots of other books alongside."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK! It is not even written by a doctor, nor is the information that accurate! It will make you INSANE during pregnancy. The advice is stringent and makes you feel as if you cannot even take a sip of water out of the faucet without thinking of all the harmful effects it will do to your baby! STay away from this book!!! There are sooo many better ones out there"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"this book will make you worry, consider every worst case scenario possible (in the middle of the night). it's demeaning, and i wish i never bought it. big, big mistake. go with the pregnancy book by sears instead."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This is a book that tells you evetything that can go wrong in your pregnancy. I found it to be filled with many questions that just indice fear. I asked my doctor and he said it is the worst pregnancy book ever written. He said \\"Pregnancy Weekly\\" is much better and I found it to be so helpful and informative,unlike this book. I know it is incredibly popular, but it scared me half to death with all of its do's and don'ts. I say get another book. This one is terrible."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"Be afraid, be very afraid, seems to be the purpose of this book. Be afraid of birth, be afraid of your body and be afraid to be fat. This book will prepare you only to be a frightened, demure, good little patient, with a medicalized birth full of procedures and a subsequent &quot;emergency&quot; C-section. This technocratic freebie is astonishingly outdated and promotes very unhealthy weight management that may CAUSE complications! This book tears down women's confidence in themselves and their ability to give birth with a condescending tone and a bias that states: DOCTOR=GOD. I received much more useful birthing information from books such as &quot;Husband Coached Childbirth&quot; by Robert A. Bradley MD, &quot;Choosing Waterbirth&quot; by Lakshmi Bertram and &quot;Primal Mothering in a Modern World&quot; by Hygeia Halfmoon Phd. Your pregnancy/birth will be as beautiful or as miserable as YOU believe it will be. Trust your body and your baby."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This is one of the worst books for pregnant women. It is scary and will provoke anxiety. Try to read something a little more kind - like The Pregnancy Book by Dr. William Sears. Get good solid information without a lot of bad advice. Become the expert on your pregnancy."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"Firstly, if you are prone to worry or suffer any type of anxiety disorder or hypochondria, as I do, avoid this book like the plague! The day after I found out I was pregnant, I was in shock and very much afraid of what lies ahead so I went to a bookstore and picked up \\"What to expect...\\" In the first few days I had it my husband tried to hide it from me twice because what I was reading upset me so much. Then one night I had something happen that I immediately looked up in the book and found it in the emergencies section. I went to pieces and was ready to rush to the ER. Instead I called the OB on call at the hospital and told him my problem. I was relieved to find out that this particular thing I had was of absolutely no concern in early pregnancy. And that is the problem with the emergenciessection...there is not even any indication of what these \\"emergencies\\" mean. It just says if such and such happens, call 911. This book is chock full of things to scare the pants off you-whether your're prone to nerves or not-and things to make you feel like you are simply not good enough to be carrying a child. Like so many others, I also findthe whole diet bit unnerving. They make out that if you eat a cookie your baby is going to come out with three eyes and a tail. Once a month treat yourself to something terribly wicked: a slice of cake or pie; an ice cream sundae or a candy bar. Oh golly gee!!! Can we *really* be that naughty?! There is far too much emphasis on weight gain, being inadequate and potential health problems. I give the book a big \\"blah\\" overall."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I don't remember becoming scared at the mention of scenarios where things could go wrong, like other women have said. I do remember combing it over like a fine-toothed comb, and it had almost enough information to quench my thirst for knowledge as a new mother. I did find it lacking when it came to natural childbirth information, and when I came back to read it after being a childbirth professional for several years, I was a little disappointed at the promotion of medical intervention. However, I think this book is quite valuable.Kelly TownsendAuthorChrist Centered Childbirth"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This was a wonderful book to read for ME, but as I learned after reading several books, is that there will never be one book that is the best for everyone. I'm a nurse and had worked briefly in OB. I was fairly confident throughout my pregnancy but very inquisitive. This book was perfect for me. But for anyone who is nervous and apprehensive and prone to psycho-somatic ideas (where you think every symptom is happening to you, when it really isn't)then this may not be the book for you. Some complained it spoke too much of horrific things that can happen but I had no problem reading these things as information, not prediction. It is a wonderful book for the right type of person. It is also an easy read."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I referred to this book right from the beginning - 6 weeks into pregnancy and it's worth reading every page! It's great to 'know' things - the name says it all. It prepared me well about what all can happen, what symptoms to watch for and what all precautions have to be taken. Finally the day before my baby was born (2 weeks before due date) when I was alone at home and had no pain but started a 'bloody show', I knew what it was! I drove to the hospital myself without panicking - the credit goes to this book!The book tells you everything that your doc will not have time to tell you!"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"We've got two sons ages 14 and 2 1/2 so they are really spread out. We kind of winged it with the first but the second was tougher due to my wife being in her late 30's when she gave birth. While the book does cover giving birth after 35, I would have liked to have seen it go into great depth regarding this subject since there are so many women now having babies into their late 30's and 40's. My wife was also a gestational diabetic during her pregnancy with our second son, complicating matters that I wish had been covered in the book.That said, the book is very helpful no matter how many kids you've had already. The information on diets alone is worth the price of the book even though her's was changed drastically due to the diabetes. My wife wasn't working full-time during the second one so she had less back ache and foot swelling but there's great advice there about how Dad can make mom more comfortable. The information on weight gain is especially helpful as this is often the mom-to-be's most sensitive issue to deal with. Ultimately the chapter that men should read the most is on labor and delivery if you have any plans of being present (and you SHOULD be present!) in the delivery room to help calm your wife and do whatever you need to do to help. I think the section on C-sections is a bit sparse so I'm glad we never had to deal with it. And of course chapter 17 is totally devoted to fathers although most of it is about psycological issues such as dealing with moodiness, handling the delivery room, etc.This is still the best book of its kind!"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"As a first time mother, I was very anxious to get started reading about what to expect in my nine months of pregnancy. The beginning of the book was great, answering a lot of questions about early pregnancy and the tests that follow at the doctor's office. However, reading month by month, I found that around the fifth month, the book began to offer some suggestions that could drive you crazy. I know the authors are trying to be thorough, but this thoroughness can lead a woman with a perfectly normal pregnancy to become paranoid. For example, it tells you to count kicks every day once you begin to feel movement. I found my baby's movement to be somewhat erratic and began to worry that something was wrong. With every question I seemed to have in my second and third trimesters, I began to grow more and more paranoid to the point where I had to have my husband hide the book from me and continuously bother my doctors for reassurance that nothing was wrong. Again, I know the authors have to be thorough, but if you have a good, healthy pregnancy, I feel that this book can just create a lot of unnecessary stress and worry."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I first bought this book 15 years ago on my first pregnancy and it helped me a great deal. I was given a newer edition on my second pregnancy 7 years later and I still found it contained a lot of good information about pregnancy and what to realistically expect. It is very informative for someone who is new to mother hood and also for fathers as well. I am surprised at some of the other reviews because I found this book helped me a great deal in understanding the different stages of pregnancy and the issues and joys associated with each. It is surprisingly close to the real experiences and very easy to follow. I gave one to my niece who just had a baby and she found it to be excellent. I am giving one to another niece (she requested it having hear so much about it) and I recommend it.I also bought &quot;What to Expect the First Year&quot; and it was equally excellent.Buy both or borrow them from the library. Doctors recommend it as well. In fact &quot;What to Expect When Expecting&quot; is part of your first visit package from most good obstetricians for the last several years."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I read this book and &quot;Your pregnancy week by week&quot; together. I really enjoy having some reading to do at each stage. But I found that its good to double check with the doctor on a lot of that information."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"Like many, this was the first book I went out and bought when I found out I was pregnant. I didn't read any reviews on the book beforehand and was a little shocked at some of the reviews I've read since then. I've waited to review this book until I got substantially into it.So far I've read from the front cover all the way up through the 6th month. I've found the book to be very informative. I've found the Q&amp;As it has for each month to be helpful in some cases. Sure, some of these don't pertain to me, and some of them do seem a little out there, but we're all different and I assume the authors are trying to reach out to various audiences.Typically I read ahead about a month so if my readings prompt any questions, I can have a list of questions ready for my doctor.I also found the information on child-birthing classes very informative. All this info was presented in the 6th month chapter (right about when you should really start getting involved in that stuff). It gave a brief synopsis on the different types of classes, what you can expect, and even references to find out more about certain type of classes or how to find a class in your area. Very helpful!Further ahead in the book there's a \\"what to do\\" if you end up having to deliver the baby yourself. Most people probably won't need that but it's nice to know that it's there if you do. Obviously not a substitute for a doctor, but better than doing it blind. There's also chapters on labor and delivery and postpartum topics.Like some others have stated in their reviews, some topics deal with rarities that may evoke paranoia in some, but I'd rather be prepared knowing the warning signs of some stuff.So far the only downside I've found to this book has to do with the way that they present the progression of the baby's growth. They list what's happening in the beginning of each month chapter but don't say when during the month you can expect it. With the rapid growth of the baby, a couple weeks can make a big difference.Overall, I've found this to be a valuable reference book, however I wouldn't make this your only book."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I bought this book when I became pregnant with my first child. I read it almost everyday, figuring that b/c it was so highly recommended it would answer most of my questions. Which it did. However, the pictures are really lacking (see A Child Is Born by Lennart Nilsson for FANTASTIC pics). Also I highly recommend Conception, Pregnancy and Birth by Dr. Miriam Stoppard. The other issue that other readers have had is the condescending way the authors talk to the mommy-to-be. If you are not \\"perfect\\" before your pregnancy, which NONE of us are, you will wish you were when you read this book. The overweight, the work-aholic, the sendentary, etc. will feel like a worthless, horrible mom-to-be. I took that all with a grain of salt and only focused on the GOOD reference stuff, which there is a lot of.

What is it that people don't like about this treasure of information??Jeffrey McAndrewauthor of &quot;Our Brown-Eyed Boy&quot;"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This book although not &quot;scientific&quot; is VERY useful. I got this book because it's about what to expect pregnancy wise. Which is what it tells you. This is for the MOM and what to expect as far as changes to you, There are other books for fetal development but this is not what that book was intended for. I would have called the doctor or shown up at the hospital daily without this book.I truely believe that this book is essential for both FIRST TIMERS and moms who haven't had kids in a while. My kids are 5 yrs apart and when I get pregnant again(we're trying)those kids will also be 5 yra apart. I think this book is for those people. Although you don't forget everything, it's nice to have a refresher course. I honestly am not stupid but always assune doc knows best and this lets you know about birthing plans. I wouldn't have thought about that with out this book."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I got this book during my first two pregnancies... by my third I practically knew it all by heart. The more informed you are, the better. Maybe this book is getting low ratings because as a first time parent you are very nervous and it really isn't a book to allay alot of fears. This book is pretty straightforward, and it doesn't tend to cushion things. I do find that it is written very well. It can give a woman the knowledge of what can happen, is happening and has happened by the questions in the book. I mean they wouldn't have some of the questions in the book if they weren't asked before by someone going through that experience. Stay informed is my motto.... this book will help."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This book should be banned from shelves everywhere. Having raised five children and being a lactation consultant and early childhood educator, I find this book to be dangerous. Much better choices that are available here at Amazon are \\"The Natural Childbirth Book by Aviva Jill Rohm and ANY of the wonderful books from the parenting library by the team of Williiam and Martha Sears.Just the one ridiculous fact that this \\"Expecting\\" book says.....\\"The newborn cannot distinguish between its own mother and a caretaker\\" is so incorrect. The fact is that a newborn CAN and DOES distinguish his own mother by SMELL! It also states that it is important for the new mom to \\"get out\\" and \\"away\\" from the baby for a few hours to maintain sanity. Now, let me say here that if you thought that you would carry on your lives just as you had BEFORE you had the baby.....you are in for a big surprise. When you decided to have that baby, you also made a committment to become a parent. Your focus should be on the welfare of the baby. That baby is always the FIRST and PRIMARY concern of any caring parent. Please....get a supportive book on parenting and not one like this which makes having a baby a momentary disruption in your life and a nuisance to deal with.Parenting is the ride of a lifetime and to be enjoyed!"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I bought this book because it is supposed to be the &quot;standard&quot; for pregnancy guides, but I quickly discovered that I could get all of its advice -- and more -- from the Internet for free, so &quot;clueless&quot; and &quot;first-time&quot; mothers should save their money for an extra package of diapers and go surfing for basic information. Futhermore, while many of my fellow reviewers warn that the book's preachy diet is not helpful for larger women, I found it to be equally unhelpful for skinny ones. The writers assume a lot about your weight gain and metabolism -- none of which fit me! Most of the book's &quot;helpful advice&quot; is: 1) x symptom is normal; 2) x symptom can be helped by following our completely impractical diet; and 3) other than join the food police, you can't do anything about x symptom, but cheer up! It only lasts nine months. On an aesthetic note, I LOATHE the cover of this book. The schlocky pastel world of maternity and baby things often makes me wonder why I decided this was a good idea.

I feel the complete opposite of other reviewers, this book hasn't scared me at all. In fact, it has helped allay a lot of my fears (weird aches/pains, GI problems). To those who are offended by the relationship advice- a lot of women ARE in traditional relationships with a husband and are dealing with all the issues that go along with having a spouse, and I thought the book was totally appropriate in that area. So if you aren't, go find a book for transgendered, homosexual, adopting from another country ,while standing on your head book and skip this one!Ok, yes, the diet/food section is pretty unrealistic when you are in the 1st trimester and can't even think about eating vegetables, etc. but I'm sure I will use it as a guideline for later on when I'm feeling better."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I think this book is a little overrated.

My wife and I went out and got an arm full of books and this was one of them. The positive side is that it did seam to provide some good information in a reference method. It also gave us a general idea on what was going on and some of the things to look for. What we did not like is it seams that this book should have come with an overbearing adult wagging her finger at you. I don't think we needed or cared for the tone the book had about the authors militant views on what not to do - is drinking 1 coke really going to be that bad? It is almost like the authors wanted to scare you silly for nine months. Overall an overview, but if you are aggravated by being talked down to then I would look someplace else."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This book should be titled, &quot;What to FEAR When You're Expecting.&quot; I received it as a gift during my second month of pregnancy with my first child, and was very excited believing that I would soon learn all that I needed to know for the months to come. What I found was every possible thing that could go wrong with my health and the health of my child during his stay in my womb.This book covers everything from the mundanely uncomfortable to the rare and horrific that a woman could possibly experience during pregnancy. As an experiment, I began randomly opening the book to any page, and I found everything from miscarriages to varicose veins to ectopic pregnancies to testing for genetic abnormalities in the fetus to premature birth. I had to actively search for any paragraph that hinted at the joys and pleasures of pregnancy, and found very little to reassure me that all the the strange new physical changes occuring in my body were simply normal and nothing to fret about.This book is an encyclopedia of disaster for the pregnant woman. If you would like to have a resource to go to that will give a summary of every possible thing that has the remotest chance of going wrong in your pregnancy, than by all means, I suggest you seek it out. If you would like a supportive, informative guide to the growth of your child and the normal, wonderful things to TRULY expect when you're expecting I think you should avoid it. I found the series of books by Bill and Martha Sears to be a much better resource.I will say that the book, &quot;What to Eat When You're Expecting&quot; is a much more valuable part of this series, offering the expectant mother practical advice that she can actively employ to help her feel more in control of both her own and her baby's health. It is a useful resource with some very good tips for keeping healthy while your appetite does some very strange things."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This book is more of a hindrance than a help. After reading the first section, and perusing the rest, I had become convinced that I was about to miscarry, I had resurected adolescent food/body image issues, and I worried myself into bed for three days. I found the advise to fathers-to-be regarding how to help keep their partners attractive/slim (!) during pregnancy particularly offensive. Pregnancy is a beautiful thing that women have been doing successfully for many thousands of years. Throw this book away and call your mom instead!"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This book was horrible. All it did was scare the crap out of me whenever I read it. Common problems such as spotting and cramping were never mentioned rather they were said to be signs of a miscarraige.

Buy another!!!!"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I was snaked in by the label that told me this book is the &quot;Bestselling Book on Pregnancy.&quot; I quickly found out that doesn't mean it has the best information. The information is presented in a way that is very much in favor of &quot;whatever your doctor says is right,&quot; and does not at all encourage intelligent, well-informed women to make their own decisions. The information is scanty on many subjects, and the part on diet makes you feel as though you're causing a birth defect every time you give into a craving. I'd recommend any of Dr. Sears' book over this one."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I'm 8 months pregnant and this book was the first one I read. After reading some others, I absolutely can't stand this book any longer! Here's why:It has a very chummy, trying-too-hard-to-be funny attitude which becomes extremely cloying. Along with that, it seems that the authors were trying to ease the fears of countless freaked-out women about childbirth, and at times they come across condescending, as if they were writing for stupid people.Grant it, I work in mind-body fitness and believe in the importance of understanding how one's body works, how to use one's body more efficiently, and how to connect to one's instrisic strength via the stabilizers (core) of the body. I've been an athlete, so I know what difficult physical exertion is like. I'm not afraid of being uncomfortable, because I know that the discomfort of childbirth is for a positive outcome and it means my body is working well to push the baby out - it not the same as the pain of injury. As I've read more materials that lean towards natural childbirth, I see that I'm not the audience for which this book is written.A lot of success in birth comes from the mother's mind-set, which is not discussed AT ALL in this book in the section on labor. I feel that this book perpetuates the medical-model assumption that women's bodies are \\"lemons\\" bound to break at any second.If you are interested in natural birth and the life-changing experience the process can be, and books that discuss what labor may feel like physically, I recommend Ina Mae Gaskin's, \\"Ina Mae's Guide to Childbirth\\", \\"Spiritual Midwifery\\" and also Kitzinger's \\"Complete Guide to Pregancy and Childbirth\\". The latter book was the one I read after \\"What to Expect...\\" and I enjoyed it thoroughly for discussing birth intelligently, without dumbing-down the presentation. It was a relief!"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I got this book because it's supposed to be the \\"must have\\" for all pregnant women. While I found many things in it that answered some of my questions, and the book was helpful in establishing the benchmarks for each month, I found information in it that was FALSE. This concerned me, as it is supposed to be reviewed and ok'd by doctors. The \\"best odds diet\\" is not only impossible to follow, but has very little in it that is accurate when it comes to measuring portion sizes (something I learned when I had to go on a restricted diet). There was a section on excercise and what not to do, and the book adviced against stretching the inner thighs... well, I'm a dancer, and stretching is what I do, and it's actually very helpful during labor, unlike what the book said (I also verified this with my OB). These two examples were enough for me to wonder how much more in the book was inaccurate, and to bring it down from a \\"must have\\" to an ok read, if you take it with a grain of salt. It's not bad, but it isn't the ultimate authority like every one else makes it to be. Borrow it if you can. I eventually put mine aside and stopped reading it altogether."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This book was SO preachy and condescending I could hardly stand to read it. Save your money and get the Unofficial Guide to Having a Baby instead."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This book did more to stress me out during my pregnancy than anything else I experienced in those nine months. Yes, it's true that some women do experience rare conditions explained in this book, but most women won't, and throwing every possible complication into a book on general pregnancies probably needlessly frightens many of women. Our babies don't need that added stress! My certified nurse midwife laughed out loud when I asked her if I should avoid deli meats and goat cheese (as advised in 'What to Expect'), telling me that I'd be better off not reading it, and our doula told me she wished she could burn every copy she came across. And the way the authors gloss over c-sections really gets my goat. It's *major* surgery, one with many, many more risks for both mothers and babies, not something to be taken lightly. I'd recommend books like Henci Goer's &quot;The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth&quot; instead."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This book was given to me by someone as a gift. I found it to be no help at all. Often, it didn't address any of the questions I did have and was packed with a lot of information that I felt was pretty much common sense. I also found it odd that certain areas had a lot of information and other areas had relatively little or nothing. For example it had roughly three pages on the ill-effects of smoking but only about one page combined on alcohol and narcotics. Honestly, I would find a different resource for my questions."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This is a terrible book.

When was the last time you saw a pregnant mother wearing PINK LEGGINGS and rocking on a rocking chair? From the beginning, we can see that this publication is not intended for women of color, working women, or any pregnant woman who is living in reality. With its horribly condescending tone, overly simplified text, and one-sided viewpoint, anyone who purchases this book should ether use it as lining for a bird cage or toss it in the compost bin. WTEWYE attempts to prepare mothers for the absolute worst, since apparently if something is going to go wrong, chances are it is going to happen to you. Not only does it preach the worst, it also prepares mothers for a highly medicalized birthing process. There are so few references to natural childbirth, alternative birthing, or holistic remedies that mothers are left thinking that she must somehow fit into an entirely unrealistic, \\"cookie cutter\\" approach to pregnancy and birth. This book also makes absolutely no exceptions for cultural beliefs, social differences, or even the many physical differences that make every pregnant woman unique. It does very little in the way of encouraging a woman to celebrate her pregnancy, and page after page emphasizes the potential discomforts and complications associated with pregnancy.What is most unfortunate about this book is that so many people will be reading it as their sole source of information. WTEWYE perpetuates the social ignorance that surrounds pregnancy and birth, and therefore only contributes to the high rate of c-sections and other medical interventions that we see in America today. Instead of explaining birth as a natural physiological process, WTWYE attacks pregnancy as a series of potential risks and complications. Fee free to purchase this book if you wish to embark on nine months of unnecessary worry and only want to focus on the pitfalls, rather than the positives surrounding birth."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"Call me crazy ... but I really liked this book. Initially, I didn't buy it because the reviews were so negative on Amazon.com. Alot of people thought it was alarmist, so I bought the \\"Girlfriend's Guide\\" instead, which got great reviews. Boy, was I sorry.\\"What to Expect...\\" is full of what I would call good, sound, medical advice and is very comprehensive. I didn't find it alarmist in nature at all. For example, the section on miscarriages struck me as simply giving sensible information about this very difficult and emotionally wrenching issue. It is not a pleasant issue to be sure, but pregnant women need to know the signs, symptoms, and what to do. So I feel more knowledgeable, but certainly not more alarmed. After all, leaving the issue out of the book does not make it go away.As a 38-year-old who is pregnant for the first time, I need solid information in an understandable format. And this is what \\"What to Expect...\\" provides. A humorous, personal approach (like \\"Girlfriend's Guide...) just doesn't do it for me right now.This book has been criticized as looking like it's organized by month, but not really being so. I think the authors tried to put topics in the month they were most appropriate. But everyone is different and the items that are generally relevant for month 3 might be more relevant for YOU in month 1. That's OK. JUST LOOK IN THE INDEX IF YOU WANT YOU FIND INFO ABOUT A SPECIFIC TOPIC! That's what I did -- and it was a cinch. The index is fabulous and it's very easy to find what you need, even if it isn't in the \\"right month\\" for you. This is hardly a fatal flaw of the book."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I bought this book, read a couple of chapters and promptly returned it. Duing the beginning of my pregnancy I have some complications that, luckily, were nothing major. However, if I had had this book during those problems, the entries in this book that described my problems would have worked me up into a nervous breakdown. There is a point at which information should be explained by aknowledgable health care provider, not by text which does not answer specific questions and concerns in a human give and take conversation. Do yourself a favor...forego the purchase of this book."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"Almost in to my 6th month of my first pregnancy and I can't give you one single thing that this book has done for me yet! If you are the atypical pregnancy with barely any pregnancy symptoms, this book definitely has nothing for you. (However for some people, who may have no medical background at all, it can be somewhat helpful on the tests that will be done and what they are for.) I was more interested in the \\"how the baby is growing\\" subject... which is not even addressed in this book. Also this book has alot of Q&A which are useless questions in most cases, and some of them make you wonder? But honestly the internet and your friends/family can give you better advice. Personally I think it is a waste of money, unless you get a free copy from a friend."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"It has the basics, but is a bit old fashioned and seems to be getting outdated.

The childbirth educators away from the hospital were full of scorn for it. Speaking from the father perspective, I found it to be full of unrealistic advice. No one's going to keep the diet and exercise routine they suggest, and if you deviate from it, your baby isn't goign to come out handicapped in mind and body. It does prepare you to be very cooperative with hospital staff and have the birth experience that is most convenient for the hospital staff. It also provides you with a lot of information about medical problems you probably won't face.Girlfriends Guide provided a much more realistic perspective for me. Our Doula was our key source of information during pregnancy."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"My husband asked me to stop reading this book because it was freaking me out! Even as I sit in front of my computer to type this I worry about the poison spewing from my video display monitor (yes, there's an entire section that talks about how miscarriages have never been linked to monitors, but you should still worry about it).

Second, I was unable to find a lot of answers to my questions, but I could find them on the internet relatively easily. Third, why on earth is this book considered a &quot;must have&quot; for the expectant mom? It's more of a nutrition book than anything, and if I were to follow the &quot;best odds diet&quot; I'd be eating all the time and worried about everything I put in my mouth.

The cover of WTEWYE shows the pregnant woman sitting passively in a rocker. In PC&amp;N she is standing on her own two feet, seeking out information as an active participant, and preparing herself for what she WANTS, not just what she can expect. WTEWYE has an undeservedly enthusiastic following, and is part of the problem in the American way of birth, rather than part of the solution. Don't do your pregnant friends a disservice.

God made our bodies to conceive, carry, and birth children. So to read a book that just makes me worry that everythig I am doing is wrong, that every move I make could in some way hurt my baby or even kill her, and that I really have no idea how to carry a pregnancy out and need to be told what to do & when to do it-- well, that makes me uncomfortable.I also find some of their information & statistics questionable, as they don't quote sources. They suggest getting prenatal testing done to make sure whether or not you want to \\"terminate the pregnancy.\\" Why should I listen to people who are so eager to kill any baby that they deem imperfect?The very small, insufficient paragraph on water birth is laughable, outdated, and completely untrue. Dubbed an unacceptable procedure, the book says the risk of the fetus (not baby) drowning is too high to make it safe. HA! They forgot to mention that babies' lungs do not start to inhale oxygen until physically stimulated by the cold air they are born into. When first birthed, babies are still getting oxygen through the umbillical cord-- not breathing in air (or water). They also only say that women use water birth to help make the environmental transition for the baby smoother, but they don't tell you how incredibly relaxing it is on the mother during labor to be in water, and how pain is lessened by an incredible amount due to relaxation and a lessening of gravity on the mother's body (so she can move freely into any posistion comfortably).They then go on to list home births as risky unless you have a doctor and a nurse and a midwife right there next to you and a loaded ambulance on stand-by. Why bother staying home? Birth is a natural process that women are fully capable of handling on their own-- this book only serves to frighten a mother into thinking she is incapable of doing what God made her body to do. Yes, there are always exceptions where medical help is needed, but that is the exception, not the norm.If you can ignore the book's advice to kill your baby if there is anything remotely wrong with it, flee to the doctor's office for every cramp, burp, or funny feeling, and completely doubt your own ability to have a baby, then this book does serve some useful information, especially if you want to know what your body is doing month by month. Otherwise, I would keep looking."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"If you are pregnant and looking for a good reference there are so many other books out there that won't have you questioning your every move. As one other review mentions, try anything by Aviva Jill Romm. Penny Simpkin and Sheila Kitzinger are others authors you will grow to love and trust.For normal pregnancies, go to those that know normal pregnancies best...MIDWIVES"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I bought this book when I was expecting my first child, despite thinking the \\"expecting\\" rather than \\"pregnant\\" usage a little too cutesy. I returned it the next day; after reading a few pages I became worried that what I was carrying was not an embryo but a dead blob of cells. There are plenty of supportive and informative books that don't dwell on every possible thing that can go wrong. Choose them, and don't be suckered into buying this one just because everyone else does."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"And where are they so I can smack them?This book is a piece of garbage that is organized in a horrible fashion, has lots of fluff information, is preachy and condescending, and even SCARY at times. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK.Apparently everyone at baby showers, all your friends and relatives (who haven't been pregnant recently), and everyone you pass on the street THINKS you need to have this book. But that means they clearly haven't had to use it! Warn your friends and family not to waste their money!A catchy title does not a helpful book make!If you are so unfortunate as to receive a copy of this book for free, DISCARD IT IMMEDIATELY without reading. You will feel worse about yourself and the pregnancy for having cracked it open."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I am really not sure why this is such a popular book. All it did was scare me. They do have some great infomation, but I found that many of our questions were unanswered. Also, a bunch of the sections refer readers to the authors' other books rather than giving a good answer in the book I already owned - the book should be more self contained, not an ad for the authors' other works. I pretty much stopped reading this book by my fifth month after a friend gave me her pregnancy book. I found it much less scary, more complete and better organized."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"The only reason this book has sold so many copies is that most OBGYN offices give it away. This book is a study in how not to have a natural, joyous pregnancy and birth."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"First off I must say that I know NOTHING about babies and didn't like them--they scare me. Irony would have it that I'm now 19 weeks along, a newlywed and this book has brought great comfort to me. After settling into the idea of keeping the child three months ago, my best friend took it upon herself and dragged my sorry prego butt into the book store to rummage around for what she considered to be my first tool of defense against myself...a book on pregnancy. We came across the third edition of this book after skimming through the pregnancy section and she told me it was the book I needed. She was right and, needless to say, I'm so glad that she's my cohort and best friend.With all that said, WTEWYE was the greatest comfort as I progressed along my pregnancy. Sure it listed some negative effects but really no one ever, EVER said pregnancy was a trip through the petting zoo. Also, I must add that this is coming from someone who from the very beginning was ill equiped to have babies healthwise and staturewise (I'm petite, anemic, and have a relatively crappy immune system). So yes, expect the book to state some negative effects of pregnancy (all of them) because it covers ground and bases in a very straightfoward and well versed manner. It also covers all the positives, so for the previous reviewer that seems to dread the birth of his own baby--it would help to comfort the mother of your baby rather than spend all that time nit picking everything negative and making her pregnancy that much more so.This book will not put you to sleep and it's a handy guide for the daddy to be. In fact, we call it the bible...as far along as I've gone with all alterations and pain that's be happening to me, this book has explained why. It's very concise and will follow a women through her pregnancy by the months and the weeks. I refer to it every two weeks now to make sure that I'm on track and it provides a good visual idea of how the baby looks inside you at the beginning of every month. It provides a list of foods to have in moderation (ex. tuna because of the possible presence of mercury...I still eat it but a lot less than I use to) and certain things you may want to eat more of that are good for your baby.One thing that needs to be pointed out is the few light exercises displayed in the book that can be done while your pregnant to help aleviate all the other pains that seem to have cursed me. I completely love this book and would recommended it to anybody (male or female) remotely thinking about having kids or will have kids. We know what to expect and are looking foward to seeing our child with confidence."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"Okay I fell for this book because everyone said I had to have it. It was the biggest waste of money! It told me nothing and should be named.... What is pregnancy I am an idiot and just crawled out of a hole. I don't write reviews but if I can save someone some money then this was worth it. The chapters were basically the same and you can find more information online than what was here.On a side note I was given the girlfriends guide and this was interesting and if you are going to buy a book buy this one instead."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This is one of many pregnancy books that I purchased. The book has good advice, but in some ways it may have too much information (for instance there are many sections discussing things that could go wrong). Overall, though, I think that the information in the book is very useful. It got me through my first pregnancy and now I plan to review it for my second pregnancy."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"A nice and simple reference book, from where you can pick up what is required for you. The book walks you through the changes both you and the baby experience each month. This book is simple and light. However the diet suggestions are not quite possible for every expecting mother. There are question answer sections at the end of each chapter is very useful and that's what I like most in the book.[...]"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"Seriously, exceedingly helpful. I'm not kidding. this book is more helpful than you think a book could be. At times assuring and at other times alarming, this book is full of information!What's good is that the information is very well organized, with a chronological order being the primary format. You can also look up issues, which is very handy. The only problem is that there is so much information there, a new parent almost doesn't know which info applies!You know what, you probably ought to get the book, but don't forget your mother's phone number."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I was very excited to get this book and to get reading about what my first pregnancy would be like and while it did give me the basics as to what to expect during my first doctor's visit and what was the cause behind initial cramping for example, it also scared me terribly. Now, I am not a &quot;La La&quot; type and need things sugar coated, actually I am pretty realistic but this book has you not making a move without consulting it and everything that you may do is absolutely going to result in a miscarriage. I am an older mother-to-be so have those concerns anyway so didn't need them compounded by the book. My doctor disagreed with most of the recs - flying, massage, cold medicines etc - and said that while she was pregnant she had bed rest and read about 20 of the books and this one should be dumped. She recommended, &quot;The Girlfriend's Guide...&quot; I will keep this book on hand because it is a good reference but I will also get &quot;Girlfriend&quot; to see what real women are feeling and ask my doctor if I have concerns. If I kept up with this book, I would never leave the house."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I found this book to have a lot of useful information, but it starts off very wordy. I don't care about the author's whole life history and reason she decided to write this book. Establishing that could be done in a page, not 4.The Pregnancy DietThere is a recipe section, that if I had the time, may be of some use. However, making cream of tomato soup from scratch is time consuming and more expensive that buying the can and adding milk. All of the recipes in that section need to be made from scratch, even the French fries, not a practical suggestion for someone who has a job.Part 2 - Nine Months &amp; CountingThe Question &amp; Answer format was really helpful. Most of the questions give you about half a page of really useful information, with facts, but not overstating the answer to the question presented.Part 3From postpartum to breastfeeding to Daddy, the section mixes the Q &amp; A format with the informational format from the 1st section of the book. This section is very useful for understand your postpartum 1-6 weeks and tips for breastfeeding holds. The &quot;Expectant Father&quot; section is in the Q &amp; A format, and may have some things that Mommy hasn't realized about Daddy. You're husband or partner may not read the whole book, but is 1 chapter really gonna hurt him?Part 4 - Special ConcernsThis was something that had never even crossed my mind until I read this book. From common colds to measles, as well as how to deal with symptoms of illness. &quot;I have a fever, should I take aspirin?&quot; and a bunch of other questions like that. It is an informative section that some may not even think about when they are expecting.Pregnancy Notes sectionI think that this is a very creative section because you have 2 pages to write down your personal notes for each month. The book also suggests that you show the notes to your doctor, so they know what's going on, since they can't be with you 24/7."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I read this book throughout my pregnancy and all or the information was right on the money. They discussed almost every possible situation that could come up during a pregnancy. It was extremely helpful when my delivery didn't go as planned."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"Every twinge, every ache seemed to have an explination here. . .saved me calls to the doctor, but when I *had* to call, it was right on target. As someone with a difficult pregnancy (I had gestational diabetes), it was helpful. I recommend it, and for those who stated things about diet, if I had followed the book instead of ignoring it, I bet I wouldnt have gotten the diabetes or gained 70 pounds! And it is true, you *do* take a chance every time you stick a pill in your mouth. Your doctor will agree, but it is a small risk. Better to be told. And as for brie mentioned above? Will check with my OB/GYN (I am having another), but I never heard that before. Still better than the other books out there, at least it treats you intelligently."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I bought this book when I found out I was pregnant with my first child because I saw it in the movie &quot;Nine Months&quot;. I never regretted the decision. My husband read some of it with me, particularly the part for fathers only. He thinks that my pregnancy was a textbook case, this book being the textbook. &quot;What to Expect when You're Expecting&quot; becamse my bible for the duration of my pregnancy until right after my birth because it answered all the questions I had, including those I forgot to ask my gynecologist and my mother. It included unheard-of symptoms some of which I got. I was so impressed with this that I got the others in the series when my daughter was born (&quot;What to Expect the First Year&quot;) and recently purchased &quot;What to Expect the Toddler Years&quot; after my daughter had her first birthday."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"The facts about pregnancy were helpful, particularly for women experiencing few or no complications. The &quot;Best Odds&quot; diet is ridiculous and impossible for the average woman to follow. Because of this book, I found myself analysing what I ate at the end of the day and felt guilty because I never measured up. My OB even told me that the book was fine, but that I should just rip the diet right out of the book. The Pregnancy Book by Dr. Sears is much better."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"Definitely a must have for moms-to-be. As with what to expect the first year, I read it nearly every day. Saved a million calls to the doctor's office."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I believe that healthy food is good. I eat a very healthy diet. However, the authors are condescending and patronizing towards expectant mothers. They act as if we are nutritional idiots who never heard of whole wheat bread before. And if you smoke a cigarette, drink a glass of wine or a cup of coffee or fail to breastfeed, you are a murderer. Period. Truly makes me wonder how my generation ever made it into the world healthy with mothers who drank martinis, smoked, and had white bread toast for breakfast. Good advice but don't take it too literally or you'll have a miserable, guilt ridden pregnancy."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"A friend of mine lent me her copy of 'What to Expect the First Year' book when I was pregnant for the first time. I read through it carefully the first time and looked up things that could go wrong throughout the pregnancy. It overwelmed me at first. This book is for EVERY expectant mother. It covers issues from be a drug user to wondering when the first time your baby will kick. Questions you would NEVER think of asking your doctor and maybe wouldn't want to ask your doctor or friends for fear of them thinking it was a silly question.What I really liked were the pictures and descriptions of how I would be possibly feeling, looking like, and what I would be thinking.I got into the book so much that I had trouble with reading too far ahead. I had to set the book aside for a couple weeks and then read up again.One of the greatest forms of assistance was after I had the baby. It helped me through what I may be feeling and how normal that was. It had great ideas about returning to work after my 6 weeks were over and my husbands aspects of the new baby.I enjoyed the book so much that during my next pregnancy I went out and bought a copy for myself.This led me to the next book 'What to Expect the First Year' and I really enjoyed that as well. Now my first child is 4 1/2 and my second will be 3 soon. My third and last child is 7 months old. Now, as you may have guessed, I have purchased the 'What to Expect the Toddler Years' book.I have found that the 'What to Expect When You're Expecting' book is a great gift for expectant mothers. I have given it out to 4 of my friends and co-workers. They really enjoy the detailed information the book provides.THANKS to author for providing us with such great reading material that will help us for those moments of informative encouragement!!"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I have bought several books since I learned I was pregnant, and &quot;What To Expect When You're Expecting&quot; was recommended by my doctor. It is a solid, informative book, and the information in it should be taken as recommendations only, just as with any other book on the subject.I did not find this book threatening or biased, though certain areas do not apply to me, I think it is wise to know as much as possible about all the things that are involved with pregnancy. I think this is a good book to have on your shelf for pregnancy reference, but it should not be the only one.However, I would recommend this book -over- &quot;The Girlfriend's Guide To Pregancy&quot; any day. (See my review on Amazon for why)If you are going to buy this book, I would suggest supplimenting it with the following:&quot;Your Pregnancy Week By Week&quot; by Glade B. Curtis&quot;Your Pregnancy Month By Month&quot; by Clark Gillespie"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I found this book to be informative but not the best book to read if you're expecting. I agree with some of the other readers about the Best Odds Diet. Who eats wheat germ - pregnant or not pregnant? The book made you feel that if you didn't follow the diet exactly that your baby would not be okay. I also found that there could have been more information on fetal development and perhaps some photographs of the different phases of development. I did find the book helpful but it was by no means my 'pregnancy bible'."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I MUST ADMIT THAT WHEN I BECAME PREGNANT, I WAS HORRIFIED. I HAD NO EARTHLY IDEA WHAT WAS AHEAD FOR ME. THIS BOOK WAS AN ANSWER TO PRAYERS. IT BREAKS DOWN THE WHOLE PROCESS, FROM CHOOSING AN M.D. TO DELIVERY. THANKS TO THIS BOOK I NOT ONLY KNEW WHAT TO EXPECT, BUT I ALSO WAS THE MOST PREPARED MOTHER IN THE DELIVERY ROOM."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"Very informative and easy to find the information. The lay-out of the book is reference style which helps you get the info that you want when you need it but reading it from cover to cover is helpful too. Helpful, informative book for anyone who is or thinking about becoming pregnant."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This is the most complete pregnancy reference book out there, no wonder it is usually the first book a woman buys when she finds herself pregnant. It answers probably most questions that anyone can have. The only drawback, I found, was that the format makes it hard to read. This is not a sit-down a read book, but really a reference book in every sense of the word. I find that the pregnancy book from the \\"everything\\" series is more user-friendly, but this one has, hands-down, the best information.Oh, and don't bother with the planner, it was a waste of money."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"Every Mom-to-be will most likely read this book. It's engagine, easy to understand and helps with all phases of pregnancy. My own copy is dog-eared and well used. I appreciate the information on preterm labor. Knowledge and knowing what to expect goes a long way when you are experiencing pregnancy for the first time."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"When I found out I was pregnant, I wasn't sure where to start. Seeing that this was my first pregnancy and it wasn't a planned one, it was a huge shock that sent my husband and I reeling. Lucky for me, my boss; who has a nineteen year old son, recommended this book. I couldn't have been more grateful. This book covered everything. It starts with a little section on before you get pregnant, signs to look for to indicate that you are pregnant and then it breaks everything down by months (with the weeks underneath). This book has everything you can think of and without it I probably would've had a nervous breakdown. The section on labor and delivery is very thorough which made it all a little less scary. I loved the postpartum section because it helped to ease my mind when I thought for sure there was something wrong with me because I wasn't healing fast enough. There are a lot of other pregnancy books out there that I'm sure are just as good, but this was the only one I read when I was pregnant and honestly, it's the only one needed."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"As a first time mom I found this book informative and helpful. This book does list a lot of the things that could go wrong but I don't see a problem with that. You should want to know the symptoms in case something does happen, better than not knowing when something is going wrong. Nothing in the book bothered me to read about, actually it put my mind at ease about a few things I was experiencing and I enjoyed being able to see what I could be feeling from month to month and how the baby was growing. I couldn't stick to the diet they recommended but I was never worried about that as long as my weight was under control. Unless your a paranoid, pessimistic person I think this is a good buy."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This book was my savior when I was pregnant for the first time. It taught me so much about what to expect when I was pregnant. I was only 21 years old and scared to death. The book explained so many things to me and really helped to put everything into perspective. When I would go into my doctors office I would tell her what I had read and she would inform me that I had been doing my homework. That gave me confindence in what I was reading. The only complaint is that I wish there were more subjects covered that had not...but on the whole the book is a great buy and read. I would recommend it to any expecting mother."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"this is the best book that i have ever read! i love how informative it is, and how it answers all my questions.

It covers almost every possible aspect of pregnancy, whether common or uncommon, and does so in a calm and reassuring way. It tells you what you need to know without judging, trying to be too funny, or making you worry. The authors are to be congratulated on producing such an incredibly useful book."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This is a great all-around baby book for first-time Moms and Dads, from month-by-month developmental charts to when to call the doctor and when to relax and wait. Best alternatives are Sears and Leach, or you can pick from conservative to liberal books on child behavior or books on Dads or single parenting. My favorite recent book on parenting is &quot;I Sleep At Red Lights: A True Story of Life After Triplets,&quot; by Bruce Stockler, which captures the incredible chaos, joy, anxiety and humor in being a parent--and making priorities. Also loved Annie Lamott's &quot;Operating Instructions&quot; (although some women I know object to her bizarre background.)"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"Very useful resource for me as a first time mother, however the diet section is unrealistic and not nutritionally sound."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This book is an inaccurate, misleading load of garbage.

It also doesnt help with how to deal with the NICU staff or how to deal with them or what expect at lest when you walk into a NICU. The section they have on Incompent Cervix is useless! I went to the book again when i was told that is what i have and it did NOTHING to help or reinsure me that i could have a child. It is nothing for the high risk !! i think it is a same you could be in trouble and refer to the book and you get so much nothing out of it"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"Any other book is better that this one. It has to be."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I am genuinely surprised at the middling average rating this book has thus far achieved on this web site; my wife and I have utilized this book as our primary (though not only) reference for the nine months of her pregnancy (our first), and we have found it invaluable. Every physical tic or symptom my wife experienced is documented within these pages. The book is clearly and comprehensively written, but most importantly it is largely free of sermonizing or partiality. Most passages are careful to take into account the full range of possible experiences an expecting couple might have. The lone exception to this would be the book's harping on diet--I'm not sure how many times I or any other reader needs to be reminded that &quot;fruit-juice-sweetened&quot; muffins are nutritionally superior to those sweetened with refined sugar, or purchased in packages and thus likely to harbor artificial flavor enhancers or preservatives. Then again, the diet recommended is called the &quot;best odds&quot; diet for a reason--flout their recommendations as much as you want, and you are still likely to have a healthy baby, but the chances of problems occurring could increase.In any case, if like me you are expecting (or hoping to expect) your first child, and you're feeling a little clueless as to what lies ahead, I recommend this book without reservation."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I'm pregnant for the first time and I bought this book a few weeks ago. I find myself picking it up again and again. It is VERY informative and straight-forward. It includes pretty much any topic/answer that you could possibly think of. I admit that a few things in it were unnecessarily paranoid, but I really enjoy the month-by-month descriptions of changes. In fact, reading that things like cramping are normal put me at EASE rather than worried me. The diet sections list many things that I already eat pretty much every day, so I don't think it's out of line. You just have to remember that not every woman is the same and no two pregnancies are exactly alike. And that just because the book says to steer clear of sugar doesn't mean that one brownie or soda is going to kill the baby. Personally, I went off caffeine as soon as I tested positive, and put a leash on my sweet-teeth.This book is not a bible by any means, but I've enjoyed and will continue to enjoy referring to it. As for the sections about serious possible problems of pregnancy, I think their info. is extremely useful to know and is not just trying to scare you. It's just trying to be informative of every possible situation."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I am shocked that the average rating this book has is 3 stars!!! I love this book and would recommend it for every pregnant woman out there."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I used this book when I was pregnant. It helped answer a lot of my questions and was a great resource. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is pregnant. I learned a lot from this book and it helped to let me know when I needed to call the Dr. or when things were normal. Great resource. I wouldn't be pregnant without it. The book is well written and broken down by each chapter for each month of pregnancy. Perfect book to give as a gift."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This book helped me a lot throughout my pregnancy!

While I have referred to What to Expect less and less with each pregnancy, I do find it to be a good reference. Topics are easy to find and I can generally find a question that relates to my concern at the time - the book is made up of questions from women and answers from the authors. Over the years, I have found many books that I like much better than What to Expect - such as The Pregnancy Book which seems to take a more modern approach to pregnancy and a book I recently read called We're Pregnant! which provides a very accurate insight into the day to day life of an expecting couple. I recommend all three - use What to Expect as a reference, The Pregnancy Book as a very informative read and We're Pregnant! to assure yourself that you are not alone in your thoughts and actions, and that you are in good company!"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This book should be on every new mother's book shelf. This is a VERY handy reference guide to ALL your questions when you can't get your doctor on the phone. There is no stone left unturned in this book.

I'm on my third, and I'm still reading it!"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This book helped me through my pregnancy with alot of helpful advice. However, I was also convinced I was going into preterm labor because of it also. Most of the symptoms listed under preterm labor, I had! Overall, it was very helpful, and informative. I like how it tells you what is happening with you 'this month' and your baby. Everything is an average with this book so don't be alarmed if you have gained 20 pounds in month 3! Let your friends buy you this book early in pregnancy."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"What to Expect has so much information it can almost overwhelm you. The book addressed many topics that I had questions about during my pregnancy and I referred to it often. I didn't pay much attention to the pregnancy diet since it really wasn't realistic for me to follow. Because of its question and answer format, I was often reassured to know that I wasn't the only pregnant woman wondering about the things I wondered about or asking the questions I asked. A great book to read along with What to Expect is one called We're Pregnant!. It presents a much more personal look at pregnancy and gives a real-life perspective on many of the medical terms and facts discussed in What to Expect."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"The author goes through each step of the pregnancy, and even comments on the delivery process, and describes the first few weeks thereafter. Reading this book you're pretty much covered to know most everything you need to know about expecting. It's very informative and helpful. Another book that has helped me during my recent pregnancy to cope with all the normal symptoms about not feeling loved, and oh gosh what do I look like, and the prevalent loneliness feeling, etc., is a book that I highly recommend because it's uplifting and boosted my self-esteem as it made me and my baby feel precious, is Dietmar Scherf's &quot;I Love Me: Avoiding and Overcoming Depression&quot; which is also available at Amazon."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I thought this book was the best out of the 6+ books that I read while expecting. It helped me realize what was normal and when I needed to call the doctor and when I didn't when I gave it to a friend who was expecting it helped relieve some of her fears that she was having. I thought it was well organized and easy to follow and I think it tells you how most doctors treat labor and delivery unlike the books that tell you all of these options that you may have that are not a reality at most hospitals. I recommend this book highly to anyone who is having their baby delivered by an ob/gyn in a traditional hospital."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I bought this book before I was pregnant. While it helped me understand the basics of pregnancy, I didn't get the answers I was looking for after my conception. This book is good in informing you about what you should do or not do, but it doesn't explain the causes of why it happens."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I enjoyed referring to this book when I was pregant. Very Informative. A must for pregnant women. I also greatly enjoyed &quot;Women's Health: Your Guide to a Healthier and Happier Life&quot; by Drs. David Newman and Holly Stevens for my other questions about women's issues. How to get ready for pregnancy? What happens after pregancy? Contraception and relationship issues. Also great book for menopause. I really enjoyed the true stories from women included in the book."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"What to Expect When You're Expecting is full of information, facts and figures. If you want to know about a pregnancy-related topic, you can probably find it in this book. It is a great reference book but don't let it scare you. Every pregnancy is different and while some times things go wrong, most of the time, everything goes right. I read many other books along with What to Expect and tried to keep everything in perspective. A Child is Born is an excellent companion book because of its vivid pictures of the developing baby and We're Pregnant! moves you away from the medical jargon by giving a true-to-life, parents-to-be perspective on the entire pregnancy and delivery process. Read them all. You'll be glad you did."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"THIS BOOK HAS BEEN VERY VALUABLE TO ME AND MY HUSBAND! IT HAS HELPED US UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING THAT IS GOING ON WITH THIS PREGNANCY!"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"So exciting each month to flip the page and get to read all about the month I was on. I loved this book and it really gave good tips and insights into what was going on in my body."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"Has good, basic information but is kind of boring to read."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This is a must-have for expecting mommies. It is a question and answer format organized by month. Every kind of question you can think of is in this book, and I referred to it often throughout my pregnancy."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I found the book helpful but I think it would be better if it was broken down a little more like in, say weeks instead of months. Also, I think it would be better with more facts and less questions from outside people, I found that some questions I had were similar but rarely did it hit it on the dot and really give me a clear explaination."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"When I was pregnant with my first child I was given this book by my doctor. I proceeded to read it cover to cover. This book was very helpful for me. I have given my friends copies of it. This book provides a pregnant woman with useful information on the changes in your body. The book also helps to distill unneeded fears, and provides women with a wealth of information."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This is an excellent reference for first time moms-to-be, chock full of scientific explanations and situational questions that cover all the bases. And it is the only book my OB recommended!"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This book was originally given to me during my third month. It was great since it gave me the basic general guidelines of what to expect during the pregnancy period. Let's face it ladies we all have questions and our mothers are not able to remember everything they went through.Less than two years later I am now referring to the book again since I am 6 months pregnant. I think it is a great gift and even better to pass on to another loved one that is pregnant.Enjoy!"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This is a great book for 1st time mothers. It has helped me a lot with great advise and ideas I never thought of before. Very good read!"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"As soon as I realized I was pregnant, I knew I had to buy this book, as it seemed to me that everyone else who had become pregnant owned it. Don't think you have to read it all at once - it is broken down into the 9 (10) months of pregnancy so I could read only a bit at a time, which I appreciated. My pregnancy symptoms really lined up with the month-by-month guide, though the authors say one may experience many or few of the &quot;regular&quot; monthly symptoms. I appreciate the book mostly because I was brand-new to being pregnant, and needed to know the basics. It answered most, if not all, of my questions. My OB/GYN's answers to my questions were the same answers I found in the book. I am glad I've read other books, like Natural Childbirth the Bradley Way by Susan McCutcheon, which explained to me what a woman's body does during labor. I also recommend The Girlfriend's Guide to Surviving the First Year of Motherhood by Vicki Iovine, regarding what happens when the baby comes. What to Expect is not an exciting pregnancy book, but it is definitely worth having at one's fingertips throughout pregnancy."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I was cautioned by my doctor not to read this book because it would scare me and now I know why. I was pregnant with my twin boys and to hear the book tell it, I would have the worst pregnancy ever and a zillion things go wrong. Well, the book was wrong and my very healthy boys are 7 months old now and never saw a minute of the NICU. Save your money and sanity and buy \\"Your Pregnancy Week by Week\\" instead of this book!"}]`),S={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:A},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:W,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},q={class:"card-container"},C=["disabled"],O={key:0},H={key:1};function L(n,e,s,c,r,i){const m=y("PoemCard");return t(),a("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=o("div",{class:"top-banner"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),o("div",q,[(t(!0),a(g,null,w(i.visiblePoems,(h,f)=>(t(),p(m,{key:f,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),a("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(t(),a("span",H,"Loading...")):(t(),a("span",O,"See more"))],8,C)):b("",!0)])}const M=u(S,[["render",L],["__scopeId","data-v-007a4ddf"]]),R=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"drive/31.md","filePath":"drive/31.md"}'),P={name:"drive/31.md"},j=Object.assign(P,{setup(n){return(e,s)=>(t(),a("div",null,[v(M)]))}});export{R as __pageData,j as default};
