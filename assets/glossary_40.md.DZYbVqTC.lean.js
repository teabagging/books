The first few pages are incredibly interesting. They are written extremely well and are filled with facinating ideas. That doesn't last long, though. After the forthy-somthing page the reader begins to understand that Oscar Wilde uses a lot of words to say nothing. And he does say something, you won't notice it because it's strangled to death with a lot of useless information.However, I do think the book does make a good read. You can't really blame Wilde for writing the way he does, since he, himself, says on the second page of this book: &quot;The only excuse for making a useless thing is that one adimers it intensely&quot;, and Wilde does admires his work intensely and for that we &quot;owe' it to him to read &quot;The Picture of Dorian Gray&quot;."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"I enjoyed reading the book, and thought that it was a great allegory.

Certainly, it is dated insofar as many other Edwardian novels out of Nineteenth Century England seem trite and shallow (faring badly with what was coming out of Russia at the time: Gripping, universal, human stories from titanic authors like Dostoevsky or Tolstoy). But, cultural handicaps aside, let's give Wilde his due: The book is a treasure trove of wit--from his brilliant epigrams to its very fascinating plot, which anticipates Magical Realism by at least 50 years. That is to say, when one thinks of &quot;Twilight Zone-esque&quot; writing one is put in mind of Kafka, Borges or Grabriel Garcia-Marquez. The best in World Literature.

He asks the reader to ponder the unsymbiotic dichotomy of beauty and goodness. Can one possess both while maintaining a clear conscience?As for the irrepressible and intrepidly narcissistic Dorian Gray, \\"I admit that I think that it is better to be beautiful than to be good.\\" The Picture of Dorian Gray is a short work of literature that I read in one day. However, its brevity is due to Wilde's publisher purposefully omitting material at the time that was deemed vile and unprintable. This causes some holes in the story - references made to the many sins Dorian committed along the way to others were left unanswered upon finishing the book. More than a little frustrating. Having said that, I was pleasantly surprised with the Gothic, sordid, and dark themes that Wilde so aptly transcribes. Wilde amuses us with the copious amounts of witty quotable lines from Lord Henry such as, \\"The only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it.\\"I found myself writing down clever witticisms constantly as I read the book. A good read if for nothing else than the unsurpassed wit of Oscar Wilde."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray has to be one of Ocsar Wilde's best books. This book, which takes place in 19th-century England, signifies the high price one young man had to pay for eternal youth.Basil Hallward, a mediocre painter, became infatuated with an extremely hansom but innocent young man, Dorian Gray. It was Dorian's picturesque beauty which inspired Basil to paint his best picture ever. Overcome by the beauty of his youth, Dorian wished that he would ramain young forever and that the portrait would deteriorate with age. However, when Dorian realised that his wish had come true and the picture took on the effects of his sins, his lifestyle signifcantly altered. Dorian went from leading a normal aristocratic life, to living a secretive life full of sin and slander.This book is proof that one can not be happy with youth and beauty alone. The suffering of Dorian Gray shows us that there is more to life than mere beauty. Dorian's life was ruined by a simple wish to be forever young. Although no one can stay young forever, this novel is a key example of why one should not simply focus on base characteristics such as youth and beauty, for these things will always fade."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"This edition is slightly shorter than the others available, but it is the ONLY one whose text reflects Wilde's true intentions. Don't be fooled by the other editions claiming to be the \\"unabridged\\" or \\"complete\\" version. The material Wilde added later was meant to make the novel seem more morally edifying. It makes the novel worse. This one is WAY better -- and also way dirtier. A bunch of the more explicit stuff was cut by Wilde's editor. The editor of this ebook version has restored it all, based on Wilde's actual typescript, which he went and consulted in an archive. If you're a homophobe, get the other, more \\"moral\\" versions. If you want to read one of the great modern novels as the author wanted you to read it, get this one. You won't regret spending a couple of extra bucks."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"Oscar Wilde's strange and intriguing mind is apparent in this book, which is full of interesting concepts and bizarre happenings. Dorian Gray, a young man who is obsessed with his own good looks, befriends an English Lord and a struggling painter. After Basil, the painter, finishes Dorian's portrait, they are stunned by its magnificence and how lifelike it appears. Seeing this, Dorian is angered when he realizes that the portrait will live forever and retain its beauty while he himself is left to age. Dorian decides to trade his soul for everlasting youth, and to always retain his beauty, just like the portrait.Since Dorian believes himself to be immortal, he dabbles into various sinful acts. He carelessly pursues a relationship with Sibyl Vane, an actress, constantly letting her down and breaking her heart. Dorian is involved in several mysterious deaths, and he even explores the London underground opium scene. Even though Dorian does all of these things, somehow he remains young, to the surprise of his peers. In the end, however, Dorian receives the punishment he deserves through a series of bizarre events. The &quot;what goes around comes around&quot; theme is strongly emphasized in the conclusion of the novel, which serves as a fitting end for Dorian's struggle with sin.This classic literary work is frequently exciting, but can sometimes delve into the monotony of 19th century British affairs (which may be a little tedious.) All in all, the novel is a wonderful concept which is given life by the genius of Oscar Wilde. It is a perfect research topic as well because it contains many themes which can be applied to anything from English rhetoric to the Original Sin. I myself wrote a term paper on the book and it was very easy to express my ideas because Wilde is so straight forward in his literary agendas. So, whether you pick it for required reading or just for pleasure, The Picture of Dorian Gray is definitely a good choice."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"Nota Bene: Once purchased, my Kindle download page contained this note near the download button: \\"This title has complex layouts and has been optimized for reading on Kindle DX's larger screen, but can still be viewed on other Kindle devices.\\" This message disappeared after a few minutes.Regardless, the formatting on my Kindle 2 looks good.

I am glad that I bought it!"},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"Oscar Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray is a thought-provoking novel that vacillates between ambling, seemingly directionless conversation and a riveting narrative thread that eventually bubbles up to the surface with the intensity of a volcanic eruption. The Picture of Dorian Gray, though not much more than a century old, has already been deemed a \\"classic\\" by literature-lovers, and after reading the book, I can understand its status. Wilde's command of the English language is almost unparalleled in recent literature.Warning - Spoilers FollowHere's the gist of the book. Dorian Gray is a young man whose physical appearance is handsome and innocent. An aspiring artist paints a beautiful portrait of Dorian. Dorian wishes that he always look like his youthful appearance in the portrait. The wish comes true. Dorian remains the same - youthful and charming, but the portrait begins to transform itself into the image of his soul.When Dorian embraces a life of hedonism, he uses his good looks and charm to obtain whatever he desires in life. His insensitivity drives a friend to suicide. The evil desires of his heart eventually cause him to murder a friend in cold blood. Over a period of twenty years, Dorian becomes a monster on the inside (reflected by the portrait of his soul) even as he remains youthful and innocent on the outside.Oscar Wilde's homosexuality is no secret, and the reader can easily discern certain homosexual overtones in the book (especially at the beginning). Perhaps Wilde's subtle innuendoes of homosexuality have made his works so appealing to lovers of literature who tend to sympathize and approve of homosexual behavior.Upon reading Dorian Gray, however, I could not help but notice how the lifestyle of hedonism is so implicitly condemned by the narrative's outcome. If Dorian's hedonism includes sexual relationships with men as well as with women (and Wilde does hint at this), then homosexuality comes under the same umbrella as the rest of Dorian's sinful passions. One can hardly characterize The Picture of Dorian Gray as a pro-homosexual book.Readers of this blog will find the picture of depravity in Dorian Gray to be intriguing. Throughout the story, Dorian, even in his hedonism, acts in a manner that forces the reader to desire justice and redemption. The book's end emphasizes the need for punishment and retribution - pointing at death as the wages of sin.What does the life of unbridled hedonism look like? What does it do to the soul? What happens to the human being who seeks to fulfill his every passion and desire? How does sin affect us physically? Do we age because we sin? These and more are the questions that Oscar Wilde raises in The Picture of Dorian Gray."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"Oscar Wilde was one of the foremost representatives of Aestheticism, a movement based on the notion that art exists for no other purpose than its existence itself (\\"l'art pour l'art\\"), not for the purpose of social and moral enlightenment. Born in Dublin and a graduate of Oxford's Magdalen College, he initially worked primarily as a journalist, editor and lecturer, but gradually turned to writing and produced his most acclaimed works in the six-year span from 1890 to 1895, roughly coinciding with the period of his romantic involvement with Lord Alfred \\"Bosie\\" Douglas, sixteen years his junior. Douglas's strained relationship with his father, John Sholto Douglas, Marquees of Queensberry, eventually resulted in a series of confrontations between Wilde and the Marquees, which first led to a libel suit brought by Wilde against his lover's father (who had openly accused Wilde of \\"posing as a sodomite\\" and threatened to disown his son if he didn't give up his acquaintance with the writer) and subsequently to two criminal trials against Wilde for \\"gross indecencies,\\" based on a law generally interpreted to prohibit homosexual relationships. Sentenced to a two-year term of \\"hard labor\\" in Reading Gaol, Wilde emerged from prison in 1897 a spiritually, physically and financially broken man and, unable to continue living in England or Ireland, after three years' wanderings throughout Europe died in 1900 of cerebral meningitis, barely 46 years old.\\"The Picture of Dorian Gray,\\" Wilde's only novel besides seven plays as well as several works of short fiction, poetry, nonfiction and two fairy tale collections originally written for his two sons, is critical to an understanding of Wilde's body of work and his personality primarily for two reasons: First, because it constitutes one of his earliest fully accomplished formulations of Aestheticism, and secondly because of its undeniable undercurrent of homoeroticism; an inclination which, after a six-year marriage widely thought to initially have been a true love match, Wilde had begun to explore more openly around the time of the novel's creation (1890). The story's title character is an exceptionally handsome young man who, both in the eyes of the artist tasked to paint his portrait, Basil Hallward, and in those of their somewhat older friend Lord Henry Wotton, epitomizes perfect beauty and is coveted by both men for that very reason. Seduced by hedonistic Lord Henry into believing that beauty can literally justify anything, including any act of immorality, Dorian sells his soul for maintaining his beautiful appearance, letting his portrait age in his stead. (In that, his character resembles Goethe's and Marlowe's Faust.) He then quickly turns from an innocent youth into a cruel and calculating man whom society, in its shallow adherence to appearances, nonetheless never associates with any of the results of his cruelty, never looking beyond the surface of his handsome exterior and assuming that a man so beautiful must necessarily also be good. Ultimately it is Dorian himself who brings about his own downfall when he is no longer able to face the manifestation of his evilness in Basil Hallward's picture.Upon its initial publication in Lippincott's Monthly Magazine in 1890, \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" was widely scorned as immoral by a public neither familiar with nor particularly open to the concepts of Aestheticism and its mockery of middle class morality, and repulsed by the thinly veiled homoerotic relationship of the novel's protagonists. Wilde republished the work the following year, adding a preface designed to explain his views on art. Yet, it was that preface which, along with several of his other publications and his written exchanges with Lord Alfred Douglas, ultimately would play a devastating role in his trials, where Queensberry's attorney would come to use an excerpt from that very preface - \\"There is no such thing as a moral or an immoral book. Books are well written, or badly written\\" - to extract from Wilde statements to the effect that any book inspiring a sense of beauty (including, as implied in the attorney's question, an \\"immoral\\" book, if \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" could be qualified as such) was well-written and therefore commendable; that only Philistines, brutes and illiterates - whose views on art he considered invariably stupid and for which he therefore didn't \\"care twopence\\" - could consider this novel \\"perverted,\\" and that the majority of the reading public would probably not be able to draw a proper distinction between a good and a bad book. It was testimony such as this, as well as the impending confrontation with a number of male witnesses ready to testify as to the nature of their relationship with Wilde, that not only caused the author's attorney to convince his client to drop the libel suit against Queensberry but also opened the door for Wilde's own subsequent prosecution.If \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" has a central theme besides the supremacy of beauty and the depiction of a society primarily interested in appearances, it is a call for individuality: Dorian's cruelty is brought out only after he allows himself to be influenced by Lord Henry's equally seductive and cynical hedonism; and similarly, Basil Hallward's blind idolizing of Dorian eventually proves fatal for the painter. - Wilde's only novel is one of the first and most poignant expressions of his own individualism; but unlike his protagonist, who ultimately pays a ghastly prize for selling his soul and giving up his individuality, Wilde paid as high a price for maintaining his. Like Dorian, he knew that \\"[e]ach of us has Heaven and Hell in him,\\" and although this novel's preface ends with the provocative statement that \\"[a]ll art is quite useless,\\" it was the very fact that Wilde put his entire being into his art that ultimately destroyed him. But like beauty, which is finally restored to perfection in Dorian Gray's portrait, Wilde's works have stood the test of time; and not merely for their countless, pricelessly witty epigrams. They're as well worth a read as ever.Also recommended:Complete Works of Oscar Wilde (Collins Classics)Oscar WildeWilde (Special Edition)The Oscar Wilde CollectionThe Picture of Dorian GrayThe Importance of Being Earnest - Criterion CollectionThe Importance of Being EarnestAn Ideal HusbandA Good Woman"},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray is a classic novel about the consequences of eternal youth. Young Dorian Gray promised his soul in exchange for the favor of his body never aging. Instead, a portrait of him grows older in his place. An eerie idea, indeed.While the concept and story itself are extremely interesting it was not the best execution. As another reviewer pointed out, it's not the easiest read for a modern reader. While the passages did not confuse me they did occasionally bore me. I found the book hard to get into - and once I got into it I had a hard time keeping interest.I do not doubt Wilde's credibility as an author in the slightest I feel that, as a modern reader, this is a book that may not stand the test of time as well as others.

I didn't really intend on reading it, but after fumbling through the first chapter, I was intrigued and soon thereafter was captivated by it. This book has mixed themes that are gothic horror at one moment, amoral and corrupt the next, followed by social political statement. I have not read a book before that compares with this one and is indeed one of the best that I have read. This book is full of quotes and one liners that are striking, thought provoking, and even horrifying to the reader. The Picture of Dorian Gray is a great book to read and discuss with a friend or a book club."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"I'm a sophomore in high school and usually I don't go for these older, classic books. Usually they bore me so much I can barely finish them. However, \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" was an exception to this rule. Though the language was a bit more intricate than is commonly found in the books of today (at least the ones I like to read), I found it to be more elegant and eloquent than tiresome and confusing.This book, with all of its discussion of morals, evil, and purity really is a window into late 1800s of England. Despite this, I found the book to actually be interesting. The real appeal this book held for me was its wonderfully potent imagery and mildly creepy, definitely surreal theme. \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is also a very short book, which I thought was pretty cool because I don't have a very long attention span concerning books. In spite of how today's people are probably a great deal more jaded concerning morals, or rather the lack thereof, than the people of Oscar Wilde's time, a lot of this book was fascinating in an almost perverted way. That aspect is offset by the theme of good vs. evil, however. The only faults I found with this book were minor details concerning the definitions of good and evil, issues which I think this book was meant to rise anyway.If you're a parent or someone looking to buy a classic book for a friend or relative in high school, I think this would be a pretty good choice, assuming they like books. The vocabulary seemed fairly advanced to me, but they ought to be able to handle it. The conflict between \\"good\\" and \\"evil\\" in this book is engaging, and the nature of the book is such that the reader has difficulty simply viewing matters in black and white. This makes the book deeper and more interesting to read. The transformations that occur in this book are slightly haunting, and at the end of this twisting tale of corruption and beauty lies a powerful, sudden, and very awesome ending. I really think that everyone should read this book."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"My feelings about this book are nicely summed up by Dorian Gray's description of a hedonistic book he has received from Lord Henry Wotton: \\"I didn't say I liked it...I said it fascinated me. There is a great difference.\\"The basic plot of the story is well known: thanks to mysterious/magical intervention the physical consequences of Dorian's action affect his portrait rather than his physical body. Urged on by Lord Henry Wotton (whose shocking/amusing/wicked epigrams are classic Oscar Wilde), Dorian descends into a life of ever-increasing debauchery, manipulation, hedonism, and the love of beauty above all else.Wilde brings up a number of themes in sometimes dizzying succession: the ability to \\"dominate\\" others, beauty as the supreme virtue, self-actualization as the guide to morality, yielding to temptation as a means of getting beyond temptation, physical consequences vs. consequences in general, the fascination of wickedness, etc. It is often unclear where Wilde stands on these matters since their proponent is Wotton who is \\"wicked\\" and the cause of much suffering, but speaks in the manner of Oscar Wilde. The moral ambiguity of the story lets the reader draw their own conclusions...fascinating."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"Basil, who up until now was a mediocre painter after meeting Dorian Gray a young Adonis, was inspired to create a masterpiece of which he puts himself into. Against Basil's wishes, Dorian Gray is influenced by Basil's friend Lord Henry. Dorian looks at his portrait and realizes that while the portrait will stay young forever, he will grow old; so Dorian makes a wish that if only he could stay young forever and the portrait can age.At first Dorian does not realize his wishes been granted. He falls in love with a beautiful young actress who is every woman that Shakespeare ever wrote about. But once again due to Lord Henry's influence, he realizes that she's just a common girl.Starting with absent-minded acts Dorian slowly sinks into debauchery. And with every new act his picture becomes more grotesque while Dorian stays is young and as innocent looking as the day his picture was painted.What will become of Dorian?What will become of Dorian's painting?What would you do if you were Dorian?Oscar Wilde paints a picture himself as he describes Dorian Gray's dilemma. And we as readers travel with Dorian as each decision is made. In some places in the story Oscar Wilde seems to drag on and on with detail; however we find that this detail is necessary to set the next scene.Oscar Wilde himself led a risky life that lead to a jail sentence; is attitudes can be seen in the dialogues in this book."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"Part humorous fable, part mystery, part gothic suspense, \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is another example of the late 1800s fascination with the soul, the senses, and science.Dorian Gray is a mere teen when the story begins, the muse of a local gifted artist, who paints Dorian's portrait in hopes of capturing his youth and beauty. Dorian's charm is also appreciated by Lord Henry, a rascally fellow, able to twist phrases and morals with his sly tongue. His winsome ways captivate Dorian, but Dorian soon finds himself pulled in the direction of a beautiful actress as well. These two loves tear Dorian in different directions, resulting in unexpected turns of events that send him down a road of sin and pleasure, though never with the rewards of true happiness. As his actions lead to even more drastic results, he finds himself fearing every shadow and questioning his own sanity.These events do not occur in a vacuum. With Dorian's sliding moral state, the portrait of his beauty begins reflecting the dark decay in his soul. Even as his own face refuses to age or show corruption, the painting becomes uglier by the day. Dorian is both fascinated and appalled by this. When, at last, he faces the consequences of his own selfish choices, he makes one final decision to try to destroy the evidence.I laughed aloud at many parts, particularly early in the book, then found the tone growing eerie and black. What a thought-provoking book! And one that kept my attention throughout. This is no glossed-over portrait of Mr. Gray, but a grisly depiction of evil--even when it masquerades in a cloak of civility.Oscar Wilde joined other writers of his day--H.G. Wells, Robert Louis Stevenson, and Joseph Conrad--in wrestling with concepts of the soul and the senses in the light of scientific discoveries. What about the conscience? Where did theology and psychology fit in? What about free will? In the last few pages, Wilde paints his own sobering portrait of a man who has tried to live as though the soul and senses have no effect on each other.This now ranks as one of my favorite classic novels. The results of Dorian Gray's experiment serve as a mirror for all those who consider themselves holy, heathen, or hypocrite."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray is another one of those classics that I'd heard mentioned in passing or read about but never actually sat down to read. It's short, only 200ish pages long - but don't let the short length of it deceive you, it packs a fairly powerful punch.The premise fascinated me from the moment I read it. Innocent young man who manages to remain that way on the outside, but a portrait of him changes to reflect the corruption of his soul. Fascinating, no?I'm positive that this book has been dissected and analyzed from all sorts of different points of view, so let me tell you what I got out of it.I felt the tragedy, deeply. The corruption of a soul is something that is unpleasant to read, unpleasant to see and seeing the effect it has on others is difficult to deal with at times.It's interesting because I read this novel while I am still continuing to work my way through George Eliot's Middlemarch. Whereas I am having such a difficult time relating to and feeling emotions from Eliot's characters, there was such a wealth of emotion being poured out of Wilde's it was almost overwhelming. I felt the passion of love and the despair when it was lost.By the way dialogue was incredible, it makes the book, honestly. I highly recommend this book to anyone who hasn't read it. And if you haven't read it in a while, go back and read it now. It's going on my \\"yearly re-read\\" shelf for certain."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"Like many of the other reviewers, I've always known the basic premise but never actually read The Picture of Dorian Gray. Also like many here, I couldn't resist the free version after reading the reviews. The story is original (though of course well told after over a hundred years of publication) and the writing is eloquent and witty. I agree that the chapter about Dorian's exploits and collections did drag on a little but it acted as a segue from youth to middle age and was kind of necessary to show how the years were passed. Otherwise, the entire work was very engaging. I highly recommend reading this book!"},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"I have heard a lot about this book and, having read a few of Oscar Wilde's plays and enjoyed them, decided to give it a try. Overall is was a good book, if a bit inconsistent in pacing at times.Dorian Grey is a beautiful young man, who is corrupted by a Lord to worry about how his looks might one day fade. While a portrait of him is being painted he wishes to never grow old. Later he realizes that the portrait is changing to reflect any cruelty in his nature, yet he remains the same.Oscar Wilde is a genius at writing. The cleverness of the language he uses and the sharpness of the commentary on society is deftly done and makes the story a joy to read, most of the time. The footnotes in this version of the book help to explain some of the more subtle jokes that I would have missed without them.The book does have some flaws, especially when compared to modern literature. Wilde takes nearly half to book to set up his characters. You can tell Wilde is a playwright at heart because many of the characters wander off into multiple page long dialogues that get to be a bit too much and sometimes a bit boring. Even in the second half of the book there are times where Dorian is reading from the book he is obsessed with and it just goes on and on and on.The second half of the book is by far the strongest. Wilde stimulates the imagination by talking about Dorian's unspeakable acts but never revealing what the majority of the horrible acts are. I was a little disappointed that there isn't a lot more to the plot than what you read on the back of the book. That being said, the end of the book is remarkable and really made the book a wonder to me.Overall this is a very interesting book and worth the read. Some of the lengthy dialogues can get a bit trying to read through, but most of the book has a quick wit to it that is amusing. The ending of the book holds some wonderful surprises. I would recommend reading this, especially if you are a fan of Wilde's writing style."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"Oscar Wilde (1856-1900) is best known today for his witticisms and classic plays such as \\"Lady Windemere's Fan\\" and \\"The Importance of Being Ernest.\\" However, Wilde also wrote short stories, poems and in \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" a short but fascinating novel.The tale is a retelling of the Germanic legend of Doctor Faust. Young Dorian Gray is influenced by the evil Mephisto figure Henry Wotton to make a pact with the forces of evil. Gray will not age despite a career of debauchery, decadence, opium usage and murder. However, the portrait of him by the artist Basil Hallward will age as Gray descends into an inferno of crime.The Marguerite love interest from the Faust legend is young Sybil Vane. Sybil is a \\"vain\\" callow actress who portraits the great Shakesperean female roles such as Rosalind, Juliet and others every night on the stage of a seedy London theatre. Gray marries her but she commits suicide since the girl realizes he fell in love with the stage heroines and not herself. Sybil's brother the sailor Jack Vane will return from sea to seek out vengeance against Dorian Gray. He will be unsuccessful being shot during a hunting accident on a wealthy estate at which Gray is spending a weekend. Basil Hallward is the young artist who will be murdered by Gray who is driven mad by the haunting picture of himself. The novel ends in a way never to be forgotten by the reader.Oscar Wilde published this short novel in 1890. In many ways it resembles the better book \\"Doctor Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\\" published in 1886 by Robert Louis Stevenson. That earlier work, like Dorian Gray, also looks at a character with a divided self in conflict with the norms and morality of society.Wilde's book is filled with aphorisms most of which are delivered by the cynical Henry Wotton The author is good at painting a scene so we feel as if we ourselves were in the garden and drawing room of wealthy Dorian Gray's London home or seeking an opium den in the foggy slums of fin de siecle London.The Picture of Dorian Gray is one of the best selling classics in the Penguin Classics catalogue. It is a satisfying piece of fiction which will make you think on the nature of evil, the human mind and how role playing and mask wearing are part of everyday life."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"I have read this book many times, and enjoyed it more each time that I did. I have to admit that Lord Henry's wit and wisdom was what kept me coming back to the book, not the important and intellectual issues about art, life, temptations and all the literary matters. I know there are other reviews with the literary facts and theories presented there, better than I can, so I'm not going to try.All I will say is this is a classic, worth more than 5 stars, should be read by everyone at least once in your life, first for the great writing, if its your first time reading Wilde, this is a great book to start with. You should read it slowly, because Wilde is a word smith, no words for words sake, each one polished like the gems that they are.

That's probably common. The famous premise is a fascinating one, though I found myself wondering if the narrative would have been even more impactful if written as a short story or novella length rather than stretched out to a full novel. The Lord Henry character who serves the purpose of putting bad ideas in Dorian's head gives multiple speeches throughout detailing his hedonistic world view. If the number or word count of these lectures was cut in half I don't think the story would suffer much from the absence. Another decision made by Oscar Wilde was not to show readers very much of Dorian's behavior. His first act of cruelty is laid out before us as is his final one, but in between we are only told that his bad reputation precedes him without being shown what he has done to earn it. It's left to our imagination. A few more scenes exhibiting decadent behavior rather than various dinner party conversations in which a pro decadence philsophy is expressed would have made for a juicier read. Would it have made for a better read? That's arguable, as perhaps it also is whether this book is intententially homoerotic or simply written during a time when heterosexual men were much more comfortable going on and on about how good looking a guy was. What's beyond debate is that Oscar Wilde came up with a great idea to build a story around, one that is as timeless as the desire for eternal youth."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"I've developed a general rule to avoid free Kindle editions of virtually anything, and it paid off handsomely when I picked this edition. There were two Penguin Kindle editions. This one for $.99 and another for free. As with other free Kindle editions labelled \\"Penguin\\", the edition was not Penguin, it was a \\"Pocket Book\\" edition. This one, for a buck, is true blue Penguin.To further validate my point, this edition has many addins which are often missing from a cheap Kindle edition. First, it has a history of the book's writing and publication, an outline of Wilde's life, an excellent bibliography covering both 19th and 20th century works, two appendices on 19th century reviews of the book and on the provinance of this edition. It also has notes on the chapters which explain things understood by a late 19th century Londoner, but which have been lost to us. An example is the term \\"Japanese effect\\" referring to a style adopted by some late 19th century painters, mimicing some aspects of Japanese art. A leading example was the great portrait artist, James MacNeill Whistler.In a word, it is a complete, genuine Penguin edition, cheap."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"I was reading the graphic novel: Jaka's Story (Cerebus, volume 5) by Dave Sim and Gerhard (which I strongly recommend anyone to read, together with the sequence: Cerebus, volume 6, Melmoth) when I met the fictional character &quot;Oscar&quot;.In that story, &quot;Oscar&quot; discussed with Jaka's husband, Rick, about a poisonous book (&quot;The Picture of Alfred Douglas&quot;), written by a certain Lord Henry Wotton! Any resemblance with the reality? :) &quot;Oscar&quot; told that he asked to Lord Henry how did he explain his success after saying that &quot;to be popular one must be mediocre&quot;? Lord Henry answered him that &quot;in this matter as in many others, he was the exception that proved the rule&quot;.Reading these passages, I was charmed with the Oscar Wilde character and decided to read the true &quot;The Portrait of Dorian Gray&quot; written by the true Oscar Wilde.I think the passages in Cerebus clarified to me what this book was about (modern graphic novels have the power to illuminate one's thoughts). One should not read this book looking for coherence. All the characters are incoherent, and this is one of the genial points in this book. People are not coherent, so fictional character must not be coherent either!In the preface the author, himself, says that art is quite useless, though it is the thing he loves most to do! The artist Basil says initially that a picture, done with heart, belongs to the artist. Later, he gives the picture to Dorian Gray. Henry Wotton throws along all the story a series of poisonous thoughts that he doesn't follow!Other genial point is that Dorian, although being evil (and could be considered a villain in his own story) is not punished for what he does!Sybil Vane commits suicide because of him, but nobody was able to connect her death with him. Later, he kills Basil, but he just disappears with the body, with no consequences. Near the end, when we think that he is going to be killed by Sybil Vane's brother, he escapes easily from him. Only when, by caprice, he makes the foolishness of trying to destroy his portrait, is that he finds death. That is, he dies merely by accident, not because of his vicious or crimes.If, instead, he just tried to cut the picture he would learn that it would have the effect of hurting himself physically. Then he would guard the picture, and proceed living his life of eternal youth and beauty (that is, until some day some insects, or rats, or something, decided to eat his canvas... :) )These are for me the mistakes of many writers, and what turns the end of many stories so boring and so unsatisfactory! The first one is that they want to produce a plot and tie all the characters of the story (as though it was necessary, and as though all characters deseverd to be well developed!!). The second is to try to create characters that evolve learning with their mistakes (as if everybody learned with their mistakes and stopped continuing doing them for all their lives!!!).Borrowing the words of Lisa Simpson (in one of those funny, crazy, genial, Simpsons' stories), the moral of Dorian Grays story is that it has no moral!"},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"All art is quite useless. Or so believed Oscar Wilde, perhaps the foremost member of the Aestheticism movement of the late nineteenth century. Wilde and his followers believed in art for art's sake: he thought his works needed no meaning beyond beauty. The Picture of Dorian Gray achieves some level of philosophical meaning nevertheless, but whether the book is worthy of the label 'genius' is questionable.This novel tells the story of Dorian Gray, a vain young man with a powerful personality. At the beginning of the novel Dorian has a portrait painted by the artist Basil Hallward, and Basil decides never to publish the painting because he put too much of himself into it. Dorian keeps the painting, wishing that its image would grow old while he himself stayed young. Eventually his wish comes true, and his increasingly Epicurean lifestyle causes the painting to rapidly age and grow uglier while Dorian himself stays young and beautiful.Despite its authors claims about art, the novel provides considerable insight into human behavior and the depths of apathy and vanity a man can reach. It is at times horrifying, but at others the writing itself can seem vain. Wilde often seems more concerned with flattering himself through his writing than with producing anything valuable which, of course, is consistent with his aesthetic philosophy, but that hardly benefits the reader, and I at least disagree with Wilde and believe that a work of art with no real value should not be considered art. Strewn throughout the novel are quotable passages which give the impression of intellectual depth but at closer inspection seem to contain little more than vanity: \\"I like persons better than principles, and I like persons with no principles better than anything else in the world.\\" \\"Is insincerity such a terrible thing? I think not. It is merely a method by which we can multiply our personalities.\\"I did enjoy the novel overall and found it insightful, but I think Wilde's writing is generally too selfish, which is a natural result of his philosophy: the core issue is that I disagree with his philosophy and am therefore bound to find at least some fault with the art it produces."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"This is quite a book. Mr. Wilde has quite a literary ability. His characters are as vibrant as a Van Gogh, his plot is tense, and he has quite a gift for quips and comebacks. All of this combines for a great piece of literature, regardless of the topic or story.This book explores the darker side of humanity, along the lines of Faust, Dr. Jekyll, and Lord of the Flies. We all feel this dread and anxiety deep within our soul; Wilde does not hold a mirror, but a picture for us to look upon and marvel. You get the chills up and own your spine as you watch Lord Henry seduce Dorian Grey.I think the high point of the story was in Chapter XI when Dorian sets a mirror next to the foul picture and goes back and forth looking at his baby-face and then the incubus in the painting. What is crucial is that Dorian is so detached: he sees himself as the smooth-faced god, but in reality, he is the demon in the picture. But his detachment is what is so crucial. He knows what his soul looks like, but he doesn't care!At times this books seems like a play, which has Wilde's native element. But the prose has such a smooth flow that you do not notice. I found myself constantly underlining Wilde's aphorism. He has a gift for one-liners, and his book is quite a charming read."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"The book is very interesting, although it starts out slow.

It may be fiction, but truth lies within the pages of this book. Oscar Wilde has painted a truly perfect representation of the human species with his character Dorian Gray. A character so full of life that you can't help but be drawn into the book. I was unable to put it down after reading the first page!When you open this book, you are not just reading a story, you are looking into a mirror. You see yourself in Dorian Gray's position as he goes through his trials and tribulations. Regardless of who you are, everyone feels and, at some point, thinks along the line's of Dorian Gray. For some, they may have even traveled down a similar path. It is for this reason that Oscar Wilde was able to create such a realistic character. He created something that people can relate to because each of us has a Dorian Gray within us, at least, to some degree.I don't know if Wilde meant to be so philosophical or psychological with this story, but it is a work of genius. I believe that this book should be part of the required reading material in some age appropriate schools. I doubt that it will, but I feel the character of Dorian Gray and his 'life' would be an eye opener for many.I highly recommend this book to anyone even vaguely curious about it. I honestly cannot understand why this has a single bad rating! If your still not sure after reading the reviews, check with your local library about borrowing it. If you like it, then buy it and save it to read for later.

Utterly infatuated, Basil Hallward captures Dorian's youthful beauty in a portrait.While posing for this portrait, Dorian meets Basil's friend, Lord Henry Wotton, who charmingly preaches hedonism. Lord Henry's efforts to corrupt Dorian work quickly. Convinced that youth and beauty are the only things worth having in life, Dorian looks upon his finished portrait with cruel jealousy. His image will never grow old, but he will.One wish sends the plot of the novel into action: Dorian wishes the portrait would age, while he stays youthful.Enter a lover whose heart Dorian breaks. Her despair coerces her to suicide. With her death on his conscience, he notices an evil glint in the eye of his portrait. Over the years, Basil's painting begins to age. Dorian sabotages reputations and even commits murder, all the while looking as young and beautiful as he did on the day his portrait was painted. However, the portrait-a grotesque reminder of his double life-documents every immoral act.Focusing on duplicity and aestheticism, The Picture of Dorian Gray is a captivating and cinematic tale. Oscar Wilde's knack for dialogue is what made him a famous playwright and parts of Dorian Gray are rich with clever play-like exchanges.Lord Henry's wit is exceptionally tantalizing. But he doesn't seem to take himself too seriously, whereas Dorian adopts everything Lord Henry preaches with the conviction of a Southern Baptist. He's basically just a dumb pretty person that everyone coddles despite the fact that he's a terrible human being.**Side note**The Picture of Dorian Gray is Oscar Wilde's only novel. The book was scandalous when it was released in 1891 because of clear homoerotic undertones. Dorian's lovers are both men and women. Though not overtly sexual, Basil's infatuation with Dorian is questionable. Wilde himself had an affair with Robert Ross."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"I read quite a lot and I have not been so entranced by a book in a very long time.

And lastly, the story line is gripping.If you're approaching this after experiencing Wilde's plays then I should warn you, there is no comedy here, in fact there is barely even a resemblance to the tone of his plays (although some of the dialogue is fairly similar).Either way, this is a damn good read and I certainly recommend it.If you're interested in gothic literature, this is highly, highly recommended, as are the above titles."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"The story is pretty standard.

Some classics are just kind of boring, but this one was quite a surprise! I really enjoyed it!"},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY is one of the most elegant novels in the Gothic canon; that it is also one of the most sinister is hardly surprising given Oscar Wilde's curious aptitude for tempering the macabre with the sensuous and the frivolous with the fatalistic.A considerable scandal upon its publication in the early 1890s, the novel still reads as slightly homoerotic, even if only in the most clandestine and aphotic of ways. Woven through its themes of beauty, decadence, age, and the nature of art is a thread of shimmering doom that becomes more poignant the longer one spends with DORIAN GRAY and the more one considers its relationship with its author.It is a peacock's fan of luminous wit and glimmering color, dripping with venom and smelling of strange perfumes. We are all familiar with the general flavor of things: an innocent and exceptionally beautiful youth has his portrait painted one fateful afternoon; upon viewing the piece, he is paralyzed by the sudden revelation that one day he will be old and hideous while the painting will retain its beauty and life. In a devil's bargain, he wishes that it would be the other way around. And then, under the influence of a particularly deleterious gentleman, Dorian Gray begins to change: his innocence gives way to corruption and his beauty seems apt to languish under the spell of opium, cruelty, and languor. One day Dorian notices that the painting has begun to transform, while he himself retains all the beauty of an innocent despite the ever-swelling ocean of his sins...Few works of literature are as effervescent as DORIAN GRAY and just as few are as utterly pessimistic; that it is capable of fusing remarkably disparate parts into a whole that is absolutely cohesive is a fascinating example of its author's gifts. Like Wilde's SALOME, DORIAN GRAY is as colorful as it is bleak, and even its weaknesses, in context, seem like strengths.Seldom is an artist's most famous work also his most erudite and brilliant: this is one of those works. I have approached it perhaps six or seven times in the last five years, and each reading has left me more enraptured than the last--which is high praise for a novel that relies a great deal on suspense and aesthetic splendour. I consider it one of the finest things I have ever read--daring, sultry, venomous, eloquent, and radiant in its own decay.(From my Gothic fiction blog:[...]"},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"My impetus for reading this book, since I read few novels, was a book entitled \\"The Ripper Code\\" by Thomas Toughill. That book's author posed the theory that in writing \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray,\\" Oscar Wilde was attempting to point the finger of guilt at one of his erstwhile friends, and possible homosexual lovers, as London's \\"Jack the Ripper.\\" This intrigued me, particularly since Wilde's book was published only a year or so after the last of the Ripper murders, and, as Toughill noted, Wilde and his suspect lived only about six miles from the Whitechapel district, where the murders took place, and Wilde clearly chose the date of the last Ripper murder, November 9, 1889, as the date which brought his story to its climax. So, in reading this book, I couldn't help but bear that in mind.After reading this book, it is clear that Wilde based some, if not all, of the main characters in his novel on persons whom he knew and, in all likelihood, on actual conversations he had had with those and other prominent people in London society. And there are certainly clear similarities between at least two of the most prominent characters in his novel and Wilde's friends: namely Dorian Gray, himself, and Wilde's presumed suspect, George Francis \\"Frank\\" Miles, an artist who contracted syphilis and died in 1891 shortly after the final Ripper murder; and Dorian's first love and suicide victim, the young actress Sybyl Vane, and the actress, Lilly Langtree, who Miles and Wilde both knew in her early days and whose career they clearly advanced. Other than that, however, there is little to suggest that Wilde was attempting to point the finger of guilt at Miles or at anyone else.As for the novel itself, I found it to be extremely interesting and hard to put down. I was particularly impressed by the author's apparent insight into human nature, as reflected in some of the ideas expounded on many occasions by Dorian Gray's friend and mentor, Lord Henry Wotton. Some of those passages were rather long, and perhaps a little tedious, but still interesting if one persisted. I consider this to be a classic which most readers would enjoy, but, in my view, Wilde simply drew on his experiences and chose certain events and characters to help sell his book. Frank Miles can rest in peace --- at least for now."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"I have seen the old movie several times, and it tempted me to order the book. Oscar Wilde was a \\"wild child\\", and he gives a glimpse into the often vain and decadant world of English society through the wanton excesses of Dorian...who appears to remain beautiful, youthful, and untouched by evil. It is Dorian's portrait that decays with every misdeed, including murder. The picture haunts Dorian as he travels among the rich, and also into the opium dens and low life of the waterfront. This edition contains a glossary of lesser known terms and references, for us modern folk. It was a quick and fascinating read."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"I knew relatively little going into this book...and what little I did know was from less than 100% accurate retellings such as in League of Extraordinary Gentlemen or references from cheesy shows or horror flicks (I think perhaps there was a reference in Scooby Doo somewhere?). I had the basic gist...there's a guy, Dorian Gray, who has some magical painting that ages while he stays young and wonderful forever. Not much to go on, but I was still excited to read it. I was pleasantly surprised that the book had much more depth to it.&lt;u>Plot&lt;/u>The plot is intriguing and has been used in other stories, though I think this one has more depth than I've seen before. Essentially, Dorian makes a wish that he will be forever as pristine as the painting made of him and that instead the painting will take on it the toils of his life. Whatever supernatural forces allow this to happen are irrelevant...the wish is granted.It's more than a simple \\"young forever\\" contract. Although age plays into the plot in a couple of places, the primary things that distorts the picture are the vices that Dorian engages in. The first transformation of the painting happens after an intense argument with the first woman he loved. It was interesting to me how quickly Dorian recognized the cause of the change for what it was, but had he belabored the motive for too long, the pacing of the book would have stalled and become unacceptable.Dorian uses his \\"power\\" to be ruthlessly reckless in his living. Dorian Gray becomes entirely uninhibited, taking everything to its limit, seeking absolute pleasure. He even sneaks out at night (so as not to tarnish his pristine reputation) to the \\"bad side of town\\" and lives a sort of double life in opium dens with gangs and prostitutes.In many ways (perhaps because I so recently read it), I felt many similarities to the morale commentary presented in Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. I felt that Wilde did a better job of delving into the psyche of the hypocritical character, largely because we were able to get into Dorian's head and think and feel with him, while in Jekyll/Hyde, we were kept at a distance by a third person narrative.&lt;u>Characters&lt;/u>There are three pivotal characters in this book.The first, obviously, is Dorian himself. For the first many chapters (perhaps nearly the first half of the book in fact), I wasn't terribly pleased with Dorian as a character...he felt very flat to me. He was basically a mirror to one of the other primary characters (Harry) and didn't ever show his own opinion. He was hailed as pure and beautiful. Perhaps it's all the art references in the book, but I often felt as if Dorian existed more as a classical statue than as a living, breathing character. As his interaction with the 'picture' progresses and once he takes some rather unexpected steps, he became a deeper character and a lot of fun to be with.The second primary character is Lord Harry (or was it Henry...blast those Brits for swapping those names interchangeably so often *grin*). Harry exists as the provocative, cynical, always-with-a-comment-about-anything mentor to Dorian. Harry is absolutely encouragable and a lot of fun to listen to. His speeches often have to do with the pursuit of pleasure at any and all costs and the hazard of a virtuous and peaceful life. His influence over Dorian is profound. As I mentioned above, it often felt as if Dorian existed merely as a mirror for Harry's advice. Harry didn't seem to follow all of his own advice, but Dorian took it readily to heart and strove to live a 'come-what-may' existence. Harry had some of the funniest and most profound comments of the entire narrative. He's a fabulous character.The third character I want to point out actually existed as more of a background character, but I feel the need to call him out merely because of his pivotal involvement in the plot. I actually can't even remember his name now...but it will suffice to call him, \\"the artist.\\" He's the one who paints Dorian's picture. He's the one who introduces Dorian to Harry. He's the one who tries to give Dorian good advice to counter all the reckless advice that Harry poisons him with. The artist was kind of like Dorian's \\"Jiminey Cricket\\"...his conscious that was often (always?) ignored until it was far too late. He showed up in surprisingly few scenes considering the huge importance he had to the plot.&lt;u>Style, Pacing, etc&lt;/u>The language used in this book was truly beautiful. Wilde wrote flowing, vivid descriptions of characters, places and actions. At times it was very poetic. It may be a bit too flowery for readers who don't enjoy that sort of description...it came very close to being 'over the top' to me in a few places. Still, I generally enjoyed the formality of it and the life it gave to the text. The first dozen or two pages were tedious to me...whether because of the language or just the style and thematic pacing, I'm not sure.The pacing was a bit slower than I would have liked. The main difficulty I saw was that Wilde was trying to present so many themes that he often had to result to lengthy passages praising or condemning one thing or another. There were often very long monologues by one of the three primary characters mentioned above. Harry's were generally offset by bits that made me laugh by their extremity while speeches from Dorian and the artist sometimes made me want to slap them and tell them to shut up.&lt;u>Overall&lt;/u>I was a little torn on my overall feeling for the book. It took me a while to get into it and there were long passages that were drudgerous to push through. However, from a high level, this is one of the better books I've read this year...or even for numerous years. It had a plenitude of intriguing themes that left me thinking in between readings. It had a lot of humorous quips and paradigms as presented by Harry that I laughed out loud at. It had surprising twists and tension that left me curious as to the true outcome (as opposed to that from rip-off stories). There are a couple of spots that could be considered \\"climax\\"...the confrontation with the artist is the main turning point in the book. Personally, I would have rather seen more pages after that turning point than before it. I think the last 1/3 of the book was far more engaging. At the same time, the buildup was necessary to promote the intended mood.Overall, this is a book I definitely recommend, with the caveat that you should be aware that it does slow down at points. Just push through those. The overall work is worthy of a couple of slow zones. In fact, perhaps those slow zones serve the purpose of allowing more pondering.****4.5 stars"},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"This was a rather difficult book to get through.

Once in a while, the story takes sort of a vacation, and you are given a lot of details that don't really apply to the overall plot. Some of the things that are discussed are good at shedding light on some of the things that Mr. Gray was doing throughout the years that this book took place, but they can get a little boring. Truth be told, I skipped most of one chapter because it went on, and on, and on about the things that piqued Dorian Gray's interest. It doesn't stop there, but it explains why it did, what he did about it, and some other people that he associated with while he was pursuing a certain subject, like gemology. In this edition, many of the names that are given through these pages are given an endnote in the back, but to the average person these don't hold much interest. Even to some hardcore fans of classic literature and Gothic Horror could find certain chapters (one at least) very tedious.That being said, there is certainly more good in this book than needed to balance out the less interesting parts. In the beginning, we get to see where the corruption of young Mr. Gray comes from. As the book progresses, you can see the corruption finally consume him, culminating in a surprising finale. I read at work, and my jaw dropped more than once, which I only realized after a co-worker brought attention to it. Even though most people have heard of the themes in the book, this is a fine example of taking an existing theme, and making it into a brilliant new idea.The ideas contained in this book can be a little disturbing to some with a weak stomach. Some of the language can be a little stiff and hard to read, but remember it was written in the 1890's.This book is highly recommended for anybody who has an interest in the Classics or Gothic Horror. Not for the faint of heart, but if it's ever crossed your mind to read The Picture of Dorian Gray, pick this book up! If you want to start reading Gothic Horror, I would suggest something a little lighter to start with -- Edgar Allan Poe, The Phantom of the Opera, or something like that. Those are a little easier, and give you a good idea of what the genre is all about.Happy Reading!"},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"\`So, Henry, how is that young Prot&eacute;g&eacute;e of yours progressing, hem?Lord Henry paused to saviour his glass. Pleased, he set it down, just so, beside his dinner plate, and turned to Lord Fermor.\`Pundits say troubles come in threes, Uncle,' replied Lord Henry. \`What the pundits omit in their gabardine rush to spread their misery to others in a foolish attempt to alleviate their own, is that the best in life never travels solo. Take, for example, the wine and dinner before us. Both French. Together they constitute a meal to entice the gods down from the Mount. When did you ever come across a bad French meal, or a good French man? Yet when wine and food march together, they repay the Creator.'\`No doubt,' replied Lord Fermor, \`but you evade the issue. I asked about the young chap you have taken into your entourage, you know.' Lord Fermor struggled to recall the name, \`that chap who poses for Mr Hallward here.'Basil Hallward felt the heat of recognition first on his brow, then running through his whole body. A retiring man, more at home with his easels and sitters than at high table, he shrank from the public glare.Recognising the signs, though failing to sympathise with them, Lady Agatha piped up.\`Mr Hallword has many sitters, do you not, Sir.'\`Er, yes, indeed I do,' replied Mr Hallward, grateful for the prompt. \`For example, just today I encountered a young man of exquisite appearance, youth in all its pomp. He has promised to sit for me. Lord Henry, I fancy, will try to take him away and teach him of the world, thereby spoiling him as a object d'art.' He laughed to denote humour, simultaneously glancing at his friend to convey the serious meaning behind his joke. Keep away Lord Henry, the glanced announced, shielded behind the laughter. Keep away from this young man lest you send him on the eternal search for fulfilment and in so doing corrupt his soul.Lord Henry roared.\\"Why Basil, you surpass yourself! Hiding a serious message behind a joke so that you may deliver it in public. Would that the Good Book decked itself in such garlands, the better to frighten the masses. You are a greater artist than your canvasses know.'\`I fear my husband is avoiding your question, Lord Fermor,' laughed Lady Victoria. \`When it comes to hiding a serious message behind the veil of farce, he may rival Dante himself.'\`What is the name of your young beauty?' Inquired Lord Henry amidst the general humour. \`I only ask,' he pressed, \`so that I may avoid him. Let us hope I have more success than Eve, who expressed no desire to harvest the only tree in the garden that contained a serpent, until admonished not to. Of course,' Lord Henry continued, \`our Creator did not warn off the firstborn with laughter on his lips. Had he done so, perhaps we would be consuming ambrosia still. Mind you,' he reflected, \`this French cuisine is an adequate substitute.'\`Yes yes yes Henry,' broke in Lord Fermor, \`but what about your young Prot&eacute;g&eacute;e? Has he a fine future, seeking the dark mysteries of life of which you profess to be so fond?'\`Should he avoid hubris, I see for him a long, comfortable and satisfactory life.'\`And should he fail to avoid hubris?' teased Lady Agatha.\`Then I see for him immortality in print and prose. Hubris is man's affirmation of his living soul, his insistence that all must be as he ordains, and his rage that it is not. Should Basil paint hubris he would reveal Caliban.\`Modesty, on the other hand, is pleasing to the casual senses but fleeting, like snow on the chimneystack. Modesty and prose combine to produce the barely adequate. Hubris and prose combine to produce immortality, but not personal happiness.'\`And this choice, modesty of hubris, is one you see before Dorian Gray?' queried Mr Hallword.\`Dorian who?' Lord Henry responded. He reached again for the reassuring certainty in his wine glass. \`I was referring to my Prot&eacute;g&eacute;e, Oscar Wilde.'"},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde is definitely a disturbing book. I think there is great worth in reading it, particularly when paired with a book such as Uncle Tom's Cabin by Harriet Beecher Stowe or Les Miserables by Victor Hugo. Contrasting Dorian's sordid downfall with with the heroic ascension of Uncle Tom or Jean Valjean is particularly beneficial.The Picture of Dorian Gray begins with Dorian, a young and handsome gentleman who is involved with philanthropy, sitting for a portrait while his new friend, Lord Henry, a sarcastic and hedonistic man of society, watches on. Dorian is described as being \\"unspotted from the world\\" and his beauty inspires the artist to his very best work. Lord Henry exclaims how lovely the portrait has turned out, but laments that it is too bad that the picture will stay young forever, whereas Dorian will eventually age and lose his youth and beauty. A vexed Dorian makes a wish that he will stay timeless and the picture will age instead of him.Taking Lord Henry as a mentor, Dorian sets out to apply Lord Henry's selfish and narcissistic worldview into nearly every facet of his life. In time, Dorian realizes that his wish has magically come true. He remains beautiful, while his painting takes on all the consequences of his wicked actions. As the debased Dorian sins more and more, the picture becomes more hideous and tortures Dorian's soul.Despite being filled with Wilde's signature wit, this is a haunting story showing the consequence of selfish character and the downfall of the soul due to despicable and hideous behaviors. Dorian loses his inner beauty long before he realizes that his soul's ugliness will destroy him.It's interesting to note that he chooses a French novel as his own Core Book, a personal classic which guided him throughout his life. In comparison, Uncle Tom and Jean Valjean both chose the Bible as their Core book. Near the end of the book, Dorian laments, \\"You poisoned me with a book once. I should not forgive that. Harry, promise me that you will never lend that book to any one. It does harm.\\"Wilde clearly shows that books exert an amazing influence over our lives. We must be wise in our choice of what we read. As Thoreau once said, \\"Read the best books first, or you may not have the chance to read them at all.\\" I would only add to that, \\"Read the best books most often, for they will color your soul.\\""},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"A classic and moving novel, The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde discusses man's desire for youth, as well as his involvement in vanity. A tale of two differing personalities, the story is enticing, yet grippingOscar Wilde does an excellent job of revealing the contrasting atmospheres throughout the book. He does a fine job depicting the lighter side of Dorian Gray with images of life and excitement for example when he is getting painted, the light is bright and it takes place near a garden filled with beautiful flowers. Wilde is also able to portray the dark and menacing side in Dorian Gray as he eventually commits murder. Dorian Gray comes off as such a complicated character which makes him so interesting. He wants to fulfill his desires but is unable to do so successfully. People can feel how each person has a part of Dorian Gray in him or her. We all have our flaws we want to fix, but we should not become obsessive over them or it leads to destruction as seen in the book.The story is fascinating in that it is able to capture reader's interest because the mysteries in the plot are so intriguing. Although the book has that characteristic gothic element of a man living without the fear of death or consequence, The picture of Dorian Gray is still an accomplishment because it is written beautifully through the character description.The Picture of Dorian Gray is worth the read, as readers are guaranteed to be captivated by the mysteries the character Dorian Gray holds."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"The Story:Dorian Gray is an adonis who is reminded or rather made attentive to his own beauty by a gentle artist friend (or lover) of his, Basil Hallward, who makes a breathtaking portrait of Gray. The portrait eventually becomes a favorite with Dorian, which also mirrors, in its painted face a sombre reflection of his own misdeeds and immoralities -- each time he commits it -- by growing uglier and uglier. He guards it with extreme care and caution everyday wanting none to see it found marred by his iniquities. Early in the story Dorian happens to meet with a reckless rich man, Lord Henry, a friend of Basil, who cares not a tithe for morality and its dull unattractive ways but believes in living life to the fullest at any cost. He preaches hedonism as sacred and purity a sin. Both Lord Henry and Dorian take an instant liking towards each other the day they meet. This friendship has an obvious deleterious effect on Dorian in that he kills himself repentantly after realising the worthlessness of his having lived a pompous, immoral, wicked and greedy life. Just before the story ends, he kills his well-wisher Basil too.How the story is arranged:Initially, the first few chapters seem to move fast and the story gains momentum. Just as the reader becomes inquisitive, a dull tone appears making the following chapters languorous. Wilde becomes a bit didactic in elaborating on the various interests Dorian picks on in his later adult life. Also, as one naturally imagines Dorian as a young lad, we then suddenly find him a thirties something in the last few chapters without a clear and smooth manifestation of this transition from adolescence to manhood. Most of Dorian's life is sinfully adventurous and in spite of that is portrayed quite uninterestingly. No events are specifically narrated upon and the emphasis on homosexuality can be smoothly sidelined. Overall, the story is good only if viewed as a philosophical inquest into human nature. Anything beyond that may disappoint the reader.Relevance, Reflections and Conclusion:The entire story is a narration of essentially how importantly one's mind makes one's personality, how one's personality makes one's deeds, and how in turn those deeds make one's soul. Of course we do not really fashion our soul, we only help it manifest it through our deeds. Gray's character is a reflection of the kind of narcissist weaklings in humanity who lack the courage to face their dark corners, while constantly finding strength and support in being mentored (actually misled) by feckless perverse people, like Lord Henry here, who lead them increasingly towards moral obscurity. How different the world would be if each one of us could reason out \\"responsibly\\" all that seems perverse and sacred, and yet not give in to anything perverse or sacred until one has found it true himself! I have also found the concept of blame game in this story very interesting. Do we not often dutifully blame others for our own darkness and failures, just as Dorian Gray blames his friend Basil Hallward for turning him into a deplorable narcissist? A responsible man always shares the burden of his own actions, rather than carelessly and callously point fingers at others -- a good lesson to learn! The story also raises deep philosophical arguments at every nook and corner if one plunges deep into the characters of the story attentively. Simple sentences like \\"Nowadays people know the price of everything and the value of nothing\\" had me thinking and I found it strongly relevant in today's consumeristic hegemony. There are many more such dialogues which raise questions about the importance of femininity, marriage, purity, aestheticism and so on. Anyhow, to read it for its \\"own sake\\", or to try to finish it in a hurry, will certainly make it very boring and tiresome. But for those who inveterately love to question and investigate the world they live in with its various dogmas, theologies, philosophies and doctrines either propagating or thrashing morality, this book makes an interesting read. Since I do not possess a bent of mind that appreciates a tragic ending, -- I consider human life very precious --, I was sorely disappointed to see the protagonist, Dorian Gray, dead in the end. In fact I find this style of defeatist writing/ending a flaw in itself though it appeals to many. Plainly, if I were the author, I would have given my protagonist a new life, a new philosophy, a new guidance, and a new hope. HOPE...without which the entire humanity cannot exist."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"Funny at times and gut-wrenching at others, this book kept me hooked. Lord Henry, an influence on Doria, said the most oxymoronic stuff, sometimes funny and awful at the same time. I had read that in reading Oscar Wilde, this book was a great place to start.

You're supposed to read it because it's a classic (no need for quotes around classic). On the other hand, it's pretty much about giving in to one's lesser wants and needs. We've all probably seen Dorian at one time or another. If we're lucky, we see him before the fall. There is something about a beautiful youth who has yet to fell the fingers of corruption. Many have seen him during the process of corruption (gosh...we may have even participated in said corruption). We've probably even seen him near the end of the process. Oscar Wilde's novel is brilliant. It covers the process of corruption very well. The ending is cliche, but it wasn't (probably) at the time.And, since I'm writing this for the e-book (uncensored), the model on the cover of the book is, ummmmm..., worth considering being corrupted by or corrupting."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"This free classic version for my Kindle was very good!

Wilde has taken an old story and transformed it into a tale of Victorian excess and corruption. He has created a main character (Dorian) with whom a little part of all of us can identify with--he lives his life to the fullest extent, but doesn't age, while his portrait bears the burden of his fast living. I highly reccemmend this book to anyone who enjoys good literature at it's best. Wilde was primarily known as a playwright, but with Dorian Gray, he has proved that he was a great novelist also."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"A true work of art that anyone can hold in their hand and return to again and again. I found myself constantly reaching for a pen to underline all those Wilde words thast only Oscar could have penned. He saw the world in such a unique way that will never be replicated.

Throughout his life he becomes more and more heinous morally, while retaining his innocent look until his death, which is the suprise ending...Also included in this book are the short stories 'Lord Aurthur Savile's Crime,' 'The Canterville Ghost,' 'The Sphinx Without a Secret,' and 'The Model Millionare.'"},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"I feel perplexed about The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde. On one hand, the story is well written about a young man being moulded and shaped. On the other hand, this book was incredibly flowery and doesn't really start for 100 pages. Dorian doesn't really know about life and meets an artist and an aristocrat that help him though his journey into manhood. The artist paints his portrait, subsequently making him keep his youth. The aristocrat had the biggest influence on Dorian Gray, though Lord Harry Wotton is very annoying. He talks and talks the whole way through this book, thinking he's so witty.Dorian Gray starts off in this novel as a blank slate, an easily influenced young man. Thoughout the rest of the story he gets moulded and pushed into shape. After Basil paints his portrait Dorian starts to unravel, afraid to show the picture, he locks it way in a room and never lets anyone see it, protecting it at all costs. The whole thing symbolising the way we hide our real selves from the rest of the world, scared of what they may think.The Picture of Dorian Gray would have been controversial in its day, with strong homosexual themes. Though the book itself is more about the life and morality, Oscar Wilde did a brilliant of capturing this element of the book. For me the biggest downfall of this book was that Lord Wotton was too loud and dominates throughout the entire book."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"This is an incredibly well written, wonderfully illustrated, and very interesting book to read. I have read and already own The Picture of Dorian Gray, but this book adds so much to my understanding of the story, the characters, and the time in which Wilde wrote the book. Plus it has fascinating references to Oscar Wilde's friends, enemies, his views on woman, art, life, and his other stories. I am reading every annotation, every footnote, and the story all at the same time. This book is a must have if you enjoy Oscar Wilde, and wish to understand him better. Buy It!"},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"First off, for the audience looking to read this book after viewing the character from the movie LXG, know that the characteristics of Dorian are no as they were in the movie. Dorian does not die when he looks at his portrait; in fact his observation of the changes in his picture is one of the main elements of the story. Basil, an artist that is obsessed with the beauty of one man, Dorian, paints a portrait so beautiful that the subject is pained by the fact that the portrait's beauty will outlast that of his mortal body, and he wishes that this formula could be reversed, with the portrait aging in his place. He gets his wish, but at what price? Dorian, now free from the bounds of mortality, is no longer afraid to sin, since there he thinks that nothing can happen to him. But his behavior was not all due to his immortality; it was also due to the fact that the negative influence from Lord Henry corrupted his pure soul. The fact that he was able to keep his beauty but not able to keep his soul shows that judgment based on appearance is not only wrong, but inaccurate. This book is recommended, but not to the highest extent. The story picks up quickly, as it must with such a limited amount of pages. One of the only flaws in this book is chapter 11, the long, unwanted pause. A classic nonetheless, one that should no be overlooked."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"Wilde creates a Faustian plot where Dorian Gray wishes to never grow old, and gives up his soul to do so. Basil Hallward paints a portrait of Gray - the portrait ages while Gray retains his youth. Standard fare from Wilde full of quotable lines and quips. Flows well with interesting turns in the plot. Recommended."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"Oscar Wilde is a witty and brilliant writer, and his only novel, The Picture of Dorian Gray, is a treasure. One of it's best aspects is something another reviewer mislabeled as a flaw, that every viewpoint presented by Wilde is contradicted in another part of the book. This is absolutely brilliant. By building an entire book out of contradictions, the reader can take absolutely any message they want from the book, or no message at all. It meet Wilde's goal (if indeed anything Wilde said can be taken seriously - remember that the paradoxical Henry Wotton is basically a fictional version of Wilde) of \\"art for art's sake,\\" but it can just as easily be a morality tale for anyone that wants one. Henry Wotton can either be the worst kind of villain or a quite harmless and likeable chap who a dumb kid took too seriously.So read this book for it's witty and memorable dialogue, mostly from Henry Wotton. Read it for the shocking (at least at the time) tale of Dorian Gray. Read it for the myriad meanings you can take from it. Just don't skip it because it doesn't have one, consistent message. Anyone can write a message. It takes a genius to write a collection of messages that perfectly balance and disprove one another."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"Of all the fears that creep into a man's heart,the most disturbing is the fear of one's own self. A man may evade the whole world but can't deny his conscience and as William Shakespeare remarks somewhere,\\"Conscience doth make coward of us all\\". One may accomlish painting goodliness on one's visage but would never be able to blend his soul in a similar fashion. The whispers of the soul about one's past sins and misdeeds keep lingering in one's heart.And that's precisely the theme of Oscar Wilde's only novel \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\". It is a telling tale about a stunningly handsome,almost beautiful,man's bizzare idiosyncracy of authoring his own tragic doom,about how a youth so splendidly bestowed with beauty,wealth,royalty and women could get sucked in by the myriad forces that he himself gave rise to,about a man's confused,complex frame of mind.Dorian Gray is that ultimate effigy of an ideal youth gifted with all arts and talents. He's the instinctive and eternal source of inspiration,\\"simply a motive in art\\" to his friend,artist Basil Hallward. The backdrop is the gentry and the royalty class of London during the late 19th. century and the Irish writer's genius lies in exploiting this landscape to picture in words and absolutely ethereal imageries man's obscure desires. Dorian becomes obsessed with his portrait traced by Basil and in the general flow of the tyde,conceives an unimaginable notion:to remain forever young whilst the portrait may wither! Indeed such a wish lurks deep inside everyone and so does the realisation o its fruitlessness. But for once,at least in fiction,the fantasy is translated into truth,a dark,troublesome truth.Evey novel,and for that matter every incident,requires a certain spark to unfold a series of actions to conglomerate into a rare item called literature. That urge in \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is impelled by Lord Henry Wotton, a cynical and witty man just ten years older than Dorian,whose eloquent gush of words \\"touched some secret chord\\" in Dorian's heart and sets it \\"vibrating and throbbing to curious impulses\\". The philosophies and crisp remarks by Lord Wotton about life in general and youth in particular push the youth onto his demise.Supernaturally Doian Gray's desire to remain young for good does manufacture itself into a fascinating reality but there's nothing called free lunch under the sun. Commencing from the time when Dorian turns an implicit murderer of his lover Sibyl Vane through the constant denudation of principles and character in the subsequent fourty or so years culminating in him murdering his friend Basil,Dorian stays protected under the shade of evergreen youth whilst his portrait consistently deteriorates and ages---it even turns a mirror of Dorian's own soul with dark contours signifying the crimes committed by him lining its entire figure and in his attempt to relieve himself of the picture,and with it his hideous sins,the eponymous potagonist brings about his own end.The theme of \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is singled out to be about how we get disturbed by our own souls but there're other ideas webbed in as well. That the author Oscar Wilde had an inclination towards gay culture is of course a subtle truth and this is ever so slightly pictured in Basil Hallward's unassuming and suspicious admiration of Dorian. The general occurrences in the gentry society and invokation to women's feelings too are colossaly and humourously penned down superadded by a streak of confusing and often conflicting ideas of life that never falter.There was never really a Faust who sold his soul to the Devil but it was actually Goethe's authorical magic that made it seem so. There was never really a Dorian Gray who exchanged peace for youth but it's actually Oscar Wilde's staunch belief that \\"it is the spectator,and not life,that art really mirrors\\" that materialiases into a concrete portrayal of life in fiction. After reading Emile Bronte's \\"Wuthering Heights\\",we rue that the authoress never composed any other novel and similarly after imbibing the charisma of \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\",which just remains on the margins of a psychological insight into a man's nature,we regret that we can't lay our hands on another classic by this wonderful,wonderful writer."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"I saw many variances of movies but never read the book. It was a true page turner. It left me wondering about Oscar Wilde's state of mind...LOL!"},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"With his life spanning the later half of the 19th Century, Oscar Wilde wrote in a wide variety of mediums, ranging from poetry to plays and from essays to fairy tales, and one novel. His fairy tales are arguably the most accessible of his writings, and as is the case with fairy tales revolve around some moral theme being conveyed. For instance in \`The Selfish Giant' a giant places a wall around his garden to keep the children out, and thus spring never comes on his garden, causing him to realize the result of his selfishness. Similarly in \`The Star-Child' a beautiful boy is forced to come to terms with his prideful cruelty.The Picture of Dorian Gray can be seen as a continuing of this fairy tale manner of writing, except in novel form (though even then the novel is fairly short).The story begins in the art-studio of Basil, a painter who is putting the final touches on what is said to be his most greatest painting. With him is Lord Henry, a shallow obscurantist of high society who upon hearing of the figure in the portrait desires to meet with him - the figure being that of a young and impressionable Dorian Gray. The two become friends and eventually the philosophy of Lord Henry begins to have its affect on him.In the words of Lord Henry, this amounts to \\"if one man were to live out his life fully and completely, were to give form to every feeling, expression to every thought, reality to every dream-I believe that the world would gain such a fresh impulse of joy that we would forget all the maladies of mediaevalism, and return to the Hellenic ideal-to something finer, richer than the Hellenic ideal, it may be... The only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it.\\"Throughout the course of the novel Dorian comes to embrace this ideal, giving into his own inner nature: \\"Eternal youth, infinite passion, pleasures subtle and secret, wild joys and wilder sins-he was to have all these things. The portrait was to bear the burden of his shame: that was all... For there would be a real pleasure in watching it. He would be able to follow his mind into its secret places. This portrait would be to him the most magical of mirrors. As it had revealed to him his own body, so it would reveal to him his own soul. \\"Thus Dorian Gray enters into a sort of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde type of scenario with himself where he resolves to do away with his conscience - where Mr. Hyde reveals the truth of Dr Jekyll, the portrait comes to reveal the truth of Dorian Gray, and before the end he must come to face that truth.The book is enjoyable, and at around 180pgs can be read in an evening. Like his fairy tales it comes away with a moral, though modern renditions of the character seem to miss this point.Memorable Quotes:-\\"You know how I love secrecy. It is the only thing that can makemodern life wonderful or mysterious to us. The commonest thing isdelightful if one only hides it.\\"-\\"Modern morality consists in accepting the standard of one's age. I consider that for any man of culture to accept the standard of his age is a form of the grossest immorality.\\"-\\"Ah! in what a monstrous moment of pride and passion he had prayed thatthe portrait should bear the burden of his days, and he keep theunsullied splendour of eternal youth! All his failure had been due tothat. Better for him that each sin of his life had brought its sureswift penalty along with it. There was purification in punishment.Not \\"Forgive us our sins\\" but \\"Smite us for our iniquities\\" should bethe prayer of man to a most just God.\\"Specific CriticismsI don't believe I have any real criticisms or complaints about this book. I do have to say that I greatly disliked the character of Lord Henry, and the book can be read much more quickly if you skip all his dialogue after his first few rants. If you've read one of his conversations you've read them all; the basic model is that he says something absurd or outlandish and then the other characters alternately gasp and fawn over his words.Every now and then this is interrupted by him saying something exceptionally bland, such as remarking that \\"They are both simply forms of imitation\\" when Basil makes the statement that \\"Love is a more wonderful thing than art.\\" Or by making some contradiction in terms, such as \\"I never approve, or disapprove, of anything now. It is an absurd attitude to take towards life.\\"Little nuances of character stand out, such as Henry and Dorian constantly remarking about the shallowness of other characters while demonstrating a pointed shallowness throughout the book. Of course this isn't a criticisms of the book or the writing, it is likely in fact a praise of the writing, that he can create such a distasteful character.More reviews at ellipsisomnibus.wordpress.com"},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"Especially considering the time of writing, this book sets out a rare insight into the workings of the human mind.

This story is about a young man who grows to be a sinful and terribly vain man driven by love, beauty and art.The Main character, Dorian Gray, at the beginning of the book is a beautiful and youthful man. Dorian was a man everyone wanted to be around just because he had innocence and he was different. \\"He has a simple and beautiful nature.\\" Says Basil Hallward. This innocence and beauty changes as he becomes friends with Lord Henry and his values of life change him. Because Dorian was so nave, Lord Henry lured Dorian into a whole new life and new philosophies about love, beauty and selfishness. This is not the only deep friendship that is developed in this book. Dorian also becomes friends with Basil Hallward and Basil paints a portrait of Dorian and Basil puts his whole heart into this painting for it to ultimately destroy himself and Dorian. Anyway, Dorian wishes that he could stay young all his life and always be beautiful. As he grows older Dorian does many terrible and shocking things but he still remains beautiful and untouched while his painting of himself shows the real nasty, terrible, and corrupted Dorian.One part of the book that really captivated me is when Dorian murder's one of his good friends. I think this is one of the turning points in the book because I believe Dorian realizes that life shouldn't be based on the appearance of things but more about quality and spirit. Dorian understands that his lifestyle of upscale parties with London's elite, and his friendship with Lord Henry is not all that it seems to be. You can see that after Dorian murders someone he questions himself and the painting because he realizes what the painting has done to him. During the last pages of the book we can see how Dorian self-destructs and finds away to restore the painting of exquisite and youth.This book was very different from anything I read and I loved it. I like how Oscar Wilde wrapped me into this book with many compelling and interesting thoughts. The main lessons I learned from this book is question your role models and to value your life. Another lesson I learned is to not worry about beauty because if we only pick things that are beautiful we miss the wonderful and mysterious things that don't look pretty but deep inside they are."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"Oscar Wilde's only novel is one of the best books I have ever read. The story is fascinating, and one that most people have heard of--that Dorian Gray, a young, beautiful man, makes a fervent wish that he would never grow old, and that the portrait just painted by his artist friend would age instead. This occurs, leading Dorian down a path of debauchery and cruelty, most of which must have been too horrific for Oscar Wilde to go into detail without violating obscenity laws.The book is a masterpiece in examining manipulation. The artist introduces Dorian to a friend, Lord Henry, who calls Dorian's attention to his beauty, and Dorian, formerly innocent and sweet, becomes vain. It is amazing to see just how potent the power of suggestion is, and this novel demonstrates it perfectly.The writing is less than perfect. One chapter goes on and on about artifacts that Dorian has collected around the world, leaving the reader saying, &quot;Okay, and who cares?&quot; Wilde's prose is far from flawless, but the story is so engaging that the reader will be willing to overlook the imperfections and will be intrigued in spite of this."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"This fascinating story of extreme narcissism and moral dilemna provides food for thought on the author's strange and sometimes twisted views on society as played out by the characters. This book provides a deep pessimism which ultimately corrupts innocense in the end. rather a strange, but interesting novel to say the least"},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"Oscar Wilde seems to have written a somewhat scathing critique of late nineteenth century English life, or at least that of the upper class. The two main characters, Dorian Gray himself and his mentor Lord Henry Wotton, lead lives of extreme self-indulgence.Lord Henry constantly spews forth his theories and philosophies regarding everything about human nature. Although they are numerous, Henry's ideas can be condensed into one main point. Early in the narrative when he is first exercising his right to influence under the title of mentor, Henry exclaims to Dorian that the only thing worth having is youth. Youth, which is, according to Henry, the only stage where beauty can be found, comes with an ever-present hedonistic lifestyle. This is the template for which the impressionable Dorian bases his life upon.Dorian becomes the ultimate purveyor of self-indulgence and corrupts everything he associates himself with, all the while accompanied on his journeys by a curse of grave implications. To the disappoint of many, I will not give away more of the story; as I'm sure most of you are already salivating over the details I have put forth.The story unfolds at first in a matter of weeks and then jumps several years, yet the focus of the novel does not waiver. This Romantic Period novel is filled with the standard mystery, and a central dealing with human nature. It is well written and comes with excellent detail, as required by this writing period. It also comes with the characteristic whit of Oscar Wilde. The dialogue between characters is excellent and Lord Henry's theories are exquisite often bordering on comical, but always cynical.Wilde seems to warn against the excess of hedonism and uses the story of Dorian Gray as a deterrent. More importantly I believe this is a social critique of high society, which breeds excess and cultivates decadence, while often regarding everything with a selfish eye. The book is filled intellectual quips about human nature and society, yet it is a short book and relatively easy read. This book is required reading for many, so possibly you've already read it, but if not, during commercial breaks of course, give this a try."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray is a terrific melodramatic Romantic-era novel. It is a pleasant story of an artist-Basil-and his relationship with a young man named Dorian Gray. Basil often paints portraits of Gray, and one day a man named Lord Henry Wotton comes and changes Gray's life. Though I don't want to spoil the rich plot, Gray is faced with the reality that he will soon age and the sketches will not, and he is horrified.The book is a quick read, despite mostly long chapters (fifteen pages or so). I was able to sit down and read the book, often finding myself enjoying a book assigned in English class. Though it is quick moving and a reasonably short book, it is a book meant for high schoolers and older.For a story out of the Romantic era, I really enjoyed reading this book. It wasn't one of the books that I had to turn to Cliff's Notes to understand-it was an easy read. The book kind of reminded me of a soap opera, though not nearly as lame, it had some parts that would appear in the script of a soap. I found myself hating Lord Henry for ruining Gray, and enjoying the choices that Gray made.Overall this book is definitely worth a quick read. It's not your typical Romantic book, because it isn't a cheesy novel, it has some real depth. I recommend it to anybody looking for a quick and easy read or if it's on the reading list for somebody's summer required reading for English. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"The story in itself was great, I loved it! However, Wilde's use of excess pronouns could tend to confuse a reader.

The storyline is dynamic and captivating while the words play smooth and melodious. &quot;The Picture of Dorian Gray&quot; is thought-provoking and certain to interest a variety of readers. I would recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"Oscar Wilde was born in Dublin in 1854. He was a poet, playwright and author, though is perhaps a little more widely known for his wit. He studied at both Trinity College Dublin and at Oxford's Magdalen College - where he became a part of the Aesthetic Movement. At Trinity, he won the Berkeley Gold Medal while at Magdalene, he won the Newdigate Prize in 1878. He subsequently graduated from Magdalene with a double first - however, he failed to be elected to the Oxford Union, which is something I'd imagine they're very embarrassed about now. After a very colourful - though, at times, difficult - life, he died in 1900 and is buried in Pere Lachaise in Paris. \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is Wilde's only novel, and was first published in 1891.Basil Hallward is a highly-regarded and well-known artist. As the book opens, he has just completed his latest portrait - one of his latest muse, a young gentleman called Dorian Gray. Hallward's friend, Lord Henry Wotton, thinks it's the finest work completed by Hallward and suggests it should be exhibited in the Grosvenor - Hallward, however, disagrees. He feels he has put too much of himself into the portrait, insisting it would reveal more of the painter than the subject. Basil has become obsessed with Gray : he sees him daily, and describes his presence as \\"absolutely necessary\\". Wotton naturally becomes intrigued, and is keen to meet Gray. Basil, on the other hand, wants to keep them apart - knowing Henry would be the worst possible influence. Unfortunately, Gray calls round unexpectedly and he has to introduce them...Basil's fears were well founded. By the end of their first conversation, Dorian is completely in Henry's thrall and is convinced that his youth and beauty will only gradually fail - leaving him with nothing of value. He offers his soul, if his looks remain as they are, while his portrait ages in his place. Under Henry's guidance, Dorian dedicates to the \\"new Hedonism\\" - and, in time, he notices the portarit not only ages but becomes more hideous with each sin.I found it difficult to see exactly how Basil and Henry came to be friends. Apart from a little pretentiousness and plenty of flouncing - especially in the book's early pages - they appeared to have nothing in common. I did find it a little difficult to take Henry seriously, though - luckily, for the book - Dorian proves to be as impressionable as he is vain. He is dominated by Henry's malign influence and - despite occasionally considering returning to the straight and narrow via Basil - generally remains happy to follow the path Henry set out for him. A book that gets better as it goes along, as it starts to deal with Dorian's internal struggles - and is certainly much better than some other classics I've read."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"I have never read this book before getting it for my Kindle. I love it, the book makes you tink about how you conduct your life and how it shows on you.This book also gives the reader a window into the life of a the rich of England at the time.

A morality tale wrapped up in a story dripping with homoeroticism and hedonism. I can't imagine how much pleasure Wilde had when he wrote this story and how much went on his head that never actually made it onto the page as a result of the laws of the time. This luscious, lusty Faustian tale is so dark and delicious; discreet when it has to be, suggestive when it wants to be. And the picture I have of Dorian Gray in my mind is that of the most beautiful man on earth--yes, we're all suckers for a bad boy, aren't we!"},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"I'm really not sure why a lot of people have not read this. It truly is a work that can only be appreciated when read and reread. This is my second time reading through the pages that Wilde weaves with this epigrams and curious cascading delight for words. Each sentence is as interesting and beautiful as the last as he speaks of sin conveyed in the most interesting of manners.Truly, Dorian is a fall from grace. A Lucifer that could have looked upon what he would become if he had the choice. Perhaps the concept of the Devil hanging over Dorian's shoulder is what makes this story so interesting. Sin never weathers Dorian's face, he remains as beautiful as he was when he was in the prime of the human age. Only the tell-tale signs of age and sin and hate and cruelty are etched upon the portrait that Basil so intricately painted. It is an ugly thing that portrays every crime Dorian ever committed. Even, towards the end of the novel, when he wished to become 'good' the old sin cannot be washed away. Even so, Dorian cannot conform to the 'good life' and instead forces himself to an unknowing demise because he cannot cope with the prospect of living a wholesome life. He would have to give up the sweet taste of sin, that which he had known without reprimand for years."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"Dorian Gray is an exceptionally handsome young man, but when he sees his portrait and realizes his own beauty he wishes that the painting would grow old while he could remain young. At first he is mortified when he finds changes in his painted image, but influenced by a friend Dorian begins to seek the pleasures in life. No matter what depths he sinks to his handsome face remains unchanged, while the portrait grows uglier and more hideous, burdened not only by age but by his debauched lifestyle.I don't know if this work of literature is as widely read as it maybe once was but I was quite taken in by the story. It's interesting that Dorian, instead of using the portrait as a type of conscience to correct his actions, instead takes strange delight in observing the change. He revels in his freedom from outward consequences and digs deeper, delving into every pleasure. In some ways the separate manifestations of the individual reminded me ofDr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, while his recognition of his outward appeal and how it would fade seemed to have shades of Bradbury'sDandelion Wine. And the character of Lord Henry is interesting, always in the background congratulating him and encouraging Dorian's sensual hedonism. But it's also a critique of society, both Victorian and today: we spend our time and money trying to reverse the effects of age (the gym, cosmetics and cosmetic surgery, etc.); companies spend billions idealizing (or idolizing) \\"youth\\"; and some even even seek to excuse away weakness and place blame elsewhere. In all, it may not be a perfect story but it's very interesting and thought-provoking."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"This book begins as a very light and humorous vignette that slowly evolves into the dangers of depending upon one's \\"perfect exterior\\".

That said, the higher threshold of today's readers for topics that would have made a Victorian-era bookworm blush doesn't take away at all from the bona-fide quality of writing, and depth of thought, manifested within the complex discourses of Oscar Wilde's characters time and again throughout \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray.\\"The storyline itself is interesting -- a young man, driven to trade his soul for lifelong youth and beauty, is left with a brutally accurate reminder that the burdens of the soul are inescapable. Nevertheless, the clever plot is the lesser of the art forms Wilde exhibits in this book.The most impressive feature of Wilde's writing in this novel is the manner in which his characters express and justify devious thoughts. Corrupt and evil notions are so explicitly well-rationalized, with such a seemingly undeniable logic, that the reader is almost forced to pause, mid-paragraph at times, to debate in his own mind whether he agrees with what he just read. As the story unfolds, and the maladies brought about through the gradual corruption of Dorian Gray grow more and more apparent and profound, one almost needs to turn the pages back to the stanzas previously used to justify an ill-fated thought simply to reconsider why such statements at first seemed to be such decent insights about humanity. Perhaps we are all just as corruptible as Dorian Gray? If so, that is the genius of Oscar Wilde in this work.This novel is not simply one to be read; rather it is a novel to be read deeply into. There is a little bit of Dorian Gray in us all."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"reading this for the first time, i remember the movie that was made in the 1980's (vaguely) i'm a fan of oscar wilde and these pocket editions as well!"},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"I love this story.

Many of us our familiar with the basic Dorian Gray fable - a man yearns for immortality and gets it. In Wilde's take, Dorian Gray, a young handsome teenager wishes the deprecating effects of age to strike his portrait and not his flesh. He gets his wish and at the goading of Lord Henry becomes an absolute hedonist. Always within though there seems to be a remorseful conscience, a longing for purity. But the ease of depravity squashes moral sentiments before they take root. In the end though, the ageless man finally confronts his portrait...After learning of the author, Oscar Wilde, I was surprised that the book came from his pen (thinly veiled homoeroticism nonwithstanding). I interpreted the book as a cautionary tale against heedlessness and indulgence - basically against the materialist character of Lord Henry. It is a moral tale that explores themes of beauty and its subsidary: age.

It is beautifully done like a silk tapestry or a work of art. His ideas about life and what place art has in life are equally as interesting. It is obvious to the reader from the moment he or she picks up the book that it is mostly about art, as the title itself shows---The Picture of Dorian Gray. It becomes clear to the reader Art was the true basis for this book. Dorian himself is a physically beautiful man who collects art, and he enjoys all the splendor of a fashionable existence. Oscar Wilde was a man who also shared interest in these things so it clear that the base for his most successful book is his ideas about art ( as show in the preface) the relation ship between artist observer and art. The characters in this book are playing the parts of his opinions of art wonderfully and in doing so reveal to the reader their inner most thoughts and feelings.Dorian and his painting that he holds so dear each have a different place in Oscar Wilde's ideals as the art and the artist .One of Oscar Wilde's statements about art is \\"The artist is the creator of beautiful things. To reveal art and conceal the artist is the artist's aim\\". (3). Dorian's outside appearance that he \\"reveals\\" becomes an illusion, a sort of mask, which hides or \\"conceals\\" his inner unhappiness and inability to live. Dorian's outer persona becomes his \\"art\\", the elegant illusion that he offers to the world, while his inner feelings are the \\"artist\\". Dorian's \\"artist\\" is his soul, but in fact while he is revealing this beautiful surface to the world and enchanting everyone he is concealing his true self. He separates himself from the aging and corrupted painting. Putting on this act is to \\"conceal the artist\\" which is the artist's aim. For Dorian Gray, hiding away all signs of aging and keeping up a surface youth, beauty, and innocence is creating himself as a work of art. This point is further illustrated in the text when after basil's visit to him he nearly goes mad about protecting his painting or his soul \\"when his servant entered, he looked at him steadfastly, and wondered if he had thought of peering behind the screen.... yet he thought it best to be on his guard...his eye fell on a large purple satin coverlet heavily embroidered with gold, a splendid piece of late seventeenth-century Venetian work ...Yes, that would serve to wrap the dreadful thing...Now, it was to hide something that had a corruption of it's own, worse than the corruption of death itself-something that would breed horrors and yet would never die.\\"(103-4). The most obvious point that this paragraph shows is Dorian's need to \\"conceal\\" his soul or himself. The Venetian coverlet symbolizes Dorian's \\"art\\" or need for splendor and beautiful things to conceal his true identy. Dorian's need to conceal himself is shown with literal symbolization he is taking his art or Venetian coverlet and putting it over his \\"painting\\" to hide his soul. As the paragraph goes on he describes the painting or his \\"soul\\" in a way that shows you his true feelings about his soul he thinks of himself as being corrupt, horrible, and worse than death and naturally wants to separate his art or outter self from his painting or inner self. Oscar Wilde's theory's about art and artist's relationship connects perfectly with Dorian grays feelings about himself.Dorian has no conscience about other people's feelings because he does not expect his own which relates to Oscar Wilde's opinion that an artist has no ethical sympathies. Oscar Wilde says, \\"No artist has ethical sympathies. An ethical sympathy in an artist is an unpardonable mannerism of style\\" (p. 3). Dorian seems to be without human emotions. He remembers his parents only through their outward appearance--- the lips or shape of the face that he has inherited. He does not remember their feelings for him or his attachment to them. It may have been that he was raised without emotional ties. The only time that his family is mentioned, Dorian calls his memories of them hateful (p. 103). In Victorian High society, feelings and emotions were considered less worthy than opinions or ideas. This has caused Dorian to grow up and not understand moral conscience he believes that the only thing that is important is new innovation and ideas, because he was taught to be that way. That is demonstrated when he decides to show Basil his soul:\\"You can tell the whole world about it afterwards, if you choose. Nobody would believe you, if they did believe; they would like me all the better for it. I know the age better than you do\\" (p, 133). He says that his age---the end of the nineteenth century---was more pre-occupied with style than substance, so his youthful glamour---and the fact that the had a secret for escaping ageing---would inspire envy and imitation, not horror. But it is show in the story with basil's reaction to the painting or his \\"soul\\" that people will in fact be horrified by someone who destroys their soul by keeping themselves enterally young and beautiful or renovating their \\"art\\". And by saying \\" I know the age better than you do \\" he is actually proving the opposite and that he doesn't have any ethical sympathies because he so obviously doesn't the nineteenth- century does care about a persons soul. It also relates to the modern day struggle over plastic surgery whether it is a way to keep yourself beautiful or a way to become obsessed with your appearance and destroy your morality you could say that a modern day Dorian Gray is a Michael Jackson someone who is once loved and admired by his public but then after turning to plastic surgery and shopping to better his appearance he becomes a joke and loses his admiration much like Dorian Gray. They both do not relate to the public and have lost their moral conscience do to constantly trying to better their appearance or better their \\"art\\". Dorian Gray doesn't understand other people's ideals because he is not willing to except the fact that he thinks of his internal self as an ugly disgusting thing. Dorian plays into Oscar Wilde's opinions about artists not having ethical sympathies because he does not understand moral conscience of his society. He also shows the reader his inner feelings that he thinks of himself as something awful.Basil and Dorian are like art and observer basil's ideals about Dorian are mirrored on to him. Basil Howard's influence is reflected in this quote from the preface; \\"All art is at once surface and symbol. Those who go beneath the surface do so at their own peril. It is the spectator, and not life, that art really mirrors\\" (p. 3). The spectator in this story is Basil Howard. Basil Howard sees Dorian through his own eyes as a beautiful young man who is full of life and innocence. Basil's soul of truth, love, kindness and caring for others is put into his painting. Dorian's external appearance is appreciated by a spectator (Basil) so it begins to mirror what the spectator sees, and other people also come to see Dorian as a prince of art. Like when an observer looks at art they interpretative it in their own way. This is shown when basil comes to talk to Dorian about the way he is perceived to society \\"I want you to lead such a life as will make the world respect you. I want you to get rid of the hateful people you associate with...you have wonderful influence, let it be for good and not evil\\" (p, 132). This shows basils admiration for Dorian and the way that he thinks of Dorian that it mirrored in the way that he will see him. He is in fact saying that he wants to lead a life where the world respects him and that he has wonderful influence because all he knows about Dorian Gray is what he knows about himself. In the page before basil talks about Dorian's face and the way that he looks means that must not be a bad person but that is only a surface opinion, like that you have of art, once you learn something about the artist, you interpret in another way. Basil doesn't know Dorian's \\"artist\\" or soul he doesn't see him he only sees himself, so basils beautiful heart and soul are projected onto Dorian's appearance. Again Oscar Wilde's ideals of the relationship between the artist and the spectator are interpreted on to his characters Dorian is just a mirror of basil, Just as art is just a mirror of the spectator. It also shows that basil wants to respected by the world, and have wonderful influence.A person could spend days and pages and pages explaining why Oscar Wilde's ideas of art reflect on the characters of The Picture of Dorian Gray and what it reveals about the characters true feelings. Here are the most important Dorian Gray and his painting reflect on the his ideas of the artist and the art, Dorian Gray and his ideas of artists not having ethical sympathies, and that Dorian and Basils relationship is the same as the art and the artists relationship. And a person could also go into the fact that according to Oscar Wilde's ideals about art the critic is he who can translate into another manner and I hope that was done in this essay.please anyone don't steal thi sessay as your own, because believe it or not if your teacher is smart and will type in the first sentance of this essay in google and this will come right up and you will be expelled.thank you for reading"},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"Who knows? But right-wing orthodox Catholic monarchist readers will be required to steel themselves through the first two chapters which consist of a drawn-out slap fight between Elton John, Graham Norton and Ian McKellan. Now I like a cat-fight as much as the next guy, but a tussle among effete Brit cats with man parts is just icky. So the narcissistic homo-erotic banter opening the book was significantly under-appreciated by this reader. But after you get through those chapters the book gets much, much better.It is difficult to maintain that the book represents a defense of amoral Aestheticism, since the embodiment of the aesthetic ideal, Dorian Gray, is shown to be a damned man. That is not to say that Wilde embraces Catholicism in the novel, as the narrator often posits confusing opinions on issues of conscience and sin. At times Wilde seems to suggest that only immoderate (quantitatively speaking) behavior is immoral; and yet, at other times, it appears some actions themselves ought to be avoided. Is Wilde acknowledging that there are exceptionless moral norms? And what is the reader to make of rotten Wotton, whose epigrammatic phrases seem so akin to Wilde's? Hallward points out that Wotton's cynicism is a pose. He never says a moral thing, but he never does a wrong thing. So are we to take his Wilde-isms seriously? Are we to take Wilde seriously? Wilde says art is neither moral nor immoral, yet Gray is poisoned by A Rebors, a book by another decadent author who, oddly enough, also converted to Catholicism. And then there's the picture itself, the fruit of Hallward's homosexual obsession, which is clearly cursed, in spite of its initial apparent beauty.Wilde's protests notwithstanding, it is a book with a moral informing the reader that he cannot escape his conscience, that he cannot reject nature and nature's God, and that the wages of sin are death. But therein lies hope, for if God is to be believed regarding the wages of sin, then why should we doubt Him regarding our Redemption? Unfortunately, this message is made ambiguous by an author who, rather than unintentionally creating a distorted image of an idea that cannot be fully represented, intentionally peppers the novel with paradox for the sake of cuteness. But the Truth is not cute. He's terrifying, and Wilde knows better. Therefore the book is best left to the orthodox or the decadent. The lukewarm will simply be confused."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"For me, The Picture of Dorian Gray was a tedious read. I did not particularly enjoy it that much, although I acknowledge that it is a good piece of literature. It is very well written and full of details and vivid descriptions. The story is told artfully and exquisitely but I found it long-winded and difficult to get through at times. Many people would enjoy a book like this, but it was not for me. I couldn't relate to the British aristocracy system and was utterly appalled at how unbelievably shallow the characters were, although Wilde was probably going for that effect. I was also disappointed with the ending. I thought the point of the novel would be to eliminate the stereotype that bad people are ugly, but it just perpetuated it. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes a book that makes them think. It is also recommended to people who like books from this era (late 1800's) and have a lot of time on their hands."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"Very wordy.

During his portraiture, Gray meets Lord Henry Wotton, who preaches self-indulgence and the high social value, yet lamentable ephemerality, of youth. Influenced by Lord Henry, Gray becomes cold-hearted and self-centered. Gray soon discovers that his descent into moral dissolution is being represented by changes in his portrait. Over the years, Gray seems never to age, while his image in the portrait ages in his place and also continues to show the ongoing moral dissolution within Gray's character. In the end, he cannot bear to be what he has become.Comment: This novel struck me as glib.

I didn't notice when I ordered it that it's not the size of a regular book--it's more the size of an academic journal or magazine. Nearly 8 X 10 inches. Further, there's no named editor, no introduction, no apparatus at all. Just the text of the story--and that is printed in two columns on the page. The result is a book that won't fit on the shelf and that is unpleasant to read. Baffling."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"The book \\"Picture of Dorian Grey\\" by Oscar Wilde that I ordered \\"used\\" arrived with the front cover defaced by a pen being used to totally cover the picture's face and hands and then a sticker of a Freddy Crueger (sp) type mask placed over the face.

What makes me say that? Could it be that the sins are too vague or too outdated? No, I judged this book based on my enjoyment or lack of enjoyment in reading it.

In the end all I can say to truly show how I feel about this novel is that this book BORED me. 177 pages of art that is 'quite useless'. The only reason I finished was because I hate to start a book then walk away and also I wanted to do review (and to do a review without finishing the book is unfair)."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"I read this book some time ago for a book club, and we all thought it was a total snooze.

I feel that Oscar Wilde used this as a semi-autobiographical vehicle to transport his radical, eccentric ideas and ideals. He speaks through his characters of Lord Henry and Dorian Gray. They seek to justify debauchery and murder and they kill off anyone who is good, kind, moral or differs in opinion with them. A good read, perhaps, for the likes of the 42nd president of the USA.

I'm not really sure what I expected from this book, but I know I didn't get it. This book shows the true demoralization of our society- past and present. The absloute worst part of the book (about 90% of it) was the long, monotonous, verbose speeches that consisted of the characters'ideals that were just &quot;off the mark&quot; by a little. I would not suggest reading this book, partly because of the boring content, but mostly because of the fact that I still haven't found a plot."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"The novel The Picture of Dorian Grey is an unoriginal story line with disturbing morals in which innocent people are corrupted. Written in the late 18th century by Oscar Wilde the novel is an example of homosexual fiction. While the sexual preference of the characters is never addressed it is often hinted at. Many of the morals presented in the novel are very disturbing. Harry presents his views in such a way as to make them seem right. He \\"preaches\\" on living a life for pleasure, and the sensations. He stresses that women are merely brainless playthings there to provide entertainment. His theory on remaining young is to repeat all your youthful sins. This is presenting a lifestyle of self-indulgence, in which material things bring happiness. Harry's corruption of Dorian leads to the corruption of many others. As Dorian begins to live as Harry has suggested he begins to use his influence over people to his advantage. He drives Sibyl Vane to her death, and also her brother who tries to seek revenge. Many close friends become outcasts because of his escalating bad reputation. In this story of twisted corruption, Basil Hallward is a very likely target for destruction. Had is not been for his adoration of Dorian then Harry never would have become interested in him. It becomes obvious that in order to be rid of all the mishaps Dorian must be rid of the originator. Basils death is almost obvious from the start. The main storyline, man sells soul for youth, is one used many times by several authors. It is based on a 15th century German magician Johann Faust. In his time he was considered a fake and a criminal. In the original Faustbook (1587), written by an unknown author, is a biography of Johann Faust in which he sells his soul to the devil Mephistopheles for 24 years in return for power, knowledge, and youth and finally goes to hell in terror. It is ironic that this is also approximately the same amount of time it takes Dorian to become fully corrupted and destroy the painting. All in all the book was a waste of time. With its disturbing morals and unoriginal storyline the book left something to be desired. It was often predictable and uneventful. This is not a book that I would recommend to other people."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"Please refer to page 212 of the Baronet Books version of The Picture of Dorian Gray.

A letter is presented to Alan and the reader has no idea what this is about. I am going to try to find another version of this classic. This book was terrible."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"The quickest way to sum up this book in one word is \\"wow.\\" I will admit that for awhile I didn't find the book 5-star worthy, but I soon found myself thoroughly engrossed. Wilde has written this story like a symphony in four movements with an overture, ballad, climax, and finale. The prose is absolutely lyrical.Beauty is a dominant theme. Wilde excessively alludes to Greek Gods and the perfection of Adonis. The concept of beauty is also represented in the idea of man vs. himself, or better yet as beauty vs. immortality. Dorian wrestles constantly with his inner self and with the immortality his beauty presents to him. But with his beauty comes sins and pleasure that have no effect on him because their consequences marr his self portrait. Dorian uses his beauty to sin which ultimately leads to violence; his emotions often confuse his sins with pleasure.A secondary theme is the absence of reality. In the Importance of Being Earnest, Wilde echoes a similar line as that from Dorian. He writes that the two most attractive types of people are those who know nothing at all or absolutely everything. Three key characters represent varying degrees of reality, as well as Wilde's description of attractive people. Dorian knows nothing and Lord Henry knows absolutely everything, but Basil is the medium ground between the two that represents reality. Basil is the only one who sees/acknowledges things for what they truly are, but he is shunned by others who don't want to see reality. Characters like Dorian and Lord Henry have the idea that to see reality is to be scared of life. It is bad to be a spectator to one's own life. Dorian even admits that \\"He felt that the secret of the whole thing was not to realise the situation.\\" If he didn't acknowledge it, it simply did not exist.Lastly is the theme of homosexuality. Wilde does not mention any specifics of homosexual relationships, but what one has to read between the lines jumps off the page with equal magnitude of the written text.All in all, this book is excellent. Read this book, you will be glad you did!"},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"The novel \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" by Oscar Wilde is yet another triumph for this talented author. The dark tale of a young man who unknowingly sells his soul in order to stay forever young is wittily brought across through three main characters, each resembling a different part of Wilde himself.Dorian, the main character, represents what Wilde himself said he would like to be, yet Dorian also clearly resembles part of Wilde: the part that was once young and innocent before becoming corrupted by the world he lived in.Henry Wooton, the man responsible for the corruption of Dorian Gray, is the side of Oscar Wilde that the world thought was the true Wilde: carefree and conceited, caring nothing for other people, yet extremely witty. This is also Wilde, as far as the witty and carefree parts go. Only when Henry displays his rare moments of care for other people does this character seem like Wilde.Basil, the man who paints the infamous picture of Dorian, is the character who Wilde found himself to be the most like. Quiet and withdrawn, Basil is a caring man with a good consience who completely adores Dorian. Out of the entire novel, Basil is one of the few truly good people.This novel does, however, have it's shortcomings. Lord Henry Wooton's wife is introduced in a scene and given an extremely interesting description. She is a nervous woman who laughs often and also displays the wit that Wilde was so famous for. This description, however, makes one think that she will be extremely important later, when in truth, she never shows up again (though she is mentioned once by Henry). There is also a chapter that delves a little too deeply into the obsessions that Dorian went through, going into long run-on sentances and too-long descriptions.Overall, this is an extremely well-written novel that portrays what is wrong with society today through the views of the characters and the actions they take. Though it may not be the easiest read for today's society (many of whom are as corrupt as the characters in the book), it is one well worth reading, if only for a new outlook on life."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"\\"It is the spectator, and not life, that art really mirrors\\" - Oscar Wilde\\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is an excellent novel about the degradation of the human soul. The novel focuses around the handsome Dorian Gray and his interactions with the artist Basil Hallward, who paints his portrait and Lord Henry, who becomes the corrupting influence on Dorian's soul and Dorian's iinteractions with the British aristocracy. Dorian is compared to Narcissus, who was so obsessed with his own beauty, that it swallowed him whole. Dorian seals his fate with one wish; upon viewing his portrait, he wonders if it would be possible for his portrait to show the signs of aging, in exchange for his mortal beauty. Throughout the novel, we see Dorian's decent into total self - absorbtion and evil all of which culminates in an ending that is predictable but still entertaining none the less.Just a quick side note, there is some great social commentary running throughout \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray,\\" specifically Wilde's commentary on the stiff, British aristocracy of the late 19th century, absurd views regarding women, who are painted by Gray as blubbering idiots (a sign of the times) and last but not least, the underlying homosexual undertones present between Dorian, Basil and Lord Henry are fascinating to deconstruct.\\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" was my first introduction to Oscar Wilde and after reading the novel, I was hooked. I would like to return to the quote above, about art mirroring the soul of the spectator, after reading this novel, you will have a sense of how trully frightening that notion is."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"C.S. Lewis wrote that pride is the greatest sin. It is the doorway to all other kinds of evil. Though this was certainly not what Oscar Wilde was writing about, The Picture of Dorian Gray is a perfect illustration of this. The protagonist's pride causes him to go to horrible lengths. In the end it causes everyone around him (and eventually himself) great pain. I have read Wilde's works only a couple of times since being introduced to them in high school. Each time I do, I remember how much I like him as an author. This time, I was once again reminded how masterful Wilde was as a writer. His keen wit and incisive humor is refreshing. His prose is clean and unlabored. I don't know why I haven't read his stuff more often. I certainly will now."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"This story is positively a masterpiece. Dorian Gray is a young boy at first, whose beauty is so entirely dazzling that Mr. Basil Hallward, an artist, becomes utterly obsessed with the portrait he is painting of Dorian. Feeling certain he has not only achieved his best artistic work yet, he confesses shamefully that he has put so much of himself into the portrait that were it ever displayed publicly, the world would glimpse his soul. In short, Basil is in love with the image of Dorian Gray. Lord Henry Wotten befriends Dorian, much to the chagrin of Basil, who feels a near homosexual jealousy. When Basil presents the finished portrait to Dorian, Dorian makes a whimsical wish \\" If it were only the other way! If it were I who was to be always young, and the picture that was to grow old! For that - for that - I would give everything!\\"From that moment on, Dorian's life changes. Lord Henry becomes his mentor of sorts, and a finer fictional character I have yet to meet. Indeed, Lord Henry has a profound influence on young Dorian, and his philosophies will hypnotize you, as they often do Dorian Gray. The portrait takes on sinister and looming proportions, and eventually Dorian must face the consequences of that one whimsical wish, and fight the ultimate battle - for his own soul. An amazingly fabulous book you absolutely MUST read."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"When Wilde landed in America in 1882 for a lecture tour, he was asked if he had anything to declare. He responded, &quot;Only my genius.&quot; Okay now, an attitude like that didn't exactly make me want to read any of his works for a long time. Finally, I decided to try The Picture of Dorian Grey, and I found that it really was a work of genius.The novel is the story of Dorian Grey who at the beginning of the novel has his portrait painted by Basil Hallward. The picture turns out to be remarkable, and Grey becomes jealous because the picture will remain young and beautiful while he will age. He expresses a wish that the picture would age instead of himself. To his delight, his wish becomes true, and believing himself to be immortal, he embarks on a path of of hedonism. He always searches for pleasure above happiness, and above all things he loves beauty. Along the way, the portrait chronicles the total moral decay of Dorian Grey.The are a lot of interpretations to this novel. My favorite is to read it as a moral tale warning of the consequences of leading a life of hedonism. It could almost be read as &quot;The Picture of Oscar Wilde&quot; as he seems to be criticizing his own lifestyle. This is probably also the most ironic reading of it since Wilde continued after the novel to preach aestheticism. But anyway, taken within itself, the novel is marvelous. The prose is well-polished. The pacing is elegant and the plot is always interesting. The points is makes are important. The Picture of Dorian Grey deserves its classic status, and Oscar Wilde actually was a bit of a genius."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"I'd heard a lot about Wilde when I started this book, but this was the first of his works that I'd ever read.

When Dorian realizes he too must face mortality and it's grip on his beauty he makes a wish to never lose his youth and beauty, to instead let his painting age for him. This the painting does... from the curve of his lips to the look in his eyes. Dorian uses this completely to his advantage and commits selfish and horrible acts all the while hidden under a charming smile and innocent face.

It is a beautifully written book and is as much a work of art as an elegantly painted portrait.Centered around the vain and young Dorian Gray, it tells the price one pays for eternal youth and gives a new dimension to the human soul. As Dorian succumbs to the tempting dark underworld of London, and he lives by night in wicked ways, the beautiful portrait painted of him becomes like a journal of his soul, becoming ever more twisted and deformed. It begins to haunt Dorian continuously, day and night, consuming his every thought. Then a shadow from his young past creeps back into his life and makes Dorian's life even more frighteningOscar Wilde's novel is a magnificent read and explores the issue and thoughts surrounding man's soul.

The novel follows the life of a narcissistic youth, Dorian Gray, who makes a Faustian pact with the devil to keep his youth. Dorian grows to love immorality and the darker joys of life. However, the evils of his life do not manifest within him but in his portrait.Published in 1890, The Picture of Dorian Gray is still a popular choice of literature for society today, being praised as one of Wilde's greatest works. The appeals of The Picture of Dorian Gray to a modern day society are the plot, characters and Wilde's firm command of language. The novel deals with themes that are common in society, drugs, violence, immorality, social decadence and human corruption.At times, Wilde's writing appears shallow and wooden, lacking any action. However, what is lost in action is gained in dialogue, which is exquisite and strongly reflects Wilde's own nature. The novel is riddled with finely wrought epigrams and witticisms that display the true skill and genius of Wilde as both an author and an orator."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"What is more important, physical beauty or a beautiful heart?

Throughout the book, Dorian Gray becomes very popular and attracts all sorts of attention just by waltzing into a room. People find him so innocent and pure, he's alluring (which soons turns sour.) But they don't see his other life. His loathing of the once-beautiful portrait which now displays his age, sins and iniquities. This deep hatred drives him to do many strange things in this dark, twisting tale of morale, age and youth. The book follows Dorian through love, loss, murder, disdain, hurt and ofcourse, happiness. Because it covers most every subject, its a wonderful classic, and a must-read.Though because its written in England in the 19th century, some of the vocabulary is bewildering.

He proceeds to live his life by indulging himself in episodes of increasing debauchery and immorality, wrecking other people's lives and committing blackmail and even murder, and all the while his portrait bears the physical signs of his aging while his own body remains young and fresh. The novel offers some weighty questions: Would we choose to be immoral if we knew we were immortal? Is an artist's work the manifestation of his own latent immorality? Are the world's imperfections, sins, and shames represented better through art than through reality?As much as I admire Oscar Wilde's great play &quot;The Importance of Being Ernest,&quot; I must admit that I found some faults with this short novel of his. Despite its florid prose and dialogue containing wickedly caustic wit and punchy aphorisms that evoke a time when conversation was an art, the novel has a strangely artificial, stiff tone. With dialogue that sounds like it would have to be rehearsed before spoken and many scene descriptions that seem like stage directions, it often reads like a play that's been converted into a novel. Interior furnishings are described in the meticulous detail of a Sotheby's catalog; a nice touch, but what's the point?

In certain parts of the book he starts to show a nervous side of himself. He does this because he is witnessing that a certain picture of someone is changing before his very eyes. Whose picture you're asking, what do think that I'm going to tell you! Stop asking, and read the book already. Anyway, the setting of this book is taking place around the Victorian Times in England. In England there is an art studio in which Basil Hallward, the artist that paints a certain picture, works and spends most of his time. The problem in the story all started when Dorian spoke a &quot;request.&quot; He &quot;requested&quot; that, &quot;Why can't this picture age instead of myself?&quot; Dorian will be scared of what happens after the next few months. One person enjoyed reading the book, and thought that it was great reading. This person loved how the author used vivid details in all his characters, especially Dorian Gray. They also saw the movie starring George Sanders and Hurd Hatfield, which they thought was also very good !"},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"What a delightful book! Many of us our familiar with the basic Dorian Gray fable - a man yearns for immortality and gets it. In Wilde's take, Dorian Gray, a young handsome teenager wishes the deprecating effects of age to strike his portrait and not his flesh. He gets his wish and at the goading of Lord Henry becomes an absolute hedonist. Always within though there seems to be a remorseful conscience, a longing for purity. But the ease of depravity squashes moral sentiments before they take root. In the end though, the ageless man finally confronts his portrait...After learning of the author, Oscar Wilde, I was surprised that the book came from his pen (thinly veiled homoeroticism nonwithstanding). I interpreted the book as a cautionary tale against heedlessness and indulgence - basically against the materialist character of Lord Henry. It is a moral tale that explores themes of beauty and its subsidary: age. One cannot help but see one's own portrait in the depiction of young Dorian Gray.I found the writing of the book to be fantastic. Great dialogue and monologues with the British witticisms that you would expect."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"So you want to remain eternally young? This book will tell you an engrossing moralistic tale that paints the picture of where the deadly sin of vanity can take you. It will take you into a descent into a hell full of shadows where the light will never touch you.This is a classic dark tale of intrigue. It is filled with the depths to which the human condition can sink. It is a page turner, but it may leave you feeling empty at the end. That is what it did for me. Nevertheless, it is a haunting book that is well worth reading. Oscar Wilde will speak from his grave throughout the centuries through this book.As the author of a spiritually-themed book entitled \\"The Misadventures of Sister Mary Olga Fortitude,\\" I appreciated this book for the most unusual reasons. I am a former addict who knows what it is like to experience hell within life. The hopeful note within this book is that it will wake the reader up to taking responsibility for his or her own life. That is what I have had to do with my own. Thank God for books that can wake us up to that reality so that we do not have to sink into the abyss of nothingness.Davis Aujourd'hui, author of \\"The Misadventures of Sister Mary Olga Fortitude\\""},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"Famed for his biting wit and a master of epigrams, Oliver Wilde fails to disappoint in the only novel he has ever published. The Picture of Dorian Gray is both shocking and profound, delving into the daunting choices one man makes after obtaining, through a careless wish, perpetual youth.Dorian Gray begins the book as an innocent, wholly untainted Adonis. He is introduced to the decadent Lord Henry Wotton through his friend Basil Hallward, a renowned painter. After the influence of Lord Henry, Dorian, upon seeing his alluring, youthful self captured in Basil's portrait of him, rashly wishes that he might remain young and beautiful like the portrait while it grew old and ugly. The discovery that his wish was made a reality leads Dorian down a sordid path. He coldly scorns his love, Sibyl Vane, when she loses her acting ability for love of him, resulting in her suicide. After this mar of blood on his conscience, Dorian chooses to lead a life of hedonism, ignoring the pleadings of his old friend Basil. Blaming Basil for his tainted conscience and corrupt way of life, Dorian murders Basil and eventually, stabs his portrait in rage, killing himself. He reverts to his true self, utterly grotesque and unrecognizable.Although the plot alone is enticing, Wilde's incredible skill with language is really the highlight of the book. Many astonishing events occur in the story of Dorian's descent into decadence, but Wilde's consistent, calm narration does not mask the scenes' madness but rather enhances it, making Dorian's evil actions all the more eerie. Tempting in its morbidity, the book drags along its readers as a horror movie would its audience. Through his mastery of syntax, Wilde is often able to convey exactly Dorian's emotion and state of mind. Varying between short, choppy sentences and long, languid descriptions, Wilde skillfully manipulates syntax to reflect upon the state of the characters. Imagery runs rampant throughout the novel. Whole passages devoted to the description of the gardens and the like drug the reader with sensual images, pulling them into the scene itself.The characters are also developed to an amazing extent, especially Lord Henry, the most intriguing in the book. Despite being a bad influence on Dorian, Lord Henry is actually a main contributor to the profundity of this novel. Although he is seen as a decadent, and often times, the intellectual lightweight of the story, Henry is also very philosophical. The man seems to have a philosophy of everything, smothering in his constant philosophical didactics. However, sayings like \\"Ordinary people waited till life disclosed to them its secrets, but to the few, to the elect, the mysteries of life were revealed before the veil was torn away\\" are very thought-provoking. It seems that Henry is Wilde's spokesperson through whom the author questions society's way of life and any alternatives. Lord Henry's thoughts, thus, not only influences Dorian but also has a tremendous effect on Wilde's readers.However, this amazing novel is not without flaws. Basil is intended to be the most moralistic of the trio, an opposition to Lord Henry's negative influence on Dorian. Although Basil's weakness can be interpreted as Wilde's criticism of Victorian society and its own weakening morals, his reluctance to fully acknowledge Dorian's stray from the noble path and thus, his inability to save his friend is infuriating and almost annoying.Overall, The Picture of Dorian Gray is a great read. Its morals are fairly simplistic while its messages are wholly complicated. The masterful use of language in the novel establishes once more the reason for Oscar Wilde's popularity. Provoking and profound, The Picture of Dorian Gray definitely merits a second read."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"It has been said that this book is one of Oscar Wilde's classics and I do say it is. The story revolves around one man and his desire to be young. Although it was originally published in the 1800's, the themes and ideas within the book you can adapt to today's time. I have underlined many quotations that I found very interesting and if thought about make sense.Now, for those who know or don't, it has been made a movie before and it has been revived this time around as a movie set to release this year with the lead character played by Ben Barnes (The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian). Ben Barnes was known for Prince Caspian and this is his next movie to release. Also starring, Colin Firth.I would certainly read this book first before seeing the movie and for a price like this, you cannot take advantage of reading a great literary classic."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"The experience of reading Oscar Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray is tantamount to engaging in a philosophical debate with a person suffering from Obsessive Compulsive Disorder--and they're winning. The exquisite attention to detail paired with a sharp analytical wit delivers an indomitable argument. One cannot help but succumb to temptations along with the charismatic Dorian and echo his cries of despair when the effects of sin become prominently displayed, marring the handsome features.Wilde creates a subtle trap, luring the reader with Dorian's innocence and naivet&eacute;. The snare gently tightens as the pure boy slides deeper into depravity and becomes corrupted by pleasure. So slowly is the reader introduced to the poison, by the time realization hits there is no hope of escape. They are as thoroughly embroiled in the life of hedonism and aestheticism as the protagonist. Dorian becomes subsequently more callous with every act of debauchery he commits and the impact of his actions is reduced by the sheer number of skeletons in his closet. Rather than becoming appalled as his wickedness grows, the reader is simple hardened for what is to come. When Dorian finally carries out the act of treachery that tilts the scale, no one is surprised.The pictures painted by Wilde's careful words are elaborate to the point of being mind-numbing. Explicit descriptions of Dorian's hobbies fill pages while serving no apparent purpose. Closer examination determines the usefulness of aforementioned descriptions in drawing the reader closer to the child-like curiosity of Dorian, perhaps justifying his eventual corruption. Unfortunately this knowledge is not enough to banish the tedium and some passages must simply be suffered through.Oscar Wilde has created a thought provoking masterpiece. An excellent read for those who have ever question the morality of society of have peered out across seas of corruption and vowed to stay away. Not for the faint of hear or easily distracted, hose who choose to take the plunge will find themselves pleasantly rewarded."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"a classic literary staple of the modern world! a must read for any intellectual. every sentence is brimming with stimulating ideas and paradoxes."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"Basil Hallward is an artist, who paints a portrait of Dorian Gray, a very good looking and nave young man. The portrait is a masterpiece that in reality depicts Basil's feelings for Dorian, as well as, Dorian's youth and beauty.Lord Henry Wotton, a seductive emotional predator and selfish pleasure seeker, is a friend of Basil who meets Dorian at Basil's house and gives him a philosophical speech about the fading nature of youth and beauty. Dorian whose greatest qualities are his youth and beauty pledges his soul to stay young and beautiful. As part of the deal Dorian Gray's portrait becomes the surrogate for the disgrace and aging of the real Dorian Gray.Under the growing influence of Lord Henry over Dorian, the later embraces Hedonism and increasingly sinks into a sinful corrupt life and shows no regard for values or morals. A tragic event caused by Dorian's behaviors starts the projection of Dorian's ugliness and self -centeredness on the portrait. Dorian creates excuses and excuses himself with lame explanations for the tragedy and hides his portrait so he can't see the hideous transformation of himself reflected in his picture. As long as his beauty remains, he can ignore the changes in his portrait. It's interesting how Dorian tries to avoid his inner feeling of ugliness by trying to surround him self by beauty, and other beautiful distractions such as roses and music.Basil's love for Dorian, which is likely a real life reflection of Wilde's love for Lord Alfred Douglas, causes Basil to defend and protect Dorian, even from his self destructive acts, until the last shocking event. I'm tempted to describe the ending event, but I won't deprive the reader from the pleasure of exploration and discovery.Given the period when this novel was written, Wilde is artistically candid and courageous beyond belief. Wilde displays his usual wit, sarcastic playful ways and funny style, while he walks us through serious dilemmas like the supremacy of youth and beauty, homosexual feelings, repentance and murder. Wilde grabs the reader through the use of shocking events that not only criticize Victorian morality, but ironically displays a moral lesson about vanity and narcissism.\\"The picture of Dorian Gray\\" is a wonderful piece of literature in which the portrait asserts itself as Dorian's conscience in a superficial society that places values on looks and wealth while ignoring the real value of humans. Simply, a one of a kind work."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"If you want a new slant on this classic novel, read 'The Ripper Code' by Thomas Toughill.

Today, we have taken for granted this incongruity and so our writers cannot express the kind of irony that Wilde mastered, despite the fact that we all know that something is amiss.\`The Picture of Dorian Gray' is filled with this irony. The plot shows us the ultimate irony of a man giving up his soul for the beauty of youth--the condition that is exalted in the modern age above all else, intellect, truth, justice, life itself. Interspersed are dialogues and epigrams that persist one hundred years later as some of the finest word handling ever recorded. Even a few samples should compel the potential reader:\\"The only thing worse than being talked about is not being talked about.\\"\\"Every portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist, not of the sitter.\\"\\"A man cannot be too careful in his choice for his enemies.\\"\\"The only difference between a caprice and a life-long passion is that the caprice lasts a little bit longer.\\"\\"Men marry because they are tired, women marry because they are curious.

He was a decadent as much as the characters he portrays are. Ultimately, the disillusion that the decadent faces comes through in the story and the reader is left with a very uneasy feeling upon completing \`Dorian Gray.' Is life as absurd as it seems?

Wilde seems far more interested in catologing lists of inane objects and people than he is of entertaining or interesting the reader. Wilde only glosses over Gray's sinful actions letting us know sparse details about his supposed debauchery but never exposing the reader to them...So a woman kills herself over being jilted, so he uses opium, so he goes to prostitutes, so he is bisexual...Who cares??

I found myself constantly amazed that someone from Wilde's time could have had such clarity of thought on certain topics. I've never seen the movie made from this but I saw some movie posters. So it was hard taking the horror look and putting that in this book. It is more of a twisted coming of age story and not even one that gets too deep.

I thought maybe the unedited version would actually have a sex scene in it lol but they don't even mention a naughty body part lol. Nothing ever gets remotely sexual. I mean several characters are definitely gay but not in a shocking way. More like Jack McFarlan on Will and Grace.

When I watched that movie I had no idea who the character of Dorian Gray was. The movie wasn't that good, but I was still interested in that character. When I saw The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde, I decided I wanted to learn more about that character.This book was not easy to read at all. It wasn't because of the language that it was written in, which did add to its difficulty. The part that bothered me the most about this book, other than its length, was the horrible lack of flow. I got the main idea of the book, I understood most of why certain parts of the book were there, but there were so many parts that did not add to the plot that for many pages at a time you would read about things like a jewel collection, book collection or whatever else fancied Dorian Gray at the time. It was so hard to finish this book because there were so many times that I couldn't grasp why I was reading what I was reading. There were so many times that Dorian or his friend Harry would go into these monologues for absolutely no reason at all.There were a few redeeming qualities to this book, but unfortunately they did nothing to help me enjoy it at all. The one thing I did like was the basic premise of the book. Dorian Gray could not age and he was beautiful so he could do whatever he wanted to. His lack of need to preserve his soul led him down the path of evil. His friend guided him down that path as well. The whole time I was reading this book I was thinking about Harry as the devil. He would plant thoughts into the brain of Dorian that led him further and further down his path of destruction.The book was a let down and I hope that the next classic fiction book I choose is a good one.If you like my review and want to read more of them I have a blog chronicaling my first year with my Kindle.

The subjects in this moral fable are very dramatic but go exceedingly too far. Tragedy stalks every crack and turn of it. It ends in a tragedy. In the beginning, it is rather happy, but right after the actress and lover commits suicide it goes completely. I do not doubt Wilde's famed wit but, he could have written something more happy than this depressing novel. The descriptions are very well done(especially in the beginning.) Thus, he should used his wit and humor for a more enjoyable and felicatous novel."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"While trying to start some kind of an aesthetic as well as a moral revolution, The Picture of Dorian Gray instead became a disappointment in the world of literature. I began reading this book upon the premise that it would contain fascinating worldviews, as well as a gripping plot. Rather, the book fell flat on its face. Wilde reflected his views of the importance of art, the pitfalls of beauty, and the horror of aging in this novel, and though it wasn't the views that were a problem, it was how they all contradicted one another. The author claimed, \\"all art is useless\\" in the preface of the novel, yet eventually it is art itself that becomes the bane of Dorian Gray's existence.The novel follows a young, beautiful young man, Dorian Gray, along with two of his friends, Basil, who paints a stunning picture of Dorian, and Harry, who leads Dorian into a world of lies, sin and betrayal. Though it starts off interestingly enough, the novel drags after the 50th page, and it only gets worse and worse until the very end. It is meant to shock its readers, with tales of murder and drugs, yet the writing isn't sophisticated enough to support these statements. The downward spiral of Dorian Gray's life is deserved, and the novel fails to leave the reader with a strong residual message. To its credit, however, the original premise was interesting, and the decay of Dorian Gray's existence and how he views himself makes for a decent plot.I will not bother to go into the details of the novel, for example the sexism and the portrayal of women in the book, and how it is questionable whether the characters are more in love with women, the idea of women, each other (yes, they are all male), or themselves. The homosexuality in the novel did not bother me, though the inaccurate portrayal of women did.If you are interested in reading about art, corruption or murder in the late 19th century in England, please, spare yourself the torture of reading Dorian Gray, though it is only a little over 200 pages."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"this book was really really twisted, our sophmore class had to read it for school, and almost everyone hated it"},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"Will someone please tell me why this \\"uplifting classics\\" edition uses an image of Thomas Jefferson on the \\"cover\\"?

He should not have to lower himself and preach to the reader."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"The most disappointing part of this book is that it read more like a non-fiction philosophy book than a story or novel. I would say 70% of the pages were portrayed as thoughts of a character or a speech of a character contemplating life, women, how we are suppose to live, etc.The actual story was hidden throughout the book, but you have to drone on through many pages to find it. The story itself is highly predictable and yet still has many missing parts to it. Many years of Dorian Gray's life is missing where it is hinted to that he commit's the most awful sins. I think reading of those sinful actions was to be more entertaining than the rabbit trails that Wilde goes on.Despite these facts, I am glad that I read the book once. It held my attention enough and was brilliant enough that I did learn something from the book, which is a great accomplishment in itself, to teach a reader a few principals that may slightly help or change on any small level, the readers actions. So I do recommend this book if you have no more pressing serious books on your reading list.On a side note, I do disagree with all the reviews I have seen on this book where the reader says that they can not relate to Dorian Gray's sins and that his sins are outdated. His chief sins in the book are (SMALL SPOILER ALERT) murder, drug use, pride, treating others harshly and without respect, using women in many ways, etc. are all sins practiced today even if they are not practiced exactly the way they are in the book. If you can relate to none of those sins in any way, then you are a better person than I, or suffer from foolish pride which is the chief sin in the book."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"I'm being made to read this book for the third time (once in high school, twice in college), but I've always rather detested it. I've been told I need to \\"appreciate\\" it, and to that effect I've been reading a number of reviews (both positive and negative) of this book, trying to get a grip on *why* it's so highly regarded. The basic story is this: Dorian (a pretty twentysomething without much personality) makes a tacit (implied, not stated) bargain with a painter: his portrait will grow old and sick while he remains young and beautiful, no matter what he does to himself. And he does *plenty* to himself. 230 pages later, he grows a conscience and tries to destroy the painting, bringing age/sickness on himself and thus dying, unpunished for his \\"sins.\\" The Faust parallels are evident; unfortunately Dorian Gray is no Faust, and lord Henry (his \\"corrupter\\") is no Mephistopheles. The book is told as a series of banal witticisms and jests which sound good the first time you read them but get chewed up and spat out the second they're exposed to intelligent analysis. (Example from the preface: \\"All art is at once surface and symbol. Those who go beneath the surface do so at their peril. Those who read the symbol do so at their peril. It is the spectator, and not life, that art really mirrors. Diversity of opinion about a work of art shows that the work is new, complex and vital. When critics disagree the artist is in accord with himself. We can forgive a man for making a useful thing as long as he does not admire it. The only excuse for making a useless thing is that one admires it intensely. All art is quite useless.\\")Synthesizing all the reviews, I get the sense that people who *really* like it--the \\"witty\\" verbiage, the Faust-lite storyline, and the moral heavy-handedness--like it because it shields them from the knowledge of their own inner emptiness. That sounds harsh; let me explain further. Since everything is stylized, pre-determined, and \\"fake,\\" there's no danger of self-discovery--no danger of discovering anything true. Oscar Wilde was deeply alienated against his own self (most homosexuals living at that time and in that society were), and so is not capable of feeling honestly, or expressing himself with any sincerity. Human nature (in the wider, not baser, sense) is \\"reduced\\"--that's the only word I can think of to describe it. Words are everything; appearances; everything. But words are empty sounds without the meanings attached to them (anyone who knows more than one language knows *that*), and appearances are superficial and deceiving, to trot out that old cliche. Human beings do not exist merely to think up verbal ripostes to personal attacks, and yet, here, this is all they do. Well, that and \\"sin.\\" But what a \\"sin\\" is is never really defined, and Dorian Gray doesn't really \\"sin\\" much (he seduces a girl, dumps her, and there's some implied homosexuality---*yawn*).\\"Dorian\\" is a morality tale, like the story of Jesus. It is something to tell children with no imagination, to warn them of the dangers of societal rejection--the dangers of being \\"different.\\" In a subtle way, it encourages conformity--and it *definitely* encourages repression. It is false to me in so many ways that I can hardly stomach it."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"nicely bound, beautifully embossed, priced especially well considering the binding and compared to other retailers such as Anthropologie; contains a sewn in ribbon bookmark which I love.

When reading about such characters such as Lord Henry for instance, you can only admit that you are being worked by the words and charms of a great novelist. It is sad that this is the only full novel Oscar Wilde ever did.(he did do a fair amount of plays, short stories, and essays however). After reading it, you will find yourself quoting it for a good while. And the plot device used is one of the better one's in all of fiction.

Actually, part of what motivated me was not my parents' persistant pestering (and occasionally threatening), but the fact that Oscar Wilde is the favorite author of the lead singer from my favorite out-of-date band, The Smiths (Morrissey, yes).But anyway, to the book. When I started to read, I was in some kind of rapturous awe of Wilde's writing. It was so utterly beautiful, shaped and molded as finely as the face of the man Wilde so eloquently describes, Mr. Dorian Gray himself. It has the operatic and tragic occurence of an opera, or at least a play, but had The Picture of Dorain Gray been written as a play, it would have shirked the story of the wonderous use of the English language that so holds this novel up.Admittedly, it was a bit thick to wade through at times, but other than that, it's a ripping good ride, and I recommend it to anyone who wants to know more about the evils and attraction of physical beauty."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray was an amazing book that had an incredable thought process.

This wish is granted and the story follows the events that unfold up to Dorian's realization that he has received everything he \\"wanted\\" and is now miserable. Two main acquaintances Basil and Lord Henry abound. Basil in some ways is a God figure in that he represents the good path and encourages Dorian to better himself and be an upright person.

This positive fruition is exemplified quite extraordinarily by Oscar Wilde in \`The Picture of Dorian Gray', as he weaves a tale of youth, corruption and disregarding hedonism.The protagonist of the story is the youthful and worldly-naive Dorian Gray who, through enticement by his mentor, pledges himself to eternal youth. His wish is sanctioned and the ravishes of age are transferred onto a portrait. Knowing that his appearance will remain forever innocent, he embarks on a pursuit of reckless pleasures, spiralling further into iniquity yet remaining unchanged, whilst his picture grows grotesquely disfigured...The novel was--and to an extent, still is--controversial due to the unsubtle suggestions of homoeroticism. Personally, I don't see the fuss. Partially for obvious reasons, but I also remain unconvinced that it is presented in such a way to have ever been an encouragement for others to embrace such a 'lifestyle'. Rather, it would appear that Dorian's sexual exploits with the same gender is a method to achieving his goal of ecstatic delectation; the goal which, in the end, is his destruction. But, of course, considering Wilde's own sexual practices, one could read it as a defence of those with same-sex attractions.Ultimately, I understood this novel to be a warning against unchecked desire and the pursuit of pleasure without limits; certainly an apt lesson for our own age."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"This book was truly one of the jewels filled with beauty that will never fade with time.

It is inconcievable to think that Wilde was denounced for this book being immoral as it is really quite moral, considering the consequences of Dorian's behaviour.

This is a time where the most important thing is preserving a good appearance. Sin is thought of as merely an adventure and the past is only a forgotten bother. The life of Dorian Gray is a race to see who will win his young mind and form it into his being. A most handsome boy, he never had much opinion and was content just to sit and be painted. Basil Hallward loves him for his features. Basil also was in love with the inspiration he felt whenever he was painting Dorian or whenever Dorian was near. Basil thought of finding beauty and living only through art, but none of this was appealing to the impressionable Dorian Gray.Upon meeting Dorian Gray, Lord Henry Wotton becomes completely intrigued. A man who loves nothing more than observing the behavior of human beings and implanting his ideas into anyone who will listen is quite a companion. Where many do not agree with his words, Dorian couldn't agree more with him. As days and years pass, Dorian is shaped into the perfect being that Lord Henry has only begun to imagine.Where there is beauty, worship, and incorrect influence there is flaw. There is hatred, there is jealousy, and there is corruption. Dorian has the strong belief that everyone will love him and he will forever be preserved the angel of time. To himself he is everything, but to everyone he is bad luck. His ideals, taken from Lord Henry, seep into the minds of others and cause them to fall. Precisely because of these beliefs he would never understand he was wrong.With the horror of the ego and the love of oneself there is no clear path again to the light. This is Dorian's story, his desperation, his trials, his losses, this, good people, is his soul.Lovers of philosophy and gothic idealism will find nothing to hate in The Picture of Dorian Gray. I am still baffled by many of the perspectives created and endorsed by Lord Henry. Though there are undoubtedly sections that could put a hyper person to sleep, this book is filled with so much philosophy and plot twists that it is worth the read despite the at times slow plot.

Set in upscale 19th century London, The Picture of Dorian Gray deals with such topics as truth, death, and most especially beauty.Dorian Gray's portrait ages while he remains his youthful self. Gray uses this to his advantage (let's be honest, who wouldn't?). Gray breaks hearts, corrupts others, and avails himself of numerous vices...most notably opium. Gray also takes advantage of his youth by learning new things...music and gemology come to mind. But Gray's self-enhancement does not make up for the copious sins he commits, both large and small...and even though his face does not bely his crimes, the portrait's face does.Wilde's play on eternal youth was almost certainly novel for the time. These days the concept has been played out time again. But I do not begrudge Wilde for this...in his time, he was an innovator.Four major things irked me about this book:First, the prose is overly flowery. I don't read many books written in the 19th century...maybe most of the books were written like this. Second, Wilde seems to use this book as a platform to give us his take on philosophical issues large and small. True, most good works of fiction are a reflection of the society in which the author lives, but Wilde is NOT subtle about giving us numerous opinions on art, love, life, beauty, etc. I think he could have been a bit more subtle doing this. Third most of characters seemed overly naive. Granted, this story is supposed to be set in a time and place where the rich did not concern themselves with trivial matters. Nonetheless...so much was going on under the characters' noses! Even, Henry Wotton -- Gray's longtime friend -- seems to come down with a bout of extreme naivete toward the end of the book. Somehow, this made the characters seem shallower than they otherwise might have been. And my final gripe kind of ties in with the characters' overall naivete. From the time that Dorian Gray is granted eternal youth by whatever powers that be, to the end of the book, nearly two decades elapse. There is only one, very minor, mention of Gray's youthful looks toward the end of the book. Didn't anyone notice that this guy has, supposedly, aged nearly twenty years and yet still appears as youthful as ever? Come on, even these days with plastic surgery and $100+ cosmetic cream, a 40 year old doesn't look half his age. Why did only Gray's closest friend only offhandedly mention this toward the end of the book? Surely someone else must have noticed?Wilde's concept had a lot of potential, and it certainly does make one ponder life's intangible mysteries, but Wilde spent to much time proselytizing his 19th century philosophy for this book to really stand out. This book is only recommended to those who enjoy Wilde's other works."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"I do not know words to describe the way I feel about this book. The first time, with the exception of one chapter, I could not put it down. I have been hooked on Oscar Wilde since. I researched the period and wrote a term paper on this book alone, and after that, when I still was not satisfied, bought his complete works, a book of quotations, and a book about his plays. I only wish by byeing these books I could understand and be swallowed into the beauty of his wisdom. I can sometimes be an obsessive person, and I suppose this is how my review sounds at this point, but don't let your opinion of me detract you from interest in this book.It's worth giving a try...you may become hooked too (by the way for Wilde fans..the movie WILDE is a great window into his life). This book is written with beauty and the words flow like poetry...warning though...people with closed minds towards homosexuality should think of choosing a different book. One of the most descriptive and hiddenly believable parts of this book is the secret feelings Lord Henry has for Dorean. I don't want to misinterpret the book, but i believe Lord Henry's feelings to be more than fatherly...great excelent story!! my favorite book!! what more can be said???-SArah"},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"This is just a warning to prospective kindle customers - the kindle version of this book is not \\"lavishly illustrated\\" which is not so surprising in a digital edition. But what was more surprising to me, Nicholas Frankel's extensive notes, which run alongside the text and which exceed the actual length of the novel itself, are not included. In fact, both the paperback and kindle editions are 'reader's editions'. Yes, there are two rich scholarly introductions, replete with notes, and some three pages of notes to the actual text (which are also included in the hardback) , but the \\"annotations\\" which have excited so much comment from reviewers are in fact missing from the kindle edition. There was no warning from Amazon that the kindle edition omits the textual notes that run side by side with the text in the hardback. However, when I pointed this out to Amazon, 'they' very generously offered me a certificate for the amount of the book on my next purchase. So that was very nice.In fact Stonewall Riot Press has a complete, uncensored \\"reader's\\" edition on Amazon for 9.19. The editor himself, JOHN MCARTHUR, praises Nicholas Frankel's annotations:\\"I was already at work on my edition of the text when I received my copy of Nicholas Frankel's P-book edition published in 2011 by Harvard University Press. Though I was somewhat dismayed at having been scooped, I could only admire the quality and thoroughness of Professor Frankel's scholarship. His notes, which run alongside the text, exceed it in length, and he also provides lavish illustrations and other resources.

I am in LOVE with this story. The way Wilde writes is fabulous- I am an increasingly voracious reader of the classics, and Wilde's writing style is exactly what I like. It is written in the eloquent verbage of the time, but not so much so that I find it stifling and hard to get through ( I am currently reading an Emily Bronte, and am having this problem). The story itself is charming and devious, with an ending that you expect and yet are shocked by. All in all, I am currently parousing more Oscar Wilde books to add to my collection."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"This is a review of the Kindle formatting of \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray.\\" I really enjoyed the story itself, but the Kindle layout could really use some work. Like a lot of free public domain ebooks, this one isn't exactly user-friendly. The lack of a title page doesn't bother me, but this book is also missing a table of contents. If you're reading this for a class or a reading group, that missing table of contents might be a deal breaker. Additionally, while you can always refer to line numbers, this book lacks pagination. Again: I realize this isn't something that's going to bother everyone, but if you need to refer to page numbers in an essay, you might be in trouble if you use this copy.If you're like me and you're interested in reading this book just for fun, page numbers and a table of contents probably don't matter much to you. However, I think everyone can agree that things like page breaks and proper spacing between chapters vastly improve one's reading experience. That's the real rub: There are none. Paragraphs sit immediately atop one another like a great wall of text. Chapters receive the same treatment and are only demarcated by plain text- no bolding, no new section, nothing. The whole effect is not only visually unappealing, but just plain annoying.So the layout of this Kindle edition isn't great, but this book isn't all bad. For one thing, it's free. You get what you pay for formatting-wise, but it's a fantastic story and it's yours forever at absolutely no cost. Plus- and this is also big- this ebook isn't riddled with spelling errors and typos like a lot of the other public domain books available on the Kindle. In sum, while the formatting is annoying, the book is still totally readable."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"\\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is a novel by Oscar Wilde. The soft cover is 176 pages in length.Maybe one of Wildes' most famous works. An increasingly macabre tale set in London, England during the 19th century.Most are familiar with the plot behind this book...but some *SPOILERS* ahead for those that don't want to know.A most handsome young man has a most lifelike portrait done of himself by a up and coming young London painter. In his youthful exuberance over the detail and beauty of the work, he casually remarks that he'd give his soul to remain young and beautiful, like in the painting, forever.His curse is that he stays young while his friends age and the face and body in the portrait grows old through the years. But the portrait does more than just grow old, it reflects every bad or evil thing he's done (using his beautiful looks to gain unfair advantage); resulting in a framed visage that becomes more grotesque and ugly with every new sin he commits.*END SPOILERS*Beautifully written, with great descriptive detail (maybe at times, a little too much). Wilde conveys a tense atmosphere filled with forebodling and apprehension as he gets into the second half of his extraordinary novel.Conclusion:A short, brilliant work. A masterpiece! 5 StarsRay NicholsonP.S.The Kindle edition of this book is free via public domain."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"I loved the idea that someone's true nature can be portrayed on a canvas. Although a beatiful young man, Dorian finds that his debauchery and sin are not reflected by the state of his own body, but by the image cast in a painting. As Dorian continues his decline in morals, an interesting question arises. Kind of a \\"which came first, the chicken or the egg\\" type of thing. Was his soul corrupted by his lack of consequences for his mistakes? Or did the freedom merely let him unleash the evil that already poisoned his soul?"},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"This sophisticated but crude novel is the story of man's eternal desire for perennial youth, of our vanity and frivolity, of the dangers of messing with the laws of life. Just like &quot;Faust&quot; and &quot;The immortal&quot; by Borges.Dorian Gray is beautiful and irresistible. He is a socialit&eacute; with a high ego and superficial thinking. When his friend Basil Hallward paints his portrait, Gray expresses his wish that he could stay forever as young and charming as the portrait. The wish comes true.Allured by his depraved friend Henry Wotton, perhaps the best character of the book, Gray jumps into a life of utter pervertion and sin. But, every time he sins, the portrait gets older, while Gray stays young and healthy. His life turns into a maelstrom of sex, lies, murder and crime. Some day he will want to cancel the deal and be normal again. But Fate has other plans.Wilde, a man of the world who vaguely resembles Gray, wrote this masterpiece with a great but dark sense of humor, saying every thing he has to say. It is an ironic view of vanity, of superflous desires. Gray is a man destroyed by his very beauty, to whom an unknown magical power gave the chance to contemplate in his own portrait all the vices that his looks and the world put in his hands. Love becomes carnal lust; passion becomes crime. The characters and the scenes are perfect. Wilde's wit and sarcasm come in full splendor to tell us that the world is dangerous for the soul, when its rules are not followed. But, and it's a big but, it is not a moralizing story. Wilde was not the man to do that. It is a fierce and unrepressed exposition of all the ugly side of us humans, when unchecked by nature. To be rich, beautiful and eternally young is a sure way to hell. And the writing makes it a classical novel. Come go with Wotton and Wilde to the theater, and then to an orgy. You'll wish you age peacefully."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"I first was introduced to Dorian Gray through a book club, and I thought 'Oh no, Oscar Wilde, here I go, another hard to read boring society book&quot;. I was wrong. Within the first two chapters of Dorian Gray I was intrigued and fascinated. This book deals with several issues that are as important now as they are today: the way our culture worships beauty and youth, an admiration that boarders on homosexual love, virtues, the differences between men and women, and what art is and what makes it truly art. Dorian Gray is a beautiful young man, who sees a portrait of himself and says &quot;How sad it is! I shall grow old, and horrible, and dreadful. But this picture will remain always young...If only it were the other way! If it were I who was to be always young, and the portrait to grow old...I would give my soul for that!&quot; The book takes off from there, leading you from a small theater to great parties. While younger readers may find some of the wording as tough as an old gym shoe, anyone older than 13 with an interest in mystery, romance, and how society runs, will find this a pleasurable and haunting read."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray is a mesmerizing read dominated by two amazing personalities. Dorian Gray is certainly interesting, but I was much more impressed by his friend and mentor Lord Henry Wotton. Dorian is a perfectly nice, well-meaning young man when we first meet him in the studio of the painter Basil Hallward. Hallward in fact is so drawn to the youth that he draws his greatest inspiration from painting him and just being with him. It is the influence of Hallward's friend Lord Henry which leads to Gray's downfall. There are few characters in literature as decadent, witty, and somehow enchanting as Lord Henry. He is never at a loss for words, fatalistic observations of life and people, sarcastic philosophical musings, and brilliantly devious ideas. Among his world of social decadents and artistic do-nothings, his charm remains redoubtable and highly sought-after. Gray immediately falls under his spell, soon devoting himself to living life to its fullest and enjoying his youth and beauty to the utmost. He solemnly wishes that he could remain young and beautiful forever, that Hallward's exquisite picture of him should bear the marks of age and debauchery rather than himself. To his surprise and ultimate horror, he finds his wish fulfilled. Small lines and creases first appear in the portrait, but after he cruelly breaks the heart of an unfortunate young actress who then takes her own life, the first real signs of horror and blood manifest themselves on his portrait. His love for the ill-fated Sibyl Vane is a sordid, heartbreaking tale, and it marks the culmination of his descent into debauchery. He frequents opium dens and houses of ill repute, justifying all of his worst actions to himself, while the influence of Lord Henry continues to work its black magic on his soul. He hides his increasingly grotesque portrait away in an upstairs room, sometimes going up to stare at it and take pleasure in the fact that it rather than he bears the stains of his iniquities. In time, his obsession with his secret grows, and he is constantly afraid that it will be discovered by someone. For eighteen years he lives in this manner, moving among the members of his society as a revered figure who magically retains his youth, but eventually he begins to see himself as he really is and to curse the portrait, blaming its magic for his miserable life of ill-begotten pleasures and loss of moral character. The final pages are well-written, and the climax is eminently satisfying.Exhibiting the undeniable influence of the French Decadence movement of the late 19th century, this wonderful novel serves as a morality play of sorts. One can understand why its unique nature upset a British society emerging from the social constraints of Victorianism, but this reader is hard pressed to see why this novel proved so damaging to Wilde's eventual imprisonment and punishment. Dorian Gray is no hero, nor does his ultimate internal struggles and yearnings for rebirth inspire one to engage in the sort of life he himself eventually came to regret. The only \\"dangerous\\" character in this novel is Lord Henry; his delight in working his evil influence on others as a type of moral experiment and the silver-tongued charm he exploits to aid him in such misbegotten quests have the potential to do harm to a vulnerable mind such as that of Dorian Gray. Lord Henry's evil genius makes him much more interesting than his disciple Dorian Gray. By today's standards, this book is not shocking, and indeed it is much more dangerous to censor work such as this than it is to read it. This book in eminently quotable, and it still manages to cast a magical spell over readers of this day and age. Quite simply, The Picture of Dorian Gray deserves a place on the shelf of the world's greatest literature."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"What made Oscar Wild(e)?The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press has published a new edition of Oscar Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray. While there is no burning need for such a volume in the day of Lady Gaga and marriage equality, it's important to remember that Wilde spent two years in prison for being gay and for having the guts (stupidity?) to flaunt his sexuality. In many ways, it was the flaunting rather than the act themselves that so angered his persecutors.And Dorian Gray, his first and only novel, was certainly a shot fired directly into the heart of Victorian prudery.And in this day of Kindles, e-books and tweets, this is truly a magnificent job of bookmaking. Oversized, lavishly illustrated and gorgeously presented, Oscar would have loved it. The text is examined minutely, with a variety of comparisons from various publications of the novel, as well as Wilde's original manuscript. While there's nothing particularly new to discover in the emendations from the sources, merely a reinforcement of the outrageousness inherent in the piece, the scholarship is both astounding and informative.The annotator and editor, Nicholas Frankel, easily and effortlessly places the modern reader in Wilde's time and place, London's late Victorian Age in London. There is still a tingle to Dorian's story of endless debauchery while he remains looking pure and innocent for decades and the painting ages and grows monstrous, reflecting his sins and crimes.Strangely, the book seems more modern than one would imagine. Rather than merely a potboiler from two centuries back, WIlde's genius imbues the story with a strange and haunting immediacy, and a cautionary tale for us all: Be careful what you wish for.One could hardly wish for a more beautifully accoutered book."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"Is your soul a good bargaining chip for perpetual youth and beauty? Young Dorian Gray was led to believe so and impulsively struck that bargain. \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is the story of his decline into depravity following that ill-advised trade-off. The story is well-known in popular culture. An artist becomes obsessed with his young model's attractiveness. He and his jaded friend compete for influence over the young man. The friend corrupts young Dorian, encourages him to embrace a life of sensual pleasure and to prize his own beauty. Dorian exclaims that he resents the portrait because IT will keep the freshness of youth -- then the fateful words, that he would give his soul if the picture could decay instead of his own face and body.Be careful what you wish for! Over the next twenty years Dorian sinks into the depths of moral slime and watches the hidden portrait show all the signs of that immorality, while his own face and figure keep the blush of youth.Along with the adulation of youth and beauty, Oscar Wilde delves into the theme of art as morally neutral, a principle of the aesthetic school of thought. Can art be moral or immoral? Should it teach us, improve us? That was the common 19th century view but the school of aestheticism believed that the arts had no role in moral enlightenment. The preface of the book lays out this theme in a series of proclamations.The entire book, like all of Wilde's work, is packed with \\"sound bites.\\" The corrupting friend, Lord Henry Wotton, is particularly prone to Polonius-like declamations, and Dorian tells him, \\"You cut life to pieces with your epigrams!\\" In fact Wilde does that, ripping into polite society and the opium dens of London alike.\\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is Oscar Wilde's only published novel. It first appeared in a magazine in 1890 as a shorter work, and was later expanded and edited to remove some of the more blatant homosexual references. His writing is exquisite, his themes repugnant but (dare I say it?) edifying. \\"What does it profit a man ...\\"Highly recommended as a true classic of modern literature. I read this book when I was young and thought I understood it. Now that I'm not so young, I'm sure that I don't.NOTE: I listened to this book on CD, not tape, but I chose this product link because it's the same production. The Brilliance Audio Library Edition, read by Michael Page, was incomparably presented and added a great deal to my enjoyment of this absorbing book.Linda Bulger, 2008"},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"This book contains the story 'The Picture of Dorian Gray' - in original typescript form. This is the way Oscar Wilde wanted the novel to actually read before the publishers got hold of it. There are two other versions of the novel out there - the version printed for magazine publication & the one printed in novel form. After the publishers got hold of the manuscript a lot of changes were made because of content - the homoerotic element was toned down. The novel version is also longer - Wilde expanded the story. There are pictures, illustrations, & extensive notes included to explain all the changes. It's very interesting to see a version in print that is how Wilde intended it. If you are a fan of Oscar Wilde's works or of Dorian Gray in particular, you will appreciate having this book."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"Basil Harwood talks to his friend, Lord Henry Wotton, about his latest painting, a portrait of a striking young man named Dorian Gray to whom he has taken quite a fancy. He feels that his art has never been alive as it has since meeting this young man. Intrigued at his friends acute interest, Lord Henry determines to meet the young man himself, and quite by chance, manages to remain in the studio as Dorian arrives and stands for the finishing touches to his portrait.Once it is completed, Lord Henry comments on how youthful the painting is, remarking how unfortunate it is that the portrait will always remain as young as on the day it was painted, whereas Dorian will slowly age, losing his youth and looks to time. Dorian frets over this and says that he would give anything if only his portrait would age instead of him.Weeks later, after an unfortunate scene with his fianc&eacute;e, Dorian notices a subtle change to his portrait, a certain cruel turn of the lips. As the days pass, he notices more changes and begins to realize that he can commit every vice and cruelty imaginable without any harm coming to him. His portrait will bear the brunt of his adventures. But at what price? As the years pass, he begins to wonder about the state of his very soul and if he can change, perhaps bring the portrait back to its original beauty.This is a great novel, dealing for the most part with man's quest for eternal youth. Who wouldn't want to stay young forever? We go through fad diets, gyms, botox, plastic surgery -- all in the name of trying to remain healthy and youthful. Dorian is given a unique opportunity, the consequences of which show him the havoc that all the vices and cruel acts have upon his soul (or his conscience). We also get to see how getting what you wish for doesn't always turn out the way you thought it would.It's a well-written story, full of unique characters. The majority of the male characters seem to have no problem whatsoever having intimate relationships with other men. By his actions, Basil appears to be in love with Dorian. Dorian, in turn, is infatuated with Lord Henry, even thought both of them do have relationships with women (for Dorian, a fianc&eacute;e; for Lord Henry, a wife). There's even a bit of jealousy on the part of Lord Henry's wife when she finally meets the man who's been monopolizing her husband's time.At times, though, it does move slowly due to long passages discussing the place of art in society and philosphizing about the quest for youth and beauty. In these passages the text seems to turn more into a lecture rather than a novel. That, however, does not take away from the enjoyment of the novel."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"While Oscar Wilde's central theme of corruption initially captures the readers attention, the character development does not help to hold the reader's attention for a long period of time. Dorian Gray, the central character, has the potential to be a very romantic and dumbfounding character, but because Wilde does not go into great character development, he seems almost more like the painting that comes to represent him ... dimensionless. The point of the novel is to point out how changed Dorian becomes over the years and how he goes from being the epitome of beauty to someone that is hardly recognized as the person he once was. However, in order to feel this transformation, the reader would need to feel as if he or she knew the original Dorian Gray. Because the beginning of the novel does not describe him enough, the full effect of Dorian's startling transformation is unable to be fully comprehended.In addition, although the theme of outer beauty coupled with inner corruption is a strong one, this book seems more like one that should be read in a class and discussed in groups. It is not a novel that is easy-reading for pleasure. The style of writing makes it hard to breeze through the book, although on the positive the book brings about much self-contemplation and is very thought provoking. The reader cannot put it down because the whole novel leads to the very disturbing, although somewhat predictable, ending.In general, it is a book that should be read and will be enjoyed by many. The reader can relate to the feelings felt by the main characters and the themes in the book are ones that can be witnessed in real life. The general faults of the novel are eventually outweighed by the suspense and the intrigue as the painting of Dorian Gray, once a masterpiece, becomes more defiled with each horrible act committed by Dorian."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"Basil, who up until now was a mediocre painter after meeting Dorian Gray a young Adonis, was inspired to create a masterpiece of which he puts himself into. Against Basil's wishes, Basil's friend Lord Henry influences Dorian Gray. Dorian looks at his portrait and realizes that while the portrait will stay young forever, he will grow old; so Dorian makes a wish that if only he could stay young forever and the portrait can age.At first Dorian does not realize his wishes been granted. He falls in love with a beautiful young actor who is every woman that Shakespeare ever wrote about. Once again, due to Lord Henry's influence, he realizes that she's just a common girl.Starting with absent-minded acts Dorian slowly sinks into debauchery. Moreover, with every new act his picture becomes more grotesque while Dorian stays is young and as innocent looking as the day his picture was painted.What will become of Dorian?What will become of Dorian's painting?What would you do if you were Dorian?Oscar Wilde paints a picture himself as he describes Dorian Gray's dilemma. In addition, we as readers travel with Dorian as each decision is made. In some places in the story, Oscar Wilde seems to drag on and on with detail; however we find that this detail is necessary to set the next scene.Oscar Wilde himself led a risky life that lead to a jail sentence; is attitudes can be seen in the dialogues in this book.The Picture of Dorian Gray Starring: George Sanders, Hurd Hatfield"},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"After reading some of the contemporary reviews of this book, I was more than a little curious to see how awful this book really was. I was skeptical that it could be bad, because I'm very familiar with the wit of Wilde. As far as gothic novels go, this book ranks high in the Victorian era. Looking back from a historical perspective, I can see why the critics of the time disliked it. But from today's perspective, it is nothing short of brilliant. Wilde weaves a story like few authors could ever dream of doing, and of course his wit is played out beautifully in this book as well. full of quips and quirks, this book is a must read for anybody who has a love of sharp, intelligent writing."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"This is a perfect example of why Speculative Fiction exists. To allow us to see deeper into the human soul than we could otherwise. Although this book was short, it took me a good week to read. I kept having to put it down after a chapter or two so I could read something else. Every word seemed to suck me in while not making me want to read another sentence at the same time. I guess the fact that I was also reading Milton's Paradise Lost at the same time as Dorian Gray doesn't help cut down the long internal debates Dorian Gray forced into my skull. Either way, this novel is a must read for anyone who has even thought that self examination is a part of what it means to be alive. But beware. This book packs a punch."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"As one of the first books I read on my Kindle, this one will always be a little special for me.

Five out of five stars! It's depressing that authors no longer write like this, where there's an amazing revelation or a great quote every couple of pages.

There is also a ribbon book marker in each of these books in a coordinating color!"},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"Perhaps I'm jaded by modern science fiction conventions (ala The Twilight Zone), but I felt Dorian Gray ended predictably. Given a magical portrait that protects the subject from the consequences of immorality, Rod Sterling would have ended it the same way.Still reading through a contemporary lens, Dorian Gray provides rich imagery of life in the 19th century. Wilde disadvantages this strength of the novel by exhaustively listing image after image while Dorian immerses himself in sensory experience. These passages read like mildly interesting dictionary entries.Overall, the pithy dialogue, imagery and wonderfully gothic story wins out and Grey entertains."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"Initially heavy on witty dialogue and light on plot, but it gets there in the second half and is a clever story. You can't flick between chapters as you can with other Kindle publications."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"Those poignant words spoken by the devil (Al Pacino) in The Devil's Advocate come to mind when talking about Dorian Gray. As a young, beautiful and conceited man, Dorian finds comfort in the company of Lord Henry, a morally corrupt aristocrat in Victorian England. Already teetering on the verge of chronic narcissism, Dorian is pushed off the edge into the abyss of eternal damnation by Henry's seductive, imaginative, and in the end, destructive speech.This classic, cautionary tale of the woes of youth has vanity at its core. Dorian, like all of us, is afraid of becoming irrelevant and unloved as a consequence of old age. Only in his case, he let his paranoia coupled with bad influence (Lord Henry) devour him. The story isn't unique in the sense that it happens everyday in the form of inconsequential lives consumed by gyms, beauty salons and drugs, chasing reluctant love and evasive youth.If you haven't read this classic in school, I highly recommend you do now. Lord Henry's lines, though evil, are very entertaining and almost too poetic. No man I know has a wit and sharp tongue like Lord Henry, but again, he is not a man. He is the devil's incarnate."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"That famous quote from Shakespeare's Hamlet certainly applies to Dorian Gray. And Lord Henry Wotton couldn't help using this quote, much like he couldn't help baiting Dorian Gray. Lord Henry admires the man in Basil Hallward's new portrait so much that he has got to meet him. Is he as beautiful in real life as he is in the painting? Is he ever! He is an Adonis, a young man as pure on the inside as he is on the outside. No wonder Hallward is obsessed with him! So begins Lord Henry's attempts to corrupt the young man. In no uncertain terms, he tells Dorian Gray that \\"beauty is the wonder of wonders. It is only shallow people who do not judge by appearances.\\" He also goes on to tell him that his wonderful youth and good looks are his best qualities, too bad someday they will fade. Dorian Gray is upset. His portrait will remain young and beautiful forever, whereas he will age and lose with his physical beauty. If only it were the other way around...That is all I'll share in terms of plot. You have got to read this magnificent novel to know the rest. The Picture of Dorian Gray, first published in 1890, is one of the most disturbing works of fiction I have ever read. No wonder it is so popular! It is thought provoking from beginning to end. Dorian is a cross between Narcissus and Faust -- his vanity is obvious from the very start, and Lord Henry is depicted as a devil, whereas Hallward is the angel who tries to maintain Dorian's innocence. Yes, as it has often been observed, the novel does have some not-so-concealed references to homosexuality. The aforementioned theme, mainly noticeable in Hallward, is, in the words of Marianne Dashwood in Jane Austen's Sense and Sensibility, \\"implied but never declared.\\" There was no need for Wilde to say it in so many words, but he dropped hints here and there, like the rumors that Hallward moved to San Francisco. I doubt he would have been able to be more inconspicuous in his time. This novel could cover long hours of discussion. There are so many themes and symbolism and magic realism and foreshadowing here, and Lord Henry's crude but honest musings and observations are fascinating. He is definitely the most interesting character in the book. This is my first time reading this book. I'd wanted to read it since I read Amanda Filipacchi's Nude Men ten years ago. Why it took me so long to give it a whirl I will never know. Better late than never, I guess. And if you haven't read it, well, need I suggest that you do? You won't regret it. This is nineteenth century literature at its finest."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"I truly enjoyed this book. It's a story of Dorian Gray's journey through life. There's a great quote, which really is the theme for the entire book...\\"what does it profit a man if he gain the world and lose his own soul?\\" The pleasures and sins Dorian Gray enjoys in life are conveyed onto his portrait. Ultimately, his portrait ages and warps with each transgression that tarnishes his soul.Wilde has some great narratives and descriptions in the book. His writing style immersed me in the book. Very moving. I can truly see why it's a classic and wish I had read it sooner."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"Art for art's sake? Oscar Wilde's \\"Dorian Gray\\" is about youth, corruption, and esthetics. Reflective of Wilde's own life and revolt against Victorian era sentimentality, young Dorian Gray slowly changes after his philosophical discussions with the cynical Lord Henry Wotton, whose cold criticisms and harsh wit are often humorous in an addictively jaded kind of way, and tempting to arm oneself with; however, read on and observe Wilde's destruction of Lord Henry's young protoget. The immediate power of Basil Hallward's portrait of Dorian retains a demonic hold on its confused subject, taunting and torturing his vanity with its strangely metamorphizing characteristics. Who's changing, and what exactly is changing? Wilde creates an unforgettable \\"portrait\\" here of one man's (or is it the whole of Victorian society?) demise. Many critics of Wilde have seen him and \\"The Portrait of Dorian Gray\\" as pure evil and criticized the undertones of homosexuality, and linked it with a lifestyle of debauchery and degradation. Wilde was thrown in jail for his \\"unlawful activities\\". To them I must concur with Wilde, that \\"Those who find ugly meanings in beautiful things are corrupt without being charming. This is a fault.\\""},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"Wilde's Dorian Gray is such a powerful book because it explores the path of one man's sins and their effect on his life and the lives of those around him. Wilde uses Dorian as an example to demonstrate the struggles of humanity coping with its flaws. Wilde's plot is simple enough. Dorian was a man who had everything going for him. He was young, beautiful, wealthy, and unspoiled. Then he met Lord Henry, whose bizzare philosophies that he himself didn't even take seriously had a great impact on the impressionable Dorian. Lord Henry had convinced Dorian that once his youth had passed, he would have nothing enjoyable left in life, which caused Dorian pray aloud that a portrait he had of himself would take on his own physical burdens. As Dorian becomes more and more corrupted by Lord Henry and commits more sins, he notices that the painting (which represents his conscience) is becoming more and more wretched. He occasionally feels remorse and tries to change, but his plans always fail when Lord Henry draws him back under the shadow of his influence. The discouraged Dorian finally resolves to start his life anew by destroying the painting, the only record he has of his sins. When he stabs the picture, however, he kills himself.This is a powerful story that portrays the important lesson that sins are inescapable and everybody's actions catch up to them. This isn't a hard concept, but Wilde's writing is very challenging. He uses very poignant expressions constantly throughout the book that can get the reader off track because they tend to cause him to attempt to frequently stop and process what has just been said. I think that this was a great book, but it wouldn't be good to require it at Mercy High because it takes so long to get through."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"More than a story, The Picture of Dorian Gray contains many of Oscar Wilde's most famous commentary on life. Unlike any other work of fiction that I have read before I actually read this book with a pen in hand, underlining Wilde's eloquent thoughts about art, tragedy and life.No need to recap the story here other than to say that it continues to be applicable to every human being born into this world. Each of us has our own picture that reflects our deepest and truest feelings, thoughts and actions. Facades abound but there is no getting around our frequent trips inside to have a look at the portrait that only we can see.A masterful book that goes far beyond the well-known story."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"\\"What does it profit a man if he gains the world, but loses his soul?\\" This is the core question raised by \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\", Oscar Wilde's reworking (if that isn't too unkind) of Goethe's Faust for the Victorian era and his attack on the values of the middle classes caused a scandal when it was first published in 1890 and over 100 years later, while not particularly shocking to the modern reader is still a deeply unsettling tale. The novel revolves around our hero Dorian, the tensions within his own character and the forces that conspire in his eventual destruction.The book begins with Dorian seeing for the first time a portrait of himself painted by his friend Basil Hallward and Dorian's wish that the portrait would age while he remained forever the same as he was on that day. The \\"prayer of his pride\\" is answered and not only does the picture carry the assault of time for Dorian, but also the full weight of the casual cruelties and crimes he commits, evolving from a reproduction of his physical form into a mirror image of his soul. Realising this, Dorian is driven to even greater excesses safe in the knowledge that he can get away with it until finally his own guilt catches up with him.In his only novel, one can't help but feel that Oscar is giving us an insight into his own soul and the guilt he suffered over his sexual orientation. But on a deeper level, Wilde shows us the damnation of one soul and in that gives us a metaphor for our world and ourselves. Despite the Victorian idea that a person&#65533;s nature is written on their face, which is frankly ludicrous with the hindsight of the last century, \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is a truly wonderful and thought-provoking story heavily laced with the famous wit and wisdom of the great man himself."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"\\"It is the spectator, and not life, that art really mirrors\\" - Oscar Wilde\\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is an excellent novel about the degradation of the human soul. The novel focuses around the handsome Dorian Gray and his interactions with the artist Basil Hallward, who paints his portrait and Lord Henry, who becomes the corrupting influence on Dorian's soul and Dorian's iinteractions with the British aristocracy. Dorian is compared to Narcissus, who was so obsessed with his own beauty, that it swallowed him whole. Dorian seals his fate with one wish; upon viewing his portrait, he wonders if it would be possible for his portrait to show the signs of aging, in exchange for his mortal beauty. Throughout the novel, we see Dorian's decent into total self - absorbtion and evil all of which culminates in an ending that is predictable but still entertaining none the less.Just a quick side note, there is some great social commentary running throughout \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray,\\" specifically Wilde's commentary on the stiff, British aristocracy of the late 19th century, absurd views regarding women, who are painted by Gray as blubbering idiots (a sign of the times) and last but not least, the underlying homosexual undertones present between Dorian, Basil and Lord Henry are fascinating to deconstruct.\\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" was my first introduction to Oscar Wilde and after reading the novel, I was hooked. I would like to return to the quote above, about art mirroring the soul of the spectator, after reading this novel, you will have a sense of how trully frightening that notion is."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"To be honest, I had two reasons for choosing this book. One was for a class assignment. Having a list to choose from lead to the second reason I picked this- a friend told me she had greatly enjoyed it. Therefore, I began reading with the expectation of having a &quot;nice&quot; read. Other than that, I didn't expect much from the novel. This is one of the times I am glad to say that I was wrong. &lt;i&gt;The Picture of Dorian Gray&lt;/i&gt; providea, first and foremost a good storyline. A young man, worried that once his youth and beauty departs he will lose everything, wishes that a portrait painted of him bear all reprecussions of time. After a period of time, this young man, Dorian Gray, discovers he has gotten his wish. However, an old maxim proves true once more in this novel: be careful what you wish for, as Gray learns he will, in fact, get what he deserves as a result of a life of debauchery. Yet an interesting (and certainly unsettling, at least at the time it was written) story line is not all the book has going for it. Wilde provides the reader with three main characters who are well-developed enough to make them convincing. We are given a tempramental artist (another good reason to read this book: anyone with any sort of artistic temprament will greatly appreciate some of the commentary made within the dialogue of the story), who is given to jealousy, a jaded, rather intellectual man who always has an opinon and never hastens to inform those in the vicinity of it, and, finally, a young man who begins the story as a very naive person and changes throughout the book in a seemingly natural manner. A wide variety of smaller characters also help to enhance the plot. In short, this book was one of the most interesting I have ever read. At times, I found myself getting the attention of someone nearby, to point out a line found in one of the passages that I felt they might enjoy or somehow relate to. In one way or another, it is my opinion one would be hard-pressed to find someone who did not relate to something the book. Overall, it was an excellent read."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"The idea of never growing old and having a painting take on all your admoralities is appealing.Dorian reacts as anyone would. He lives life with full adbandonment pays the price.I believe the moral of the story is this. In the end we all pay for our actions.Wilde does a great job building characters and leading the reader into the world of the Englis upper-crust."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"This book is sooo good, I think no jaded reader can deserve that title without having read this book. Dorian Gray, an astonishingly beautiful young aristocrat, receives the gift of eternal youth in the form of a painting one of his friends has made of him. Later, prompted by another friend, the divine dissolute Lord Henry Wotton, Dorian gradually falls into a dissipate lifestyle and the eerie painting shows both the ravages of age and the advance of Dorian's moral decay, while he retains his breathtaking looks. As Dorian becomes more and more obsessed with the painting's worsening appearance, the changes in his once sweet and naive personality are explained in the story, and Dorian lives in fear of the painting being exposed to the world, therefore showing him beyond any doubt as the sleazy creep he is, until it comes to a point when the gift he prized so much ends up turning against him. Dorian Gray is one of the least likable characters I have seen on print, but I really liked his wicked friend Lord Wotton, who in the story is the one in charge of leading Dorian astray and dishing criticism after witty criticism of nineteenth century English society. I later learned this particular character was a sort of mockery of Oscar Wilde himself. A mellower version of this character can be found in another of Wilde's works, Lord Arthur Savile's Crime, my second favorite story by this author."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"Contrary to some opinions I've come across, this book does NOT romanticize or promote a loss of morals. It is the exact opposite. Yes, Dorian becomes corrupted, but does the ending suggest that Wilde was making Dorian a hero for it? By no means. Dorian did not live happily ever after. It is a very moral book in that it clearly reinforces the principle of inevitable consequences of one's actions. Yes, at times it was a little slow (that is when the characters went into long life-philosophies)but all around it was very interesting and provided an insight into the late Victorian world in which Oscar Wilde lived. It addresses some key concepts such as appearance and its relation to virtue and the double-sidedness of one's character. Overall this book was not bad at all. A good read."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"I am a fan of many writers, but Oscar Wilde holds a special place in my non-existant but nonetheless real Hallway of Marble Busts of Famous Dead Guys. Obviously, Wilde was aware of his already-forming legend status at the height of his popularity, and his arrogance is permeated throughout every one of his works. This does not, however, disqualify him from being rightly honored by his huge and admiring readership. It also doesn't change the fact that he was victim of his own irony, dying young and humiliated in jail. No one illustrates tragicomedy better than Oscar Wilde. This particular book is the Bible of the Infinitely Quotable Strokes of Verbal Genius. My personal fave: &quot;Cigarettes are the perfect form of the perfect pleasure. They are exquisite and they leave one unsatisfied. What more could one want?&quot;"},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"Besides the clever fiction and vivid details that draws you in deep, this book brings out the shame of humanity and puts it on display so elegantly. The man got jailed for this book and boy was it worth it!!"},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"I'm surprised no one has actually managed to portray this books correctly. It was actually why I decided to read it.If you expect exploits as in the movies, where he uses his ability and all that, then you'll regret it.It's a good story about a man who realises what morality is and how to live with it, or not live with it."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"I heard of the movie first because I'm a Fan of Ben Barnes before I found the book. I read the reviews and saw how people praises the book a lot. I liked the concept so figured I'll read it first before I'll watch the movie. I really thought I'd walk into a grotesque environment but it ended up so intriguing. Its exhilarating and atmospheric. I admire Oscar Wilde's brilliance in creating the characters, specifically Lord Henry. He is Dorian Gray's (the evil one) creator and honestly, Henry is the keystone of the story. His lines are perfectly constructed making them alluring even if he wasn't brave enough to do them himself. If I were like Dorian who grew up seeing only 4 walls and suddenly got freed, then get to talk to a man as eloquent as Henry is, I really believe his influence will be so great too. The characters of the book also show deep interest in art of different forms including Painting of course, literature and fashion which reflects the artist within Oscar himself. The author described Dorian Gray as \\"art\\" himself, I figured it will be challenging to find a person to play the part in the movie so beautiful to be called \\"art\\". Amazingly, Ben Barnes lived up to the role. Being chosen to play that role brings pressure and flattery of course, but the challenge is, if he can bring to life the Dorian Gray Oscar Wilde created. Its a good read! Oscar Wilde is a talented writer as we all know. This book can change your point of view of some aspects in life if you let it!! As what Ben said, \\"there's a great difference between pleasure and real happiness\\". You can try the movie too, its wonderfully made; great acting and the story line is nice. they made a few modifications and additions from the book at it made it more interesting. Colin forth and Ben Barnes were fabulous! The movie is lush, exhilarating and extremely sexy!!"},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"A fascinating look into the human ego and basic selfishness,this story could as easily have been written regarding our society as that of 1890s England. The only rough spot is chapter 11, which can easily be skimmed over. My best guess is that it all would have been fascinating to Wildes contemporaries, but is somewhat meaningless in this age."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"I would happily listen to Edward Petherbridge read a telephone book but he truly does make this a very enjoyable book to listen to.

It's suspenseful, the ending is a sudden twist, and there's suprises all over the place. This book is free, so there's no reason for you to not get it. NOW."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"This cover art features a portrait of an unknown, bearing no resemblance to the blonde Dorian in Wilde's novel.My parents kept a page of chapel sayings from Bob Jones Sr. on our refrigerator for many years. Some of their friends sent their children there long before I was born. Pastor Jones might have had Dorian Gray in mind when he said: \\"Dissipations of youth must be paid for with a draft on old age.\\"Wilde's Dorian Gray is devoted to the fanciful premise that a soul might scar itself with the most horrible of depraved debauchery, which in Victorian London included opium dens, prostitution, and in the case of Mr. Gray, murder, both by proxy and in personal excess of temper. So, if you exercise patience, a murder mystery unfolds. (Lots and lots of patience!)What dark meditations crossed my mind, and how like ice was my countenance while feasting in Wilde's psychological eulogizing of scarlet sins and opulence from dozens of characters famous in classical Western history. As my mother was a history major with emphasis in fine arts, I've seen many of the anecdotal persons from art and mythology named in this book, experienced their art and literature and stories in our own collections and the local library. I've read their sad, sordid sense of moral turpitude, the decay of dynasties possessed of great art, luxury and wealth.Dorian's zeal to experience every pleasure on which he might lay his hands is reminiscent of the Ecclesiastes, though more lengthy and of less lucid outcomes. Accused sometimes of misanthropy, Oscar Wilde is nonetheless a master of florid verbosity. As once observed by author Ursula K. LeGuin, each sentence must dedicate it's reason for being, to an introduction of the next sentence.I might not have read all of this novel, except that I'm awed in admiration of the incredibly artful architecture of Wilde's sentences. One simple sentence might introduce what literature teachers will scold their students about being a \\"run-on-sentence.\\"But Wilde philosophizes elaborate arguments in the heads of his characters. There is nothing wrong analytically, or logically with attaching the cohesive phrases and clauses of two or more sides of an argument all together into a unified thought, even wielding a dozen commas to conjoin these articulated opposites.The style evokes memories of reading St. Paul in the King James English Bible, or the sublime constructions found in the tragedyRamona (Signet Classics), by Helen Hunt Jackson. I would never subject juvenile readers to the philosophy of Dorian Grey. Even as an adult, I'm grateful to have experienced a healthy dose of Shakespeare, prior to microscopically examining the minutia of a deeply troubled mind preoccupied with male beauty."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"I started out disliking this book: too much silliness, not enough serious message. However, as time progressed, it turned out that the silliness (often shown in people's favorite quotes) is froth, and the body underneath is substantial: good, evil, innocence, and corruption. Wilde is a sublime genius at meshing the two levels in one work."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"this was a well written book but I wouldn't suggest it to anyone who wants a relaxing read. If you like well written novels that have an almost disturbing sense to it then this is the book for you."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"I picked up this book as I was intrigued by the character of Dorian Gray after having watched The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. It was an interesting book, and while I cannot say that I liked it as such, it is good to have read it - my curiosity is satisfied.It was very sad that Dorian went so completely \\"off the rails\\", so to speak, under the influence of Henry, and I found the worldview difficult to cope with. At times the irony in the situations was very poignant - such as when Dorian tells Sybil Vane that she is selfish, while he, in fact, is the selfish one. I suppose that justice was met at the end of the book."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"First published in 1890, Oscar Wilde's now classic novel is a meditation on decadence, art and morality. At the center is a young man of strikingly good looks who's portrait is painted by a dear friend - a portrait that then absorbs and reflects the young man's soul as he makes decisions that affect others as he slides into a life of debauchery.Highly stylized, the prose contains classic lines such as \\"the only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it.\\" Wilde's only novel, the book was viewed as scandalous and immoral when published despite the fact that the immoral - or, more accurately, amoral perpetrator of ill deeds suffers as he chases empty pleasures and eventually comes to reflect upon the impact that his actions have had upon others and himself.The book is not the easiest of reads given the heavy style, the setting, and pervasive use of cultural references from high society in the late 19th century. However, for those who want to fully understand the commonly referenced trope of \\"Dorian Gray's portrait,\\" nothing serves bettern than the source."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"I read this book because it was a bookclub read. I aways wanted to read this book, and glad that I did, but it was a little bit of struggle at times not to set it down and forget about it.

I am happy that I read the book and I did find it to be a good story and plot overall. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to read the classics."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"I really have no idea why \\"Illustrated\\" is included in the title of this work. The only part of this book that is illustrated (besides the cover) is the short biography found at the end of the book."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"It must have been around 1870 when very capable artist Basil Hallward brilliantly painted soon to be very rich 20-year old Dorian Gray. Hallward's wordy, witty friend Lord Henry Wotton on their first meeting in the painter's studio persuaded Dorian Gray that youth was any good looking human's greatest attribute. And youth, since it did not long endure, must be lived to the utmost while it did last. This meant Dorian's \\"expressing,\\" externalizing every insight, impulse and passion that most people learn to keep bottled up inside them. An early version of \\"let it all hang out.\\"Oh, how hitherto naive and innocent Dorian wished that he would never have to say farewell to his youth and beauty! If only he might stay young while the young man in his portrait did all the aging? That wish was granted. And THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY (1890, 1891) unrolls the next 18 or 19 years of Gray's while everyone around him grew older but he did not.It can be argued,that Dorian's wish for eternal youth was morally indifferent, neither good nor bad. It might have remained harmless, like Ponce de Leon's search for the Fountain of Youth. It was conceivably a well-meaning God who granted Dorian Gray's wish. What would matter in the end was what Gray did with his youth.He was given good albeit secular advice by painter Basil Hallward and very bad, cynical, character-ruining advice by Lord Henry. Unfortunately for Hallward (whom Gray would later murder) and for Dorian himself, the young man consistently heeded Lord Henry. In consequence, Dorian Gray learned to separate art from reality, learned to value clever words and eptithets more than unselfish deeds and denied himself nothing that his fertile brain could imagine. This self-indulgence included frequent visits to London opium dens, brawls with foreign sailors on the docks and viciously spurning Sybil Vane, the teenage Shakespearean actress, whom he loved for her acting skills but who renounced them because they seemed unreal compared with Dorian's love for her. Hours after a scathing denunciation by a disappointed Dorian, young Sybil swallows prussic acid and dies.All this dissent into hell is faithfully reproduced in the increasingly cruel, vicious lines of face and body in the portrait of Dorian Gray. The picture becomes the conscience of the novel's hero who often sits spell-bound before it. It sometimes persuades him, very briefly, to make half-hearted efforts at reform. But the portrait allows Dorian to understand that every single one of his half-hearted good deeds is hypocritical, is bad acting. For 18 years, until he destroys himelf with a knife intended to destroy his portrait, Dorian Gray remains a handsome 20-year old while all others move steadily toward the grave.Telling the bare story of Gray's decline takes up perhaps a third of THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY. The rest is ballast, starting with excursuses into Gray's sometimes year long fads of the moment: tapestries, music, religion (especially Roman Catholicism), mysticism and decadent French literature. Then there are teas, dinners and parties among the swells and aristocrats of London. These are all contrived social stages for Oscar Wilde to let his decadent characters like Lord Henry Wotton and handsome young Dorian Gray skewer institutions like marriage and preen themselves before admiring audiences as they drop several hundred seemingly spontaneous epithets into sparkling conversations. The London ambience of useless Duchesses, members of Parliament and wealthy society widows is lovingly limned by Oscar Wilde.Let one party and its smart talk suffice for many. As brilliant for its repartee as any other social occasion in the novel is Chapter 15's small, hastily puled together dinner at Lady Narborough's. Dorian Gray appears, having mere hours before having stabbed to death his friend painter Basil Hallward and having then blackmailed another onetime friend to dispose of the body. At Lady Narborough's Dorian was wildly excited but outwardly calm and his manner \\"as easy and graceful as ever.\\" The company was rather dull. His hostess's married daughter had \\"one of those characteristic British faces that, once seen, are never remembered.\\" Things became livelier when Lord Henry Wotton arrived, very, very late. The table discusses the amours of Madame de Ferrol. Lord Henry summed her up: \\"Her capacity for family affection is extraordinary. When her third husband died, her hair turned quite gold from grief.\\" Henry preens himself when accused of wickedness: \\"It is perfectly monstrous ... the way people go about nowadays saying things against one behind one's back that are absolutely and entirely true.\\"The question arises at Lady Narborough's: are we such a sorry lot because it is \\"the end of the century\\" (fin de siecle)? or the end of the world (fin de globe)? Certainly none of the players is morally outstanding or even self-content. They are useless and they know it.-OOO-"},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"This was a English summer project for my daughter in school. She really enjoyed it.

The background in which Gateway is set is brilliant, and the only reason why my rating's not lower. An imaginative look at how earth could be in the far future (mass exploitations in countries rich as well as poor, people thrown out the airlock when they're not of any use), the lives of the prospectors and how long space trips could be, and the brilliant concept of Gateway itself. Where the novel is extremely flawed is the absolute lack of any kind of conflict; I gave up assuming this was just a long buildup around 3/4ths of the book.

Unfortunately, Pohl never goes this route. Instead of discovering new planets, new technology, or new lifeforms he focuses almost exclusively on the protagonist's psychological problems. These are two-fold: constant fear of going on a mission and guilt because of the outcome of the last mission. The last third in particular seems concerned with the protagonist procrastinating any actions that might make this a more interesting story. Pohl's style partially makes up for the lack of plot but it's still a wasted oportunity.Fortunately there are sequels which live up to the Gateway premise, as well as Legend Entertainment's computer games which capture the atmosphere quite well."},{"Title":"Gateway","review":"In the distant future a large complex (Gateway) carved into an asteroid by the Heechee, an Alien race that left almost no clue as to who or what they are, except their ships of course.

Every other chapter is devoted to the Future Bob after his gateway adventures have finished as he sees a robot shrink named Sigfrid as Bob tries to deal with his time and experiences on gateway and in space.The Good:I thought the concept of the book was really cool, and the description of gateway and how it all works was really cool. The trips into space were well thought out. Not super exciting but just the description of how limited of space they are, limited food, and how after many days in this small space will make you hate the people you are stuck with.The Bad:No too much. The book isn't super adventure filled as a lot of the book is Bob being afraid to go on a ship because of the risk and hanging around on gateway.Overal the book is good, not super exciting but well written and enjoyable, and worth a read."},{"Title":"Gateway","review":"Along with Enders Game by Orson Scott Card, this has the crappiest story to cover ratio ever(this is a horrible cover that has nothing at all to do with the book). I have a terrible habit of letting the cover of a book influence me. Thankfully my better judgment prevailed. I read this book in two days and had to drag myself away from it the first night (at 2am, I had to get up at 6am).The chapters are set up so that one takes place in the present and two is a sort of flash back and so on. This makes it compulsively hard to put down. To me that is one of the most important qualities in a book and this one does it perfectly.In the future an asteroid is discovered containing hundreds of automated space ships that are capable of faster than the speed of light travel (the problem is that you don't really know where the ship is going, if anywhere). The beings who built the ships are long gone and have left no trace as to what happened to them or where they went to. So humans take it upon themselves to inhabit the asteroid and send \\"Prospectors\\" out in the ships to search the stars. A lot of them don't come back.The book is essentially an interview between one of the most famous and wealthy (prospectors get a percentage of the profits on any thing they find) Prospectors, Robinette, and his computerized therapist. As you get deeper into the book the tension mounts and spirals towards an incident too painful for Robinette to speak of, terminating in one of the most satisfying endings of any book I've ever read."},{"Title":"Gateway","review":"Along with tau zero this is my least favorite classic science fiction book. It won so many awards &amp; is so highly praised that it is ,I admit, a classic. It did have good ideas, which it mostly ignored. Instead it talked about bleak characters, in a bleak world, doing bleak things in a bleak way,etc. Also this book gave me way too much information on the main character's sexual dysfunctions. Maybe my personal prejudices got in the way of my enjoyment of this book. For instance I dislike unrelenting bleakness &amp; don't believe in psychology. Still I do not understand why I am the only person who disliked this book."},{"Title":"Gateway","review":"This is the best book I've ever read about guilt; the real kind resulting from a moral failure. It's also one of my favorite, if not THE favorite, SF book."},{"Title":"Gateway","review":"I recently re-read Gateway (after at least 20 years). Many old, beloved books can't live up to fond memories. Gateway does.Very briefly, humanity has found the techno-remains of a vanished elder race. Prospectors (from a base at Gateway asteroid) risk their lives using ancient FTL ships to explore unknown distant destinations. It takes a special breed -- or true desperation -- to be a prospector. Our hero is in the latter category. He wildly succeeds, but only after paying a horrible psychic cost hinted at throughout. That price is dramatically revealed late in the book, after a great build-up.The scale of the plot remains impressive. The main character (Robinet Broadhead), the Heechee prospector, remains fascinating (if flawed). The cast of supporting characters is excellent and well drawn. The star of the show, in an understated way, is an AI: Sigmund von Shrink. The psychodrama between Broadhead and Sigmund is the heart (not of the plot but) of the book.As a bonus, in rereading I appreciated the seeds so excellently planted -- without leaving loose ends -- for the immediate sequel (Beyond the Blue Event Horizon).Are there weaknesses? Sure. The boxed interludes (e.g., many classified ads) about past prospecting missions and life on Gateway base are overdone, and give a sense of a book padded. Some human-technology references are jarringly dated (like references to computer tapes). And Broadhead in fact HAS a big head. It's sometimes like the sitcom Scrubs, with him narrating his life, only in retrospect.Still, all in all, rewarding still after all these years."},{"Title":"Gateway","review":"A common plot feature of some of the most compelling science fiction novels I have read is a mysterious alien civilization - a vast black box that the author reveals in tiny but tantalizing snippets. Pohl does this masterfully in Gateway; it is probably the novel's best feature. The worst feature is undoubtedly the unintentionally hilarious psychoanalysis the protagonist undergoes. It sounds so outdated and is such a stilted and cheap way to try and develop a character that it prevents the book, in my opinion, from being an enduring classic. That said, I devoured the book in only two sittings. It is engaging, moves at a fast pace, and contains many interesting asides about astronomy and &quot;xenoanthropology&quot;. The characters are believable and not just adventure story archetypes. Read it!"},{"Title":"Gateway","review":"I read this book with great expectations since I had heard it described as a 'classic', but I was not really happy with the experience. There is so little exposition (concerning the Heechee's for example) that one is almost through with the book before some of the important aspects of the story are understood. I did not find the 'science' very credible either. Nevertheless, I did find the main character interesting and the story does sort of grow on the reader even when all pieces of the puzzle have not fallen into place. However, I have read many, many much better pieces of science fiction - in terms of character, plot and the science aspect. This would not be one that I would consider a 'classic'."},{"Title":"Gateway","review":"I'm a bit at a loss for words for this one. There were times where I couldn't wait to continue reading, and then there were times where I had to stop and wonder, \\"Is this going anywhere?\\". In the end I felt a little of both, leaving me with mixed feelings.The pros are that the story is an interesting story, one of a long dead/missing alien race that ultimately led to the discovery of an interstellar Gateway. You feel the trepidation that Rob and Karla had and all the Prospectors when their training was done and it was time for them to venture in to the unknown. Rob's timid and fearful thoughts ring through resoundingly, and at the same time you feel the strong feelings of love and affection that slowly grew in him. Karla's feelings and emotions are all too real and come off as though it were something that you or I could feel any given day. The sci fi feeling of ships coming and going into the unknown adds to the feeling of loneliness and fear.What I don't understand though is why half the chapters (not half the book since these chapters were invariably smaller) were all of Rob with a therapist. I understand that this is supposed to reveal Rob's inner feelings as well as some of the more intricate parts of the plot, but in the end it seemed to be a filler most of the time and then every once in a while it would reveal something deeper and more meaningful to the story. I mean, do we really need to see a Freudian analysis of why Rob misses his mother and yearns for gay sex because that is what he associates with his mother? No, and it didn't add anything. But it was there nonetheless.Ultimately the book was rather anticlimactic. It just trudged along and then, well, it just ended with nothing really happening. Life goes on and so does the story. I was hoping for more and at times I found it, but just as many times I found that I was disappointed. I do notice the trend of these earlier Hugo and Nebula award winners, that they all create a story with very little to no sci fi, using the sci fi as a backdrop to the story usually. A tentative recommend.3 stars."},{"Title":"Gateway","review":"If you like sci-fi with a little psychology mixed in, then this is the book your you. This is an excellent and quick read. This was one of the most satisfying books I have read in a really really long time. I really liked the interaction between Robinette (main character) and is AI psychotherapist (Sigfrid). The other part of the story is about his actual exploration of space via 'Heechee' technology which humans discover but don't fully understand. This is a very unique and very intriguing story of exploration of both outter space and human nature. I really cannot recommend this book enough."},{"Title":"Gateway","review":"Isn't that what you want from a novel? A year later I still think about it. Yes, the psychotherapy sections seem a little slow. It helps if you've ever had any therapy, and are used to the rhythms of it. But it has a great ending (which you need the therapy sections to set up), and I keep thinking about the ideas of probability and risk and their effect on human behavior."},{"Title":"Gateway","review":"This science fiction work was awarded both the Hugo and Nebula Awards in 1978. Apart from its abbreviated length, I found it be well deserving of the awards. The novella is set in the somewhat distant future, in which the Earth, with a population of 25 million souls is suffering from food shortages and converts hydrocarbons not into energy, but into food. Picture a \\"Soylent Green\\" society. To alleviate overcrowding, colonies have been founded on Mars, Venus and Luna.While establishing the underground Venus colony, the remnants of a previous civilization are discovered. A \\"prospector\\" finds a self guided alien spacecraft which transports him to Gateway, some type of alien way station at which hundreds of self guided alien ships are stored. The story revolves around life at Gateway and the process of using the alien (Heechee) ships (they are capable of interstellar travel) to explore the galaxy. The pilots of these one, three and five man ships are compensated based upon the importance of their discoveries. Each trip contains a very high likelihood of mortality, but the rewards are great.The story is told through a Gateway \\"prospector\\" named Robinette Broadhead, a former food miner who has earned his way to Gateway through a lottery. The chapters alternate between his \\"current\\" psychiatric sessions and flashbacks to his time on Gateway.The premise of the story is excellent and the story is well developed. The chapters dealing with the psychiatric sessions are not nearly as entertaining however, and almost amount to filler. This brings us to the length of the work. At 275 pages, the book is relatively short to begin with, however, fully 60+ pages are comprised of \\"exhibits\\" which are interspersed throughout the story. These exhibits take the form of Gateway bulletin board postings, pages from what appears to be a Gateway orientation manual, and various trip reports and scientific findings. Many of these are largely filler, the remainder deserve only cursory attention. In addition, there are roughly thirty chapters, each of which begin and end in the middle of a page. You are left with what is actually a book with 150-175 pages of text. Throw out the psychiatric sessions and you are largely left with what could easily be compressed into a lengthy short story. The book can be read in its entirety in 5-6 hours.There are several sequels to Gateway and I will possibly follow up the story, but suspect that two or three could have been combined into one standard length science fiction novel."},{"Title":"Gateway","review":"My dad gave me this book several years ago saying it was one of his childhood favorites. I was so bored by the first few pages that it took me a while to start reading it. Since then I have read it three times.The only flaw i found in this book was the overuse of the psychology, but Gateway without Sigfrid? impossible. The psych portion of this book makes up the setting, the foreshadowing, the conclusion, the everything. I only felt that a few of the Sigfrid chapters (maybe one or two) were unnecessary or too long. By the time i read it the third time i found myself skipping over these.I heard one reviewer say that the use of present and past gives the book no suspense. Frederik Pohl in this book used what most people like to call foreshadowing, which is a literary device that has been used since the dawn of... literature. It is so expertly done i believe, that it only increases the suspense. I found that after reading it for the third time in under a year, i still felt tingles down my spine whenever Bob \\"shipped out.\\"Many said that this review is dated 30 years (to be exact actually, no one said anything but 30), but it isnt. They are lying. The end. If you do decide that they are right, and im wrong, as they actually established evidence (however flawed i may believe it to be), then so be it, but what the book lacks in new age science it makes up for in new age writing. This isnt one of those space opera formulas, this is something different, more unique than even Hyperion or anything Asimov has put together (that i've read).If you want to dwell more on the heechee universe, use your imagination, or reread Gateway, but dont read the sequels Although they do have some interesting parts, they are far too predictable, unlike this much more unconventional novel."},{"Title":"Gateway","review":"this is a disappointing read: here is a new idea (the mysterious hechee artifact) turned into a muddled story with questionable motivation (guilt-in-your-face) and terrible structure (alternating flashbacks and current time--so there is no suspence, you see). Characters are what saves this books from taking one star."},{"Title":"Gateway","review":"From the mold of early Heinlein, Clark, and Asimov, Pohl is a science fiction reader's writer. While weaving a fantastic work of fiction he keeps readers' minds alert with a healthy dose of edgy science."},{"Title":"Gateway","review":"Pohl's first entry in the Heechee series is really two books in one: a space adventure about pioneers exploring the universe and a tongue-in-cheek look at artificial intelligence through a Freudian prism.\\"Gateway\\" alternates between two storylines. Robinette (Bob) Broadhead, a young man drudging away in an underground food mine on Earth, wins a lottery and uses his earnings to travel to Gateway, a portal that was constructed and abandoned by an unknown species and that contains hundreds of modules which transport voyagers to predetermined locations throughout the universe. Adventurers are paid immense royalties by the Gateway Corporation for any scientific discoveries and for booty, but there are two hitches: nobody has ever been able to figure out in advance the destination for each module and a rather significant proportion of the explorers either return dead or are never seen again.Pohl ably depicts the claustrophobia of the Gateway colony and of space travel, and he convincingly imagines the fear and excitement that precedes each journey. Once our hero arrives at Gateway, however, he finds himself thwarted far more by his fear of dying than motivated by the desire for glory and fortune; after his training he proves a reluctant pioneer. The accurate and realistic portrayal of this inertia is simultaneously one of the novel's strengths and its downside, since the reader all but experiences Bob's indolence while he gets up enough nerve to set out on a trip: \\"Most days we simply spent deferring decisions.\\" Living and working in space can be quite tedious.Between Bob's recollections of his life in Gateway are transcripts of his conversations, years later, with Sigfrid, a computer/robot who serves as his A.I. shrink. We soon realize that Bob was the only survivor of one of his exploratory missions, and Sigfrid teases out Bob's feelings of guilt while we concurrently learn the details of his past. At its best, these conversations are vaguely reminiscent of Stanislaw Lem's psychological fiction (although nowhere near as cerebral), and Pohl's idiosyncratic sense of humor make many of these sessions fun reading.These two \\"before and after\\" strands twist and twine their cords to an ending that wraps up all the loose ends, explains the mystery of the doomed expedition, and satisfactorily connects both stories. (Perhaps too satisfactorily: the final bit of dialogue between Bob and Sigfrid almost has the feel of a punch line of a shaggy-dog tale written for psychotherapists.) Pohl's wit and his knack for realism ultimately carry the story of these daring--if suicidally inclined--fortune-hunters to other worlds."},{"Title":"Gateway","review":"Perhaps it's the extensive psychotherapy that turns people off, but I found Gateway to be one of the most moving pieces of sci-fi I have ever read, second to Stranger in a Strange Land. Gateway came about 15 years later, and the 70s were a fantastic time for the genre, in my opinion. Your mileage may vary, but I think it's important that you know where I'm coming from as a reader.At any rate, I was engrossed by the humanity, or vulnerability, of the characters in this book. It's not something you see very often in the genre. While characters in an Asimov or Clarke novel (God love them) may only serve to move the plot, Pohl lets the plot move around them; the central conflict is within. So this may actually turn off the escapist reader.But this is still firmly science fiction, as it explores speculative ideas as a necessary part of the story. Nothing today can approximate the Gateway space station; only on a smaller scale, at best. It's a story of desperation that also carries science fiction's famous \\"sense of wonder.\\" It's something every star gazer has felt, and Pohl nails it.Unfortunately, he isn't as adept in psychiatry as he is spinning yarns, and the sections with Bob talking to his therapist feel slightly dull compared to the sharpness of Gateway station and its occupants. But only by comparison. It's also one of the few books I've ever re-read."},{"Title":"Gateway","review":"Read this years ago, haven't forgotten a word. Astounded that nobody's made a movie of it -- can't think of a more cinematic novel. Because of its odd structure and unexpected humor, some might think it just plain strange -- but rarely has the intensity ratcheted up, for me, as highly as in this one book.Only caveat is this, and let me be absolutely clear:Do. Not. Read. The. Sequels."},{"Title":"Gateway","review":"The premise of Gateway is simple enough - humankind has discovered a space station abandoned 500 000 years ago by a technologically superior race (the \\"Heechee\\"). Part of the station's equipment is a group of space shuttles with faster-than-light drives. The shuttles have a capacity of 1 to 5 humans. No one can figure out most of the technology in them, but through trial and error, they learn that if a certain panel glows a certain intensity, the ship will make a round trip to.... somewhere. The truly adventurous (or desperate) sign up to ride the vessels out and back and see if they go anywhere of use (i.e. an old Heechee colony that contains some more of the wonderful Heechee artfacts/technology). Of course, because nothing is known of the destination, and because the Heechee were known to be scientists, sometimes the destinations are close to black holes, inside recent supernovae (that were stars 500 000 years ago), or the trip is too long for the occupants' food/water supplies.The central character is Bob Broadhead, a poor miner who won enough money in a lottery for a ticket to Gateway. Unfortunately for him, he's a self-professed coward - afraid to go back to the mines, yet afraid to try his luck in the Heechee ships. It turns out that the story is more of a character study - we first meet Broadhead in his psychiatrist's office, where he's fabulously wealthy after three trips in the Heechee ships, but with deep emotional problems. The story intercuts between therapy sessions and a first-person account of the actual events leading up to his fame and pychosis.The strength of the book is the way it maintains suspense and interest - we know what is going to happen to Broadhead, but not how, and not the fates of his friends and associates. It is well established that many flights are \\"successful\\" only in the fact that at least one of the crew returns alive. The therapy sessions and the story narrative are effortlessly intertwined and build up a rich weave of narrative that is difficult to put down.The future world is plausible, and written in a fashion where little is explained explicitly, but where the reader can fully understand based on context. There is very little science because the inner workings of the Heechee artifacts are not understood. The book's weakness is, in fact, its attempts to explain some of the technologies (the explanations of Heechee \\"metal\\" are laughable). However, this is a fully realised futuristic society, self-contained and a logical extension of pre-AIDS sexual mores... That the psychoanalysis is almost excusively Freudian is forgivable because it fits perfectly well with the attitudes and morals of the society.It is the first book of a series, although completely self-contained. It piqued my interest enough that I will be on the lookout for the second book in the series, and is a worthy dounle-winner of science fiction's top prizes, the Hugo and Nebula."},{"Title":"Gateway","review":"Wow. I just finished this book the other day. Unlike what other people have said Pohl is surely a master of his art. This is what I'd consider Hard Core Science Fiction, much like that of Asimov. The story is written in a great fashion, from the past to future, but never leaves you completely in the dark as to what's going on. I have yet to read the rest of the series, but this is the true meaning to superior science fiction. It was all worth the last line (now THAT'S how you end a book!) I wish I could give more stars."},{"Title":"Gateway","review":"Although the character of Robinette Broadhead is expertly handled and the frame narrative adds to the suspense, I think the real reason this is one of the greatest sf novels of all time lies in the world Pohl has created. He has taken a silly idea, something you'd expect to find in a pre-Campbell pulp or a Silver Age comic book, and made it perfectly plausible. Imagine how it would have been done then: people discover a mysterious box and find that when you enter you will either die or become rich. It's a cool idea, and a great setup for a story, but it's also terminally silly. Pohl has taken this clumsy deus ex machina box and opened it for us, so that the roulette wheel of Gateway makes perfect sense, and both the risk and the reward become logical, even necessary, extensions of the place. My one complaint: Pohl is too addicted to the practice of ending each chapter with a clever sentence."},{"Title":"Gateway","review":"This book has some merits. Pohl paints a convincing miners' world by giving us a sense of its grit and stench. The lives of the miners are also handled well. The cramped seediness of their environment stunts their souls and this is crafted both believably and professionally. And, in spite of portraying Twenty-Third (?) century scientists as being unrealistically dense, the mystery of the Heechee is equal to any other creation in science fiction.However, for all its strengths, this book didn't engage me. I found the angst of the main character both affected and contrived. And while his emotional self-flagellation was not central to the workings of the story, it kept distracting me from the more important elements. Consequently, I couldn't enjoy the story because of my resentment towards the book's heavy-handed artifice.In this book, Pohl is so intent on teasing a multi-dimensional character out of a uni-dimensional kernel that he overindulges in Freudian excess. The main character is a parody of psychological trauma. His self-consuming guilt is advertised to the reader with all the subtlety of a highway billboard. Just as blatantly, our hero goes through unbelievable mental contortions to evade his real feelings. What we get is not a characterization we can identify with, but a painfully simplistic parody of an emotional breakdown. If despair and survivor guilt were really this superficial, psychiatrists would all be out of work.Many readers unused to science fiction complain about the genre's tendency towards simple characters. This book illustrates why simple characters in the service of a good story are preferable to &quot;complex&quot; characters purchased with pretension. Grandmasters like Clarke, Asimov and Heinlein rarely created multifaceted or engaging characters. Yet some of these works proved to be classics because characterization was unimportant to the story. Here, a great story is felled by a misguided attempt to inject &quot;dimension&quot; into the hero when a simpler hero would have allowed the complexity of his world to take centre stage.If you can get past the Hollywood angst, this book is actually a pretty good read with interesting ideas, settings and storyline. But it could have passed from &quot;good&quot; to &quot;great&quot;, and it's a shame that its excesses prevent it from achieving something grander."},{"Title":"Gateway","review":"Gateway by Frederik Pohl is a simple story about a complex man that takes place in a setting that lends itself to a myriad of adventures both enriching and terrifying...usually the latter. In the case of down and out Robinette Broadhead it leads him to roll the dice on living the life of a \\"prospector\\" in space, and leads him to a mission that results in a life of opulent wealth, as well as soul wrenching guilt.The book begins with Robinette (Bob) undergoing psychoanalysis under the care of an artificial intelligence that he not so fondly refers to as \\"Sigfrid von Shrink.\\" Bob is wealthy, and happy...or so he keeps telling himself, but Sigfrid doesn't believe him. Deep down in his soul Bob doesn't believe himself.Bob begins reliving his story and the circumstances that led to sitting on a mat in a skyscraper talking to an AI about his problems. As a young man Bob worked as a shale miner in Wyoming, the same occupation his mother and father held. It's a dismal existence, but the only one they know. He lives much of his life underground in dirty, miserable conditions with little hope of a different future. His father died in a mine accident when he was very young. He then developed a psychological problem and was put away for a year. During this time his mother also died. He returned to work in the shale mines, with an even more bleak future staring back at him in the hot, deadly tunnels.Then Bob won a lottery. $250,000. Not a lot, but enough to live well for a short time, or enough to buy a one way ticket to Gateway to become what he'd always dreamed of being...a \\"prospector.\\"Gateway is an enigma to humanity. It's a hallowed out asteroid that holds approximately 1000 small ships left behind by a race called the Heechee. No one knows why they left, where they went, or why they left behind all the ships. (Note: The Heechee are explained in a later sequel, but there's no requirement to read later novels to fully enjoy this one!) The Gateway Corporation was established, and it was soon discovered that all of the ships were pre-programmed to destinations somewhere in the galaxy...but one didn't know the destination until one locked themselves in a ship and hit the launch button. The ships used an autopilot system to navigate, would debark to a destination and (sometimes) return to Gateway. Trips took weeks or months...sometimes years (resulting in starvation obviously) depending on the ship taken. Whatever was discovered on the other end entitled the pilot(s) to a cut from the Gateway Corporation. The people who rolled the dice on Gateway are called \\"prospectors.\\" Prospectors either died or never returned or became wealthy from their exploration of the galaxy. Death was the predominant result. Future uncertain indeed.Would any of us make the choice to strap ourselves in to an alien ship not knowing where it would take us, or how long we would be gone? How do you physically prepare for that other than stockpiling as many supplies in to the small ship as could possibly fit? How do you mentally prepare for such a journey other than to assume you are going to die? This was usually the mindset Bob had, and the theme that a person can become lost and desperate enough to even contemplate making that decision runs throughout the book. But when the ship arrives at its destination and crews realize that they have enough food/oxygen to return home...the exuberance and welling of life coming from the characters is almost palpable.This is the path Bob Broadhead chose, because he felt it was better than the one he left. Gateway is also a place where Bob seemingly beat the odds to survive and become incredibly wealthy. We know the endgame on the the first page of the book. But we don't know the journey to that endgame until we read the last page.Gateway alternates chapters between Bob being psychoanalyzed and flashbacks to Gateway. The plot threads meet up at the and and we learn what happened to Bob and why he's paying for a shrink. The novel is sprinkled throughout with multi-genre elements such as lines of code from Sigfrid, classified ads on Gateway, mission reports, contract summaries, and the like. These add an exceptional flavor and background to the story without unnecessary and bloated narrative.The tale that Pohl weaves is mysterious, adventurous, and tragic. The very ending itself (if one has rudimentary understanding of astrophysics) is chilling and depressing. Towards the end of Gateway the reader can begin to understand why Bob is undergoing psychoanalysis and is so angry.I've always believed that Gateway would make an amazing movie given the right script treatment. But as far as I know it has not been optioned by any studio. This is a shame. It possesses all the elements that would make for a mind blowing science fiction drama. But alas, Hollywood is too busy recycling and rebooting to see potential.Gateway is Frederik Pohl's greatest work, and stands as one of the best science fiction novels I've read over the years. The book isn't the length of modern science fiction novels (my version weighs in at 313 pages), and it seems to be forgotten by many, and unknown by even more. Gateway won numerous awards when it was published: Hugo, Nebula, Locus, and John W. Campbell awards for best science fiction novel. To my knowledge no other book has won all four of these awards...it's also one of a few that actually deserves them.Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Gateway","review":"Gateway is the first book in Pohl's wonderful Heechee Saga. It details the adventures of Robinette Broadhead, told in flashback. In the beginning of the book we learn that Broadhead had struck it rich, but do not know why. We learn his past through a series of therapy sessions with his psychologist (in the present), and through a telling of events in the past. Broadhead is a successful gateway prospector. Not too long ago in the story's history, humans stumbled upon the remnants of technology possessed by an advanced race. One of these prized artifacts was a huge spacestation with a nest of thousands of ships. This spacestation was termed Gateway, as these ships were found to have preprogrammed destinations. Unfortunately, humankind has not found out how to change the course of the ships, only to be led to their preprogrammed destination, and back. The problem was, the ancient race (termed the 'Heechee') had left for nearly half a million years, so some of these destinations became disaster areas, such as nearby a star that had undergone a supernova. Thus the adventure was on. Those who could afford the trip to gateway risked their lives on board these Heechee ships. If something of scientific value (such as more Heechee technology) was found at a destination, a bonus was given to the lucky prospector. More people died than strike it rich however... The last 30 pages or so is hard to put down as the story comes to a climax. Broadhead is one of the lucky people to strike it rich. But how? Read and find out!"},{"Title":"Gateway","review":"This book started out with a neat premise: an ancient alien civilization has left a few traces behind in our solar system, including a tunnel-filled asteroid with a thousand faster-than-light rockets attached. The rockets hold one, three or five humans and though they have a navigation system no human can figure it out. People can ship up to the asteroid, board a rocket and launch themselves randomly into space. It's entirely a crapshoot where the voyagers end up - some ships come back with a happy crew and a ship full of pricy alien artifacts (so they go home rich), and others come back mangled and destroyed (or not at all).The climax was a pretty solid idea, too. I found it extremely chilling, and the way the ending played out was suspenseful enough. Pohl managed to make his statement heard.But I have a number of problems with the vision of future human technology (notably, they send people to their death instead of just placing a recording device in the rockets to make sure they'd come back safely...) The entire business with the psychologist computer (Sigfrid) struck me as very hokey, and the main character REALLY bothered me during these sequences. He spends practically the entire book pretending as though he doesn't have anything he wants to talk about, and won't discuss anything from his past. But why would he bother with therapy if he was so opposed to actually getting any therapy done? And there was some kind of subplot that was meant to explain his latent homosexuality, but that came way out of left field for anybody reading. I didn't find the psychology believable AT ALL.In the end I think this entire story could have been reduced to a nice novella or even a short story: put the introduction, a little bit about the characters, then hit us with the ending and leave everyone thinking. Even for such a short novel it felt too long - there were little excerpts of 'Gateway classified ads' and also some transcripts of a professor educating potential prospectors about the dangers of the galaxy, but they did nothing for me except to interrupt the flow of the book."},{"Title":"Gateway","review":"This was a great book with an intriguing plot with the exception of the parts with the psychologist.

I can't describe why, but...if you like scifi you'll love this!"},{"Title":"Gateway","review":"I had really looked forward to reading this book, as it has been built up as such a classic of the genre. And the premise seemed exremely intriguing. But once I started reading, I found that I had to force myself to trudge through it. I did not identify with the main character. Seems like Pohl was trying really hard to create a deep character, but it seemed contrived and phony to me. And it was just boring. I didn't care about the protagonist, and just kept wanting it to get to the parts where they would go on missions. Then when they went on missions, it was still boring and disappointing.I really wanted to enjoy this book, but maybe that was part of the problem. Perhaps it was too hyped up in my mind before I started."},{"Title":"Gateway","review":"Yeah, a good book and an interesting read since the reason why the character became so rich keeps you turning the pages. But steady on, because right now we are on the brink of the 21st Century and reading this is like watching an old black and white Flash Gordon series. It's science fiction, yes, but its hopelessly outdated now. You can't help but smile at some of the old concepts being bandied around in this book, such as Freudian analysis and the description of the plastic robot psychologist. I found the whole basis of the book to be flawed and typical of science fiction from the 50's to the 80's i.e stary eyed characters without a hint of true human maliciousness which has dominated our species for centuries and also wide sweeping comments concerning space travel which simply havent stood the test of time for the modern reader. A classic? Lets just say it sums up the whole of science fiction literature before the words 'digital' and 'nanotech&quot; and 'virtual' became household words even for children. A classic to be compared with Dickens or Tolstoy? No. However, save yourself 30 years of sci-fi literature from 1950-1980 (with the possible exception of 2001) and read it and smile."},{"Title":"Gateway","review":"This book is truly a science fiction classic.

Yes, it's that good in my opinion. And quite frankly it devasted me. If you like your SF with emotion, feeling and fully 3 dimensionally characters, You will love this book. It will break your heart. Pohl leads you up to a point where you think things will be OK, then leads you careening over the edge. It really hit me hard, emotionally. Some people would say that this is melodrama, but I don't think so."},{"Title":"Gateway","review":"Gateway (1977) is the first SF novel in the Heechee Saga. The Heechee are long gone, but they have left a Gateway on an inclined orbit that reaches inside the perihelion of Mercury and outside the orbit of Venus. An asteroid or the nucleus of a comet, Gateway is a space station that contained nearly a thousand little FTL ships shaped something like a mushroom. These ships were all programmed for a large variety of destinations.Every since its discovery, prospectors have been flying the ships out to unknown destinations. Sometimes they come back with news of another uninteresting location, sometimes they come back with only dead bodies on board, and sometimes they don't come back at all. However, every now and then they come back with news of a great treasure of artifacts or data; then everybody on the flight scored big.In this novel, Robinette Broadhead has been a prospector on Gateway and is one to the big winners. He has crewed on several relatively low payoff flights before he comes back from a twin ship mission as the only survivor. The survivor total mission bonus plus the science bonus nets him over eighteen million dollars, which he then parlays even higher with his investments. However, he is having bad dreams.Much of the novel consists of Broadhead's conversation with his computerized therapist, which he calls Sigfrid von Shrink, interspersed with his memories of Gateway and the flights that he has taken in the Heechee ships. Every now and then there are inserts of pieces of Sigfrid's program, Gateway brochures, payment statements, and other documents. The plot moves slowly, but the suspense builds also. However, this is not a story for anyone who wants a lot of action; Broadhead is less often doing than done to.This was an engrossing story of adventure, romance, and suffering. This series is probably the best known of the author's works, although some his other tales are probably better written. Some of the sequels in the series are even better than this novel.Recommended for Pohl fans and anyone else who enjoys well written tales of relationships amidst the minutia of budgets and bureaucrats leavened with moments of terror in a high tech environment.-Arthur W. Jordin"},{"Title":"Gateway","review":"One of the best books for sci fi.. I loved it.. After seeing so many uncreative movies lately, I wish they would make this into one.."},{"Title":"Gateway","review":"Gateway proceeds under constant heavy plot acceleration, maintains an unflinching visceral realism concerning near-future space travel, diminishing food resources, overpopulation, and stratification of wealth, plumbs very uncomfortable psychoanalytic depths, and succeeds in concluding a compelling narrative zipper. It is an excellent primer to the twenty first century. This reviewer finds it equal in magnitude to EON and Enders' Game."},{"Title":"Gateway","review":"This is one of the best hard science novels , highly recommended. The rest of the series is excellent. Actually the Heechee are referenced in some of the earlier works."},{"Title":"Gateway","review":"My rating of Gateway is relative to what I think are true sci-fi classics: Dune, Foundation, Snow Queen, Hyperion, etc. For Gateway to qualify in my book as a winner it must have qualities of Hugo winners: character depth&amp;development, grand themes, innovative science, a compelling epic tale, and MOST OF ALL good writing. Gateway lacks all of that.The story weaves you through the present and past to tell you of a story of a man who hit it big discovering some ancient Heechee artifact. Gateway gives you computer psychologists, people stuck in a singularity for eternity, coal miners in Mars, etc; It all seems fascinating. Its just not cohesive.Overall, Gateway is rather dull. The elements and ideas are good, but the exposition was just too dry for my tastes. The pace of the story is slow and Pohl decribes very little of the alien environs, and even less in human emotions. The main character seemed very one-dimensional. He didn't seem guilty enough, curious enough, or greedy enough to carry the reader through. It all seemed like a very rough draft or a short story from Analog magazine as opposed to a real novel."},{"Title":"Gateway","review":"This book is your basic teen fare from the '70s. Outer space is a place with lots of sex (alas, presented in a manner with little entertainment value), occasional pot, a Corporation that runs things, a detached and jaded narrator, and plenty of pop psychology.

The pyschotherapy sessions that filled up every other chapter were just a waste.

Coping badly with no resolution."},{"Title":"Gateway","review":"This is an awesome book. The plot is original and keeps you in suspense.

There was already a computer game, several years ago.As for the sequels, there's a reason the second book's out of print.

While I would not call this a work of meta-fiction exactly, there are elements which can be compared to Postmodernism. First, it is a Science Fiction novel that really goes nowhere. Imagine placing the exploits of Broadhead, a sexually frustrated and psychologically problematic character, and place him in the role of hero. Pohl does exactly that, gives the reader a hero who does nothing, isn't really much of anything (doesn't want to go on any adventures!), and when he does, ends up nowhere, untill the very end of the book. This is the anti-Science Fiction I'm talking about. 'Gateway' is the antethesis of the mainstream contemporary Science Fiction novel. In someways it even mimics works like Raymond Federman's (To Whom It May Concern, Double Or Nothing),without as said before, being Postmodern, and yet plays on the not! ion of creating a Science Fiction story that does not operate like a Science Fiction story. Yet, due to the apprehensions of Broadhead, and all of his psychosis, he ends up more real than many characters who are of the Bewulf characterizatiions often found in many recent long drawn out epiosodic Science fiction and Fantasy novels. While I have nothing against these types of novels, and have enjoyed many before, I personally like the tact Pohl used for this novel. Very clever."},{"Title":"Gateway","review":"Most of the reviews for this novel seem to be 9s and 10s. Well, offering further proof that tastes differ, I found this book to be a mediocre 5. The world the author created wasn't terribly interesting, the lead character became tiresome by the middle of the story, and the sense of suspense the author tried to create wasn't justified by the ending. An OK read, but only if you're facing a long flight and don't have a better SF novel in your briefcase."},{"Title":"Gateway","review":"It takes you away with the first page till the last one.The story is tiled in such a way that you want to go to thenext chapter wishing not to be the last one !The human protagonist Robinette is introduced with periodicalflashbacks but in a consistent and fluctuant fashion.I began to read in the morning and when finished ran to thebookstore to buy the second of the trilogy:&quot;Beyond the Blue Event Horizon&quot;...and read it non-stop till 4:00am !!!You may read my review for the second book here too..Now looking forward for the third book to be translated inmy native language:&quot;Heechee Rendezvous&quot;"},{"Title":"Gateway","review":"Despite the fascinating premise, this story in my opinion emphasizes and focuses on all of the wrong things. Instead of creating a colorful, vivid, compelling narrative of a protoganist in a possible suicide mission, Pohl instead has the protaganist Bob Broadhead as an weak coward who spends much of the book shying away from going on the missions. That or he's having sex with his girlfriend (and then spending the therapy sessions lamenting about his lost love SIXTEEN YEARS AGO). It's a shame because if Pohl had just focused more on the mission aspect and incredible HeeChee inventions and minerals discovered, this book could have been truly a mind-blowing experience. The missions in which bob went on were never really elaborated all that much and for the most part seemed skimmed over, when what could have happened is that Bob could've faced those dire situations in which food rations are running low and everybody is going crazy on the ship because they think they're going to die. Not only would it have made the book much more suspenseful, it would've placed the character in a much more interesting, tense situations.With that said, the book does hit on some strong points. The build-up for the first third of the book is well-done, especially when Bob is new to the space station and he watches a battered spaceship come in and body parts are splattered all over the place or the little \\"files\\" unrelated to the story serve as a nice backdrop that adds more details (but are ultimately not very necessary and could be distracting for some people). Pohl tries very hard to create some very deep characters, which is a nice change of pace after reading the \\"Mote in God's Eye\\" where most of the characters seem like wooden cardboard cutouts. Bob articulates some his thoughts/insecurities extremely well, and I really enjoyed the sessions with the Freudian computer (a very realistic portrayal of computer + man interacting in deep, meaningful ways while confronting the interpersonal tensions). Sadly, I found myself trying to skip ahead to the therapy sessions over the mainstory because the main story seemed to drag on way too long, and when a side story starts to dominate the main one, that's not a very good sign.In conclusion: Had so much potential, but doesn't live up to the intriquing premise set up."},{"Title":"Gateway","review":"I was captivated by the mystery of the heechee and the how Robinette made his fortune and neither was revealed to my satisfaction in this rather short novel.

Good work Pohl!"},{"Title":"Gateway","review":"Gateway as an example of how good scifi can be when it carries a political/sociological edge.

Having just finished one of Pohl's other books (The Voices of Heaven - which I give 3stars), this was certainly a much more engaging story. I have to admit the protagonist started to wear on me though. He came across as a little too pathetic. I also don't consider myself to be someone who needs constant action in a story, but I'm finding Pohl's style to be lacking the action just a bit too much. That said, I still enjoyed the book and am perhaps most disappointed in seeing that others say the other books in the series are all down hill."},{"Title":"Gateway","review":"Great book. Some of the concepts are a bit dated, but overall a fun, quick read. If someone hadn't wrecked the ending for me, I would probably have given it 5 stars."},{"Title":"Gateway","review":"Bob Broadhead toils away at a boring labor job with little hope of anything better. When he wins the lottery, the prize money is enough for one-way passage to the asteroid Gateway. Its main attraction is a long-abandoned Heechee spaceport. The Heechee are long gone, but have left behind nearly a thousand spacecraft. Most can be made to work by twisting a few dials and pushing the launch button. But nobody knows how to control where they go. Bob joins the pool of prospectors who risk such trips, hoping to find high tech artifacts or new worlds.The story is told as a series of therapy sessions between Bob and an artificial intelligence therapy program, alternating with flashbacks to Bob's earlier life and his three prospecting missions. The therapy discussions are sometimes painful and \\"Sigfrid\\" the therapist is both persistent and subtle. Even though his presence in therapy makes it clear that Bob survived all three missions, there are still surprises, puzzles, and interpersonal tensions. Although this is a complete story on its own, Bob's life story continues inBeyond the Blue Event Horizon,Heechee Rendezvous, andThe Annals of the Heechee.This is an enjoyable story and worthy of its good reputation as a science fiction classic. It has an early Heinlein feel to it. Some of this comes from the institutional setting of the Gatway asteroid and the corporation that runs it. Some comes from Bob's difficulties understanding women. At least Bob--unlike a number of Heinlein characters-- knows that he has issues and looks for help to deal with them.It's a good read. And a good listen as an audio book. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Gateway","review":"Fred Pohl is, without any argument, one of the half-dozen most important, most creative, most productive, most readable science fiction authors since World War II -- though he was editing pulps even before that. The man is over 90 now, and still working. But at the time of its publication, he said himself that he thought Gateway was his best work to date. Everyone else agreed, and he won not only the Hugo and the Nebula, but also the Campbell Award. (Later, he even won the National Book Award for Jem -- a rare feat for an sf novel.) And why is this such a great book? Because you can't read a single page of it without coming across a new idea in speculative science, or a new, mind-blowing comment about what we might find in our future, or a new insight in human psychology. The set-up is really very simple: When we, who live on the overcrowded, starving Earth, first make it to Venus, we discover underground constructions of thoroughly alien origin, and with alien artifacts, some of which can be understood sufficiently to be replicated and integrated into our own technology. But no aliens themselves (the discoverers call them \\"Heechee\\" for lack of a better name); they've been gone a very long time. But most important, there are also ships, with what turn out to be pre-programmed courses embedded in their mysterious innards. And that leads to the discovery of Gateway, a converted asteroid or comet-heart, in ecliptic orbit. And Gateway is Grand Central Station when it comes to alien FTL ships. But since no one knows how to read any of the controls, or how to change them successfully, anybody venturing out in one faces long odds against returning. And many don't. Some ships never come back, or they return with deceased prospectors in them. But, of course, people keep trying. Because, every so often, a successful visit to (and return from) a particular ship's unknown destination will result in incredible discoveries and enormous wealth for the lucky prospector, via the international cartel that now manages Gateway. At this point, we meet Robin Broadhead, escapee from a dreary life in the Wyoming food mines via a lottery ticket that gets him to Gateway as a potential adventurer. If he can only overcome his paralyzing fear of launching himself into the unknown. But because the narrative shifts from Robin's past on Gateway, trying to balance his fear against his diminishing capital (you can't stay there after your air-tax has run out, you understand) to his present, a couple of decades later on Earth as a tycoon, we know he managed it, that he struck it rich. And we also discover, through his sessions with an automated psychoanalyst, just what that luck has cost him. And it's his last, only partly successful trip as part of an experimental pairing of two five-man Heechee ships, that the whole story is leading up to, and which has defined the rest of his life, because it meant the semi-death of the woman he had come to love (as well as the rest of the crew). Robin is a very well-developed character, as are all the supporting characters, even those who don't get a lot of stage time. Pohl makes the reader care about what happens to them. And he makes some of us wish we were living in that future, with all its problems, just because it's so fascinating. His writing is moving and the plot is gripping. It's a book to be re-read and enjoyed anew every decade or so."},{"Title":"Gateway","review":"This is by far my favorite book from Pohl. His writing style clearly describes the characters, their actions and the storyline. It was hard to put down each day but I guess I had to get some sleep. I read this book three times since I first purchased it in the early 80s. Now, more recently, I went to see if it was available for the Kindle and I am disappointed to see it is not. I wanted to read this book again but I don't want to damage the book since it appears to be quite rare. If you have this book, good for you, if you don't but can find a copy at a reasonable price it is worth the purchase."},{"Title":"Gateway","review":"Bob Broadhead's regular sessions with his computerized psychoanalyst gradually reveal a powerful story in this science fiction novel from Frederick Pohl. In the story's present, Bob is wealthy, confrontational and guilt-ridden. The reason for his personal issues is firmly rooted in his past, which is only very slowly uncovered in a series of long flashbacks.The protagonist (don't call him a hero) is lucky enough to escape the miserable circumstances of this youth and unhesitatingly takes the opportunity to go to the coveted Gateway to try his luck as a \\"prospector\\". The Gateway is a hollowed out asteroid in space that holds the only known means of interstellar travel. The mysterious and inexplicably absent Heechees have converted this asteroid into a spaceship hangar complete with ships of a design that has confounded the understanding of human science. Nonetheless, intrepid \\"prospectors\\" undertake dangerous interstellar explorations in hopes of returning with extraterrestrial artifacts and information of incalculable value. Of course, no one is entirely fearless...While obviously a science fiction yarn, Pohl is clearly trying to write a psychological novel here: while delving into Broadhead's past, Pohl introduces a substantial love story as well as episodes referencing homosexuality and domestic violence, and ultimately, problems with cowardice and guilt. The setup was far too long, but the science fiction was very well done. As a psychological novel, it was less successful; readers who don't care for sci-fi will probably not find enough meat to satisfy. So yes, it was pretty heavy-handed, and yes, it seemed to take a long time getting anywhere, but this was still a darn fine piece of science fiction."},{"Title":"Gateway","review":"This book is a science fiction masterpiece that intriguingly inverts most of the conventions of science fiction. The hero, Bob Broadhead, is no tradional hero: he is dominated by emotions, mostly fear, greed, and guilt; his most redeeming quality is that he is honest about it. Human society in the future is not impressive either: it is bedevilled with overpopulation and food shortages, and its best chance comes not from human ingenuity but from the lucky discovery of artifacts left by a more advanced race, the Heechee.The ideas of luck and gambling (rather than prospering from hard work and brains) is pervasive: first Bob's big chance comes from winning the lottery, then he gets involved in a bigger lottery: volunteering for missions that may kill him or may make him rich. The final incident hedges on the uncertainty principle: Stephen Hawking's theory that given two particles on the boundary of a black hole, one will fall in and the other escape, and you can't predict which.I haven't seen much discussion of it, but the organization of the Gateway Corporation is intriguing. To keep any one nation or business from monopolizing the Heechee discovery, an international nonprofit agency runs the space program and relies on volunteers. The volunteers must hand over anything they find, but receive cash compensation for the discoveries, which may be millions of dollars. Pohl treats the corporation as ruthless (it takes no responsibility for the lives, safety or welfare of its volunteers) but seems to assume that it does not exploit its own monopoly. In this cynical age that may date the novel.(SPOILERS!)The one plot flaw is unfortunately the one on which the plot hinges. The corporation budgets to pay a 10-person crew for a special mission. When 9 of the 10 fail to return, the one survivor (Broadhead) gets all 10 crewmen's salaries, and without any suspicion of foul play! Broadhead himself is perceptive enough to realize that he benefitted off of 9 deaths, and is obsessed by guilt for the rest of his life. Pohl explained earlier in the novel that the corporation works that way, but it still seems contrived, and that's why I give the novel 4 stars instead of 5."},{"Title":"Gateway","review":"Despite some of the negative opinions on here, I think Pohl did a great job with this sci-fi piece. I think other people seem to underplay the romantic story in the midst of the two strands of narrative about the main character, Robinette Broadhead. How the novel is set up is switching in between Robinette recalling his past experience at Gateway and his current psychotherapy sessions with Sigfrid the computer. Along with the psychoanalysis tete-a-tete between Sigfrid and Robinette, Robinette's flashbacks (which comprise the other half of this novel), paint a vivid picture of the dangerous realities of Gateway. On there, Robinette meets some of the most important people in his lifetime, and his need for the current therapy sessions is due to the relationship with his then-girlfriend and what ensued between them, which you will find out near the very end of the novel. I thought the story was tragic, and it definitely depicts a very emotional cross-section of the human experience and the depth of human emotions such as pain, guilt, fear, etc.I understand where other people come from in not warmly embracing this story and reviewing it with mixed praise or critical remarks, but if you give it a chance, Pohl does a pretty good job of representing a facet of future humanity - and the tribulations of the human situation in an era of space exploration. If you can bear with Sigfrid and his sessions, you will find the deeper backstory that triggers the need for these heart to hearts, and see that Robinette is much like any ordinary person with a past relationship that is hard to get over. I guess the exception would be that his situation is unique due to the scientific elements that got in the way. So don't heed the critics too much and take an open-minded chance on this sci-fi thriller!"},{"Title":"Gateway","review":"Gateway is an alien treasure hunt story set in a claustrophobic, overcrowded future. The story begins with Rob. He is an ultimately successful prospector, one of the elite rich, undergoing psychotherapy for space exploration trauma. As a disadvantaged youth he left the mines of earth and voyaged to Gateway, an alien spaceport now adapted for humans as the embarkation point for looking for alien treasure.The process of looking for alien treasure is highly dangerous and has a high mortality rate. Not only are the expeditions very dangerous, but they are very uncomfortable. Those who are sent have no idea if they will return until they have reached their pre-programmed destination. But those who are successful receive huge rewards.Gateway reads like a long troubling nightmare. Pessimistic yet suspenseful, it is a fascinating speculative adventure and an incisive glimpse into the human psyche. Pohl's writing is clear and simple. The story is told in such a way that the language is almost unnoticed. Clearly he is a master of space adventure writing. The good news is that there are plenty of sequels!"},{"Title":"Gateway","review":"GATEWAY is generally considered one of the best science fiction novels of the 1970s. It won the Hugo, Nebula, Locus, and Campbell awards for best SF novel of 1977, one of the very few novels to win all four of these honors.I genuinely enjoyed this short book, mainly due to its high level of its originality. GATEWAY is one of those rare novels with a really ingenious story idea, one that is quite unique. Its plot goes in all sorts of directions that I could have never predicted. Pohl also dares to create a main character, Robinette Broadhead, who is both unlikable and indecisive. Much of this book is devoted to the Broadhead's inner conflicts and his repeated failure to take action. Broadhead isn't the least bit heroic, but comes across as a flesh-and-blood human being with recongizable flaws.GATEWAY doesn't contain much action, suspense, or hard science. Readers looking for space battles should look elsewhere. At its core, this novel is a satirical work that takes aim at unrestrained capitalism, psychoanalysis, and how the sexes relate to one another. Its highly enjoyable at this level, but the storytelling does lacks depth in certain areas. Nowhere is this more true than with the book's ending, which is both abrupt and unsatisfying.If you enjoy your SF with a heavy satirical edge, GATEWAY is a fine choice."},{"Title":"Gateway","review":"\\"Gateway\\" is a wonderful account of one man's journey that culminates into a riveting finale of science and psychology. \\"Gateway\\" received the Hugo award in 1978 and the Nebula award in 1977. Pohl crafts a tale of Bob Broadhead who wins the lottery and uses his winnings to escape his \\"blue-collar\\" laborer job to go to Gateway, where prospectors may choose missions that send to unknown parts of the galaxy in search of mysterious (and insanely valuable) artifacts from the lost Heechee civilization.The chapters alternate from Broadhead's time on Gateway to his time many years later with his holographic psychologist trying to help him with some buried issues resulting from his time on Gateway. By alternating between these two points in time Pohl grants an exciting tale that culminates to an explosive finale. Riddled throughout \\"Gateway\\" are documents and personal ads that are provided at Gateway or by Gateway personnel. These documents truly add a lot to understanding the mindset of the prospectors and how everyone has needs and wants, even in the height of death or riches.What is the price of riches? This tale will keep you wondering until the very end. If you like Science Fiction even a slight bit, then you should read this book immediately. It is no wonder that this book has been acclaimed by thousands and received such high awards.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Gateway","review":"You can argue that there are other SF novels from the 1970s equal in stature to Gateway but you can't place it on a lower tier. Certainly it is the most accessible great SF novel of the 1970s. Certainly it has a great ending, especially if you like irony. Certainly it is a great cautionary tale. But most certainly of all, it is the great SF movie waiting to be made, the Casablanca of science fiction, powerful, true, frustrating beyond endurance.Just don't film the sequels. Ugh."},{"Title":"Gateway","review":"&quot;Gateway&quot; tells the story of the ultimate futuristic gold rush. In the 21st century, an asteroid known as Gateway is discovered containing hundreds of ancient space ships, all of them with pre-programmed courses already set. The builders of the ships are referred to as Heechees, but very little is known of who they were, why they built the asteroid, or why the Heechee disappeared. Since no human knows how to steer the ships or predict the destinations, explorers have to get in the ships, activate the program, and then go where it takes them. Some discover vast wealth; many never return or come back dead because they have run out of food or air.Robinette Broadhead becomes a Gateway prospector as one of the few avenues of advancement open to a poor person on Earth. This book tells of his trips interspersed with his conversations with a computerized therapist.The setting is interesting, and the story is very effective. I would recommend this book highly.This is the opener of a series which suffers from what might be called the &quot;Dune&quot; Effect: a terrific first book, with diminishing returns in subsequent volumes. Pohl ultimately does resolve the mystery of the Heechees, along with other questions not introduced in this book; unfortunately the answers are less interesting than the questions, and the story loses momentum well before the end of the series. I would recommend the sequel, &quot;Beyond the Blue Event Horizon&quot;, but the final two volumes aren't up to snuff."},{"Title":"Gateway","review":"What I find most compelling about this wonderful SF novel is the way Pohl makes the FEAR so palpable. The protagonist is no super-human, which makes one able to relate to him. The SF novel that this reminds me most of with its ablilty to really make the reader relate to the protagonist is John steakley's Armor - without the happy ending superhuman sappiness trick to explain the ending. I also like Pohl's nice trick of providing key background information in a very unobtrusive way that negates the need for longwinded explanations with little bulletin board messages, snippets of robot pseudo-code, snippets of scientists' lectures, etc. to get such needed details across. If you like interesting SF ideas and a story with good character development that really draws you in, and you aren't turned off by &quot;what if&quot; questions about potential advanced alien civilizations - you can't go too far wrong here."},{"Title":"Gateway","review":"Gateway is memorable not so much for its characters but for the seed it stirs in the human imagination. At each possible destination could lie death or an exciting new discovery, and the only way to get there is by riding an alien ship that may not be able to get you home again.Interspersed with Bob Broadhead's reminiscences are pieces of lectures on the Heechee or their technology, speculations and ideas and questions raised by the situation. There are logs of missions that either failed or found nothing, and even a few that found something worth remembering. I remember finishing Gateway with a sense of wonder, thinking about all the possibilities and all the unanswered questions. In this respect Gateway's plot is almost secondary; the setting is what's most important.The characters are solid, believable, with realistic failures and regrets, but ultimately they've also got a faceless tinge. Broadhead remembers a place where a lot of friends died, a place where there's a certain facelessness to everyone who ships out because so many don't come back. I think his character is built around the premise that despite a few unusual events happening to him, he knows he was just as forgettable.The sequels are a bit disappointing in that they lack this sense of wonder, the sense of a story that's happening to thousands of people at once. Gateway shows us glimpses of other lives, of great research projects and of the many explorers of a dangerous fronteir. Those glimpses are worth it all; they're the what-ifs and tell-me-mores that spawned from a simple premise, and they give the book life and depth and meaning. The psychological problems and life history of one man are the true story to tie it all together, but the setting is what makes it so powerful."},{"Title":"Gateway","review":"If there is one way ruin a book's appeal for its second (third, fourth...) generation of readers, it is to heap awards onto it and call it a classic. That often does it for me; such high expectations can almost never be met. And yet I knew of this book's award-winning status before reading it and I still enjoyed it. I even read it twice.Gateway's premise is both clever and simple. A huge fleet of ancient, abandoned, operational alien ships serve as the ultimate gamble; hop aboard and hit &quot;go&quot;... if you have the courage. Because the proverbial &quot;go&quot; button is about all it will let you operate or comprehend. Each ship is inalterably pre-programmed (by its long gone alien creators) and will either leave you stranded, starved to death before the programmed voyage completes, or who knows what.But if you're lucky, the information and/or artifacts you might return with may make you a multimillionaire. And in Pohl's over-crowded future, this means &quot;full medical&quot; - the closest thing to immortality money can buy.Like a lot of award winning books, Gateway successfully combines sophistication with a conventional, page-turning plot. Pohl's use of first person point of view is especially effective in drawing you into his character's personal conflicts, and into his very suspenseful space voyages. Not since A.C. Clarke's _The City and the Stars_ have I been so curious as to what awaited a space voyager at the end of his or her trip (or in this case, trips)."},{"Title":"Gateway","review":"hehe, I'm funny.This is sort of \\"Solaris\\" sci-fi (the confusing 12 hours long Russian one, not the Clooney one), which has hard sci-fi spaceships whizzing about all over the place, conterpointed against an inner voyage through the psyche etc. (Hehe, I'm clever too).Yes, it's dated, but I remember going to see Stargate at the cinema and hoping that what Stargate was going to be was Gateway. (I was sadly disappointed).The sense of \\"Russian Roulette\\" played by the prospectors is really well realised by Pohl and the pen-portrait he paints of the characters and the world of the Gateway asteroid are very vivid. This is a high-class piece of sci-fi and a high-class piece of writing.The sequels are also pretty good, but Gateway is the best and would still make a brilliant film.In one of those strange quirks of the universe, I had a summer job working in a supermarket called \\"Gateway\\", but it was sadly much less interesting than this book, and the only alien artefact to be seen was Anne, the night shift manager.

The Annals of Heechee.Like Niven's Neutron Star, I picked this book up because I thought the spaceship on the cover looked cool. Give me a break, I think I was 15 at the time. Although the details are a bit fuzzy now, I remember enjoying this series as being original, creative and genuinely entertaining.Original. As I recall, the series is based on the technology left over from a lost civilization. So, much of the story takes you through the creepy leftovers of an extinct race including spaceships, asteroids, star-bases and artifacts. SPOILER!!:: Using this technology, the human race finds that another exists in a separate universe which could answer the mysterious disappearance of the Heechee.Creative. These are some of the things I will never forget from this series: Parking people/items within the event horizon of a black hole to be retreived at a later point in time. The possibility of time travel using black holes. The existence of a civilization at the core of the galaxy. The eery blue tunnels left by a lost civilization. Converting your conscious existence to a computer program, giving you eternal life. Eating food derived from coal. Sleeping on warm rocks (vs. sheets).Genuinely Entertaining. This whole series is really just a big TV episode. There are a few memorable parts, but nothing revolutionary for the science fiction genre. All in all it's a fun read. Beware, though, I read this in my adolescence, so it may not be as impressive for all you sophisticated readers out there."},{"Title":"Gateway","review":"Rob Broadhead, a poor coal miner in food production quarry, is destined to spend the rest of his dismal. A lottery win is his ticket to way out. But where? He decides to take one way trip to a hollowed-out asteroid called Gateway somewhere between Venus and Mercury. It is an abandoned alien space station (\\"The heechees\\") filled with small faster than light star ships. The Corporation is short of explorers to fly these hundreds of ships come that in three sizes and are defined as a 1, 3 and 5 based upon the number of passenger. The is one but. The discoveries are rewarded with substantial bonuses, even lifetime's wealth, for anyone to take part of unknown destinations; *but* the ships fly on auto-pilot. The chances to return alive is like playing Russian roulette.The inner turmoils of Robbie -- to take all measures to avoid the voyages -- is told in sandwich manner. His past, the events in Gateway station are told while he visits computer psychoanalyst to understand his crippling despair and the dark secrets buried deep in his psyche. He once loved Klara in the Gateway station with all of his soul. He survived a \\"trip\\" with him and they went in their own ways. With the help of his computerized psychoanalyst, he needs to find the truth about what happened \\"out there\\". This is the beginning of The Heechee saga of four books, of which the others areBeyond the blue event horizon(1980),Heechee rendezvous(1984) andThe annals of the heechee(1987).Four (4) stars. Written in 1977, the book won 1977 Nebula Novel and 1978 Hugo Award for Best Novel. Pohl is interesting writer, but never dull. The story is not much about the Heechee technology itself, but about Rob's journey into himself. The consequences that are revealed at the end are more horrifying to Rob than the nightmare trip through the interstellar void that he drove himself to take. The character treatment in this respect is more analytic than emotional. The hard SF reader is left wanting more: as the explorers give more information, even more questions are raised who the Heechees were? Be prepared that this book is more like A. Clarke, than Asimov, so this awards-winning book may not satisfy all readers."},{"Title":"Gateway","review":"This is the story of a curious anti-hero,Robinette Broadhead.

A must read!"},{"Title":"Gateway","review":"This classic book is divvied up into two equally satisfying spheres. First we have the sessions between Robin and his computer shrink Sigmund. While writing psychology in sci-fi isn't new, this takes the mundane is a whole new plane. Not only is it insightful to characterization, but it also helps us understand the world Robin lives in and how he relates himself to women (who are pretty much objects to be possessed) and the Heechee (which are beyond possession). The second half of the book is the exploration of the Gateway itself as well as the gateways that the Gateway allows the explores to venture. Intermixed in all this activity, there are tidbits of interesting facets of life from the Gateway. Just little things like classifieds and technical information. This also provides another level of depth to the already deep story."},{"Title":"Gateway","review":"I remember Gateway fondly from its original publication, and I was a little worried about revisiting it decades later. After all, a lot of science fiction doesn't age well, as predictions of the future quickly become dated by real life events, transforming excellent books from literature to mere curiosities.Gateway isn't immune from this, as its characters depend on lectures recorded on cassette tapes for their education! Worse, it features one of the most unsympathetic protagonists to inhabit a sci-fi classic. Robinette Broadhead's character defects are too manifold to list here. And half the book is devoted to Broadhead's futuristic psychoanalysis, and in the end, it proves to be a ludicrous red herring.So why the excellent rating?Because Pohl is an extraordinary talent, and his imaginary world of the future is a fascinating one. Here's an example of what I mean: \\"While I listened to the professor I could feel the wonder and the beauty of space. It was too immense and glorious to be frightening and it was not until later that I would related those sinks of radiation and swamps of thing gas to ME, to the frail, firghtened, pain-sensitive creations that was the body I inhabited. And then I would think about going out among those remote and titans and... my soul curled up inside of me.\\"There's not much one can add to that. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Gateway","review":"This one has been around for a while and I found it a little tired. For dedicated science fiction fans this is worth the read but does leave questions unanswered."},{"Title":"Gateway","review":"his is a peculiar novel. For 300 pages you think you're reading a SF novel and it's only in the last 13 pages that you become aware of the fact that all along it was mainly about psychology. The SF elements are only the background for this novel.The two main characters are Bob, his full name is Robinette Broadhead, and Sigfrid, a psychotherapist.Bob, a poor devil who wins the lottery, is finally able to leave the Earth ( or at least what is left of the habitable part of it ) for an asteroid named Gateway. Gateway has a complex of tunnels digged by the Heechee, an alien civilization that vanished half a million years ago. A part of their spacecrafts - still intact - are left behind on Gateway. They still can be used by humans for exploration of the universe. You don't need a special training because the ships are almost entirely automatic. You can earn a lot of money when you make a new discovery - an unknown star or a new planet in an other solar system, or when you find signs of alien intelligent life and things like that. You have to come back alife of course and that's the tricky part.The second character is Sigfrid, a robot-psychologist. What can you say about a robot ? I guess Sigfrid is like any other psychologist ( OK, bad joke, forget it ).Now what's the problem with Bob ? In his last discovery voyage something nasty happens. He's the only one of his crew who gets away. The others are still alive and well but something very odd happened to them. Bob is feeling very guilty about it hence his weekly visits to Sigfrid.The last 13 pages are very emotional."},{"Title":"Gateway","review":"The book was entertaining, but not fantastic. The chapters alternated between psychoanalysis by a psuedo-sentient computer and then flashbacks to the actual story. Even during the story chapters, there was more focus on interpersonal relationships than on adventure. If that's what you are looking for then this book is absolutely for you. The characters were interesting and captivating, though not always well developed. For people who are looking for pure sci-fi adventure, this book isn't bad and definitely worth reading, but nothing exceptional."},{"Title":"Gateway","review":"Gateway evokes the fascination and terror of the unknown universe better than any other science fiction book I know. I agree with the reviewer who said that the other books of the series could be regarded as optional; the fascination of Gateway consists largely of the fact thet we DON'T know all the stuff about the Heechee that is revealed in the following books.Dick Ellis"},{"Title":"Gateway","review":"just as the heechee space-worm drive works...picking up speed...this book seemed to work the same way.for a hugo award winner, i was surprised i had to fight the temptation to put the book down during the first chapter or so...but, stick with itvery well worth itjust a tough beginning.gateway, explores scientific, sociological, technological, and pyschological avenues all interetwined as a few select years of rob broadhead's life. this book follows (through two sets of dialogue) robinette broadhead, through some of his exploits as a prospector for heechee (long lost race of aliens) valuables and technology.the two narratives, alternate chapters, and conist of 1) rob talking with his computer pyschiatrist, who he dubs 'sigfrid von shrink', who continously probes deeper into harsh issues rob can not yet deal with, and 2) the story of his life as a prospector, and all of the technology and other such things.if you find yourself, like i did, with the urge to drop the book...push on. it really does get quite good."},{"Title":"Gateway","review":"Gateway remains one of the most memorable and moving books I have ever read. I would recommend it to other readers without hesitation.Pohl recently stated that \`Gateway' is under development as a motion picture (in an introduction to \`The Boy Who Would Live Forever', a Heechee-related short story in the hardcover collection \`Far Horizons').The sequel \`Beyond The Blue Event Horizon' is perhaps a better, but certainly different, novel. I'd also recommend Pohl's \`Man Plus' and \`Jem' and Pohl &amp; Kornbluth's \`The Space Merchants'."},{"Title":"Gateway","review":"This is my all time favorite science fiction novel and personally I think it is the best SF novel of the entire 1970's (Left Hand of Darkness was released in 1969). Before the present fracturing of SF into a myriad of subgenres, at one time there were two, considered soft scifi and hard scifi. This novel wonderfully unites those two subgenres. The novel contains an intermix of two basic chronological sequences, one from his journey prospecting on one of the spacecraft left by the mysterious Heechee alien race, and the other from events after his return. What gives this story so much additional power are the details. Placed throughout the book are relevant, but not directly part of the story, pages of computer printouts with his computer psychiatrist, a leaflet on a description of the Heechee, classified ads of someone on a distant planetary object hoping to meet females from earth, etc, that really embellish the novel.The hard science fiction includes descriptions of what's known of the Heechee, a vanished alien race, from the remnants of the space craft left behind. These space craft still work, but how to control them is unknown. One can only travel in them to wherever is their preset destination and return. These destinations can have artifacts of immense worth, so \`prospectors' are called upon to take the risk of traveling on these space crafts. The risk being of what is at journey's end and how long the voyage is. There is only so much life support. Pohl describes well the journey in one of these ships as it continually accelerates to the half way point and then continually decelerates to the destination. The crew of the space craft know they're screwed if the half way point occurs after half of the life support is used because it means that they'll be dead by the time they reach the destination.The soft science fiction part includes conversations of the protagonist, Robin, with his computer psychiatrist. These occur after his return from a prospecting trip and he is now quite wealthy. However, during the trip a horrible mishap and turn of events occurred to the other crew members including the woman he loved. The mishap is so horrible to him because not only did it occur, it is still occurring, and will continue for all time. Thus Robin's visits to the psychiatrist. Some reviewer suggested that the ending was corny, I was floored reading it. Damn, you wish your family and friends were as considerate as this computer psychiatrist.To be fair, I haven't read this novel for a number of years so I cannot comment on it's datedness. However conceptually it certainly doesn't feel dated and just it's importance to 70's science fiction alone makes this still a relevant read at the least. The one thing about concepts of some science fiction, such as novels about interstellar space craft and alien races, is that their relevance can be maintained until, if and when, humans finally travel on such ships and meet such aliens.I've seen that there's a new book cover. I don't know why..., the previous cover of two space craft streaking away from an asteroid was one of the best book covers in science fiction history! What's wrong with publishers? Well... at least they know enough to keep this book in print.If it hasn't already been hammered home yet, at all costs avoid reading the sequels. (Negative book reviews can be just as meaningful as positive book reviews.) Gateway was written as a standalone novel and reading the sequels are not necessary. Sure, book 2, Beyond the Blue Event Horizon, was a 1980 Nebula and a 1981 Hugo finalist, but this says less about that subpar book than it does about the power of Gateway where anything related to it would have been considered for nomination. Unfortunately, everything else written by Pohl after Gateway is really disappointing (though I'm still not sure about Jem). It seems Frederik Pohl really celebrated his award winnings. Fortunately Gateway now stands for the ages as truly worthy science fiction reading."},{"Title":"Gateway","review":"Frederik Pohl has always been one of my favourite SF authors. As a double Hugo/Nebula winner for 1997's best novel, that makes it (at least nominally) one of the best of the best.In the mid-21st century, tunnels and artifacts are discovered on Venus. This discovery leads in turn to the far more lucrative discovery of Gateway, an asteroid orbiting the sun outside the elliptical plane, tunnelled out and housing nearly 1000 spaceships abandoned half a million years ago by a mysterious race that humans have labelled the Heechee. These fully-functional ships are capable of faster-than-light travel and can hold one to five passengers. The problem is, no one knows how to operate the controls. Prospectors have spent their life's savings to travel to Gateway and travel in one of the ships to destinations unknown, hoping to make a major scientific or commercial discovery. Some do and hit it big. Most don't. Many don't come back.The protagonist, millionaire Robinette Broadhead, is one of the ones who hit it big. We find out two important things about him at the beginning of Gateway. First, on one of his trips he made a major discovery worth 18 million dollars. Second, he is a very screwed-up man; we first meet him lying on a mat in the office of his digital shrink, Sigfrid.Structurally, the novel's chapters alternate between Broadhead's sessions with Sigfrid, and flashbacks to Broadhead's experiences on Gateway. Unfortunately the book's structure is its major weakness. There is simply too much Sigfrid; Broadhead's appointments with the shrink could have been removed by half without harming the story. Besides, reading Freudian interpretation after interpretation of Broadhead's dreams and word choices starts to get monotonous.It is the flashback sequences on Gateway and beyond that make this novel interesting by far. Pohl has done an excellent job of preserving the mystery of the Heechee. They are never revealed, even at the denouement of the story. Their presence is felt only through the tunnels of Gateway, the rare half-million-year-old artifacts they left behind, and their still-functional spaceships with their cryptic controls, the function of which can only be guessed at (more often than not wrongly). Interspersed throughout the book are page-long sidebars containing snapshots of life on or about Gateway: classified ads, trip reports, academic lectures. In addition to helping create a general impression of the risks of being a Gateway prospector, some of these little diversions provide clues to how the story ends, and are worth reading carefully.If you're a hard SF fan and haven't picked up Gateway yet, you owe it to yourself. Despite its literary flaws, it's on my list of must-read SF novels."},{"Title":"Gateway","review":"I'm always reluctant to start a new series of Sci-fi novels because of the usual let-down that ensues after a fine beginning novel. I've read the sequel, &quot;Beyond the Blue Event Horizon,&quot; and I was thoroughly disappointed. It took me over a year to even bother to start the third book, which I am reading now and so far it doesn't look too promising, either. So, what I'm trying to say, in so many run-on sentences, is to read the first book only. It has a great mystery at its heart, and does what all masterful Sci-fi does best: raises more questions than it answers. There are a few down moments, but they are forgivable given that I was there with the characters pondering the mysteries of the Heechee and subconciously fearful for their well-being when they do travel to the stars. Some never return; some return with their entrails splattered all over the inside of the ship. It's a dice game with the craft of the Heechee. But those who return with artifacts and knowledge are likely to become rich beyond their wildest dreams. For some reason, much like Dan Simmons' &quot;Endymion,&quot; I keep having memory flashes from this novel. I was there in spirit. The great Sci-fi novels take you on a journey into the unknown and sometimes beyond. This is one of those novels."},{"Title":"Gateway","review":"Short, sweet, and to the point - I read this one in a day; I just couldn't put it down. The sad but compelling character of Robin is the perfect vehicle for this story as we follow him through not only the pains of his life, but the wild risks he eventually takes as a result of it. Gateway, being a station almost entirely populated with people who are basically so desparate as to continually play a frightening version of Russian Roulette on the off chance they might escape one way or the other, makes for one of the more fascinating sci fi settings I've encountered. The mysetery of the long lost Heechee and the strange legacy they left behind is the perfect backdrop to the story. Read it twice!"},{"Title":"Gateway","review":"A clever book. The psychoanalysis chapters will bore a hardened sci fi fan, but they are essential to the story. Reading it a second time (once I knew what was going to have happened) made me appreciate just how clever Pohl had been in the clues he scatters through the psychoanalysis sessions. Having said all that, the very best part of the book, IMO, is the final line in the last chapter. I hadn't even realised that there was a whole other sub-plot until then."},{"Title":"Gateway","review":"This is the book that made me love science fiction. It wasn't just space age technology and fantasy, but a fiction story with real characters. Pohl brilliantly explored Robinette Broadhead and his mechanical psycho-analytic machine Sigfreud in a displaced reality. This is what sci-fi should be focused on - the human reaction and interaction in alternate realities."},{"Title":"Gateway","review":"The story: Mankind has discovered a long-abandoned alien space station, with hundreds of empty space ships. The discovery brings new hope-- and new heroes-- to the miserable masses on an overpopulated Earth.There's a problem, though. Although hundreds of space ships are docked at the station, no one knows much about how to control them. Enter Robin Broadhead, one of many desperate people who have spent their life's savings-- or lottery winnings-- to get to the station in order to risk their lives taking the space ships out into space in search of other abandoned technologies. The prize: striking it rich and living a decent life in a hard world.Unfortunately for Robin, his willingness to flee life on Earth doesn't change the fact that's he's shivering in his boots at the thought of dying out in deep space.Pohl does a good job of creating a sense of raw human fear in Gateway, his early signature work. It's a scary story about an average guy who is afraid to die. It's considered a classic, even though it's a bit rough around the edges and the prose is at times lacking, because it sticks to the basics: it's an engaging, tightly written story about a person. And even today, it's quite original in the telling.Pohl does a masterful job of creating a sense that Robin's life on Gateway (the name of the space station) is much like the feeling you have when you've worked yourself up into climbing a 50-foot tree high above a river, then lose your stomach. Even though you're too afraid to jump, you can't turn back because there's a crowd of people climbing the tree behind you.It's a clever premise that Pohl executes well. The story is told in a series of flashforwards and flashbacks, as an older Robin talks to a therapist about his past and a younger Robin fears the future.Gateway is not a masterpiece. Pohl's recently published hard SF Eschaton series, which ends with &quot;The Far Shore of Time,&quot; has far more believable characters, far more persuasive description, and the sense of &quot;creepiness&quot; that comes with engaging the Unknown is far more engaging. But Gateway is a high water mark in Pohl's career, and in science fiction as well. It's interesting and it's scary. That's why you'll read it more than once.[There are a number of sequels to this book. There's a reason why they're all out of print, but I've seen them all at larger used book stores.]"},{"Title":"Gateway","review":"I originally read Gateway years ago while in the military. It turned me back on to science fiction and saved me from the doldrums while stationed at Fort Knox.The book holds up pretty well. There are some anachronisms - our visions of the future have changed radically - but not enough that it really bothers the flow of the book. This is, after all, a *character* story. The character development arc, as revealed by both history and intercut psychiatric sessions, is a finely crafted masterwork.But that's not all of the story - this is a speculative fiction work, with a well-realized future society and several deep mysteries. The plot moves on relentlessly, keeping us wondering what new revelation is behind the next page.Interestingly, the society presented is well past our current homophobia. Gay people are simply presented as another facet of the society without comment - excepting the protagonist's own relationships. Yet that is clearly an aspect of his own personality, not something reflected by the world at large.Through both worldbuilding and character development, Gateway clearly will deserve a place as one of the classics of science fiction."},{"Title":"Gateway","review":"I picked this up at a used book store based on the strong reviews here. Although some readers have described Gateway as 'hard Science Fiction,' I wouldn't go with that category.Pohl loves to critique contemporary capitalism / commercialism within a futuristic setting, and a lot of Gateway is based on commercial exploitation of alien technology. Like the classic Bladerunner movie, Gateway assumes a very dystopian, corporation-exploited future. Most humans are impoverished and toil about in manual labor jobs. So bleak is their outlook in the food mines that they are excited to jump at the chance to take huge risks at piloting undocumented alien spacecraft on missions that might bring them financial riches. Sadly, many of these missions result in death for all crew members.This is my first Frederik Pohl full-length-book experience and it had me running back to the used bookstore to find the sequel, Beyond the Blue Event Horizon. I had read one of his short stories before (1954- 'Tunnel Under the World'), and found Gateway to come across somewhat dated as that story did. Both are great reads, but it's frequently jarring to read all the references to cigarette and pot smoking while travelling in a closed container at faster-than-light speed."},{"Title":"Gateway","review":"Along with Enders Game by Orson Scott Card, this has the crappiest story to cover ratio ever. I have a terrible habit of letting the cover of a book influence me. Thankfully, my better judgment prevailed. I read this book in two days and had to drag myself away from it the first night (at 2am, I had to get up at 6am).The chapters are set up so that one takes place in the present and two is a sort of flash back and so on. This makes it compulsively hard to put down. To me that is one of the most important qualities in a book and this one does it perfectly.In the future, an asteroid is discovered containing hundreds of automated space ships that are capable of faster than the speed of light travel (the problem is that you don't really know where the ship is going, if anywhere). The beings who built the ships are long gone. Leaving no trace as to what happened to them or where they went. Therefore, humans take it upon themselves to inhabit the asteroid and send \\"Prospectors\\" out in the ships to search the stars. A lot of them don't come back.The book is essentially an interview between one of the most famous and wealthy Prospectors (prospectors get a percentage of the profits on any thing they find), Robinette, and his computerized therapist. As you get deeper into the book the tension mounts and spirals towards an incident too painful for Robinette to speak of, terminating in one of the most satisfying endings of any book I have ever read."},{"Title":"Taking Down Syndrome to School (Special Kids in School)","review":"I have a daughter who has Down syndrome and I was looking for books for her classmates to read and this one is very good!

I liked how this book was written - thumbs up!"},{"Title":"Taking Down Syndrome to School (Special Kids in School)","review":"I used this book to read to my son's 4th grade class for World Down Syndrome Day. We have 2 girls with Down syndrome so I wanted to bring awareness, but a lot of the books out there are geared towards younger kids. This book was great for his age group (9-10) and sparked lots of fantastic questions and interesting discussions about Down syndrome and disabilities in general.

My son's teacher asked me to come back next year and read it again to her new class. :)"},{"Title":"Taking Down Syndrome to School (Special Kids in School)","review":"I think this book did a great job talking about Downs.

Other than that this is a great book for kids!"},{"Title":"Dog Tags of Courage: Combat Infantrymen And War Dog Heroes in Vietnam","review":"It can be argued that, as a nation, America rushed to forget about the experience in Vietnam. As a result, many heroic acts often went unsung. John Burnam's moving book takes the reader back to a difficult time in our history to share the unique stories of a special group of heroes-- the Vietnam dog handlers and their canine partners. Burnam's conversational accounts of incredible war time situations is both eye-opening and hair-raising. Sadly, the reader also learns the chilling truth about how our government and military callously forgot the dogs of Vietnam. Their handlers, however, never forgot. Soldiers like Ron Aiello(US Marine Corps Scout-dog handler) never forgot how the dogs often saved soldier's lives. (You can read how Aiello's own life was saved by his female German shepherd partner, Smokey, on page 281.) In 2000 Aiello founded the U.S. War Dogs Association and spear-headed the drive to honor the Vietnam war dogs and their handlers with a bronze sculpture that now stands in Holmdel, New Jersey. Readers may also be surprised to learn that military dogs continue to protect and save lives today in Afghganistan and Iraq. The chapter on the rescued Iraqi dog recruited by Special Forces Sergeant First Class Russell Joyce for sentry duty (\\"Fluffy\\") is uplifting and inspiring.Burnam's book is a great read. His telling of his relationship with his partner \\"Clipper\\" is poignant and ultimately heart-wrenching. The personal accounts and military details also make it an interesting historical record. But perhaps more than anything, it is a moving tribute to some very special heroes who's bravery and good deeds should never be forgotten.(And don't forget to read with a box of tissue--you'll need it!)"},{"Title":"Dog Tags of Courage: Combat Infantrymen And War Dog Heroes in Vietnam","review":"I was thoroughly enthrawled and entertained while reading this well-told story. It is precise, matter-of-fact and compelling. I highly recommend this book to anyone who owns a dog, loves animals, or wants to see what it was like to be an infantryman during a very trying and difficult war. Mr. Burnam tells it like it was, and shows what it means and what it takes to be a dog-handler during the Vietnam war. Good book."},{"Title":"Dog Tags of Courage: Combat Infantrymen And War Dog Heroes in Vietnam","review":"War dogs have been used in military actions for many years. This is the story of author John C. Burnam's experiences as a dog handler in Vietnam. These dogs saved countless lives as their keen senses of hearing and smell alerted their handler to danger long before the handler would have become aware of it. And, of course, many of the dogs also lost their lives in the line of duty. This is a very personal look at the special relationship between dog and handler and the brotherhood of all those who were dog handlers in a military action. Filled with pictures taken during the Vietnam action, it includes the sad story of the abandonment of thousands of dogs at the end of the war. For anyone who has an interest in the ways dogs have helped military actions, the bond between handlers and dogs, the courage and dedication of war dogs, or just the recent history of war dogs Dog Tags of Courage is a recommended read."},{"Title":"Dog Tags of Courage: Combat Infantrymen And War Dog Heroes in Vietnam","review":"This is truly a heartwarming and at times heart wrenching. I really got a sense of what it must have felt like to be a teenage Infantryman during such a difficult time. It is a book that tells the truth about our 4-legged heroes being left in Vietnam.

I was afraid to keep reading it. But, it was about a group of unsung heroes, and I owed them the time and fortitude to read their story.It's saddening to say the least. I've never been so moved by a grayed out picture. I'm grateful of the author for sharing his story."},{"Title":"Dog Tags of Courage: Combat Infantrymen And War Dog Heroes in Vietnam","review":"Excellent book. Maybe too much leading up to stories of the war dogs. I had heard of the dogs being killed after a handler left Viet Nam but the book exposes the governments role. I traveled home alongside a dog handler and now I more fully understand why he was so quiet on the way back. A rapist and a pimp sent us to Vietnam and a lifetime politician saw to it that thousands of us young men went to war for their stature and reputation. We fought for each other and the dogs were unwavering soldiers along side us ready to give their life which many did. It is a sad chapter in American history that her soldiers were \\"used\\" and dogs were \\"expendable\\". Don't let this history be repeated."},{"Title":"Dog Tags of Courage: Combat Infantrymen And War Dog Heroes in Vietnam","review":"This is a wonderful book encompasing what it really was like for the infantryman andhis dog during the Vietnam War.

The unanimous critical praise and popular demand hopefully will convince the publisher to soon release another printing.Like \\"insteadlaugh\\" I found the book to be very settling, the information provided makes suicide seem not so necessarily imminent.As for those selling copies for $200 and more, shame on you. It is as if you are trying to exploit a last pound of flesh from those desperately seeking a final answer. A simple $20 price tag with a message urging the buyer to sell it for the same price to the next person would accomplish much more. Hopefully the publisher will soon release another edition and your copy will be as worthless as you are."},{"Title":"Suicide and Attempted Suicide: Methods and Consequences","review":"This book is not &quot;sick&quot;--it's absolutely necessary, both for those of us who have a serious intent to die and for those of us who are toying with the idea and don't want to cause permanent irreversible damage on the way there. A book like this helps more than it hurts because it prevents people from making attempts that are sure to fail and will cause all kinds of damage along the way. I belong to an internet newsgroup that provides the same kind of service. Talking honestly and openly about suicide SAVES lives, it doesn't *cause* more deaths (as the author said, it's like teenage sex--if you fail to talk about it, it doesn't in any way mean that it's not still going to happen). This book is an invaluable resource for anyone (and that's a lot of us) who has thought about taking that step towards self-inflicted death. my only beef with the author is that he puts depressed people in the &quot;irrational&quot; category. now, if someone is psychotically depressed, hearing voices and the like, that's one thing, but your normal, run-of-the-mill non-psychotic depression is NOT, in my opinion, to be put into that &quot;irrational&quot; category. depression is as serious and as painful as any long-term physical illness, and it ought to be viewed as such. especially because there are cases in which depression can be prolonged for many years and can ultimately be untreatable. this is definitely a book worth owning."},{"Title":"Suicide and Attempted Suicide: Methods and Consequences","review":"That this is called the most complete suicide how-to book indicates just how little information is available. Rather than being authoritative, this book would merely make an attempt even more frightening, given its insufficient and vague instructions.The book offers little information outside common knowlege and mainly serves to emphasize the consequences of a failed attempt. The few statistics quoted are of small sample sizes and are not geographically spread, there are no diagrams, descriptions are colorless and technical information is incomplete. The author fails, for instance, to note that lethality of firearms is as dependent upon type of cartridge and bullet as upon calibre (imagine someone confidently using a .357 magnum pistol inadvertently loaded with low velocity .38 special cartridges).To be fair, perhaps the stigma against suicide, and career considerations caused the author's sources to be reluctant to offer information or advice. This might explain why so much of the book seems gleaned from internet dilettantes. The book is still a brave first effort, made at some personal risk, and the author should be commended for performing something of a public service."},{"Title":"Suicide and Attempted Suicide: Methods and Consequences","review":"This book needed to be written. There is no better source of information about suicide methods. If you want to know how it's done, what works, and what's likely to leave you a vegetable, this is the place to look."},{"Title":"Suicide and Attempted Suicide: Methods and Consequences","review":"This is one of the few books that I have had qualms about reviewing. It is so morbidly fascinating that it is hard to set aside. It doesn't appear to have been written exclusively for psychiatric professionals- the style is too readable and the statistics are too readily useful and understandable.The first part of the book does a good job in examining the history, philosophy, study approaches, and reasons for suicide. The author makes it quite clear that he does not automatically consider suicide to be inappropriate in all cases, nor does he automatically rule out the existence of rational suicide. There are also an excellent couple of chapters on the subject of euthanasia and its application in other cultures.It is the second part of this volume that has made it famous, or infamous, in the mental health world. While the author clearly states on the flyleaf that the book should not be considered a \\"how to\\" guide, it is difficult to imagine how anyone could not foresee that this is exactly how it could be used. The author devotes a chapter to each and every means of self termination and then sums each up each method with pros and cons (asphyxia, cutting and stabbing, drowning, drugs and poisons, electrocution, gunshot wounds, hanging and strangulation, hypothermia, and jumping.) The chapters give quite detailed descriptions of how to successfully carry out these acts and the odds of your being successful. For instance, not only are you told specifically where to shoot yourself, but also the individual effectiveness of the various calibers of bullet is examined. The old hangman's formula for determining the height of drop for a given weight is included. There is even a table to calculate the exact velocity at which you will hit the ground based on the starting elevation of a jump (he points out as a rule of thumb that a jump of 150 feet on land and one of 250 feet over water is 95 to 98% fatal.) The only thing that makes me think that such a detailed guide is not a how-to book is the fact that he also gives detailed descriptions of the horrible injuries resulting from botched attempts. To be more effective in this respect, perhaps photographs should have been included.If this book keeps individuals from suffering the traumatic effects of botched suicide then it is a worthy effort. Similarly, if it helps those that merely intend a survivable suicide \\"gesture\\" from going too far it will also have served its purpose. There has been a concerted campaign on the part of some mental health professionals to remove this book from circulation. I can't say that I approve of that effort, but I would definitely keep it out of the hands of minors and the mentally unstable."},{"Title":"Suicide and Attempted Suicide: Methods and Consequences","review":"I thought this book had a lot of essential information for people who wanted to learn about the facts of suicide and attempted suicide.

It's extremely difficult to find a book like this.I thought it was execellent."},{"Title":"Suicide and Attempted Suicide: Methods and Consequences","review":"I felt rather spookey when ordering this book - a bit like sending off for pornography! There is also such shortage of easily available information about this topic, so relevant to the experience of everyone. As someone who suffers from periodic depression and has reflected at length at the implications of getting off the bus, this volume has brought a sense of comfort and perspective, in the most practical and reasonable manner. The human race is extraordinarily inept at looking after its own and seems unable to respond effectively to its equally extraordinary capacity for suffering, both innate and self-imposed. The author must be congratulated on successfully hitting the target with an aspect of human existence that is so controversial, difficult to grasp and in need of attention. In reading, I felt I had a friend in Mr Stone and a companion to take me through the challenges that will come along during the remainder of my time in this world."},{"Title":"Suicide and Attempted Suicide: Methods and Consequences","review":"Great book, very clear and concise, very well writteneasy to read."},{"Title":"Suicide and Attempted Suicide: Methods and Consequences","review":"Now that I have read this book, I feel that I have a wider range of techniques to use.

It was worth it. The book is an excellent reference for anyone interested in (or morbidly fascinated by) suicide. It is a scholarly work which has been meticulously researched. Mr. Stone has added immense value to the store of knowledge about what can be a difficult and emotive subject. The accusations that are thrown around that he has done \\"something immoral\\" by clearly setting out how people can chose and execute (pun intended) a suicide method are just plain nonsense. Yes, he may indeed have assisted some people to make the final exit in a way that suits them, but because he also gives equal weight to the means by which people in pain can make a \\"call for help\\" through attempted suicide in an effective and safe manner suggests to me that he may well indeed have saved lives.

But I believe that people who are determined to end their lives will do so eventurally no matter how we try to stop it. I hear lots of suicide that ended up in taking so long and so painful. Those who really want to die already experienced so much pain mentally and physically prior to the suicide, and I believe that at least when they die it should be painless as they don't need more pain on top of the pain they went through.If I could choose, I would like to die from a natural cause, that is, an old age. That is my choice, and as much as my choice being vaild, I value other people's choices. Everyone has a different curcumstances, and I don't think I completely understand how others feel. I wish I could help all beings, but I am very limited.Since I have not read this book, it is impossible to tell if the content is fit in terms of physiological effectiveness.

But instead of teaching you how to make a souffl&eacute; or Peking Duck, it has recipes for death. Like any good cookbook, the methods are clearly categorized by chapter (such as asphyxiation), and each has step by step instructions, as well as medical background about how it works, how difficult it is to do, what could go wrong, and what to do in each case to ensure lethality.There's no nonsense here. You won't be talked down to or patronized. It's accurate and precise information written by a doctor who has studied each method. This makes it an important and interesting book because there is very little accurate information on this subject available. Dr. Stone is clear to point out that there are many misconceptions about suicide methods in the general public. And if you're going to play with fire, don't you think you it is wise to know what you're doing?Just like any cookbook the author does not make tangential remarks about why he made this book. But there is an underlying message of personal responsibility here that can be gleaned from the book's introduction and Dr. Stone's dark humor.Part One of the book describes suicide in broad terms, speaking of the different kinds of people who in the past had made successful or unsuccessful attempts. And there's a clear warning that due to lack of information some people who didn't really want to die, end up making the tragic mistake of using a method that is much more lethal than intended. The reverse warning is also here: That for those who wanted to die, and took action without clear thought often results in waking up in an Emergency Room with a damaged body or a slow and painful death.Personally, I am more familiar with genuinely wanting to die rather than using a suicide attempt as a gesture for attention. When I read this book, I was depressed and specifically purchased the book for the \\"recipes\\" in Part Two. I was amazed to discover how many choices you have, even when your goal is the same. As I continued to read, I realized that these methods would always be there, waiting for me, tucked away like a fire extinguisher. Despite the great pain that you might be feeling, I realized that there is no need to rush things. I could execute one of these methods, and ensure my death, at any time I chose.What I'm about to say might sound strange to you initially, but this feeling of certainty and control over your own destiny is something that I hadn't felt before. So, now, as I finished reading, and put it back on the shelf, I wondered what things in life existed to which I had not properly been introduced. If there were so many ways to die, could there be even more ways to live? I believe this feeling of control and certainty that I now felt is what kept the book on the shelf and me in the game. I hope that if you purchase this book, you will experience a similar feeling."},{"Title":"Suicide and Attempted Suicide: Methods and Consequences","review":"(...)this is a book about which it's hard to be neutral. If you think that suicide is always wrong, a sin, or a crime, you won't like it: the book provides lots of &quot;how-to&quot; information that can be used to commit suicide. But at the same time there is an anti-suicide thread running through the text---time and again, the author suggests delay, alternatives, and medical treatment, so the in-your-face pro-suicide crowd (small, but vocal) won't be happy either. Further, the author's website contains, among other things, lots of grisly photos that seem intended to discourage suicide.Unlike Gaul, the book is divided into two parts. The first half is an overview of suicide, covering history, causes of suicide (considered through sociology, psychiatry, and biology), American and Dutch end-of-life medical practices, and a few related areas. Compressed into a little over a hundred pages, this broad coverage is not terribly detailed but functions well as a summary and is both interesting and well done.The second half describes, with sometimes weirdly-fascinating factoids, what is known about suicide methods (the &quot;how-to&quot; part) and their medical consequences (the &quot;why-you-probably-shouldn't-try-them&quot; part). If you're interested in suicide methods, this is the best source of information available. If you're not, there's far more information here than you want to know. Trust me.The book's layout is poor. References are in the back organized by chapter, but pages in the text don't have chapter headers, so it's easy to lose your place, whilst flipping back and forth. Footnotes are at the end of each chapter instead of at the bottom of the page, another annoying practise, and there are a surprising number of typso. &lt;g&gt;In sum, if you want to know why people kill themselves, there are better sources. If you want to know how, this is your book."},{"Title":"Suicide and Attempted Suicide: Methods and Consequences","review":"This is the definitive book on the subject, exhaustively researched, and yet quite readable...As I read this book, I was struck that this is not so much about suicide, as about self-determination (...). I began reading this out of a sense of professional obligation, but quickly found the book surprisingly interesting. There is a wealth of detail presented, with the solid and sobering information relieved by the often wickedly amusing (albeit occasionally warped) footnotes.While the &quot;how to&quot; sections are quite graphic, the reader can readily find areas of interest through the clear chapter subheadings, and thereby skip those that might be either too gory or too technical. But the detail presented is here out of necessity-for how else can the individual make an informed decision?This book clearly does not advocate suicide. It provides individuals with the information to make a better decision about their future. For example, if someone wishes to make a gesture, it gives them guidance about appropriate choices that will not leave them off in an even worse state.As a physician, I was a bit put off by the author's criticism of docs. I think he underestimates the chilling effect the threat of professional criticism and repercussions has. Of course, there is also the effect fear of more serious legal action (eg charges of murder) has on the willingness of physicians to be more active in this area. This extends to efforts in the area of pain relief (such as by providing adequate doses of morphine) which are often inappropriately criticized as excessive. Also, as he notes, docs have been very poorly educated regarding pain control.I highly recommend this thorough reference work, the most definitive work I have seen on this controversial subject. It is far more than a &quot;how to&quot; manual. It is both a reference book, as well as a thoughtful resource, providing objective information, historical information, and perspective on this difficult topic."},{"Title":"Suicide and Attempted Suicide: Methods and Consequences","review":"This is a disturbing book, but, given the culture we live in, an essential one. I believe it will deter those that need detering and assist those who truly need self-deliverance and are unable to get help from others.One comment: geo stone, along with all others writing about 'taboo' matters, is still way behind when it comes to an informed and humane understanding of depression - indeed 'mental health' illnesses in all their forms. Today we understand that epilepsy is a condition. Years ago people living with any kind of epilepsy - there are many forms of the illness - were considered to be inhabited by the devil, satan, etc. Our views on mental health illnesses remain just as stunted and backward.Many people living with, for example, agitated depression since childhood have treatment-resistant brains that have incurred damage over time. These good folks are currently considered off-limits by everyone when the subject of assisted suicide is mentioned. The excrutiating and relentless pain of untreated, long-term depression in any form, rivals any physical pain from cancer, kidney stones - anything. Yet still, people with depression are lumped together; termed 'mentally ill'; and are treated like scum. Even those living with schizophrenia have moments inbetween the episodes where they can see the hell they occupy. Many folks living with depression of any kind never get a break from the pain - they suffer and witness and exprience the pain without any numbing or relief AND are amongst the most sane people you could hope to meet. They are not 'crazy' - they have illnesses. They are not 'irrational' - they are ill.Someone dying of cancer has the right to assistance from groups like the Hemlock Society, but not someone in the hell of depression that has not been touched by any kind of medication at any time. My sincere hope is that our culture will begin to understand that depression can hit in many guises and that many people live untreated in hell. These people deserve the right to assisted self-deliverance and if that help is not around the corner, the right to know, in detail, how to deliver themselves so that the suffering may cease. Who amongst us should be expected to live an unlivable life? Who should be so punished?I think this is a great book. And I hope that works like this will open up other 'taboo' areas, such as the one I've written about above."},{"Title":"Suicide and Attempted Suicide: Methods and Consequences","review":"When I was 11 years old, my brother and I were walking to our favorite swimming spot on the Colorado River. We passed through a dusty, overgrown lot where an old man had been living in his trailer. We saw him working around his car, with a tube that he'd taped to his exhaust pipe. He looked up, smiled and waved. When my bro and I were done with our swim, we walked home the same way we'd came. We noticed the old man's car running...amber smoke in the car, the long tube taped from his exhaust pipe to the rear window...his head was leaning against the passenger window. We knew then that he'd killed himself.The thing that strikes me about that memory is the peace that I saw in the old guy's face prior to his making his exit. He wasn't obviously tormented - he looked happily resolved. And if my life was deteriorating in an uncomfortable and irreversible way for myself, I'd like to think I have the backbone to go ahead and pull the plug like he did. Why is there so much stigma attached to this act? I guess the key word here is \\"irreversible\\". Some dire situations, certain emotional pains - seem to have no end, so suicide appears to be the best solution to some people...in the moment. If they'd just work through the pain of a temporary situation...they can go on to a happier existence. Is this a dangerous book for people at that threshold? My life partner reacted badly to the mere idea of my owning this book, and brought that point up. I reminded him that he and I come from a generation that was used to hiding all the smut and dirty little details of reality...the new generation is the \\"Information Age\\". If a person really wants to learn how to do something, they can research it on the net and forums dedicated to certain controversial topics. But this book DISSUADES someone from making a foolhardy gesture - going into detail about the consequences (pain/crippling) of certain common methods of trying to \\"dispatch\\" oneself. It's presented in a very realistic, responsible way. If I had to lose my entire library and only keep one book - this would be the one book that I would keep - tucked safely under my arm - as a valuable reference for the moment I might need it in the (hopefully distant) future. Throughout the tumultuous journey that is life, I find great comfort in having my guidebook, my \\"map\\", of how to gracefully, and with dignity, be able to find my final resting place - should I need it.XXX...As a final note to this review; I found out later that the old man my brother and I saw commit suicide had been pining for his life-long sweetheart, who had died the previous year...in addition to facing grave health problems of his own. I used to go into his abandoned trailer to play \\"Go-Fish\\" with my little friends, and never felt weird about what I'd witnessed. I felt like he would have welcomed me being there.I wish people would start giving up their fear of death in our narrow-minded little western society. Other, comparitively primitive societies have much healthier and more realistic attitudes than we do."},{"Title":"Suicide and Attempted Suicide: Methods and Consequences","review":"This is an odd, idiosyncratic, fascinating, uneven, irritating, and important book: there's nothing out there like it. &quot;Suicide and Attempted Suicide&quot; is primarily a study of suicide methods---how people try to kill themselves (or, more often, try to get attention or help). It reads as if it were written by more than one author, or over an extended period of time: the tone bounces unpredictably from didactic to ironic to funny (be sure to read the chapter endnotes!).The first half of the book touches on a wide range of suicide topics: history of suicide, the legal situation, treatment options, terminal illness, philosophical issues, euthanasia and assisted suicide. The information is interesting and well enough presented, but tries to cover too much ground in too few pages. A reader unfamiliar with this material will find it a reasonable, though patchy, introduction that can be followed up from the author's well-chosen &quot;suggested reading&quot; list.The heart of the book is the second half, where it discusses suicide methods and their consequences in clinical detail. This treatment will surely be controversial, since the author provides &quot;how to&quot; (and &quot;how not to&quot;) information that can be used either to commit suicide or to carry out a suicidal gesture.I've seen only one other book that takes a similar approach, Derek Humphry's &quot;Final Exit&quot; to which this book will inevitably be compared. &quot;Suicide and Attempted Suicide&quot; is the far more comprehensive and detailed work, which is both its strength and its weakness. There is no better---in fact no other---book that discusses the variety of suicide methods in any significant depth. However the large amount of information comes at a cost: a suicidal reader may have a hard time extracting the data he wants from the mass of data he doesn't need. Similarly, the casual reader will probably find the quantity and details of evidence overwhelming.The writing style is rather pedestrian, which doesn't detract much from a book of this sort, but occasionally slips into &quot;medicalese&quot; which does. On the other hand there are quite a few interesting and informative asides and digressions. These range from early Christian theological disputes, to minimizing heat loss in marine mammals, to the words of Jim Jones (remember Jonestown?) at an anti-suicide rally in San Francisco.Given the sometimes-gory descriptions, the absence of photos and drawings is a bit surprising. However the author says in a &quot;note to the reader&quot; that these will be available on his website.Overall, flaws and all, I highly recommend this book for anyone who has seriously considered suicide, or is presently contemplating it. With more reservations---the first half has too little detail, the second half too much---I would recommend it for general readers as well."},{"Title":"Suicide and Attempted Suicide: Methods and Consequences","review":"This book contains some of the most insightful interpretation of statistical data and superlative research in forensic pathology.There are two sections in this book. The first section analyzes the social, psychological and biological aspect of suicide in history and at present time, in the US and all around the world. There are some powerful conclusions, such as gun ownership does not necessarily contribute to higher suicide rate, that are counter-intuitive but extremely convincing.The second part of the book deals with various suicide methods. The tone in this section is notably different from the first part, as if it is another book by another author. Numerous forensic works are quoted here. However, there are some assertions that seem to me novel and dubious, like the author states, without reference, that the carotid artery is on the right side of the neck and the vein is on the left.While the content of the book is superior, the format is less impressive. The references of each chapter are bundled together at the end of the book; and there's no indication on each page which chapter you are in. This makes it very hard to go from a sentence to its reference. I believe the publisher should be more considerate about the format of this book.Nontheless, this is a top-notch, definitive work on the subject, infinitely better than Mr. Derek Humphry's."},{"Title":"Suicide and Attempted Suicide: Methods and Consequences","review":"This is clearly the work of a man deeply steeped in his own moral compass which is nothing but laudable. I would say it is worth reading this book simply for it's strength of character; as an example of what happens when someone looks deeply into a social phenomenon, then deeply into their soul, then expresses the result in a clear, concise way.Yes this book is challenging to the reader: if you have ANY fear of some means of death or injury (who doesn't?) then there will be some part of the book that defies you to keep staring at the clinical reality of the situation.Yet Stone makes his case with emotion, feeling and yes, humor -- but never without the utmost respect for those considering suicide or those reaching for help in a desperate act. Never once did I feel Stone was judging the subject or the reader. He saved all that for the system and those that perpetuate it.I read this book a year ago and it's principles have stayed with me and inspired me to me more open, generous and thoughtful.Thanks."},{"Title":"Suicide and Attempted Suicide: Methods and Consequences","review":"I spent some time with this book at a local bookseller. This subject has been with me for much of my 40+ years of life and I was curious to read something that could offer real advice about how to commit suicide successfully. However, as I read about the various methods explained in detail including pros and cons I became more and more discouraged about attempting such an act. There were just too many examples of what could (and has in fact) go wrong leading to among other things disfigurement, blindness, brain damage, etc. By the time I was done reading I was dissapointed by finding too many &quot;cons&quot; to go along with the &quot;pros&quot;. Too many in fact to actually go through with the act-at least for now-hopefully forever. May all of you struggling with despair and thoughts of suicide find the sanctuary you need to sustain life. Don't give up. I wish you all well!"},{"Title":"Suicide and Attempted Suicide: Methods and Consequences","review":"I read the guy's website because I can't afford $299 for a book and trust me, it's a helpful thing to read if you're feeling down and thinking about doing yourself in.

It's simply I have ever a wish to win when things go bad (and they are being better as ever). Curiously this doesn't happens to me when what I have are false problems not really very hard.But well, there are drug addicts, people who drinks, dements... Summing up, life is hard and some persons doesn't know how to fight with all these weigh. I can't condemn them, at first because I know stupefacients and alcohol are only theoretically fought and forbidden, but, how many politics and businessmen use them, trades with them, enriches with them?And so, perhaps someone wants to end. Most religions forbids that, but not all, and furthermore, many people isn't religious. It seems to me a sort of aberration a book is dedicated technically in full to this matter, but I find still more grotesque the affirmations of some people saying \\"this handbook is incomplete\\" You can fail, but, truly is correct to say you have dead incompletely? Anybody can die more than once? These observations are absurd, very own of people who truly doesn't know from first hand what terrible thing are non natural death and suicide.

Few other novels offer artistic possibilities as great as 20,000 LEAGUES UNDER THE SEA. Unfortunately, Saddleback's artwork is the book's weakest link.Intended to introduce young readers to classic novels, the Saddleback volumes I've reviewed have varied from fair to poor. Their version of 20,000 LEAGUES UNDER THE SEA does a fair job of condensing the novel down to 56 pages. A little more pruning was probably called for since some strips are overflowing with dialogue. A bigger problem though is the book's artwork. It's poorly done and often amateurish. I don't know if it will entice younger readers into wanting to read the original. And $9.95 seems a bit much price-wise.I'd rate this an optional purchase. There are better versions of this book available. Check out the 'Classic Starts' series from Sterling."},{"Title":"Great Adventures of Sherlock Holmes","review":"Jules Verne's classic tale of five castaways on a (supposedly) deserted island is given the Saddleback Publishing 'Illustrated Classics' treatment in this 2007 release. Geared to classroom use, it aims at introducing young readers to classic novels.This Saddleback edition accurately and fairly dramatically portrays the efforts of five Union Army POWs who escape from a CSA camp using a hot-air balloon. Days later, they crashland in the Pacific and barely make it alive to an unknown island. Thanks to lead character Cyrus Harding, an engineer who is a combination of MacGyver and the Professor from 'Gilligan's Island,' the castaways are soon masters of the island with food, weapons, pottery, a water-powered elevator, etc. Yet time and again they are seem to have help from an unseen presence. Then pirates arrive on the scene and things turn really dicey.THE MYSTERIOUS ISLAND was one of Verne's most exciting novels, the Saddleback version being equally dramatic and fast-paced. The artwork is compelling and young readers should be caught up in the adventures of Harding & Company.My only beef is that Saddleback, once again, renames some of the characters. Harding, the genius heading up the castaways, was named Cyrus Smith in the 1874 original. Likewise Verne's Bonadventure Pencroff becomes Saddleback's Jack Pencroft.Having said that, I did enjoy THE MYSTERIOUS ISLAND. It should be a hit with readers in the 9-12 age category.

I was expecting a paperback version of the original story punctuated by some colorful illustrations. What I got was basically a comic book.The description states that the book \\"features classic tales retold with attractive color illustrations.\\" In plain English, that means the book is 70 pages of bold, cartoonish drawings that tell the story via \\"thought bubbles\\" like those you find in comic books. There are sporadic phrases from the original book sprinkled throughout, but not exactly as part of the story.I was very disappointed with this book.Also, part of the spine was torn slightly during transit, so I returned the book for a full refund. I have since purchased an illustrated paperback (what I was looking for in the first place) at Barnes & Noble."},{"Title":"Great Adventures of Sherlock Holmes","review":"When my son and husband chose The Great Adventures of Sherlock Holmes for our monthly book discussion, I was certain I'd be bored senseless but figured it was only fair that they choose some of the titles, too. Far from bored, however, I actually loved the droll accounts of Sherlock's sleuthing talents. In fact, as I read, I could &quot;hear&quot; a radio broadcast of the stories in my head. As it turns out, recordings of the mysteries are available, as are films of the adventures. It will be interesting to see how these compare to the version in my head.If you are sharing these stories with young readers, you may want to read the first story aloud. This proved helpful to my son, who initially had a little trouble &quot;getting into&quot; the rhythm of the narrative. After &quot;The Solitary Cyclist,&quot; however, he was happily on his own. He is now tackling a two-volume collection of Doyle's mysteries."},{"Title":"Great Adventures of Sherlock Holmes","review":"The Great Adventures of Sherlock Holmes is a fantastic book. Having amazing description I can paint a very detailed picture in my mind. Although it may have short stories in it, these are stories that have had a lot of thought put in to them. I can tell this by how amazing Sherlock Holmes is able to figure out his cases. He focuses on ever little detail to figure the most difficult cases. It's especially amazing how he figures it out so quickly. Hearing this it may seem as if it is impossible, but when you read the book, in the end, when Holmes tells the other characters how he figured out this case, he explains it so well that it is quite believable. This book is so great that I can't even explain the amount of talent was used to make these stories possible.Although this book was a wonderful book, it also had some down sides to it. When reading this book, in the beginning of each story, the author went a little too quickly in to the case so the reader doesn't understand what's going on until the middle of the story. But to make up for his rushed start the author explains the case with much detail and informing the reader on every little detail about the case. All in all, The Great Adventures of Sherlock Holmes is a very good book that I would recommend to anybody that likes mysteries, even if it does have some down sides."},{"Title":"Great Adventures of Sherlock Holmes","review":"I thought this was going to be the Jules Verne novel with some illustrations to go with it.

The Saddleback books are apparently a 21st Century attempt to ape the fondly remembered 'Classics Illustrated' comic books of the 1950s. This is the second Saddleback volume I've read and I have mixed feelings about it.The book throws readers a curve ball of on page 1; most of the characters had been renamed! Professor Lidenbrock is now Professor Van Hardwigg; Axel is Henry Lawson; etc. Why the name change?The Saddleback version generally follows Verne's plot with actual dialogue taken from the novel. The illustrations are so-so; very colorful, often amateurish yet sometimes effective. It's a pity the artist who did the cover art couldn't have done the inside illustrations as well.If this gets kids hooked on the classics, more power to 'em! On balance, I'd recommend the book although it is over-priced at $9.95."},{"Title":"Great Adventures of Sherlock Holmes","review":"Review by my 11-year-old son: This book is very bad!The graphics are like Japanese anime.

Those unidentified teachers and researchers have done a fair job of condensing the two stories and retaining somewhat of the flavor of Doyle's original texts.

A dismissal of worth. The total subjugation and repression felt by women of the post-colonial world is not without its listeners. Titsi Dangerembga's \\"Nervous Conditions\\"(NC) is the story of a determined young girl who manuevers both patriarchal and Imperial obstacles to obtain an ambigous future. Offering an answer to the question of how a person who is \\"double colonized\\"(233pc) can break free from the restraints of both neo-colonial and cultural barriers NC never the less leaves for the reader the issues of western education and the judeo-catholic religion as unresolved mechanisms of future restraints in its character's lives.\\" When Nervous Conditions was published in 1988, it added to the growing corpus of women's writing in Zimbabwe.\\"(debunk1) Explaining the controlling theme of the novel Kwame Appiah writes in the introduction,\\"while not specifically addressed to a western readership, the problems of racial and gender equity the text raises are not in any way unfamiliar to us.\\"(NCxi)Both Shani Mootoo's \\" Cereus Blooms at Midnight\\"(CBAM) published in 1996 and Arundhati Roy's \\"God of Small Things\\"(GOST) published in 1997 explore the theme of characters seeking to define themselves outside the traditional patterns of repression encountered universally by women in post-colonial society. This striking similiarity in the subject and themes of NC,CBAM and GOST makes for an interesting comparison. Ketu Katrak in an essay titled \\"Decolonizing Culture\\" warns against judgement,\\"One finds(1)little theoretical production of post colonial writers given the serious attention it deserves, or that it is dismissed as not theoretical enough by western standards; (2) the increasing phenomenon of using postcolonial texts as raw material for the theory producers and consumers of Western Academia; (3) theoretical production as an end in itself, confined to the consumption of other theorists who speak the same priveliged language in which obscurity is regularly mistaken for profundity. A near hedgemony is being established in contemporary theory that can with impunity ignore or exclude post-colonial writers essays, interviews and other cultural productions while endlessly discussing concepts of the 'other' of 'difference and so on\\" (239cr)It is with this warning against classification that a parallel can be drawn between the three novels and a unity of message defined in the texts.All three novels place Western education at the forefront of the story. By portraying abuse at the hands of the mimic-man (Bahbi) the contradiction between the value of western knowledge and the system of repression it represents is drawn. The patriarchal figure of Babamakura in NC is reconstituted in the figures of Chandin in CBAM and Papachi in GOST. Placing the mimic-man into a political context Frantz Fanon exhorts his \\"comrades\\" in the \\"Wretched of the Earth\\", \\"Let us not lose time in useless lament or sickening mimicry. Let us leave this Europe which never stops talking of man yet massacres him at every one of it's street corners, at every corner in the world.\\"(WE235)By portraying characters that have broken away from societal norms and found happiness the authors of CBAM and GOST confirm the possibility of an alternative to the cycle of female oppression that NC challenges but does not defeat. Vivian May describes CBAM's interpretation of transcendence by it's characters as,\\"an alternative epistemology and economy of being that rely upon notions of love and desire which do not uphold the dysfunctional family of empire\\"(dislocate) By choosing a lifestyle that is outside of the normal structure of social roles for its protagonists Mootoo and Roy have offered an alternative to Dangarembga's vision for hers. In NC Tambudzai explains herself when she says,\\" I was not sorry when my brother died. Nor am I apologising for my callousness, as you may define it, my lack of feeling.\\"(NC1) With this apology Tambudzai includes the readers in the story emphasising the importance of the subject. Tambudzai goes on to say,\\"my story is not after all about death, but about my escape and Lucia's: about my mother's and Maiguru's entrapment and about Nyasha's rebellion.\\"(NC1) NC's portrayal of the hoplessness of Tambudzai's mother and her aunt Maiguru are contrasted against the achievements of Tambudzai and Lucia but also tempered by the agony of Nyasha. CBAM also offers its interpretation of how a person can break free from the opression of cultural norms. Mr Tyler, an effeminate man, finds freedom by working in a field where he is the only male, he says,\\"I was, after all, the only Lantanacamaran man ever to train in the field of nursing.\\"(CBAM6) Being a male in a female dominated career Mr Tyler becomes a symbol for female repression as he struggles to understand his place in society. Otoh, Mr.Tyler's friend and love interest also has found a place outside of the traditional Patriarchal and Imperial confinements of the story. Describing Otoh's change from woman to man Mootoo writes,\\"The transformation was flawless. Hours of mind-dulling exercises streamlined Ambrosia into an angular, hard-bodied creature and tampered with the flow of whatever hormonal juices defined him.\\"(CBAM110) Alternately in GOST, the twins, Rahel and Estha also offer an idea of how to overcome entrenched societal strictures. Describing Estha's reaction on being reunited with his twin sister Roy writes,\\"It had been quiet in Estha's head until Rahel came.\\"(GOST16) Explaining the space occupied by Rahel in society Roy comments,\\"Rahel grew up without a brief...Without anybody who would pay her dowry and therefore without an obligatory husband looming on her horizon.\\"(GOST18) Freed from the patterns of Patriarchal repression Rahel and Estha live outside of the dominant culture,\\"So as long as she wasnt noisy about it, she remained free to make her own inquiries:...Into life and how it ought to be lived.\\"(GOST18)In answering the ambiguous ending to Dangarembga's NC Mootoo and Roy have employed the technique of \\"Magic-Realism\\" to offer an alternative narrative to overcoming the repression of \\"double colonization\\".Vivian May explains the use of supernatural events among post-colonial writers,\\"They see an imaginary space as offering opportunities to remember identities and histories differently.\\"(dislocate) Using magical and unreal events CBAM and GOST allow the reader to imagine a different reality, one that transcends normality and gives the reader the confidence to embrace a future that is optomistic and hopeful. Bahbi in his forward to \\"The Wretched of the Earth\\" says of the idea of using fantastical imagery and situations,\\"It is Fanon's great contribution to our understanding of ethical judgement and political experience to insistently frame his reflections on violence, de-colonization, national consciousness, and humanism in terms of the psycho-affective realm--the body, dreams, psychic inversions and displacement , phantasmatic political identifications.\\"(WExix) Answering NC with the use of psycho-affectivity both CBAM and GOST draw from the teachings of Fanon in an attempt at,\\"an engagement with(or resistance to) a given reality...\\"(WExix)Foremost of the themes of psycho-affectivity and magic realism used in CBAM is the setting of the story on the mythical island of Lantanamacara. By setting the story in a place that is not part of the known reality of the reader Mootoo provides the necessary backdrop for an escape from the accepted patterns of repression and control. Another more subtle note of magic realism occurs in the character of Otto. Born as a woman but living life as a man, his feminine qualities are supressed along with the memory of the community of his early years of life as a female.\\"So flawless was the transformation that even the nurse and doctor who attended the birth, on seeing him later, marvelled at their carelessness in having declared him a girl.(CBAM110) The inability of the people of Lantanamacara to remember that Otoh had originally been a female is one of several premises that would be hard to accept outside of a world colored by psycho-affectivity.GOST also offers its own magic realism in the setting of the abandoned home of Kari Saipu. Populated by the ghost of a white man who has \\"gone native\\" Roy compares the ghost to William Conrad's Kurtz in \\"The Heart of Darkness\\". Later the house becomes the reason for the death of Sophie Mol in her attempt to cross the river as well as the scene of Velutha's savage beating at the hands of the police. Explaining the place of the house in the story Roy writes,\\"Nobody went to Kari Saipu's house anymore. Vellya Paapen claimed to be the last human being to set eyes on it. He asaid that it was haunted. He had told the twins the story of his encounter with Kari Saipu's ghost.\\"(GOS189) Including the supernatural within the story GOST also engages the reader to think beyond the known and consider situations and outcomes outside of the normal human experience.Answering the questions left by NC, CBAM and GOST offer an avenue of understanding to how women can break free from oppression. Using the themes of magic realism, gender variance and love without restrictions Mootoo and Roy have provided an alternate vision to the issues brooched by NC. By depicting characters of ambigous sexual orientation Mootoo enlarges the scope of oppression by voicing the concerns of those outside of traditional sexual relationships. Roy, in her investigation into the \\"Love Laws\\" comments that they control,\\"Who should be loved, and how. And how much.\\"(GOST33) Offering another interpretation of how women are repressed in the control of their ability to love, GOST answers to NC with an additional aspect of female repression. Apparent in both the novel CBAM and GOST is the portrayal of relationships that are anathema to the judeo-christian tradition. Characters who have chosen relationships in direct opposition to religious dogma and found happiness is a direct refutation of a third oppressive structure that is unaddressed in NC."},{"Title":"Nervous Conditions Pb (Women's Press fiction)","review":"Set in the late 1960's -- 1970's, Tsitsi Dangarembga's 1988 novel \\"Nervous Conditions\\" (1988) tells the story of an adolescent girl growing up in rural Rhodesia (Zimbabwe). The author is a Zimbabwe native who earned a medical degree and lived in Germany and England before returning to her native country. She has become a full-time writer of novels, plays, and films. \\"Nervous Conditions\\" is the first book of a projected trilogy. The second book \\"The Book of Not\\" was published in 2006.Written in an appealingly simple and understated way, \\"Nervous Conditions\\" explores issues of cultural and gender relationships in colonial Rohdesia. It is a first-person narrative in the voice of Tambu, a grown woman whose age is not given, recounting and reflecting upon the events of her youth beginning in 1968 when Tambu was 13 and continuing for three years. At the end of the book, Tambu has received the rare opportunity to study at a Catholic girls' school that admits a small number of native African girls. But Tambu has already seen enough to know that the experience will not give her the life that she wants. She is apparently rejecting assimilation to Western culture in favor of the local life in which she was raised.The story pivots upon the death of Tambu's older brother Niamo who was attending a missionary school. With Niamo's death, a place opened up for Tambu, an intelligent and ambitious young woman, to attend the school under the sponsorship of her wealthy and British-educated uncle, Babamukura, who is the headmaster as well as the head of the family. Babamukara and his wife Maiguru have a daughter, Nyasha, who is Tambu's age and is also highly intelligent. Nyasha has become British in outlook from the five years her parents spent studying in London. Tambu has been raised on a poor rural commune that Dangarembga describes in detail. Her father, Babamukra's brother, is poor and unambitous while his wife is subservient but tries to do her best for her children.Tambu describes her story as \\"the story of four women whom I loved, and our men\\". (p.204) The four women her mother, her mother's younger pregnant sister, Lucia, her uncle's wife Maiguru and Nyasha, their daughter. Gender is a pervasive theme of the book as Tambu and each of the four women are portrayed as caught in and responding to a native Rhodesian society dominated by men which allows little room for the growth and autonomy of women. Tambu is beset af first by her brother and her father and their understanding of the role of women in the family. She continues to struggle with gender expectations as she attends the missionary school. Her friend Nyasha with her exposure to British culture contends and literally fights with her father while Nyaka's educated mother must also remain in her educated, domineering husband's shadow. Lucia, pregnant under questionable circumstances, is also dependent upon Babamukura. Each of the four women in this novel develop in varying degrees the ability to speak for themselves and, so to speak, to fight back.The other primary theme of this book is colonialism as Dangarembaba examines the relationship between the British and the native Rhodesians. Tambu's uncle Babamukra is the pivotal character. He has had the rare opportunity to study in England at the graduate level and to become respected and prosperous. He is the head of the family and it shows as he demands obeisance from his poorer relations, especially the women. He and his family have worked to become acculturated in the ways of the West. Throughout the book, it becomes increasingly apparent that he and his family are patronized and diminished by their British overlords. Dangarenrga guves great attention to the missiouary school system which, at its best, was open only to a small number of natives while carefully restricting the opportunities available to the selected few. The tension between British and native values together with gender relations works to ruin the life of Tambu's friend Nyaka and to radically change Tambu's own outlook on life as she comes to see the value of her native culture and to reject that of the British. There is a tension between the gender-related aspect of the story and the colonialist-related aspect of it that is not entirely resolved.Most of the time books with a heavily ideological component do not work for me as novels. This book is an exception. Dangaremrga's book moves quickly and her characters are portrayed sympathetically. The protagonists in the story come to life as people rather than as counters in the service on an ideological position. Tambu's voice and the choices she must make are portrayed in a convincing way. I learned much from this book's portrayal of mid-20th Century Rhodesia. Thus I found that Dangarembga successfully combined ideology with storytelling and character development in this book to create a successful, moving novel.Robin Friedman"},{"Title":"Nervous Conditions Pb (Women's Press fiction)","review":"TsiTsi Dangarembga has crafted a superb narrative of a family in the midst of sorting through the trials of colonial life in Southern Rhodesia (Zimbabwe). Telling the story from the point of view of the young Tambudzai gives her free reign to express a range of emotions and genres of experience, such as fear, guilt, pride, resentment, confusion, and acceptance. As Tambu she sometimes makes sharp political commentary in a tongue and cheek sort of way, but the sting is there nonetheless. The characterizations all convey layered symbolic meanings in terms of the larger issues of female entrapment with its corresponding male entrapment, as seen for example in the relationship of Babamukuru and his wife Maiguru. Nervous Conditions' universality lies in the realization that we all have \\"nervous conditions\\" in our lives based on not just the immediate family situation, but on larger hegemonically enacted ones as well."},{"Title":"Nervous Conditions Pb (Women's Press fiction)","review":"This is an engrossing book. The story details the life (and growth) of a young girl in a patriarchal culture. I cheered her every ambition, endeavor, and accomplishmnt. Her courage to move beyond her \\"station\\" in life is nothing but amazing. But it's not just her story - it belongs to all her female relations and how they accept or defy their expected place. Actually, it probably belongs to many women at one time or another. I look forward to reading the sequel with much anticipation."},{"Title":"Nervous Conditions Pb (Women's Press fiction)","review":"I recently read To Kill a Mockingbird, and it reminded me in many ways of this novel. Both are bildungsromans, told from the perspective of a young female protagonist. Both are marked by a gentle irony- Scout's descriptions of her schooling in the 1930's American South are paralleled by Tambu's description of Doris, the white woman who is shamed into paying for her education (\\"She patted me on the head and called me a plucky piccanin\\"). In many ways, though, I think Nervous Conditions is the superior novel. Atticus Finch is too perfect, the story of Boo Radley is too cute, and even with the unjustness of the trial, the novel seems to paint a too-flowery picture of the South. Nervous Conditions is a grittier and more challenging novel.The title comes from Frantz Fanon, the radical Algerian psychologist who campaigned for violent resistance to the evils of colonization. He writes that 'the condition of the colonized subject is a nervous one,\\" and in the appendix to his work he examines case studies of specific colonized subjects with severe nervous disorders. While most of the reviews have focused on Tambu, the pragmatic narrator, I think in many ways that Nyasha is the center of the novel. Tambu's cousin is brilliant, observant, a critical thinker, and a rebel- much of the novel's postcolonial discourse is presented through her. Her fall into a \\"nervous condition,\\" then, is both tragic and compelling, and the climax of the novel is one of the most beautifully realized scenes in any work of literature I have ever read. Tambu and Nyasha adopt different paths in combatting colonization, and while Nyasha's is perhaps more admirable, Tambu's is ultimately the most successful.Women's rights, the role of education, colonization and other wide-sweeping political issues permeate the novel, but the book is at heart a touching and often humorous coming-of-age story.

Tambudzai brings that balance well into perspective and it is a good read through and through and still holds her dignity and pride with a good balance.

A must read for any one in the African diaspora experiencing some kind of change in social class (e.g. being first in the family to attend college or graduate school) or otherwise having suspicions about the sources of their feelings of alienation. Specifically, this is an amazingly relevant depiction of the pain experienced by those who do as they're told and pursue education to \\"better themselves\\": the richness of this book's characters show just how many costs go unstated by those who have the privilege of not paying said costs and unacknowledged by those who haven't had to go through the violent process of being harshly disciplined into being acceptable by the dominant segments of society.Nyasha's character resonated most with me: I, too, feel frustrated by what seems to be an obvious oppressive reality around me as well as the extreme deprivation that can encourage oppressed people to appear complicit. Additionally, most of the other characters also helped open my eyes to the ways that I have failed to understand why people with situations different from my own can seem complicit in their own subordination. The discussion of how gender plays out also may be eye-opening for those with little clarity on the violence that seeming innocuous hierarchies produce (e.g. even \\"good\\" people can enact said violence). I plan on reading the sequel, although I've heard it's not as good.I also recommend this book to:-Any person who doesn't understand the severity of the violence of colonization on those who have been colonized (e.g. people who aren't part of a colonized group, people who firmly believe today's racism is \\"less bad\\" than yesterday's)-Those who don't see why people in the African diaspora are often concerned with what often is written off as mere \\"identity politics\\" (as opposed to a legitimate sense of loss)-Any person who is having a hard time understanding how \\"nice\\" and \\"good\\" people are still among the hands that enact violence against colonized peoples-Any person who is having a hard time understanding how a \\"minority\\" can be among the hands that enact violence against (their own) colonized people (e.g. people who firmly believe in a rigid category of \\"sell-outs\\")"},{"Title":"Nervous Conditions Pb (Women's Press fiction)","review":"Nervous Conditions by Tsitsi Dangarembga; 1989In Dangarembga's novel, Nervous Conditions, we see the lives of several African women living in 1960's Rhodesia. The cultural clash felt in Rhodesia due to colonization by the British is apparent in the lives of all the women. As they each struggle with social and personal identity in a world of patriarchal pressures from both their Shona heritage and British education we see a complex array of outcomes and developments.The novel by Zimbabwe native Tsitsi Dangarembga was the first novel published by a Zimbabwean woman. In the novel, Dangarembga pulls from her own personal experiences and imagination to inform the reader about the lives of Zimbabwean women in colonial Rhodesia. The result is a kaleidoscope of personalities, issues and lessons. The novel not only questions \\"western\\" notions of femininity but also those of Shona culture and provides the reader with a new, more holistic understanding of what it means to be \\"feminine\\"."},{"Title":"Nervous Conditions Pb (Women's Press fiction)","review":"I studies this book for my Post-colonial literature class.

While much of the scholarly work focuses on Dangarembga's use of space and body in ridding onceself of a \\"double colonization\\" - that of Britain and that of patriarchy - my work focuses on how European objects are ironically used as accomplices to this desire. My point is that while a 'simple' read for high schoolers or older, there is also a lot of meat that you can grab into analyzing this book! It really lets you appreciate the masterpiece that it is."},{"Title":"Nervous Conditions Pb (Women's Press fiction)","review":"I think the other reviewers have covered everything that needs to be said about this novel - and quite well I might add. After having the novel on my bookshelf for 2 years, I finally got a chance to read it over the Christmas holiday - I regret that I waited so long. I was so touched by this story. I wasn't sure if I would be able to relate to the characters at all, because their world is very different from my own. But I found myself identifying strongly with Nyasha (sorry if I mispelled her name) and by the end of the book I was crying for both her and myself. This book is about (in my opinion) oppression of the self and I think that this is a topic that is accesible to a lot of different people. I think that for young women it is especially salient.

It is a dilemma for African children who are seeking education who often find that in adopting the new culture of the colonizers, they often can no longer associate with the traditional ways of their own people. This superbly written book will touch any reader to the core. The writer clearly dissected the negative effects of colonialism and the settler-politics that caused so much strife in Zimbabwe, creating two tragedies in the persons of Ian Smith and Robert Mugabe. We see those consequences in Triple Agent Double Cross, No Longer at Ease, The Oaf.

I understand the argument that the novel is more into telling instead of showing, but I tend to disagree a bit. The novel hinges on the pretext that the central characters are cerebral, and that their intellectual complexity is misunderstood by colonial doctors. For me, the action that was taking place in the mind, whether we saw it or were told about it from an outsider perspective (that of the narrator, who is often an outsider and an observer), was very powerful.Generally, it has taken me a little while to adjust to African novels, which I read intermittently throughout high school and college, but this one is a wonderful place to start for people who do take time to adjust to the more traditional style. Since the narrator has a Western education, the novel reads more like a Western novel...in a way, this makes the story much more heartbreakingly real, but it also makes it accessible to Western audiences.

Nyasha's parents went to England to go to university, while Tambudzai and her family stayed at the farm and kept up a working life with fields and animals.As those two social itineraries meet up again later in the 60s, not long before the war of liberation, gender roles and cultural forces start changing while the novel simultaneously explores the territory of the family and how communal life and personal life become entangled in larger historical contexts.Tambudzai and Nyasha find each other again after the long absence of Nyasha, but with the return of Nyasha's family has also come the ghost of hitherto unknown potentials and with that both new possibilities, new demands, and new layers of friction with the existing, rural way of life of Tambudzai's family.On the surface the plot is quiet and slow in unfolding, but it has an explosive character when read as a family drama, and in that sense it reminds me of books like Sefi Atta's \\"Everything Good Will Come\\" and J. Nozipo maraire's \\"Zenzele: A Letter for My Daughter\\" which map similar territories from the perspective of African women.Nervous Conditions deals in transitions. Kids turning into teens. Women turning from houseworkers to students. Countries moving from colonialism towards independence. Men moving into themselves to shelter from oncoming demands and the push for their family thrones.And while two family tragedies, one sudden and another creeping, color the book with an outer, tangible drama, the inner tour is where Dangarembga has managed to pull of a work of brilliant (almost) feminist fiction.Women struggle to free themselves most of all from the chains laid on them by the thoughts of their men, the family leaders, the ones with the traditional sources of power and authority. However, it is not a straight-forward movement, it is more like a rising tension and a shaking deadlock, where it can be hard to reach and take what you have fought for once it is within your grasp:\\"Since the thoughts of my mother had belonged to her father first and then to her husband and thus had not been her own, she found it hard to make a decision\\".For the men the decisions are no less harder to make, but they mostly decide under either direct or more subtle social pressure. Tambudzai's father, for instance, struggles to come terms with whether his daughter should go to school and as a consequence become a fruitful investment in the future - or if he should keep her working around the house to make her a capable wife for whom a fine number of cattle could be won. Take chances on the new or go with conformity?It all comes down to change. Larger scale change which was happening in not only Rhodesia but in the world around it as well in the 60s. Changing gender and family patterns most of all.But what I really like about Nervous Conditions - and the title, by the way, is a fine summary of both the social contexts and the psychological mindscapes in the book - is how change is not a big external mechanism. Change requires action and the ability of a person to see herself enter into new situations. In other words: Change requires agency.Obviously agency has its limitations, and those are always defined by who is acting, where she acts, how she acts, in relation to whom, and when (and then some). In 1960s Rhodesia, societal structures and the built-up landscape of institutions that went beyond the family were controlled by the colonial rule, and so it also is in Nervous Conditions.Family matters are still distinctly local, full of long-running formal relations and clear divisions of labour, which many of the women in the book openly find oppressive, but for those with social aspirations, the real ladder is not in their back years - it is firmly planted in white man's land.This does not make the ladder unclimbable, it just makes getting to it and then up it a different route than possible routes in the spheres of the family. For any climber, who is not the older brother and thus the obvious candidate, this will almost inevitably cause two different social processes to conflict, and different aspects of such conflicts play out in Nervous Conditions.It is a story in which moving up in the world by means of education does not mean the same for black girls as for whites. If you are a Tambudzai or a Nyasha you risk ending up in an in-between world, neither accepted by those friends you grew up with nor accepted by those you try to grow into, and as identities start becoming frail and floating people begin struggling with their senses of selves.Ultimately this neither-here-nor-there state of being is what Tsitsi Dangarembga portrays in this emotional and sensitive tribute to women, and while the conditions brought upon them might make some readers edgy, nervous, at times enraged, Dangarembga has brought a powerful voice to people she admires and respects and out of that has come an important, beautiful book."},{"Title":"Nervous Conditions Pb (Women's Press fiction)","review":"Frank T. Scruggs, M.A.Book ReviewOctober 11, 2007Nervous ConditionsI really enjoyed reading this book and of the details she wrote about this family reminds me of my own. As an African-American growing up roughly in the same time period I could see how bothNyasha and Tambu just becoming into a political awareness would begin to see the world take on a new shape.The strength of the African family is that the extended family is viewed as a unit within the larger society with legitimate head. As in the book as in my own family, problems were mediated by theElders of the family and each person functions as a part of the unit demonstrates a commitment to the group as opposed to the individual.The plan to educate the children in order to help provide for the future benefit of the family shows the adherence to perpetuating the family group (first through Nhamo then Tambu after Nhamo's death. As Isaid before as an African American, I don't think we're as far removed from African culture. I think that the author also wanted to demonstrate that the characters Maiguru and Babamukuru benefited a great deal living in England and learning about British culture. The author also show that Babamukuru and Maiguru were already rooted and grounded in the African culture and education, the experience and contact with the distant British culture therefore one could say to be a growth experience and an expansion of their knowledge.Upon return to Africa, Babamukuru wanted and expected Nyasha to act as an African girl which she was incapable of doing because she was socialized into a British girl. The character Nyasha was in her early formative years and lost her African culture after assimilating into the British culture. The fight between Nyasha (when it became physical) is also representative of the clash between distant cultures where one culture tries to subject the other culture. The fight broke out when Babamukuru began to beat Nyasha but she decided to fight back (she rebelled against his authority). It also shows that in Nyasha it is a defense of which she is and on the part of Babamukuru, it is to subject her to his will. In culture clashes, the dominant culture uses power and authority to maintain its hegemonic relationship with different cultures (e.g., Britain and her colonies, America and her protectorates) quite often through economics and or violence and military force. From my perspective, I' think that the clash between Nyasha and Babamukuru serves as a metaphor of the clash between the British and African cultures.The character Tambu grew up as an African girl and remains grounded in African culture therefore when she makes contact with the European culture she grows and remained African unlike her cousin Nyasha. Nyasha is not really part of the British culture and not quite African either. What she does have however is an awareness of the social ills brought about by colonialism. This awareness, I think, brings about sadness caused by the isolation from both worlds while living among those steeped in the African culture. It is this very isolation and sadness that causes her to rebel against her assimilation and mourn the loss of her African culture, which was her birthright.Overall, I think this is an excellent novel. I found the book quite riveting and dynamic. I also think that anyone interested in cross-cultural communication, anthropology, sociology and family would enjoy this book and benefit from the ideas that the author seeks to convey."},{"Title":"Nervous Conditions Pb (Women's Press fiction)","review":"This novel is loosely autobiographical and takes place in the 60's and 70's in colonial Zimbabwe, then called Rhodesia.

A country hungry for independence and a woman starving herself to suppress her pain is just one example of the dichotomous network of upheavals and conflicts woven into this powerful social commentary.The rebellious and head-strong Tambu spares no reader the pain of suffering along with her as she delves deep into her emotional well to describe her disdain for a sibling who has betrayed her, her family that revels in her misery, and as she searches for true freedom from psychological and mental bondage. It is the astonishing individuality and insightful deliberations of the narrator that establishes the tone as the reader is drawn into discussions of domestic violence, depression, and survival. To remain a strong, Black, connected woman in a society that has eaten the very being of those around her is Tambu's greatest obstacle. While others have succumbed to the lore of the oppressors humiliation and degradation, Tambu survives, calling upon a sense of history and identity not of her time. It is surely the knowledge of the ancestors that has been imparted to her that has been held deep within her very soul that gives her more maturity, knowledge and stamina than those around her who have come to identify themselves through the bluest eye of the oppressor.Nervous Conditions shows that imperialism is not just an economic form of bondage, but also a sociological one in which its captors suffer exponentially from the rape of cultural and spiritual norms. Dangarembga's novel is a brilliantly painted picture of the human spirit excelling in the face of resistance."},{"Title":"Nervous Conditions Pb (Women's Press fiction)","review":"The story about a young woman hungry for an education, though odds attempt to halt her. As Tambu grew up her family was faced with the reality of having two children wanting an eductation but only having the money for one to go. As the times permitted Tambu's brother was sent to school. Tambu then faced the incredible task of funding her own education by means of growing crops. Tackling issues such as sexual repression, the roles of the sexes in society and phycological disection, this period of the story alone would give anybody interested in cultural motives for sex roles a pregnant amount to bite into. Also dealing with issues of British Imperialism and the British spheres of influence with a different culture. This offers yet another aspect of the book for people interested in phycological angles of reading something to sink their teeth into. It is especially interesting since Tambu is a young girl, still developing her ideals, morals, ethics and goals for life.

Even after finishing the book, I still felt like I didn't know Tambudzai as a character because it seems that she is always naive and confused, and following behind in the footsteps of someone else - in this case, Nyasha.

Its deep involvment with the meaningful place-and-time of the setting notwithstanding, this novel has all the powerful nuances of a Bildungsroman, facing anguishes and dilemmas (inferiority complex, origin-versus-progress, desire to break out) that are part of our life. And if women from all over the world will find their own experiences of discrimination mirrored in those lived by Tambu and the other female characters, men will meet the manifolded, powerful portrays of male chatacters who are all bound to &quot;carry on the tradition in the normal, unanalytic male fashion&quot;...A &quot;free-your-mind&quot; reading to everyone!"},{"Title":"Nervous Conditions Pb (Women's Press fiction)","review":"I learned some interesting things about Africa and indigineous vs. colonized society, and I felt like, after shutting the book, I had expanded my knowledge in an area I will never truly be able to understand.As far as story goes within the novel, I felt like I was getting a little too much &quot;tell&quot; instead of &quot;show,&quot; and that it was almost set up in vignettes as opposed to a whole novel. The last paragraph made me feel like the novel wasn't ending, but merely closing a chapter.All in all, I would say read it, for it isn't a story one often hears, and it was very interesting, but read it more for expansion than story."},{"Title":"Nervous Conditions Pb (Women's Press fiction)","review":"Tambu, as the storyteller in this book was able to tell the story in a way that made the reader realize what is good and bad about colonization of third world countries and the lasting effect it can have on the country and the people that are colonized. I know because I am from a country that was a British colony."},{"Title":"Nervous Conditions Pb (Women's Press fiction)","review":"I've always considered myself to be very understanding of women, especially women of the same stature and situation as the female characters of the book, but the book did expand my understanding of their condition. When I read the book I saw my mother who grew up in South Africa under situations similar to Tambu's. Although Tambu manages to rise from her condition with something on her hands, an education that is, most of these women get cought on the situation and they never escape it. I could relate to the book because I've seen how women are expected to conform to a male dominated community where they are not expected to question the men in their lives. As I've lived and am still living in modern South Africa for my whole 19 years I've seen and still see the Nyasha's that have to deal with the same men as in the book and still expected to be modern women. I found the book to be very true of the African women's situation and saw a reflection of somebody I know in Jeremiah. Here is a man who had to live in his brothers shadow for all his life. He is poor and lazy, and the only thing that he knows he has control over are the women in his life. I am not trying to sympathise with the character but his situation on the book should be understood. As a modern African man I've learnt to treat women as equals and although that may be there still exist a group of men who can't handle the truth. Tis book will help a lot of people in understanding how women, especially in rural communities, had to live and still live in Southern Africa. A powerful book and a great asset to African literature!"},{"Title":"Nervous Conditions Pb (Women's Press fiction)","review":"The troubles and turmoil of life often present us with guiding burdens, mountains that not only seem but are truly impossible to climb, and boundaries put in place to check even the strongest of wills. These mountains, boulders, and impassable rivers serve as a standard, a ceiling and a foundation; created by the society in which we take our very breath. So when we find ourselves stuck in the very system that we create, who can we blame? Who can we turn to for rescuing? These are the very questions that narrator Tambudzai learns to ask in Tsitsi Dangarembga's novel NERVOUS CONDITIONS.Throughout her young adult life, Tambudzai witnesses many cultural tendencies of her people and struggles internally with what she is being taught versus what she observes and believes to be right. Aside from her Rhodesian homeland being colonized by the British, she also wrestles with getting an education in a country where an education is seen as wasted on women. The role of men over women in this very patriarchal society serves as the backbone of NERVOUS CONDITIONS and operates as a means to compare different women's struggle to survive that cast-iron system. Through Tambudzai's eyes, readers see how her cousin Nyasha rebels against her father - the family leader, proclaimed prince, and headmaster of the school at the Mission. Readers see the difference between Tambudzai's subservient mother and her mother's defiant sister. We also see how this society treats a woman just as educated as her husband. Following Tambudzai as she progresses towards higher learning and gains a deeper understanding of the world that surrounds her, literary audiences discover just how suffocating it is to deal with the burdens of simply surviving.Many themes course through NERVOUS CONDITIONS making it an excellent novel for discussion and evaluation. Aside from the obvious men/women theme, a few other issues in the novel are the dangers and benefits of colonization, the necessity of education, and Christianity vs. traditional African religions. I also liked the importance of food and the role it played throughout the novel, especially at the end with Nyasha's rebellion. Exceptionally written, Dangarembga's novel, although about the learning period during a young teenager's life, is not child's play. This is a very adult novel filled with mature situations and intellectual food for meditation. The characters are well developed and the author takes time to draw scenes for her audience. You can see the poverty when she shows it to you just as well as you can see the surplus when it exists. Never have I read a novel that so intensely and effectively relays the burdens some people bear up under to simply be.Reviewed by Natasha T.of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers"},{"Title":"Nervous Conditions Pb (Women's Press fiction)","review":"The voice of the narrator, plantive and engaging, retrospective and sensitive, is the jewel of the story. Although her lovely spirit and shrewd perspective on people/relationships propelled me through the book at a rapid pace, I found the plot quite empty. The story line, mostly founded on mundane details of her challenging daily life, feels dull and predictable. However, in spite of the lack of plot, the most important aspect of the book-- its main value to many readers-- is its thematically rich stew of commentary on gender roles/relations, sexuality, race, class, poverty, family dynamics, love, education, etc.I gave book 3 stars because, although i fell in love with the narrator, the plot was too meandering and vacant to really make a good story. I also felt the ending, like the plot, was sort of half an ending and very lacking. In the end though, the story, themes, and the characters were so rich that they will stick with me for quite a while.Read this book if you fulfill at least one of the following:1) You want to read a tale that tackles intimate yet universal themes2) You want to hear the too rarely heard voice of an african woman3) You want a book that is poetic and academic at the same time4) You are looking for an emotionally intricate read of personal dynamics5) You need a speedy read for an airplane ride, book report, etc6) You love books with insightful, shrewd observations of very real characters and family dynamics"},{"Title":"Nervous Conditions Pb (Women's Press fiction)","review":"For anyone who lived under colonial occupation or grew up in those parts of the world where the resident population has been made alien in their own country will appreciate this book. The writing is superb and the story was most touching. Tsitsi Dangarembga really gets at the essence of what colonialism and settler-politics meant in Zimbabwe. It's a personal story about a girl growing into a woman and having to confront the fact that her society and family are not the most girl-friendly. She struggles for an education but then what kind of an education is it when her worth as a human being is questioned by essentially foreign institutions. I cried so much at the end of this story. It reminded me very much of my own experience in missionary school.

I totally disagree with people namely one who said the book was flat and inconsistent. Things like this actually do happen and people do actually live their lives like this and this is Tsitsi's take on these issues and hers alone. I don't know, I could go on and on.

The story is engaging, the main characters sympathetic. But what kept me reading was the deft folding-in of a hundred little details of Zimbabwean life and culture.It's a consciousness-raising novel, trumpeting its themes -- feminism, colonialism, and mental illness -- more loudly and more often than the modern reader expects. But it's not naive about those themes. Colonialism, as seen here, impoverishes and distorts traditional society; but traditional society so oppresses women that their only route to power and independence is through the colonial education system.As other reviewers have noted, this is a suitable book for teens, in that is neither obscene nor violent. More than that, it's authentic foreign literature with a heroine their age. -- Suzanne Demitrio, demitrio@hotmail.com"},{"Title":"Nervous Conditions Pb (Women's Press fiction)","review":"You know, I was really looking forward to writing this review. &quot;Nervous Conditions&quot; is a truly wonderful book that manages to provide endless topics for discussion. All pleasure at the prospect writing this review was taken from me, however, as I was finishing the book this afternoon. I was reading while having dinner at a local restaurant when a woman came in and was seated at a table near me. I noticed that she kept looking at the book, trying to see the cover. Eventually I looked up and made eye contact. She looked squarely at me and said: &quot;You can't possibly understand that book.&quot; I didn't ask if this was because I am not black or because I am not a woman (she was both). I also didn't ask if it was because I wasn't raised in Zimbabwe, or a pre-industrial society, or in the sixties, or go to a medical school in London (she, presumably, also experienced none of these, except for being a black woman). I simply told her that I thought I would go ahead and finish the book as I was so close anyway. I then proceeded to not look up from the book until I left the restaurant.Now I feel as if by writing a review I will be trying to prove to the world that perhaps I do understand. That I am so sympathetic and empathic that I can completely understand the emotions in the story I have just read (for the third time). In short, I now feel as if writing a review would be a defensive act. I don't like being put in that position by a woman I don't know who said six words to me in a restaurant.All I will say for now is that this is a wonderful book. I recommend it for everybody.

It indirectly asks whether or not children who are seeking an education are selling their cultures out, to become more like their colonisers. And when they adopt this new culture why they no longer associate with their own. It shows from babamukuru's generation up until the present won, the problems that a family had to endure. As mentioned before it most especially questions the validity of maintaining a way of life. It could also be regarded as a parallel to what was ocuring in Zimbabwe at the time. In essence it presents the question of the colonised mind... Good read all in all."},{"Title":"Nervous Conditions Pb (Women's Press fiction)","review":"&quot;I was not sorry when my brother died.&quot; Who would want their brother to die or even feel that way about a sibling? Tsitsi Dangarembga starts &quot;Nervous Conditions&quot; that way to catch the attention of her readers, and she did a fine job in catching mine. All the characters of this novel have determination and overcome difficult obstacles. Babamukuru is the uncle in the novel who is an inspiration for his niece, Tambudzai. She admires him: &quot;Babamukuru, I knew, was different. He hadn't cringed under the weight of his poverty. Boldly, Babamukuru had defied it.&quot; Tambudzai bases her decision to go to school on the fact that her uncle has come to be someone everyone admires and trusts. She not only proves to her family that she can get an education, but she proves to herself that she can get out of the pool of poverty and ignorance. She begins her mission to raise money for school after she convinces her father to give her a plot of land to plant her own crops. Dangarembga describes in her book the work that Tambudzai puts into her field. &quot;By the time the sun rose I was in my field, in the first days hoeing and clearing; then digging holes thirty inches apart, with a single swing of the hoe, as we had been taught in our gardaen periods at school; then dropping the seeds into them, two or three at a time, and covering them with one or two sweeps of my foot; then waiting for the seeds to germinate and cultivating and waiting for the weeds to grow and cultivating again.&quot; Her brother, on the other hand, receives the opportunity to get an education without having to work. Unfortunately, because of health difficulties he dies, and as a result she gets the opportunity to prove to her uncle that she is capable of achieving in school as well as in life. Moving to the mission gives her the chance to learn about her uncle's family as well as learning to adapt to different environment that is beyond where she comes from. Learning that not all families are perfect, she is faced with her cousin's eating disorder and the fact that her uncle will not tolerate any of his children to rebel against him or do anything to give his family a gad name. He hits his own daughter because he does not stand for her to raise her voice. &quot;Babamukuru, gathering himself within himself so that his whole weight was behind the blow he dealt Nyasha's face. 'Never,' he hissed. 'Never,' he repeated, striking her other cheek with the back of his hand, 'speak to me like that.'&quot; Such conflict within a family she admired was hard for Tambudzai to deal with or understand. In reading &quot;Nervous Conditions,&quot; I have come to understand that cultures may be different but at the same time similar. There were instances that I felt I understood what characters were feeling for a minute. Take for example when Tambudzai felt no one had confidence in her and in what she was doing for herself. Having no one believe in you can encourage you to do more for yourself. That's what having self-confidence is all about. I felt that Tambudzai demostrated that through out the book as she was faced with many obstacles she eventually overcame. I recommend this book to anyone who loves to read or does not like to read. It grabs your attention in the beginning and takes you along on every adventure the characters surpass."},{"Title":"Nervous Conditions Pb (Women's Press fiction)","review":"Seeing no customer reveiws from Africa I feel obliged to give my point of veiw. My brother bought the book as part of his english course at university. I was really not interested in reading it as I had a bad experience with a similarly themed book - Down Second Avenue by Ezekiel Mphahlele. I found DSA to be overly inflamitory in an already uneasy political climate. Were DSA centered on the problems of the country as a whole and felt rather rushed; NC was more free flowing and people orientated ahich made it a much beter book in my oppinion.

It's amazing, first of all, to get a glimpse of Zimbabwean culture with both its beauty and its ugliness. But what I loved about the book was the protagonist's struggle to advance herself and the questions she has after she has succeeded. This young woman, Tambu, recognizes the sexism in her culture very early on and feels her father and brother most acutely represent that insidious quality. One scene that touched me deeply was this: Tambu cannot continue going to school because there is only enough money to send her brother. Railing against this unfairness, she takes it upon herself to raise the money. Her father wants to forbid her from trying, and her brother sabotages her effort. Yet, Tambu still manages to succeed.Tambu and her family also struggle with poverty, and their only hope is Tambu's uncle, Babamukuru. Tambu and her entire family idolize Babamukuru, especially when he gives Tambu's brother a wonderful opportunity. Eventually, through bad circumstances, Tambu is given the same opportunity. She succeeds, but along the way, she questions how her success is changing her, making her less able to relate to her family. She also begins to see her uncle for who he is and understands the reason his household, which should be gloriously happy due to their blessings, is deeply troubled.Any woman who has climbed out of poverty and moved away from her family's dysfunction, only to find herself stuck between two worlds, should enjoy Tambu's story and relate to Tambu's questions."},{"Title":"Nervous Conditions Pb (Women's Press fiction)","review":"\\"Nervous Conditions\\" by Tsitsi Dangeremba begins with the harsh words, \\"I was not sorry when my brother died.\\" These words set the tone for the emotional journey into the communal lands that surrounded Umtali, Tanzania. The story centers on the thirteen-year-old adolescent, Tambudzai, who seeks an education not only to prove to herself she could overcome the burdens of poverty, but also to show her family that hard work, self-confidence, and motivation is all one needs to succeed. Tambudzai's determination is seen early in the book when she grows maize to earn her school fees, because there was just enough family money to pay her brother's school fees. On page twenty Dangeremba shows how dedicated Tambudzai was to her field: \\"By the time the sun rose I was in my field, in the first day hoeing and clearing; then digging holes thirty inches apart, with a single swing of the hoe, as we had been taught in our garden periods at school; then dropping the seeds into them, two or three at a time, and covering them with one or two sweeps of my foot; then waiting for the seeds to germinate and cultivating and waiting for the weeds to grow and cultivating again.\\"Although the conditions Tambudzai describes as she becomes a woman may enrage you, one must understand the patriarchal traditions of the African culture. This leads to the ultimate question for Tambudzai and many African women: Is oppression by my colonizers more acceptable than oppression by my own culture? This question can lead one to explore many issues, but the most important lesson is not to let success (education) form a barrier between you and where you came from. Therefore learning and adopting ways of a new culture should not cause an individual to no longer associate with their own culture.As an African American reader I liked this book because it shines a light on African culture, which is a part of my history; also being a female I was able to directly relate to Tambudzai's feelings of oppression. Another good point about the book is the use of vivid imagery. In chapter one Tambudzai discusses why her brother did not like riding the bus home at the end of term; she says, \\"He did not like traveling by bus because, he said, it was too slow. Moreover, the women smelt of unhealthy reproductive odours, the children were inclined to relieve their upset bowels on the floor, and the men gave off strong aromas of productive labour.\\" On the other hand, one confusing part about the reading is the use of Shona terms, which is one of the languages spoken in Tanzania, throughout the book. This slowed my reading down because I found myself searching for context clues to define the word. It would have been much easier to have a translation in parenthesis next to the word or a glossary in the appendix defining each term."},{"Title":"Nervous Conditions Pb (Women's Press fiction)","review":"Disturbing but honest look at the struggles of identities in the face of colonialism."},{"Title":"Nervous Conditions Pb (Women's Press fiction)","review":"The novel Nervous Conditions is a challenging but inspiring journey that describes the 'struggle' Tambudzai, a black female, in a male-dominering culture.

It has moments of promise, but never really measures up to those moments, in my opinion. First, from reading about this novel on Amazon and in the materials from the McDougal-Littell literature English materials used at the high school where I taught last year, I thought Nervous Conditions was going to be an edgy, anti-patriarchy book filled with lots of conflict and rage and revelation (a sort of Rage Against the Machine meets PJ Harvey in novel form). But it is not that type of book at all. It is more like a Judy Blume book written about 1960s Rhodesia. This could work for me if Dangarembga was consistent in her narrative approach, but she is not. (And granted, I realize she wrote this novel when she was only 25 years old, so it is understandable that she was still &quot;finding her voice.&quot;) Dangarembga flirts with moments of powerful political writing with the character of Nyasha, but never really goes anywhere with it in the book. Examples of this abound: Nyasha confronts Babamakuru, colonialism, patriarchal values several times in the book, but Dangarembga never takes us anywhere with these confrontations. And in terms of the characters themselves: I have the distinct sense that all of the characters are just &quot;voices&quot; in Dangarembga's head, parts of herself, and she had trouble developing them into real people on the page. I do not get a coherent picture of Babamukuru, Nyasha, Tambu, or Tambu's family from Dangarembga's descriptions. In addition, there is much confusing inconsistency with the characters' actions, thoughts, and behaviors. Babamakuru gets violently mad on one page and on the next page he is calm. Babamukuru's wife hates being oppressed by the patriarchy of colonialism and tribal ritual on one page and a few pages later she is happily making dinner for Babamukuru. And Tambu's character seems almost incredulously naive about everything that is going on in the book. The Judy Blumishness of her thoughts just bug me after a while. And finally, the plot: It's so slow and never really goes anywhere. The wandering, unclimatic ending of Nervous Conditions is perfect, because it fits with the whole way the novel was written. Definitely not one I'd want to teach."},{"Title":"Fort Ancient Cultural Dynamics in the Middle Ohio Valley (Monographs in World Archaeology)","review":"Excellent for those interested in Ft.

His treatise upon negligence and judicial discretion reaches back to Roman foundations (even back to Adam and Eve, p. 27) and ends with modern theories on fault and negligence. Parisi's work is historical, comparative and critical. It was and is a challenging book.In the main the book is structured chronologically. After a short introduction the author describes the early roots of liability, starting with the biblical lex talonis. He then turns to Roman law, to its adoption in medieval civil law and to canon law. Part I ends with the sixteenth century, stressing the achievements of Donellus (for whose ideas the author shows much sympathy (pp. 130-31)). Part II explains how natural lawyers dealt with the problem of fault and the difficulties in setting their ideas into the civil law codifications, that is the French Civil Code and the German BGB. In part III the author leaves the civil law systems and focuses on the development of modern common law, concentrating on its American form. When in part IV the reader is confronted with contemporary theories on negligence, he or she will look at them with much deeper, much &quot;older&quot; knowledge.The strength of Parisi's work lies in his description of Roman law and in his ability to show its influence on the development. of the common law of torts as well as of civil tort law systems. Even where no direct influence of Roman law is shown, the work gives us a clear view of the striking parallels legal systems develop when confronted with the problem of negligence. But Parisi's intention goes further than giving mere descriptions of other people's ideas. His deep insight into the subject enables him to evaluate and criticize the different concepts. In the end, the reader understands why the unsolved riddles of negligence are still unsolved and thus (particularly if he or she has a civil law background) will have a greater tolerance towards the judge's discretion in negligence cases.Kerstin StrickBonn University"},{"Title":"The Life of the Mind: Volume One, Thinking","review":"This book does so much in such a small space. It is at once an introduction to much of Western philosophy and an original treatise on many fundamental philosophical questions. Like her other books, Arendt focuses here more on philosophy as it applies to a person rather than more theoretical matters such as metaphysics. Everybody should read this book. I had it for a sophomore-level philosophy class, and I have found myself coming back to it time and time again for the next 8 years."},{"Title":"The Life of the Mind: Volume One, Thinking","review":"In her typical straight-to-the-point style of writing, Arendt explores some of the most philosophically important questions asked since antiquity. She guides us through the ages of development on topics such as freewill, time, and Being. She is one of the most important thinkers, not of the 20th century, but of all \\"time\\". This is Arendt for the philosopher/thinker, not the political scientist. From Heraclitus to Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Arendt leaves no great thinker's stone unturned. I've read a lot of books, and this is probably one of the most important. Does she give us any answers to these important questions? NO. However, she shows that there are no answers to these questions, only better questions to be asked."},{"Title":"The Life of the Mind: Volume One, Thinking","review":"It seems to me that Hannah Arendt's thought is at its strongest( and also its weakest) when it does not confine itself to the world of pure metaphysical abstraction, but rather addresses historical realities and concepts. The Arendt of 'The Origins of Tolitarianism' and of 'The Human Condition' brings a tremendous power of thought to the analysis of phenomena of the real world. In this work there is primarily ' thinking about thinking' and the connection with historical realities, individual personalities is not central. Therefore the reading of the work it seems to me becomes more an exercise in that metaphysical abstract never- never land where nothing can be firmly affirmed or falsified.It thus seems to me that this text is best read as a kind of poetic inspirational work, that does provide understanding and insight into thinking and the world of the mind, but which does not fundamentally provide ' truth'. My guess is Arendt would greatly object to this definition of her enterprise. And my sense is that in this work what she was really trying to do is make her bid to be among those system- producers who stand at the center of the long philosophical tradition in the West.I say this when I myself find Arendt an exalted and inspiring thinker, one who inspires me to thought of my own. I will just bring one passage, in my opinion, a key one from the work so that the reader can have a feel of what she is doing.\\"If thinking is an activity that is its own end and if the only adequate metaphor for it, drawn from our ordinary sense experience, is the sensation of being alive, then it follows that all questions concerning the aim or purpose of thinking are as unaswerable as questions about the aim or purpose of life.\\""},{"Title":"The Life of the Mind: Volume One, Thinking","review":"I came to this book still quite skeptical of Arendt's writing style and intellectual caliber; several years earlier I had attempted to read her book 'The Human Condition' and it underwhelmed me with its stilted writing style. But I was pleasantly surprised and even delighted almost from the first few pages of this work. This book was a complete intellectual delight, relatively easy to digest, but extremely well written, without a trace of arrogance or stylistic awkwardness. This is no doubt due to the expert assistance given Arendt by her editor Mary McCarthy.While Arendt had originally planned to write a three-part work, on Thinking, Willing, and Judging, she only lived to complete the first two sections. But since she associates Thinking with the past and Willing with the future, it seems fitting to limit the book to these two concepts. (There is a short appendix containing lecture notes from a series she had given on Kant's Critique of Judgment, but I don't recommend it; it's very rough and hard to read.)A large part of the first section on Thinking is devoted to Greek philosophy. She throws around a fair amount of Greek that, for the most part, is translated or understandable from the context. The second section is heavy on medieval philosophy with healthy doses of Latin all over the place. This was the more interesting section from my point of view, for there are lengthy discussions of Augustine and Duns Scotus. Towards the end of the second section she deals with Nietzsche and Heidegger. Heidegger (as you might expect) is given a full and sympathetic treatment.Reading this book has been an experience that I won't soon forget. In fact, I am suffering withdrawal symptoms from it as I write this review. The book was a one-of-a-kind intellectual home to me. I will also add, once you get to the end of the Willing section, you may as well stop reading. Editor Mary McCarthy's Postface is rather self-centered and repetitious, not really worth one's time. And the final unedited lectures of Arendt on Kant's Critique of Judgment are rough, sketchy, and very unlike the polished prose of the earlier part of this great book.If you are looking for a sophisticated work that will engage your mind but will not overwhelm your intellect, then this is the book. It will easily become a refuge of delight for any thoughtful reader."},{"Title":"The Life of the Mind: Volume One, Thinking","review":"\`Life of the Mind,' while incomplete, nevertheless serves as a phenomenal exegesis of Western thought from one of the leading political and metaphysical thinkers of our era. Arendt breezes through an exorbitant quantity of philosophy with remarkable clarity and grace in this two-volume work. In it she provides a critical review of classical thought, including Plato, Aristotle, Plotinus, Augustine, Dons Scotus, leading all the way up to Kant and Rousseau. She also explicates the notion of the Will in Nietzsche, and then Heidegger's \`Will-Not-to-Will' in his later thought. It is possible that Arendt will remain among the greats in Western philosophy, political theory, and journalism more broadly. Her depth of knowledge and insight and capacity to read a text with fresh eyes will astonish you. Also included in the second volume of the text is one of the most cogent explications of Heidegger's Being and Time you are ever likely to find."},{"Title":"The Life of the Mind: Volume One, Thinking","review":"If you are interested in philosophy or religion, then you must read this book. I think book 2 on the will is the more important of the two books. The central issue is the movement of time, if time is linear then the will is central in creating reality, if time is circular then the will is an illusion."},{"Title":"The Life of the Mind: Volume One, Thinking","review":"Arendt's premise - assuming that Chapter 1 is the place to start and the book is not a suspense novel, that \\"Being and Appearing coincide,\\" and that nothing exists that does not presume a spectator, made it difficult for me to continue the book. She maintains, up front, that Being and Appearance are prominent (she refers to them as part of the \\"two-world theory\\") philosophical fallacies. What a place too begin?! And so dogmatically! She goes on to use the internal organs of a man as an example of \\"behind the appearances\\" (my quote marks), then spins off additional abstractions (as if philospophy needs them) such as semblance and authentic appearance and process. Later, she pronounces \\"thought without speech is inconceivable\\"; oh boy.I found her discussion of truth and meaning incomplete and confusing, if not, in places, just plain incorrect. Arendt assumes \\"meaning\\" conveys how something arrives at being (using Kant's texts), and contrasts it (meaning) with truth, writing that there can be only factual truths, disposing of propositional (logical) truths and mathematical truths, seemingly declaring that these a priori artifacts of reasonng can only be evaluated meaningful or meaningless.While obviously a scholar, Arendt is neither clear nor convincing in this book. She does make her points at places: describing the futility of adopting solipsism - and Wittgenstein's role in promoting it interesting enough.Her use of the senses and the superficial appearances of the world as the foundation of a book on thinking is itself superficial. Her writing is not however; it is althogether hard-headed."},{"Title":"The Vegetarian Mother's Cookbook: Whole Foods To Nourish Pregnant And Breastfeeding Women - And Their Families","review":"I bought this cookbook a few months ago after I was sick and weak for an entire month. I am not a vegetarian but I am a nursing mom who is trying to eat healthier.While the cookbook contains sections geared towards pregnancy (like herbal tonics), you do not have to be pregnant to enjoy this cookbook. For that matter, you don't have to be nursing or even have kids.This book covers foods from very basic things like millet and quinoa to fun yummy foods like tortilla soup, shepherds pie, spanikopita, etc.I NEVER write reviews but thought this book deserved a great one that other peope should know about.The food contents are the following:-breakfasts (hot & cold cereals, pancakes, waffles, french toast, -eggs, tofu, potatoes, toast, bagels, and english muffins)-sandwiches (cold, hot, breadless lunches)-salads & dressings-soups and stews (stock, soup, stew)-side dishes (grains, vegetables, cultured vegetables, biscuits)-main dishes (savory pies, casseroles, bean & legumes, burgers, burritos, enchiladas, fajitas, pastas, stir-fries, and tofu dishes)-dips, spreads, sauces, and condiments (salsas, dips, spreads, yogurt, cottage cheese, sauces, gravies, seasonings, condiments, breadcrumbs)-snacks (savory snacks, quick breads, muffins, doughnuts, scones, crackers, bars, and cookies)-desserts (cakes, crisps, pies, fruit, pudding, frozen treats, dessert toppings)-beverages (dairy and non-dairy, thirst quenchers, smoothies, shakes, teas, and tonics)I cook exclusively from this cookbook now and my family is very happy with all the recipes. We are very healthy too.This cookbook focuses on how to make food their absolute healthiest. For example, most soups contain miso or nutritional yeast to boost the nutritional value. A muffin recipe I recently made had 1/2 cup of ground almonds added to the flour mixture. A creamy broccoli soup I made had ground raw cashews in it.I've served things like creamy parsnip soup to guests and they were delighted at how yummy and healthy it was. I was a horrible soup maker before this cookbook came along and now I am awesome!To make things even better, the format is easy to follow. I have NEVER found a cookbook that was so perfect for my lifestye.TO make things better yet, the author gives ideas about how to reuse leftover oatmeal in muffins and provides ayummy recipe for it. She gives tips for how to make pregnancy, nursing, and life with kids easier as far as food goes. Things like putting together dry ingredients in the morning, then mimixing the wet in later, then baking even later. She really understands pregnancy and how moms need to conserve energy.I have low blood-sugar problems and the quick lunches and helpfu tips help me like nothing ever has. Add that together with truely healthful foods and I haven't experienced blood-sugar problems since I started using this book.I don't even have constructive criticism for this book, it is awesome is every regard."},{"Title":"The Vegetarian Mother's Cookbook: Whole Foods To Nourish Pregnant And Breastfeeding Women - And Their Families","review":"Cathe Olson, author of Simply Natural Baby Food is back!

There are sections on how to supplement your diet to help witheverything from cravings, constipation and heartburn to a colicky baby, lack ofbreastmilk and depression. But that's only the beginning.There are over 300 recipes in this cookbook. When I first got this book, Istarted by writing little notes to myself in the margins: things like \\"Yumm!\\",\\"Quick and Easy\\" and \\"Great!\\" Pretty soon, I realized the whole book was beingmarked up and now I have little post-its sticking out all over to remind myselfto \\"make that again!\\" Every recipe has been a hit!Many of the recipes are vegan; those that aren't offer a vegan alternative.Each recipe offers nutritional information and key nutrients.

The subtitle is \\"Whole foods to nourish pregnant and breastfeeding women-and their families\\" but its usefulness will go on long after the woman of the house is pregnant and breastfeeding. The meals are simple to prepare, nourishing, and will appeal to all types of palates, from the very basic to the fussy to the adventurous. One standout feature is that each recipe, aside from displaying nutritional data, details key nutrients. So, it's easy to see which recipes contain nutrients important to pregnancy and lactation like iron, folate, and so on, and in what quantities.I sure wish I had this book when I was pregnant and breastfeeding. It's so much better than that ridiculous \\"What to Eat When You're Expecting,\\" so much friendlier, and not the least judgemental.My \\"babies\\" are now vegan teens and we all enjoyed Cathe's Miso-Noodle Soup, Tofu Enchiladas, Pasta with Vegetables and Pine Nuts, and others.

It goes over a lot of information about pregnancy and nutritional needs, and we haven't had a bad recipe out of it yet. I would recommend it for everybody, not just pregnant people, as the recipes are tasty, nutritious, and, for the most part, easy - I have made several things from it, and my ninja skills do not normally extend to the kitchen.The one thing I will say - the needs of a vegetarian mother-to-be aren't very much different from the needs of a regular vegetarian or a non-vegetarian mother, so you can probably get away with many healthy cookbooks, not one tailored just to vegetarians (which is probably why there were so few books in this genre). Still, a great cookbook, and highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Vegetarian Mother's Cookbook: Whole Foods To Nourish Pregnant And Breastfeeding Women - And Their Families","review":"I bought this book for my wife when she was pregnant with our first child.

My wife had a really healthy pregnancy and we are using the tips in the book for increasing her milk supply and keeping her postpartum moods steady.I have come to rely on many of these recipes and I know this is a book we will continue to use for many years.

I have made about 7 recipes from this book, and so far and every one has turned out great. My favorites so far are the Tamale Pie and the Potato Kale Quiche, which are really easy and even my meat-eating husband loved them. I feel they really tested the recipes (in a normal kitchen, vs. with commercial equipment) prior to publication, which with many cookbooks I've bought, this is clearly not the case. It's a nice mix of exotic and mainstream vegetarian recipes. I rated it 4 stars because I would probably not make some of the recipes with tempeh and some ingredients I have never heard of. However, the majority of the recipes in this book incorporate staples readily available in your regular grocery store. I will continue to use this cookbook long after my son is born."},{"Title":"The Vegetarian Mother's Cookbook: Whole Foods To Nourish Pregnant And Breastfeeding Women - And Their Families","review":"My husband and I and now our 14 month old son stick to a diet that is about 90-95% vegetarian. We can't always live up to being completely meat-free, but only because sometimes the vegetarian options are less than satisfying. With that said, I am always looking for tasty vegetarian recipes that don't feel like punishment. Cathe Olsen is amazing!!!There are combinations that I would never have thought of and every ounce of me says \\"Ewww, that won't work together.\\" But a leap of faith and a little cooking later and I am stunned that everything turns out so tasty. It is expanding my repertoire of vegetarian cooking and inspiring my own new recipes using some of the different ingredients I had never used before this book. Very inspiring.I have not had a single disappointing recipe from this book. Everything, absolutely everything is wonderful. My family is eating it all up. My husband is even taking the leftovers to work for lunch on his own initiative (and he really hates leftovers). I highly recommend the tortilla soup and the squash and bean soup and the sweet potato enchiladas. The squash and spinach lasagna was great (except I think I might par-boil the lasagna noodles next time b/c I think the starch in the noodles gives off a bitter taste).My main purpose for eating primarily vegetarian is the health benefit. This book gives you a break down of nutrients, vitamins and minerals with each recipe. I initially picked up the book when I got pregnant, but the title is a bit misleading. This isn't just for pregnant mamas, it is fantastic eating for everyone.Love it. Buy it. You won't regret it."},{"Title":"The Vegetarian Mother's Cookbook: Whole Foods To Nourish Pregnant And Breastfeeding Women - And Their Families","review":"This is such a good cookbook, it has so many delicous recipes in it.

I've been a vegetarian for nineteen years, though, and I so wish I'd had this sooner. All my pregnancies have, fortunately, been very healthy because I had read so much about what I needed to be eating, but (ironically, I think) my doctors always referred me to dietitians when they heard I was vegetarian, just to check that I was getting proper nutrition. (For the record, the dietitians would always say, \\"You're doing great.\\") But I wish I could have taken this book in to reference the information the author shares.There is a very informative section -- sort of the nuts-and-bolts of healthy vegetarian eating during pregnancy and breast-feeding. But it's followed by great recipes, too, from snacks to desserts and beverages. I really appreciate that the author has symbols that show what can be made Gluten-Free (not an issue for my family, but for friends), vegan, or even what can be made ahead and frozen. It makes menu-planning so much easier.The food is delicious, too. My family's main-dish favorites (so far!) are Mushroom Stroganoff and Vegan Pad See Eaw. It's all written very clearly and simply, and I love that it has the nutrition information included on every recipe! I can know that my kids are getting enough protein, and my husband, who is trying to get healthier, knows the number of calories. It's so helpful!If this wasn't called \\"The Vegetarian Mother's Cookbook...\\" but had a more inclusive title, (and a different picture on the front) I think everyone would realize what a valuable asset it is to a vegetarian's recipe collection. This is the kind of book from which everyone can benefit!"},{"Title":"The Vegetarian Mother's Cookbook: Whole Foods To Nourish Pregnant And Breastfeeding Women - And Their Families","review":"I first tried this cookbook when I rented it from the library.

If you are looking for solid pregnancy nutrition that makes a difference and do not mind tweaking the recipes to match your palate, then no need to look further. I have so far tried 4 recipes and the flavors tend to be mild, nothing that cannot be fixed with additional condiments, garlic, hot sauce, etc. What i like about the recipes of this book is the great combination of diverse ingredients more than anything else to ensure solid nutrition. As a regular cook, I found the recipes on the simple side to make (perhaps easier than Rachel Ray's recipes, and much more easier than Gordon Ramsay's) but it is still cooking from scratch mostly - no condensed cream of mushroom soup. There are some non traditional ingredients that one needs to purchase, thus it requires planning ahead for grocery shopping (and even internet research to learn more about certain ingredients). Some ingredients can be replaced or omitted altogether. For non vegetarians, one could easily replace tempeh or seitan with the meat of choice, or a mix of both, as i did in a \\"chicken\\" stir fry recipe.I find this book (because of pregnancy specific nutrition focus) the most indispensable of all pregnancy books, even after reading other pregnancy info books, i find that pregnancy nutrition first and foremost can make a drastic difference on woman and baby not simply surviving pregnancy but thriving during pregnancy, and even optimizing baby delivery conditions and performance.If you think you have healthy eating/cooking habits, think again -- or in this case read again. Because that's what i thought generally knowing how to prepare meals which always included fruits and vegetables.But i personally learned the hard way that my nutrition knowledge base was extremely lacking, and that pregnancy nutrition can make a tremendous difference between feelings of barely being able to make it, and being and feeling empowered in every way, not simply in the pregnancy aspect.I started off my pregnancy by having many of those miserable pregnancy related symptoms (both mental -- aka \\"baby brain\\", and physical) that left me without strength, even wasted for about the first 4-5 months of my pregnancy. Until by chance i learned that there were things i could actually do to change all that.The learning curve is pretty tough, so i suggest for all who are contemplating ever having children to start now nutritionally, and one good way is by making the recipes from this book.Though i was not vegetarian, i found several things during my pregnancy:- my body seemed to reject meats(beef and chicken). I normally had no problem eating almost 1/2# of meat in one sitting, but now i could hardly swallow any.- foods that are considered healthy still left me famished (eg, a portion of meat with two portions of cooked vegies)Basically i learned that it was not enough to \\"eat healthy\\", but that i needed to eat enough of it until a difference could be tangibly felt.In a painfully slow and steep learning curb, the following steps changed the way i feel during pregnancy:- Changed my diet to first mostly RAW and diverse fruits and vegetables, and then everything else including complex carbs, such as whole grains, proteins, and nuts and seeds. Take vitamin C on mega dosage(about 5000 mgs or more as needed) on a daily basis (in crystal powder form of ascorbic acid). Also 50 mg of Niacin helped me a great deal. Also other vitamins/minerals that mostly do not have toxicity levels, as needed. I only took prenatal vitamins for the first 5 month of my pregnancy for personal reasons on folic acid. The rest of the time i take the individual vitamin supplements as needed. Mind you i eat a \\"ton\\" of especially green leafy vegetables to ensure that i am not lacking.- Stopped eating out in general because i noticed that foods from restaurants were not fresh, and i could feel that it did nothing for me nutritionally. We need to remember that restaurants might keep ingredients stored for extended periods of time, and even before that their suppliers might keep them stored for some time. Restaurant food ingredients might be highly processed.The following is my general daily diet schedule:- Breakfast from this book which include complex carbs and protein(sometimes i make further modifications to include more ingredients/nutrition). Amaranth porridge is one example.- Daily 24 ounces of green smoothie : 4-5 medium Kale leaves, other greens (eg, dandelions) that might change to intake diverse greens, juicy fruits such as pinaple and grapes. A little water when necessary for the blending. Nuts could be included for extra protein and oils.- Lunch: Leftover dinner from day before - this helps me save time and energy.- Snack on different things (banana, yogurt - dairy or non dairy, variety of nuts, hard boiled egg wrapped in nori sheets found at Korean markets, misc left overs)- High protein dinner (which would include beans/legumes or vegetarian meat substitutes), with complex carbs and vegies.- Daily evening 16 ounces home made vegetable juice with centrifugal juicer, because that's what we have: 4 small/medium Carrots, 1/2 large beet, 1 celery stalk, 1/8 of cabbage, 1/2 bell pepper, and other vegies and left over stems from greens from morning smoothy.Methods:- Consume lots of vegetables, and the only way i found this to be effective is via smoothie and juicing, it is easier on the digestive system (because of lots of fiber) and much easier for the body to absorve its nutrients especially in juice form - i think i might take even less than 30 mins for absorption, which is a huge plus when there is immediate need, such as feeling famished and exhausted with headaches. DO NOT recommend bottled juices from stores. The only alternative i use is the freshly squeezed juices from a juice store, or at Whole Foods supermarkets, but this can be expensive and they do not wash produce thoroughly, but for emergency i think it is better than nothing.- Wash fruits and vegies thoroughly, in a gallon water solution made with a couple of TBS baking soda with a few drops of \\"Seventh Generation\\" natural dish washing detergent, Soak then rub/scrub under running water. Or Spray with vinegar solution, wait and wash under running water. This is to wash off pesticides. Even organic produce have \\"approved\\" pesticides. Pesticides can affect babies and children neurological development.- With vegetables with bad reputation such as spinach, i wash thoroughly and only eat it cooked to prevent bacterial infection such as listeriosis. Else for raw consumption in smoothies i buy spinach from asian stores where they sell other strains of spinach produced by smaller producers, such as chinese or korean spinach.- I buy leafy greens at large korean or chinese markets, they seem better handled and packeged and fresher, and even cheaper, so can be true with herbs. This is important to prevent listeria contamination.Beside this book, i also haveThrive Foods: 200 Plant-Based Recipes for Peak Health. This book contains really exceptional recipes nutritionally, but i feel like a rabbit eating from this book. I have tried two recipes from this book containing kelp noodles, and each time my baby became very active in the womb for a good while. Thrive Foods was written by and athlete for generally other athletes who are under high physical/nutritional stress -- i believe pregnant women fall under the same category.The last tip i have has nothing to do with nutrition, but helped a great deal: I am a stone back sleeper. But then i noticed my foot swelling, and if my foot swells i was afraid for the baby too, from cutting off circulation. Because getting a contour pillow seemed a rather expensive risk, noting the negative reviews, i used the many pillows and seat cushions we already had on hand: On a book reading back rest i place a couple of pillows to my comfort so that i am sleeping propped up, i place one big firm pillow on the right side of my back to prevent me falling flat on my back when sleeping, on my left i placed some flatter seat cushions (ran out of pillows) to support my belly, and a firm large pillow to lift my right knee especially. This causes my body to be always at rest towards the left side (the recovery side) propped up and yet have that back sleep but not totally flat. The configuration has the shape of a human size nest and takes a lot of space, but it has worked. I no longer have any swelling, and feel better that i am doing my best not to cut off circulation to the baby while at the same time getting the rest i need. We already had a 2 in mattress foam topper we got from amazon, so the entire setup is really soft, normally this set up would give me back pain, too soft and not as supportive for normal bodies, but for some reason now that i am pregnant this is comfortable.Technically my performance level is even better than when i was not pregnant. This whole foods with lots of raw fruits and vegies diet improves my physiology to such and extent that i am able to accomplish a great deal more work than when i was not pregnant, requiring less physical and mental down time. Currently i have not decreased at all on household work, if anything increased because of dietary demands.In conclusion, this whole foods diet is a keeper even for after pregnancy."},{"Title":"The Vegetarian Mother's Cookbook: Whole Foods To Nourish Pregnant And Breastfeeding Women - And Their Families","review":"I've bought a million things from Amazon, and never once written a review.

I particularly appreciated the tea and drink section at the end of the book.So far I've used the recipes for Sweet Potato Biscuits, Granola, the Orange Creamsicle Smoothie, and the Tomato Omelet, and I've got a bunch tagged for future use."},{"Title":"The Vegetarian Mother's Cookbook: Whole Foods To Nourish Pregnant And Breastfeeding Women - And Their Families","review":"I have been helping my daughter with her new baby and have tried a dozen or so recipes from this book. Raised 5 kids of my own, vegetarian for over 20 years. These recipes have not gone over well. Expensive, bland or in some cases barely edible. Wheat biscuits like lead, Shepards pie went in the trash, Cauliflower with walnuts... Of course the nuts just lay in the bottom of the bowl. I keep swearing I'm done with this and then give it another chance. I will use Vegetarian Times and Mooswood from now on. Sorry!"},{"Title":"The Vegetarian Mother's Cookbook: Whole Foods To Nourish Pregnant And Breastfeeding Women - And Their Families","review":"This is a great book in theory. Jammed pack full of information, but if you are looking for consistent, exceptional tasting recipes, please look elsewhere. The recipes are uninteresting and bland. I bought this book based on its wonderful reviews. I was very disappointed when I actually started to cook from this book. I am no novice in the kitchen and have been cooking for many years. I keep coming back to this cookbook because of its potential and hoping/praying that the results will be better this time. But, nothing changes. The food isn't great. This book is going back onto the high shelf in my kitchen where I can't reach it and can collect dust. Sorry folks."},{"Title":"The Vegetarian Mother's Cookbook: Whole Foods To Nourish Pregnant And Breastfeeding Women - And Their Families","review":"there's nothind special about this book. recepies are not surprising, most of tham I know myself. maybe it wii be more useful for peaple who just turned into vegeterians"},{"Title":"The Vegetarian Mother's Cookbook: Whole Foods To Nourish Pregnant And Breastfeeding Women - And Their Families","review":"I don't find the recipes in this book especially appealing. I'll be sticking to my Moosewood cookbooks. I've read enough about nutrition during the vegetarian pregnancy that I know what I need to get in my diet, even without this book."},{"Title":"The Vegetarian Mother's Cookbook: Whole Foods To Nourish Pregnant And Breastfeeding Women - And Their Families","review":"I bought this to help me eat right while pregnant. i have been a vegetarian for years. i wanted to make sure I was getting the perfect nutrtion for my growing baby. The book is pretty informative. It does contain shopping lists and tons of recipes. I found that the recipes seemed a bit complicated, because of the amount of ingredients needed and its not just stuff that most people would have lying around the house. I haven't cooked anyhting out of the book yet, but have used a lot of the tips she offers. I guess I am just not much of a cook. I am a young newlywed with all the time in the world, but I am pregnant and therefore exhausted. I also don't have the cash to spend on all the weird ingredients you need on hand, which I would have to buy at the local co-op which is super expensive. If you love cooking this book is great, if you are looking for simple recipes or info on vegetarian pregnancy, seek out another resource."},{"Title":"The Vegetarian Mother's Cookbook: Whole Foods To Nourish Pregnant And Breastfeeding Women - And Their Families","review":"Though I do not qualify as a vegetarian mother or mother-to-be, this cookbook is easily one of my all time favorites. My copy has nearly doubled in size from all of the pages I have earmarked to trial. I have already trialed the Gingery Black Beans and Sweet Potato Salad w/ Peanut Butter Dressing. Both were easy to prepare, delicious, and surprisingly filling as a main dish. The author has also inspired me to purchase a few new-to-me ingredients, such as wheat berries, for her Wheat Berry Pilaf, and some coconut oil to prepare the wheat-free Coconut Almond Shortbread. I do hope that she opts to produce a second vegetarian / vegan cookbook titled for everyone. After all, we don't want the men to feel shy about purchasing and using her nutritious book of recipes!A few of my extra notes & tips:This cookbook contains over 300 recipes, all of which are vegetarian, most of which are vegan/dairy-free or have vegan/dairy-free optionsThe recipes are fairly easy to follow, with more than half containing 10 ingredients or less. They range from extremely simple options, like basic oatmeal and homemade ginger ale, to the slightly more complex tofu quiche and gluten-free bunt cake.This is an attractive book, suitable for gift giving to women who are expecting. It is a unique and intelligent baby shower gift, that will likely stay in their collection long after the baby is born.This cookbook deserves five stars for layout. The font is large enough and very easy to read, recipes are typically one per page, and the format is very simple to follow.Though the entire book is not a one-size-fits-all for special diets (with the exception of vegetarian), there are many wonderful gluten-free, soy-free, egg-free, and nut-free recipes throughout. It is up to the reader's discretion to pick the recipes that are suitable for their diet.I am a dairy-free consumer, who is learning to cook vegan. Though the cookbook is geared more towards vegetarians who are tinkering with cutting out the dairy to go vegan, I found it incredibly useful."},{"Title":"The Vegetarian Mother's Cookbook: Whole Foods To Nourish Pregnant And Breastfeeding Women - And Their Families","review":"Just wanted to say this is such a wonderful cookbook.

I am not pregnant but I wanted a good family cookbook that had healthy recipes. This is it!The meals are awesome - our favorites so far are Tamale Pie, Tortilla Soup, Tofu Pot Pie, Potato Kale Quiche, Falafels, High Protein Pasta, Black Bean and Sweet Potato Enchiladas, and Winter Squash and White Bean Soup - in fact all the soups are incredible.Breakfasts are better than ever as well. We also love the Multi-Grain Pancake and Waffle Mix and the Overnight Oatmeal cooked in the crockpot is a lifesaver on school mornings. The Muesli is great too.I also LOVE the desserts. Who knew healthy treats could taste so good. The Pumpkin Cheesecake Bars are so good, I serve them to guests and everybody raves. The Applesauce Cake and Gluten-free Bundt Cake are amazing too.Our favorite snack from the book this winter has been homemade Cinnamon Graham Crackers and Hot Carob Cocoa.I don't write reviews often but I just had to write one for this book.

He bought me this book because he didn't feel I was getting what I needed from what I was eating. My favorite part is some of the recipes are large, and she gives reheating instructions so you can save portions for later, in the freezer. That was great for me because when I'm hungry I need food NOW. I recommend this book!"},{"Title":"The Vegetarian Mother's Cookbook: Whole Foods To Nourish Pregnant And Breastfeeding Women - And Their Families","review":"I originally bought this book for a friend who was pregnant but when I saw how many great recipes were in it - recipes that I knew my family would like - I had to get one for myself. Tortilla Soup, Squash and White Bean Soup, Tamale Pie, Shepherds Pie, Spanikopitta, Yogurt-Spinach Quiche (well I could go on) are now regularly on the menu at our house. At a party we had recently, I made the Tofu and Udon Noodle Salad with Sesame-Peanut Dressing and Curried Rice Salad and they were both a hit.The desserts are great too - we love the Applesauce Cake and Cranberry Date Bars (both vegan), as well as the delicious and easy \\"Better Than Ice Cream\\" varieties. And they are all made without refined sweeteners.I'm so happy to have found a book of easy to make recipes that are family friendly and healthy. I recommend this whether you are a parent or not - and even if you are not a vegetarian but just want to eat whole, natural foods."},{"Title":"The Vegetarian Mother's Cookbook: Whole Foods To Nourish Pregnant And Breastfeeding Women - And Their Families","review":"The Vegetarian Mother's Cookbook is a cookbook especially designed to nourish vegetarian pregnant and lactating women, though the delicious meals are also excellent for serving one's whole family.

I have been wanting a good french toast since becoming vegan! This book has both vegan and vegetarian recipes, sometimes with vegan options. So far, I like it, and I have not put it away sinse I bought it- I usually buy a cookbook try something once and put it on my book shelf where it sits for months and years. This book also has good advice, and tips for pregnant women and mothers. I love it!"},{"Title":"The Vegetarian Mother's Cookbook: Whole Foods To Nourish Pregnant And Breastfeeding Women - And Their Families","review":"I use this book almost daily. It's very practical, great for everyone, not just pregnant & breastfeeding women, & not just for vegetarians- almost everyone wants to include more healthy & vegetarian meals into their diet. Olson includes great time saving tips for busy moms. My 15 month old son loves the smoothies & muffin recipes."},{"Title":"The Vegetarian Mother's Cookbook: Whole Foods To Nourish Pregnant And Breastfeeding Women - And Their Families","review":"I use this book every single day (and still have more recipes in it to try out). I love the food and so does my daughter.

My family isn't vegetarian, but I am, and I can still get them to eat the recipes inside they're so good."},{"Title":"The Vegetarian Mother's Cookbook: Whole Foods To Nourish Pregnant And Breastfeeding Women - And Their Families","review":"Gives recommended first, second, and third trimester recipes for meal planning. Drink and pregnancy teas. Most of the recipes come with variation ideas. The recipes are easy to make and delicious! This is something I will be able to use even after baby is here. There is also lots of recipes that have stars by them indicating they freeze well; make a week's worth so you don't have to cook after baby arrives!"},{"Title":"The Vegetarian Mother's Cookbook: Whole Foods To Nourish Pregnant And Breastfeeding Women - And Their Families","review":"I love this book. First I checked it out at my local library along with 5 other vegetarian cookbooks. This book had the least amount of soy as part of the ingredients. That's a huge plus for me because I have concerns eating genetically modified soy. Now keep in mind, it is not a vegan cookbook, so many dishes have dairy ingredients, but the author offers replacements. I also like nutritional information at the bottom of each recipe. All in all, highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Vegetarian Mother's Cookbook: Whole Foods To Nourish Pregnant And Breastfeeding Women - And Their Families","review":"It's not often that I find a cookbook these days that has so swiftly become my \\"go-to\\" book for inspiration, recipes, and general nutritional info, but this one definitely ticks all the boxes. My family generally has loved the food I've made with the recipes in this book, and that doesn't happen often either. The desserts and sweets at the back are made without cane sugar (such a huge plus in itself) and they taste great. I'm loving the Sunflower-Sesame Molasses Cookies, and I don't mind if my 2-yo. & 4-yo. munchkins snack on them all day -- they won't go hyperactive on me because of the low-GI sweetener (I use rice malt syrup). As this has been the first of my pregnancies as a vegetarian, I love getting the nutritional info at the end of each recipe so I know what's good for me and my little bub. My husband, also vegetarian, is happy I've found a cookbook that uses minimal salt and no refined sugars -- that alone has earned me massive brownie points in the kitchen.Bottom line: this is a great general family cookbook, and I'd very highly recommend it to anyone looking for genuinely healthy and tasty recipes."},{"Title":"The Vegetarian Mother's Cookbook: Whole Foods To Nourish Pregnant And Breastfeeding Women - And Their Families","review":"I bought this book in anticipation of becoming pregnant for my first time. I like how it has a little section with suggested recipes for pre-conception nutrients (and for each stage of pregnancy through lactation). I can't keep down prenatal vitamins because the iron is to rough on my stomach and I love how the recipes give a percentage of nutrient/vitamins so you can pick the recipes that suite your needs.I have only tried one recipe from the book so far but i have plenty lined up to try out. First taste was the Veggie-Apple melt. So simple yet so delicious!!I've been recommending this book to everybody, even those not focusing on pregnancy. The recipes just sound amazing for everyday cooking for anybody!"},{"Title":"The Vegetarian Mother's Cookbook: Whole Foods To Nourish Pregnant And Breastfeeding Women - And Their Families","review":"We highly recommend this cookbook. It is chalk full of delicious recipes that are healthy and nutritious. We have been vegetarians for over 10 years and the recipes in this cookbook have added new and fun experiences to our household. The recipes are easy to follow and we appreciate her suggestions for meals based on certain interests (eg, high protein, high calcium, first trimester). Thank you, Cathe Olson!!!"},{"Title":"The Vegetarian Mother's Cookbook: Whole Foods To Nourish Pregnant And Breastfeeding Women - And Their Families","review":"This has become the only cookbook I use anymore. That's what the five stars are for, I love it! However, I like playing with some of the recipes to suit my individual tastes. I purchased it when pregnant with my twins. I never put the book down. Now, over two years later, it's lovingly full of notes, dog-eared, and still my 1st cookbook of choice. I'm thankful it's around for my current pregnancy. I have fun with these recipes, especially the Falafel with Tangy Tahini sauce. If I didn't go gaga over a recipe, I found it was pretty easy to try it again with my own variations. The vegetarian recipes are mostly manageable to 'veganize' as well.I would love to know if there is a sequel to this book that would have vegetarian/vegan recipes for baby food, food for toddlers and for young children."},{"Title":"The Vegetarian Mother's Cookbook: Whole Foods To Nourish Pregnant And Breastfeeding Women - And Their Families","review":"as a nursing mom who is short on time, i found this book very helpful. i've been trying to find something that spelled out how to eat a veggie diet while nursing and i really enjoyed this book. like any cookbook, i find a few recipes need some embellishment, but overall the ones i've tried have been good."},{"Title":"The Vegetarian Mother's Cookbook: Whole Foods To Nourish Pregnant And Breastfeeding Women - And Their Families","review":"I picked up this book when I had already had my child, and have been using it for the last six years. It is my go to book along with the other cookbook Cathe Olson has written, \\"Simply Natural Baby Food\\". Thank you Cathe for the great books, please keep the books comming. I want more of your delicious, healthy, easy and fun to make recipes."},{"Title":"The Vegetarian Mother's Cookbook: Whole Foods To Nourish Pregnant And Breastfeeding Women - And Their Families","review":"I'm really glad to have this book so that my wife can cook me delicious and nutritious meals throughout my pregnancy. Lots of good ideas and tips included."},{"Title":"The Vegetarian Mother's Cookbook: Whole Foods To Nourish Pregnant And Breastfeeding Women - And Their Families","review":"The book is one of the few cookbooks, vegetarian and non-vegetarian alike that shares my philosophy of not using refined sugars in my cooking. I have enjoyed the recipes so far that I have prepared. I would recommend this book to both vegetarians and non-vegetarians, even if they were not pregnant."},{"Title":"The Vegetarian Mother's Cookbook: Whole Foods To Nourish Pregnant And Breastfeeding Women - And Their Families","review":"I bought this cookbook when I started breastfeeding my daughter. I hadn't known anyone with it, but the reviews were so positive I thought I would take a chance. I am so glad I did. Just like the others have said, I have made 5 recipes so far, and they all are delicious, easy, and filling. I cannot wait to make more. I feel so much better about what my family is eating. If you want to do whole foods, but need the guidance and motivation...get this book! Cathe makes it easy. It does help to have a food processor for many of the recipes."},{"Title":"The Vegetarian Mother's Cookbook: Whole Foods To Nourish Pregnant And Breastfeeding Women - And Their Families","review":"Being a vegetarian for over 10 years, I was excited to start reading this book and making the recipes. The introduction has a lot of great information on general types of food you should eat, and helpful guides for which recipes are best for which trimester.I have two problems with the recipes: 1) the food is bland. My meat-eating husband usually likes all the vegetarian food I cook, but he didn't like any of these, and I don't blame him -- they just didn't taste great; 2) many of the recipes are complicated, so as my pregnancy moved along and it became harder for me to stand up in the kitchen cooking for an hour, I found myself just not cooking from this book.The biggest pro of the recipes are that I did feel good after eating the prepared food. I felt full and energetic, without feeling bloated.Overall, a mixed bag. The recipes are complicated and bland, but I felt good after eating the food."},{"Title":"The Vegetarian Mother's Cookbook: Whole Foods To Nourish Pregnant And Breastfeeding Women - And Their Families","review":"Honestly, this cookbook has made it possible for me and my family to take a good shot at a vegetarian diet. During my third pregnancy I was amazed at how motivated I was to eat vegetarian. I was raised eating meat with lunch and dinner every day and really felt like it was a necessity to keep my blood sugar in check, particularly during pregnancy. I saw this cookbook on the shelves at my midwives practice during my fourth (and last) pregnancy and decided to give it a try and I've been converted. I am truly satisfied eating vegetarian.I think the information in this book re: pregnancy and lactation is very thorough and instructive. If I'd had the book during my first pregnancy I would have probably memorized every word. By the time I got it though I was on the tail-end of my last pregnancy and have therefore not applied some of the tips that are recommended to address nausea, exhaustion, etc.In any event, the most convincing endorsement of this book would come from my kids, ages 7, 5, 3 and 1, if I allowed them on the computer. :) They LOVE nearly everything I've made from this cookbook. Favorites include: Potato-Kale Quiche, Tamale Pie, Tofu Pot Pie, Shepherd's Pie, Brown-Rice Asparagus Quiche, Butternut Squash Lasagna, Rice and Greens Casserole, Tomato Chickpea Pasta, Sesame Molasses Cookies, Cranberry Orange Muffins, Banana Molasses Muffins. And I love the Hummus when made in my Vita Mix. I use the Bean / Legumes Cooking Chart to prepare dried beans in the CrockPot and they come out perfectly every time. It's so much cheaper and SO much less waste than using can after can of prepared beans.In short, I am so thankful for this cookbook. This is the first review I've ever been inspired to write. Thank you, Cathe Olson!"},{"Title":"The Vegetarian Mother's Cookbook: Whole Foods To Nourish Pregnant And Breastfeeding Women - And Their Families","review":"This cookbook has been great. I ordered it when I was 8 weeks pregnant and it has opened my eyes on protein and vitamin content of different foods. The recipes (especially dinner) are incredible. I have not tried one dish that I didn't love. I eat fish and dairy so I am not a true vegitarian and this book has suggestions to add dairy to recipes and has given me new ideas on what to eat with fish. I will use this after I have the baby because the recipes are excellent."},{"Title":"The Vegetarian Mother's Cookbook: Whole Foods To Nourish Pregnant And Breastfeeding Women - And Their Families","review":"I have tons of vegetarian cookbooks having been a vegetarian for over 18 years and this if definitely one of my favorites. The recipes are easy to follow and taste great. Being pregnant, I love the fact that each recipe comes with nutritional information so I know just how much protein and iron I'm getting in a meal. There are several recipes that are quick and easy to make and also several that can be frozen and reheated later. This is now the first cookbook I reach for. My husband who is a vegetarian in training loves the meals too! There is a lot of variety and most of the recipes don't require a lot of exotic ingredients that you can only find in specialty stores as is the case with some vegetarian cookbooks. You'll enjoy these recipes whether you are pregnant, nursing or just love good vegetarian food! Can't speak highly enough about this cookbook. I buy tons of books from Amazon and have never written a review but this cookbook was too good to leave unreviewed!"},{"Title":"The Vegetarian Mother's Cookbook: Whole Foods To Nourish Pregnant And Breastfeeding Women - And Their Families","review":"With all the yummy recipes, containg ways to makes them vegan, as well as other variations to change them up for a slight difference, there isn't a better vegetarian book, or even pregnancy book out there for pregnant women and mothers! It gives nutritional information and menu ideas for each tri-mester, post partum, and breastfeeding stages. And then these recipes are excellent for none of theses stages too! The recipes also state if they are good for freezing which is much needed information to start stockpiling those frozen meals before morning sickness sets in, as well as before baby is born to guarantee healthy meals and less take out! My vegan sister borrowed it when she was pregnant with her first, and loved everything about it. Then when she realized it was from Mothering Magazine editor, said \\"That explains it all!\\" I will be buying it for her for her birthday!"},{"Title":"The Vegetarian Mother's Cookbook: Whole Foods To Nourish Pregnant And Breastfeeding Women - And Their Families","review":"I bought this book when my now-five-year-old was a baby. The food in it is delicious, as well as being healthy and filling. The veggie soup in here (the one with the seaweed) is to die for. My son loved it then, and he loves it now. As do I! Thanks for a fantastic book."},{"Title":"The Vegetarian Mother's Cookbook: Whole Foods To Nourish Pregnant And Breastfeeding Women - And Their Families","review":"every recipe so far has been a great success!! i also like the grain and legume soaking charts in the back and other nutrition advice throughout the book."},{"Title":"The Vegetarian Mother's Cookbook: Whole Foods To Nourish Pregnant And Breastfeeding Women - And Their Families","review":"This cookbook is absolutely amazing! I got it from the library a few days ago and ordered one for myself the very next day! I have made recipes from it EVERY DAY since I got it and they have all been wonderful! The very first recipe I made was Cathe's Tofu Vegetable Stir Fry and I had a question about browning my tofu. In the book she shared her email address and said that she welcomed comments or questions. I figured it was a long shot but I emailed her (not expecting to get a reply). Well, much to my surprise, not only did she reply, but she gave me step by step instructions to answer my question and was so friendly and helpful! She didn't seem at all put out that I would ask such a simple question. Since then I have made her Potatoes and Veggies served with Scrambled Eggs, her High Protein Pasta with her Easy Marinara sauce and her Pumpkin Pesto Ravioli (my personal FAVORITE!!!). My family (3 1/2 yr old twins, a 1 1/2 yr old and a very picky hubby) all LOVED every single thing I have made from this book!!Another perk is that she shares nutritional information on all the recipes. Also, the recipes are EASY to make and don't have difficult to find ingredients. She also has freezing instructions for many of the recipes which is extremely helpful!I'm having a BLAST with my new cookbook. This is by far the best recipe and nutrition book I've ever seen. I can't put it down - it is worse than being in the middle of a good novel! :-) I have a TON of cookbooks in my kitchen and this one is by far the very best one I own. Don't be fooled - this book is not only for pregnant/nursing mothers. It is for ANYONE who wants HEALTHY, DELICIOUS, EASY RECIPES."},{"Title":"The Vegetarian Mother's Cookbook: Whole Foods To Nourish Pregnant And Breastfeeding Women - And Their Families","review":"I really love this cookbook and I am not vegetarian or a mother (still working on that). I consider myself a flexitarian so I value good and wholesome vegetarian food. This book delivered!!! I loved the way she explains the importance of good nutrition and vitamins during pregnancy. She also includes the nutritional benefits that you are recieving from each recipe. I also liked how she grouped the helpful recipes to make for pre-conception (that's me), pregnancy, and post-partum. It was so handy to have when I cooked for my vegetarian friend that came home from the hospital when she had her new baby. I made the fabulous butternut squash lasagna which is recommended for the post-partum mom to help her heal because of its high nutritional content. They really loved it. This will be a cookbook I turn to for years to come and especially when I am pregant to produce a well nourished baby."},{"Title":"The Vegetarian Mother's Cookbook: Whole Foods To Nourish Pregnant And Breastfeeding Women - And Their Families","review":"You don't have to be vegetarian or a mother to love the recipes in this cookbook. While it does have some great information about nutrition for mothers and families, I use it for the amazing recipes. I grew up with Midwestern comfort food like macaroni & cheese, pancakes, and pot pies, and the recipes in this book help us make the most \\"true to memory\\" versions of each of them.This has become the go-to cookbook for my family, whether we've made a particular recipe or not. Even the ones that seem to have weird ingredients turn out great, like the awesome pot pie that tastes better than any restaurant makes. I can't recommend it highly enough."},{"Title":"The Vegetarian Mother's Cookbook: Whole Foods To Nourish Pregnant And Breastfeeding Women - And Their Families","review":"I love this book!

Came in a timely manner, and was less than I could have gotten it at Barnes and Nobel (not including the shipping of course) but being 8 weeks preggers and TOO SICK to move, it was the best route for me to take. Thanks a bunch - Love it."},{"Title":"The Vegetarian Mother's Cookbook: Whole Foods To Nourish Pregnant And Breastfeeding Women - And Their Families","review":"While I agree that this the best resource on nutrition for pregnant and breastfeeding women, any person wanting to add a nutritional boost to their meals would benefit from this comprehensive cookbook. I did buy this cookbook two years ago, when I was pregnant with my son, but I plan to use it for a long time to come, even when my kids are grown up.This is the way I like to cook, meals packed with nutrition. I have to admit, most recipes in this cookbook I would not classify as gourmet, although they are certainly delicious. They are aimed at providing the most nutrients. Just a few ways that the author does that is by adding sea vegetables, using whole grains, and incorporating nut and seed butters.By the way, I also don't use sugar and dairy in my cooking, so finding good cookbooks can be hard, but this one offers alternatives, and tends to use wholesome ingredients. I think vegan nutrition is great, but lots of vegan cookbooks out there substitute meat with a bunch of processed soy products, processed sugar, and white flour. This book is definitely for health conscious out there! For those, who are not interested in vegan or even vegetarian way of eating, this cookbook is a great way to add some more vegetables and whole grains into your diet.I made some miso soup for dinner, and not only was it tasty, it was packed with lots more greens, than traditional miso soup, which made it a great meal in itself. Sweet Potato-Spelt Biscuits are delicious even if you don't like sweet potatoes. Roasted Root Vegetables are a breeze to make and are a great way to get my toddler to eat beets.After you follow the instructions in this cookbook, you will know how to add more nutrition to your cooking. Lots of easy and flexible recipes!Happy Tasting!"},{"Title":"The Vegetarian Mother's Cookbook: Whole Foods To Nourish Pregnant And Breastfeeding Women - And Their Families","review":"That's all.

This book is her account of the bird, from cradle to grave, as he learned to perform tricks, sing and develop a personality with many characteristics like those of his master. The book was received so well in England and around the world after its first printing, that Kipps became somewhat of a celebrity, as did its main character. It's a very touching story, like Wesley the Owl, but better written, in my opinion."},{"Title":"Sold for a Farthing","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this little book.

The introduction to Buddhism and Zen is not particularly illuminating, but the translations of the stories capture the spirit of Zen better than any other anthology I know. Paul Reps \\"Zen Flesh Zen Bones\\" has probably been its most serious competitor. Back in the late 1980's, when shopping around for a book on Zen to use in my course, I narrowed the field to Schloegl and Reps. I found a story both had included about two monks arguing over a flag fluttering in the breeze. One insisted that the flag moved and the other that the wind moved the flag. Then their master intervened. Reps has him say something to the effect that neither the wind nor the flag moves. Mind moves. Very majestic. Schloegl translates the same sentence thus: \\"It is neither the mind nor the wind, but the hearts of the two brothers that are flapping.\\" Enough said.P.S. Disclosure: I have a vested interest in people buying this book. When it goes out of print, I have to get special permission from the publisher to have it printed at my school as a course pack for sale at cost to my students. I'd rather not have to go to the trouble."},{"Title":"The Wisdom of the Zen Masters","review":"This book is an excellent introduction to Zen thinking for the traditional Western mind.

The poems are very touching and heart warming."},{"Title":"Letters to God and Other Poems That Touch the Heart","review":"This book has certainly touched my heart! This author\`s voice is clearly heard in this book."},{"Title":"The Story Of England","review":"If someone is looking for a good, easily read, overview of English History, Christopher Hibbert is a logical choice. His 'The Story of England' is both entertaining and informative. However, if you already know something of English history, you will be amazed at the short shrift he gives to major events such as World War I &amp; II, the Wars of the Roses, and some literary/social events that are certainly worth mentioning. Hibbert does well with the ancient history sections, and he does throw in great anecdotes on people and places that are accurate as well as fun to read. Hibbert also includes timelines and maps for both England and World history, and several royal family trees to pin down dates and people. For a beginning book on this subject, I would highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Story Of England","review":"The same day I became engaged to my British boyfriend, we stopped by a bookstore and I found this book. Since I'm about to begin on a lifelong commitment to an Englishman, I thought it was only appropriate that I learn more about his country and cultural background. However, given the vastness of England's history, I felt overwhelmed: How could I possibly get a decent overall review of England's history without my head spinning in the process!?&quot;The Story of England&quot; was the perfect solution. Its condensed format, covering most of the major historical bases, was exactly what I'd been looking for. It provides just enough insight for me to have a good impression of where my betrothed and his family are from, but doesn't weigh me down with 5,000 years' worth of detail. I especially liked the timeline charts and genealogy listings in the back.However, I'm not giving it five stars, even though it is obviously well-researched and an ambitious effort. First, I agree with the other reviewers who have commented on the long-windedness of the author. (Perhaps it is a British English vs American English thing -- who knows?) Second, although the author touches on many different historical events, I felt that some should have received more attention -- maybe just a page or so. There were several times where I felt like the author stopped short of telling me the basic facts.All in all, this is a very good read. It is perfect for those of you who'd like to learn more about England's history and the events that help us understand how England has become the country it is today."},{"Title":"The Story Of England","review":"I read this book over the past weekend and found it so absorbing. Sure, this is an English history suitable for ones in a hurry but it's a very good one for that purpose. I like his narrative style and how he portrayed his subjects. He captured important persons and events in English history and put them together in a concise manner. You will be able to see a clear development of England through times - pretty quickly. The book's presentation is also nice. This is not a history book for serious readers or students majoring in history, I suppose. But it's good for general readers and those who are looking for an enjoyable history book to read. The reason that I'm giving it only 4-star is because I think in certain places, Mr. Hibbert could have elaborated a little bit more. Still, the book as it is, is simply very good. I'm going to buy more books written by Mr. Hibbert."},{"Title":"The Story Of England","review":"I read this book on the plane on my way to England in 1995. It is concise and very readable, excellent for anyone wishing to learn the English history in a hurry. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Story Of England","review":"Okay, I bought this book looking for an introductory course to English history, nothing really in depth with each event taking up a chapter, but rather a quick run through of English history. Well, I got what I wanted. Here's the good and the bad.Good - This book covers everything, a prehistory of England, from Stonehenge, to the Roman invasions, to the Anglo-Saxon massacres, to the Norman conquest and feudalism, to England becoming a world power, the Black Plague, The English Monarchy, Wars with Spain and France, The Colonial Era, War with America, Empire and Industry, and finally England's triumph in World War I, and despite being bombed for 10 months by Germany in World War II, being able to halt the invasion and remain a free country for the remainder of the war.Bad - This book is terribly concise. Though it is a concise history, sometimes the book is bad because of it. The entire twentieth century, from World Wars I and II, to Irish secession, to The Falkand Wars gets a few pages. The Blitz of 1940 is not mentioned, and Winston Churchill gets a few lines here and there. C. Hibbert tends to make run on sentences and fragments, and there are tons of errors throughout the book. The book fails to list why England was so dependant on its colonies.However, if someone is just starting to learn about English history, then this book will save you. But if you want a better book, I suggest other titles.Rating: 3 stars ***"},{"Title":"The Story Of England","review":"English History is daunting in its breadth and depth, but to truly understand and appreciate the glories of the realm, one should try to tackle at least the basics. The Story of England makes this possible, and enjoyable. Filled with terse descriptions of people and events which have helped shape this country and its people, The Story of England has great visual appeal, too. Small enough to take with you on a trip to England, it is also brief enough to read before your trip. Accurate, interesting, and consice, this history book has it all."},{"Title":"The Story Of England","review":"That might actually sum it up if not for the fact that there is actually a lot of research that went into this book and such a glib encapsulation does not do it justice. What is the purpose of the book. Mr Hibbert tells us. &quot;It is intended as a generously illustrated introduction to the history of England for all those readers who have largely forgotten what they were taught at school, or whose history lessons touched upon only parts of the long periods covered here, as well as those looking for a readable book which will help to put the places they visit in their travels about the country into their historical context.&quot; Phew! THE STORY OF ENGLAND in very long sentences!I may have forgotten a lot of the English history I learned in school, and I am grateful for the colorful and interesting presentation of it here by Mr Hibbert. What I do remember from school though is that a sentence should be about 25 words long and a paragraph roughly 75. Here you will run into more than the occassional 75 word sentence!The book is gloriously illustrated with every page having at least one (usually full color) graphic, and the historical period covered is extensive - from Roman Britain to the present. There are chronological tables tracking significant British historical events, genealogical charts of the Normans, Plantagenets, Tudors, Stuarts and Hanoverians. The historical style is descriptive.Suitable for general readers; introductory college level English history. Concludes with the ascension to power of John Major in the 'palace coup' of 1990 when the conservatives found too much rust on the 'Iron Lady' and ousted her as party leader."},{"Title":"The Story Of England","review":"Just as William Shatner is attracted to writing in short sentences (where two words is the norm), Hibbert is extremely verbose, to put it kindly. Often his sentences are written in the passive voice and have five or more phrases and sentence fragments in them. It becomes extremely difficult to follow the narrative of the story. Some of his sentences are so long that they literally become paragraphs in and of themselves. It was frustrating to have to read a sentence three or four times before the meaning became clear. Half the time I felt like I wanted to go through the book with a red pen and edit the grammar. I think I would have run out of ink by page 74. Another dissapointing fact about this book is that it pays lipservice to some of the most important events in English history. Historic milestones, battles, and cultural references may be only mentioned in one phrase in passing, never to be seen again. Other significant events like the rise of the empire on which &quot;the sun never sets&quot; are glossed over. The book does include some extras, like maps of England and timelines, but even then, the maps were of little use. They simply tended to list pinpoint locations while the author would refer to provinces or areas of the country that were not marked on the map. If you are not familiar with British geography (and I imagine you wouldn't be if you are considering a book like this) then their value becomes wasted. All in all, this was an experience which I would not like to repeat again. For an example of a good history book, check out Willam Manchester's take on the American century,&quot;The Glory and the Dream.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Story Of England","review":"Hmm, well, this is a great book for beginners in English history. However, there are areas where Mr Hibbert could have touched on certain areas more. It basically starts with prehistoric England, to the Roman, Danish, and Norman conquests, and finally to the restoration of the monarchy and England's empire. Illustrations and some bonuses are ever present, but the book skips some areas. The reader gets mouthfed areas about the Anglo-Saxon and Norman invasions, but we need to hear more about certain wars that the English were in. We don't hear anything about the Crusades except for one line. The twentieth century as a whole is just skipped. World War I and Irish secession is mentioned in a paragraph, and World War II is mentioned in about three sentences, we don't hear about the Lutwaffe air attacks on London, Manchester, and Birmingham, and we don't really get information on how the Romans cooled down British resistance in ancient times. It's okay for people who haven't touched on English history, but for experienced history buffs, you don't need to buy this."},{"Title":"Project Ultraswan","review":"This is an incredible book for all ages!!

It is difficult to fathom how a very young woman could stand up to a whole wall of brutality and barely whince. How she could walk to her death at age 21 because she would not or could not compromise her sense of right. Sophie's belief in justice and compassion and humanity was stronger than all the military might raised to silence her. This book challenges us all to stand against injustice and brutality. There is perhaps no more important act we can achieve than to force ourselves to be as aware as Sophie was. Only then can prejudice and cruelty and injustice be stilled. This is a powerful work with an amazingly powerful message."},{"Title":"The short life of Sophie Scholl","review":"A well-written, interesting review of Sophie Scholl's life, including not only the resistance activity but details of her personal life, thoughts. Who was Sophie Scholl before she has become an idol? That's what the book tries to answer using personal interviews with relatives, friends, those who knew her personally."},{"Title":"Gentleman's Agreement","review":"Although the book takes place in 1946 and concerns rampant anti-semitism, both overt and subtle, it's a book that trancends time. The book's anti-semitism could easily be replaced by any other kind of racism and feel right at home in 2005. The story concerns a liberal Christian writer who takes on a magazine assignment to write about anti-semitism and his angle is to pose as a Jew so he can find out firsthand. It is a rude awakening for him, whether it is a hotel that does not cater to \\"those people\\" or a fiancee making off-hand anti-semitic remarks and thinking nothing of it. Some people might get thrown by writing that was done fifty years ago, but it is a book well worth reading."},{"Title":"Gentleman's Agreement","review":"GENTLEMAN'S AGREEMENT concerns the experiences of one Philip S. Green, an investigative reporter who decides to pretend he's Jewish to get to the heart of modern American anti-Semitism.Although written in 1946 and concerning the immediate post-World War Two era (the late months of 1945, the peak of New Deal liberalism, and the growing Conservative reactionaryism of the time), GENTLEMAN'S AGREEMENT still reads well, despite its occasional heavy-handed moralizing.Though some of the more grotesque evidences of open anti-Semitism have virtually disappeared from the American scene in the last sixty years (avowedly \\"restricted\\" clubs and the like), author Laura Z. Hobson's theme that there's an \\"us\\" and a \\"them\\" in America is unhappily still timely. Replace the word \\"Jewish\\" with any other, and GENTLEMAN'S AGREEMENT is just as illuminating now as it was in 1946.Hobson spends almost no time on her Jewish characters qua Jews. The Holocaust gets a fleeting one-sentence mention, though the mere fact that Hobson wrote GENTLEMAN'S AGREEMENT at all in 1946 places it squarely in the realm of \\"Holocaust Literature.\\" Hobson gives us no discourse with Judaism or Jewish culture as such, but for her purposes as an author none of that matters. The representative Jewish characters in these pages, Dave Goldman and Dr. Lieberman, are thoroughgoing Americans, totally assimilated and non-religious; yet, like Phil Green, the non-Jewish Jewish protagonist, they are battered and subjected to a bewildering array of overt and covert attacks, exclusions, and snide comments. They also demonstrate a sense of identity as Jewish individuals which Green first questions, then admires, and finally adopts.The shock of his friends and co-workers upon discovering that he is indeed a Christian is palpable. Many of them (including Phil's supposedly \\"liberal\\" fiancee, Kathy) are forced to confront their own preconceptions and prejudices.A fine book which needs to find its place in the American consciousness, GENTLEMAN'S AGREEMENT comes highly recommended."},{"Title":"Gentleman's Agreement","review":"A superb social commentary of its time and a thoughtful examination of different shades of bigotry. Journalist Phil Green decides to take an undercover assignment on antisemitism by simply and quietly declaring that he is Jewish and then observing how it affects his relationships with others.The title is a reference to an unspoken gentleman's agreement not to sell homes, rent apartments or admit Jews to resorts or social clubs. However the elements of nonacceptance can be more subtle. Hobson makes the point that antisemitism can be selective as well - it's not just a violent Nazi/Cossack dislike. The word \\"gentile\\" derives from \\"gentility\\", and it is the polite mask here that exposed, the selective judgment of some Jews can be given a pass, but others not, or that social pressures cause some to hide their Jewishness or even the expectation that Jews qua Jews are required to be more moral than the rest of us.The form of the book is similar to that of a morality play in that each of the major characters act as a spokesperson for different aspects of the author's views. It is interesting to note that Ms. Hobson herself was, like the main character, a journalist - write what you know - though not a man. Her female characters come across very strongly, though there's a false note near the end when Ann, the \\"best bud\\" type reveals that she is having an affair with a married man, and this is used as a deus ex machina plot device. This too may have been extracted from real life as she had a child at the time who was born out of wedlock, as well as an being a single mother with another adopted child.Interesting too that the author voices the notion that acceptance of Jews would act as a test case for the further emancipation and integration of blacks in American society.Overall an enjoyable and thoughtful read, and though the language and social customs date it, the underlying message endures. The fictional experiment was laterupdated and enacted in real life. There is also awell known film of the novelstarring Gregory Peck and Dorothy McGuire which is worth checking out"},{"Title":"Gentleman's Agreement","review":"Perhaps because I saw the 1947 Academy Award winning movie first, I liked it better than the book, but I truly think the movie explored the theme of prejudice against the Jews better than the book did and with more finesse. The book seemed heavy handed by comparison."},{"Title":"Gentleman's Agreement","review":"Second time I read it. Although it is dated, I hope the theme is also dated and society can say isn't it great this is no longer an issue."},{"Title":"Gentleman's Agreement","review":"Although I am not a Jew, I know what it feels like to be on the receiving end. In 1971 I applied to rent an apartment and was shocked to be given an application that quizzed me about my race, religion and just about everything else. I was rejected and no reason was given. In 1987 I tried to rent at a large building with a for-rent sign. Two men were standing outside. One of them told me, \\"The apartment has already been rented. We forgot to take the sign down.\\" Yeah, sure. I am old enough to remember when Arthur Godfrey (a popular TV personality) owned a hotel in Miami Beach that openly refused to cater to Jews. But upon reflection, Hobson's novel (and the movie) presented the problem from only one point of view. Just think about it. There are any number of Jews-only condos and closed communities. If a Jewish landlord in New York were to refuse to rent to Arab-Americans, then what? Don't Jews have \\"gentleman's agreements\\" of their own? Is discrimination OK if a Jew does it? Just askin'."},{"Title":"Ethnic Nationalism: The Tragic Death of Yugoslavia","review":"Despite its title, Denitch's analysis of the Yugoslav collapse is not so much a study of ethnic nationalism as such as it is a thorough, passionate and often personal look into the causes and consequences of Yugoslavia's break-up. Since he was a citizen of Yugoslavia, and also actively involved to some extent in the political events of the early 1990s, Denitch generally discards with the customary cold, academic aloofness and feigned impartiality and tells the reader squarely where he stands on issues such as nationalism, the war in Yugoslavia, the events that led to the country's destruction, etc. This makes the text all the more interesting, as he offers very fascinating, if not sometimes controversial, views and insights into recent Yugoslav history and the ethic politics which hold sway in the Yugoslav successor states. His analysis of Yugoslavia's failure to progress into a pluralist democracy, despite being THE European socialist state most likely to do so in the late 1980s, is very interesting: he notes that the fatal flaw made by Tito and the ruling communists was to decentralize the country's decision-making processes rather than democratizing its political scene. His opinion of nationalism is, needless to say, very disparaging, and his intent in this book is to warn that ethnic nationalism and identity politics in today's world are an enemy to democracy everywhere, not just in the former Yugoslavia or the formerly communist Eastern Europe, but throughout the world, including the developed, allegedly rational and post-nationalist West. Regardless of what one thinks of Denitch's standpoint, this is definitely an important book to read for a better understanding of Yugoslavia's break-up and the problems that still plague the region today."},{"Title":"Metropolitan Tabernacle pulpit","review":"Many books are published these days with the name &quot;Spurgeon&quot; on them. However, so many of these books are edited down adaptations of something Spurgeon wrote or preached. Too often these &quot;books&quot; are actually 3 or 4 sermons cut apart and taped together into a book format. The unfortunate result is that much of Spurgeon's beliefs, exhortations, and theology are lost, and all that remains is his poetic style. Few publishers have remained true to the real Spurgeon, instead using his name to sell books and make money. Their finished product is watered-down milk, psychology at best, instead of the real meat of the real Spurgeon's preaching.This book, however, is the REAL Spurgeon! This is a collection of over 50 of his sermons, the REAL unedited sermons, and many more expositions of Scripture as they were published in 1892. Read this book and hear the meat of Spurgeon, the depth and conviction with which he preached, and the consistency with which his theology rests upon Scripture.And these sermons are not just historical pieces; they are useful to us even today! No Christian can read this book and not find his soul challenged, uplifted, convicted, and educated in knowledge and wisdom. The Victorian Londoners found Spurgeon's ministry to be all these things, and since that time it has had its effect on so many others, too - and it can have that effect on you!This book is published by Banner of Truth, one of the greatest publishing houses of our day. Their faithfulness to truth is an example to the publishers who just seek to publish what will sell.This book is a great shelf volume, well-bound and durable. Read it every day, and it will still wear well.Perhaps you've heard the new Spurgeon, the one created by so many modern publishers and editors. If you want to know what his sermons were REALLY like, and if you want your soul to be taught and ministered to by the &quot;Prince of Preachers&quot; himself, read this book!"},{"Title":"Metropolitan Tabernacle pulpit","review":"Since Amazon doesn't appear to currently carry these volumes, I'm posting this information on where to find new copies.Pilgrim Publications currently publishes new reprints of the entire Metropolitan Tabernacle Pulpit series, New Park Street Pulpit series, Sword and Trowel series, and most other Spurgeon books.You can buy them from various places, including Cumberland Valley Bible Book Service (a large Reformed bookseller), who has most of them in stock.(Note: I'm not affiliated with either of these companies)"},{"Title":"Maddie Retta Lauren: Georgia, 1864 (American Diaries)","review":"This was a good American Diaries book.

The book works well in conjunction with a well taught class, which I thankfully have. The text contains a lot of information, although not all of the mathematical subtleties are brought to the readers attention, and are either left as exercises or for the student to ponder further. Greater analysis of deep and complex concepts would have been appreciated, and some answers to the problems would have been helpful as well -- the book contains none, which is a shame because the exercises are pretty good and are a requirement to master the material. I can understand why my professor likes this book, but it can be difficult to learn from if you haven't been exposed to the material before, and especially if you need to rely on it as a primary source of information."},{"Title":"Roads to Geometry (3rd Edition)","review":"*Note: this refers to the second edition.Author: CS/Math double major at Cameron University.This is the book I unfortunately got stuck with for my College Geometry class at Cameron. Thankfully I had a great teacher and I enjoyed the class in addition to getting an 'A', but that was no thanks to this textbook. Our class and the textbook were proof-oriented and designed to introduce the student to the basic axioms, theorems, and developments of several geometries. The book doesn't go extremely in-depth into any geometry but it was only designed to introduce the basic logic and principles of the geometries anyway. The problem is the extreme conciseness and unclarity of the material. Chapter 1 is written well enough, giving the reader a good foundation in axiomatic development. From then on, each chapter starts with a list of axioms and explanations and then it's the traditional theorem-proof-theorem-proof format. Unfortunately, the proofs are condensed into as compact a format as possible. The way the proofs were written, it kind of made the book feel like 1000 page book crammed into 400. The drawings are somewhat helpful but even those are lacking. Also, a series of exercises are given at the end of each section yet no answers are given in the back. And, like most geometry books, there's no available study guide. On the plus side, the exercises have a nice range of difficulty, from trivial to virtually impossible and everything in between.Avoid if you can or pray you get a good teacher like I did."},{"Title":"Roads to Geometry (3rd Edition)","review":"My review is basically a warning about a defective stock of books.

Essays on the New Sciences of the Mind","review":"This book is more related with question than answer. The authors focus on the success and the pit falls of the growing science of consciousness in a very elegant and explicit way. As neuroscientists, aware of the technological advance, they establish what the technology can do to uncover consciousness and what it can't do at the present time. In addition, they also comments on what is still needed in order to obtain more information about consciousness in live human beings. But most of all, they argue about the necessity of clarifying the definition of consciousness in order to lead to new discoveries.The book could be divided in three parts. The first few chapters deal with basic concepts of the central nervous system from what a neuron is? to neurotransmitters, to the hypothesis of long-term potentiation as evidence of the physical existence of memory. In the middle, there are two excellent chapters on the problem with the diagnosis of dementia (Alzheimer's disease and squizophrenia) and how careful we have to be to establish generalization such as that when you get old you will be nuts, or is you find any of these symptoms your dealing with a squizophrenic. Then, the rest of the book is focus on consciousness, presented in a multidisciplinary approach. From artificial intelligent to philosophy.Written for a general audience, From Brains to Consciousness is and excellent source to complement a text book on basic neuroscience in a way to arouse the curiosity and to debate fundamental things about being human with the students, in addition to break with the standard of learning facts."},{"Title":"From Brains to Consciousness?

Nonetheless, it is very relevant and quite interesting!(I later found more of mr. Rose's thoughts in a book he edited with a Hillary Rose - his wife? - called &quot;Alas Poor Darwin&quot;. It shows the untenability of Evolutionary Psychology. His own article in that collection is by far the best of all.

Rose writes a great introduction to consciousness studies, and it alone pays for the entrance ticket. It is always interesting to read about Aleksanders work on artificial consciousness, and Penrose on Quantum Consciousness. The collection as a whole covers many topics, and it is a valuable contribution to consciousness studies. It is also not at all technical, so it can serve as an introductory work of the field. Again, originality and content do will not live to many expectations, but I certialy recomend the book."},{"Title":"From Brains to Consciousness? Essays on the New Sciences of the Mind","review":"Steven Rose compiled an uneven collection of papers. Some of his allusions to Soma seem misplaced when contrasted with Crow's biological psychiatry (article on Schizophrenia). Another article claims that schizophrenia is not an identifiable medical condition. Schizophrenia is a useful label for a complex constellation of symptoms. They share at least one characteristic: disordered thinking. I am reminded of Oliver Sacks' book, Migraine. When originally written, Sacks dispaired that a single, unified cause would be discovered. In a revision ten years later, Sacks discussed the discovery of a single cause, the nucleus trigeminalis, in the brain stem. Some of the articles are out of place; for example, discussion of computers and artificial intelligence. Several of the articles are excellent but do not offset the more peculiar articles."},{"Title":"Extreme Cuisine (Margot O'Bannon Mysteries, No. 5)","review":"Kit Sloane is a resident of Northern California.

Margot's glamourous friend and wine specialist Loretta Rose appears on their doorstep and quickly ingratiates herself into their lives, obtaining her first position in the Executive Dining room of the studio and hooking up with Robert Madrid of the restauranteur Estrella family. But everywhere she goes, murder seems to follow, and the Estrella's are heavily involved, first by Robert's murder which coopts a scene from Max's latest film, \\"Extreme Cuisine\\":\\"Loretta Rose stopped frowning and stared, seeming oblivious to the tears still streaming down her face. 'Oh my God, the police. I have to call them, don't I?' She wiped her nose, ran across the room to a stainless steel counter and grabbed a black phone. Margot could hear the 9-1-1 call punched in. She turned away as Loretta Rose described the horror into the receiver. It was a brief conversation.\\"EXTREME CUISINE is a humorous look at the Hollywood scene, which includes agendas, the seamier side of movie-making, and Margot's metamorphosis from retiring film editor to amateur sleuth when the people she cares about find murder popping out all around them. Sloane gives a good bird's eye view of the movie business, along with the aberrant personalities. The result is a delightful and, at times, laughter-inducing and lighthearted look at murder, cuisine, and the temptations of the flesh.EXTREME CUISINE is written in a blocked way, meaning it could easily translate into a comedic tale of murder and mayhem. Sloane has a definite eye for the absurd, and she also knows how to entertain. EC is a delightful read, and Sloane's characters cry out for an encore.Shelley GlodowskiSenior Reviewer"},{"Title":"Extreme Cuisine (Margot O'Bannon Mysteries, No. 5)","review":"With a title like \\"Extreme Cuisine,\\" I pictured a mystery featuring the Iron Chef rappelling down a cliff. To my delight, Extreme Cuisine is the fifth mystery featuring Margot O'Banion, film editor and amateur sleuth extraordinaire. Her sexy lover Max Skull, an ambitious and talented director and the father of her son, is currently working on a film highlighting Latinos and the restaurant business, so this means lots of behind-the-scenes research for the couple at the hottest restaurant in Hollywood, Caf&eacute; Estrellado. Max has the chef's brother, Robert Madrid, hired as a consultant and the hunk with his own popular nighttime cooking show provides ample distraction for Margot's friend, the dramatic Loretta Rose Cinefucco. Having left her family's wine-making business for a career in cuisine, the impulsive Loretta Rose has just signed on to take over the film studio's dining room. This doesn't sit well with the previous manager, Madrid's mother, and Loretta soon finds that she's got her hands full with overflowing egos and temperaments. When a murder that mimics the movie script occurs Margo and Max are forced into investigating in order to save their friend and the movie. Soon everything shifts into high gear and the reader is lavished with ample amounts of food, film lore, and fun.This is a series that has gotten better and better, and Sloane continues to provide fascinating background information on the world of movie making. Extreme Cuisine also explores the high-pressured arena of restaurants, and food lovers and addicts of the Food Network will be pleased. The relationship between Max and Margot has become more complex and enjoyable, and I'm finally coming to appreciate Max's appeal. This is a truly entertaining mystery that abounds with humor, romance, and suspense. Don't miss it."},{"Title":"Extreme Cuisine (Margot O'Bannon Mysteries, No. 5)","review":"The first chapter gave me a delightful surprise. In one of Ms. Sloane's prior novels, \\"Grape Noir\\" a delightful character was introduced to her reading public. To my joy, the character has popped up again some 3 novels later to center in \\"Extreme Cuisine.\\" I won't give you the name as it would foil the unexpectedness. To Margot's film editing eyes, the scene Max has just shot, is both shocking and chilling. It is a keeper for the movie in progress, in their eyes. Perhaps a murderer's too?In this story, I was reminded that a glamorous restaurant often does not show the chaos necessary to bring forth a perfectly plated dinner of Prime Rib. The confusion lies just beyond the closed double doors. A nominated novel does not display the sleepless nights of plotting, nor the hours of reference studies put in. Not to mention the hours of art work to 'catch' the eyes.Then again, in this book, we sense forward motion in careers, relationships both personal and industrial, and the movie industry as well. This series \\"A Margot O'Banion & Max Skull Mystery\\" is also at a stage, this reader sensed, of storyline progression. This series is not stagnant but dynamic and kept me reading with interest and creating, (I must admit,)my own versions of what happens next.This was a wonderfully paced mystery. I really love this series and this individual novel. Do find the books, whether they are new, used, or found in a library. They are worth the search."},{"Title":"nmazca","review":"He always had that special talent of being able to see things in in a way that not everyone could-but somehow he would make you see it and appreciate it. &quot;The world is round and the place which may seem like the end is only the beginning.&quot;I.Bakerpriest So many words,so much to do,so little done,such things to be.&quot; A.L.

It's all on your back at that point, the success or failure. And you really have to believe in the promise of your work to hedge one over the other.Luckily for Mr. Taylor, NMAZCA shows extraordinary promise. It's a strinking assemblage of 36 photos that point the reader toward the atmosphere and experience of place and the frame of mind. Some photodocumentations by other artists successfully acheive for us a sense of location or allow us to make an inventory of items in that location, but Mr. Taylor sets his sights on acheiving photographic poetry and acheives it in stunning hues. Which makes this book even more remarkable: it's a self-published work of full-color photography, and the works are remarkably well-rendered in lush tones.Ultimately, I think NMAZCA points us to, and asks us to evaluate, something about each of us as island selves. But that's just me. It's a work of exceptional breadth and flow - one image informing and presupposing the next - but also one of great intimacy. The viewer is asked to involve him/herself with, to come to an understanding of, ripples in the desert sand, the ragged lilt of a twisting root, the shadowy creases of rocks and feathery plateaus of their attached lichens, the subtle topographies the sun traces as it arcs its paths through our skies.Think of each photograph as little haikus.

In THE CHANGING LANGUAGES OF EUROPE Bernd Heine and Tania Kuteva convincingly argue that these similarities are due not to coincidence or parallel development (= \\"drift\\"), but to a series of language contacts radiating outwards from various centres in Western Europe over the last two thousand years.Two substantial introductory chapters open the book. In \\"Europe as a Linguistic Area\\" the authors describe previous research positing a European sprachbund, with certain languages lumped together in one theory and a different set in another. The second chapter is an introduction to the process of grammaticalization, showing how language contact-based innovations begin as small tendencies in an individual's speech (use patterns) that may eventually become integral features of the whole language.There are four changes that have appeared in many European languages and, the authors argue, are due to language contact: the rise of articles, the rise of possessive perfects, the merging of comitative and instrumental forms, and the use of question words as relative pronouns in subordinate clauses. Using textual evidence, the authors show how these new features gradually spreading throughout European. Documentary evidence makes it very clear that the disappearance of the synthetic preterite and its replacement in this function by the analytic perfect began in Parisian French in the 12th century, had spread into Germany a century later, and then hit northern Italian dialects by the end of the sixteenth century. (The benefits manuscript evidence provide to students of language contact make me bemoan the short history of writing in the Uralic languages I study.)Through their research, Heine and Kuteva have been able to postulate stages of grammaticalization, revealing that in some European languages things haven't progressed as much as others. Indeed, some languages haven't even started on the path at all. This helps better deliminate a possible European sprachbund, where suprisingly the Celtic languages and Russian are squarely outside the fold.Heine and Kuteva are two of the leading scholars in grammaticalization theory, and each has amassed a hefty publishing record. Nonetheless, they have succeeded here in explaining the specifics of grammaticalization in European languages without using too heady specialist terminology. Even an undergraduate in linguistics could profit from this book. And for those linguists who deal all day with difficult specialist material, this is a downright *fun* monograph."},{"Title":"Music Lovers Quotations (Quotation Book)","review":"This book has been with me for over a year now and I still reference it frequently.

The quotes in this book are reminders that beauty still exists in this world. Without it we would suffer. This book takes you back in time. It is relaxing and refreshing. A must for any true lover of music!"},{"Title":"Music Lovers Quotations (Quotation Book)","review":"I have always been attracted to quotations and there is no better place to find them in books of quotations .Some of the more famous books such as the large books like \\"Bartlett's Familiar Quotations\\",have quotations from famous people down through the ages and from every walk of life.There is a plethora of such books,all of which I treasure;but there are also those many little \\"tomes\\" that limit themselves to one culture ,occupation,or whatever.I've written Reviews on a variety of these smaller books such as those of Iris,Jewish,Military,Literary,Cowboy,Scientists,Politicians,etc;but this is the first I've come across from the world of Music and Musicians.It is really quite distinct, as they are much more personal and from the heart ;and what else could they reflect when usic is ,more than anyhing else,something that comes from the soul.The quotations,though all relating to music,deal with a wide aspect of music.It deals with such diverse things such as music origins,art,science,love,critics,composers,singers,instruments,opera,rock,beauty,immortality,silence,and many more.I don't think I ever looked at music from so many aspects as when I read the quotations in this little book.Although the book is quite small,only 120 pages,there are somewhere around 600 quotations.The book also has about 20 full page B&W; illustrations as well as a Name Index giving the dates of each of those who are quoted and what their profession or role in life was,and the pages where you will find their quotes.While you would expect many of the quotations are from people associated with music,there are many from people one doesn't immediately associate with music.And why not,music is part of everyones life.You would expect a great quote from someone like Louis Armstrong with;\\"What we play is life.\\"Or Duke Ellington with;\\"I merely took the energy it takes to pout and wrote some blues\\".Or Victor Borge with;\\"The oboe sounds like a clarinet with a cold,but it is the instrument thewhole orchestra tunes up to.\\"But there are quotes like these from Voltaire;\\"Life is a shipwreck but we must not forget to sing in the lifeboats.\\"Or this from Einstein;\\" In art,and in the higher ranges of science,there is a feeling of harmony which underlies all endeavor.There is no true greatness in art and science without that sense of harmony.\\"Or this from Henry Kissinger;\\"People are generally amazed that I would take an interest in any form that would require me to stop talking for three hours.\\""},{"Title":"America Entangled: The Persian Gulf Crisis and Its Consequences","review":"This anthology titled AMERICAN ENTANGLED is a useful anthology in explaining the current disasters incubating in Western Asia. Those who wrote the essays provided a clear view of the stupidity of U.S. policy makers in \\"assessing\\" events in Western Asia and the Middle East. The complete lack of understanding is almost beyond belief. Such lack of knowledge on part of U.S. \\"experts\\" has led to dire consequences which the essay writers portray.The begining essays in this book dealt with the historical background in Western Asia. What is totally ignored now is the massive aid the U.S. gave to Saddam Hussein and the Iraqis from 1963 to 1991. As an interesing aside, readers should view the video titled THANKS FOR THE MEMORIES which detailed the immense support that the CIA gave to Hussein. Another topic covered in the early sections of the book dealt with the fact that U.S. military forces fought FOR Hussein between 1987-1988. In fact, U.S. military authorities used satellite technology to assist Hussein's forces with logistial intelligence. What is now amusing is the media, in defference to their corportate paymasters, will not mention one word of any of this. Pres. Bush I and his advisors had so much contempt for U.S. citizens that when the First Gulf War started, these politcal incompetents referred to U.S. citizens as resources rather than individualsThe essays re oil dealt with possible economic consequences re disruption of oil supplies. Threats to the U.S. ecconomy were bogus. The First Gulf War was supposed to reduce gasoline and oil costs. Yet the price for gasoline increased in spite of rosy predictions of oil/gasoline price reductions. To let readers know how false this prediction was, one only has to look at current gasoline prices and the very high jobless rate now plagueing Americans. Pres. Bush II and his advisers argued that with the elimination Saddem Hussein, oil prices would be reduced to about $20 a barrel-fameous last works. The predictions of the \\"neocons\\" have proven to so false as to be laughable if not so tragic.Essays dealing with constitutional issues were informative. Pres. Bush I stated he needed no congressional approval and that he could use U.S. military power unilatrallly. Sadly, few members of the U.S. House and Senate did not object at all to these claims of dictorial power. Also very few U.S. citizens had any qualms about the President acting as dictator. What was worse is that Pres. Bush II & co. threatened dissenters with indefinate detention and torture anyone who insisted on Constitutional Law and civil liberties granted by the Bill of Rights.The essays that dealt with events in Iran coincide with events in Iraq. These essays also revealed the stupidity of U.S. presidents and advisors. For example, Pres. Carter said events in Iran such as the overthrow of Mossadeagh in 1953 were \\"ancient history.\\" This stupid remark showed exactly what was/is wrong with U.S. policy makers. They know nothing and are proud to be stupid. As an aside this was just as stupid as the remarks by Pres. Bush II & co. when told of serious religious differences between Sunni and Shi'ite Moslems. Bush II & co. stated that they did not there were Shi'ites and Sunnis and they thought they were all Moslems They were so stupid that they did not know that Shia' Sunnis are different sectarian groups within Islam. They are both Moslems,and their religious differences have serious politcal overtones. Readers should know that Mossadeagh was opposed to Big Communism, persectuted domestic communists, and got Soviet forces to leave Iran after W.W. II. Yet his overthrow was based on the false premise that he was a Communist due to his demand that Western oil executives pay more for oil.Some of the essays included the French, British, Japanese, and German interests in Western Asia. Political complaints that these authorities have not contributed more fall flat. The French, German, etc. authorities would contribute more if they could advise on policy decisions. Yet, U.S.policy advisors have told them that the U.S. will take their troops and support but no \\"outside\\" influence. U.S. policy makers might know more if they listened to such advice. They sure could use it.One criticism of this book is that more historical background could have been offered. However, the book serves as a good guide to the disasters that incubate in Western Asia which will probably get worse. Readers who want a \\"quick guide\\" to the complex problems of Western Asia and the Middle East should read this book.James E. EgolfDecember 11, 2009"},{"Title":"America Entangled: The Persian Gulf Crisis and Its Consequences","review":"Ten years after its publication, this slim volume stands up to the test of time. The essays, all written prior to the beginning of the Gulf War, soberly examine the rationales and likely outcomes of the then unfought conflict. Then-president Bush's &quot;New World Order&quot;, the use of threats to the oil market as a rationale for the war, and long term problems in the mid-east are all critically dissected and little justification is found for military intervention.Possibly the most interesting part of the book is the essays on the oil supply. A pro-war administration and its pundit allies in the press predicted sky high prices if America didn't strike against &quot;naked aggression.&quot; An excellent case is made in &quot;A War for Oil?&quot; that no such thing would have occurred and the fact that oil prices have continued to decline over the past ten years, even with the restricted output and other disruptions in the oil supply, helps put the lie to such wild claims.This book is an essential addition to the library of anyone interested in critiques of America's foreign policy and especially to those who are concerned with the tendency of the U.S. to intervene militarily abroad."},{"Title":"A brief history of John Valentine Kratz, and a complete genealogical family register, with biographies of his descendants from the earliest available records to the present time [microform]","review":"I ordered this book Dec 16, 2009.

The Trails Illustrated map of the GC includes this area so that if you want to explore anything west of 112 15'W, you'll need to get the TI map.This is a lovely map for the limited area it shows. If the map included the missing area, the quality of this map would be my choice of the two. Another unique and nice feature is trail mileages included on many trails.Use area designations are shown which assist in applying for a backcountry camping permit. I'd have preferred that the designations such as BJ9 and AK9 had color variations to indicate their respective Management Zones such as Primitive and Wild.All in all this is an excellent map subject to above comments and provides a tremendous amount of information."},{"Title":"Grand Canyon Trail Map 4th Edition","review":"If you're planning a serious hike in the Grand Canyon, you really need to get this Sky Terrain map. It has an amazing 1:43,000 scale, which provides MUCH better detail than the popular National Geographic \\"Trails Illustrated\\" map at 1:63,360 scale. And although you can purchase USGS 7.5-minute quadrant maps of the canyon at 1:24,000 scale, they don't provide any of the crucial extras that this Sky Terrain map does: detailed trail information, profiles, mileage & difficulty ratings; backcountry use area boundaries & descriptions; perennial water sources; gps grid; park information, etc.; and it's waterproof & tearproof. It's clear and concise. This map contains so much information that you can pack it and leave your heavy guidebooks at home.My complaints? I personally find the contour shadings a bit confusing: I think their low-elevation grey coloring looks too similar to their high-elevation purple coloring, so on first glance it's too easy to confuse DOWN and UP. And as stated in other reviews, the coverage of this map is limited: it doesn't cover the western end past Crystal Rapids, and it doesn't cover north of Malgosa Canyon, so if you want to hike the North or South Bass Trails, or the Nankoweap Trail, for example, you're out of luck.That being said, I still feel that this map is easier to read than the \\"Trails Illustrated\\" one, with bolder print and lots of elevation markings. Another plus: this 3rd edition was revised in 2009, therefore it's very current. I highly recommend this map."},{"Title":"Grand Canyon Trail Map 4th Edition","review":"This Grand Canyon map covers the central area of the park (equivalent to 8 USGS quads) at 1:40,000 scale, nearly double that of its best competitor, the Trails Illustrated. While it's true there are areas in the park not covered, most backcountry campers and day hikers will be well within this map. Where the Sky Terrain maps excel is their eye-pleasing clarity and wealth of ground-level information. The T.I. maps by comparison are somewhat dark and over-shaded. You can read this one by the light from a campfire, no trouble. While I'd never discourage anyone from bringing a quad or two for their trip as a backup, this map will serve most needs and is vastly more up-to-date. GPS users familiar with UTM (you ought to be!) should be able to eyeball their position fairly easily with the grid provided.The margins include nice, concise trail descriptions and even elevation profiles for major hikes in the park. Also included are a small regional road map (useful for vehicle navigation), and a simplified geology profile for the canyon.If you're planning any casual or serious hiking or backpacking trip in GC, this should be part of your gear.P.S.

If you need detail for route finding, you still need a USGS quad (if you need this, you probably don't need me telling you this). If you're only doing an overnight hike on the Corridor trails, you don't need to buy this. The map they give you with the permit is sufficient. Even though it is good for what it is, I docked it a star because they didn't put a 100 meter scale on it. This would have been an easy add with a lot of value."},{"Title":"Grand Canyon Trail Map 4th Edition","review":"Being used and loved by an avid hiker and white wafter rafter.

These 13 stories, mainly about first-generation Jewish immigrants in America, but also about visitors to Italy from America, capture so much of life in a society where one is an outsider---that feeling of \\"being here but not here\\", or of living in a country, but not belonging. The wasted ex-coffee salesman, the harassed landlord, the loner rabbinical student, they all seem to pulsate with failure, with uncertainty, and fatal mistakes. Ah, this is a book about life all right, but it's a book in which the vision is almost tunnel vision. Every single story, without exception, deals with people who cannot rise to their own imaginations of themselves. They meet frustration, failure, death or disappointment, they are deflected from any purpose they might have once had. They are melancholy shades of fruitless endeavor. Does even one reach his ambition ? (They are all male.) No, the student doesn't find a house in Rome, the would-be art critic abandons his research, the would-be lover lies about his Jewish origins and loses the beautiful girl, the buyer on credit never pays back, the so-called reader never reads, the shoemaker allows his daughter to marry an unsuitable man. Only once, after humiliating an angel to tears, does an old man admit his mistake and save his wife from death, and this occurs in the only fantasy among the thirteen. Most of the characters lose, their labors come to naught, they grow wiser, but sadder. I would assume that Malamud himself felt an outsider everywhere, comfortable nowhere. If that is not true, his dreams must have been filled with worry, because this is a most melancholy collection. Does anyone smile ? Does anyone laugh ? Does anyone dash down the street radiant with love ? No. Life is full of personal shortcomings, a bald spot, a stubborn rejection of family, an inability to swim or make money. Frustration and lies run rampant--people certainly do shoot themselves in the foot again and again. Life is a tragedy, life always ends in disappointment-these are truths told in half the literature of the world, but there is more to our humble existence than that. Even when Malamud writes a humorous story, it is filled with underlying doubt in human nature, concentrating on the tendency of people to try to be what they are not. If you want thirteen superb stories to illustrate that sad point of view, here they are. If you think life is more of a mixed bag, then perhaps this book will only depress you."},{"Title":"The magic barrel","review":"'The Magic Barrel' by Malamud contains several (mostly) entertaining short stories involving Jewish (/Yiddish) characters from the 1950s. He captures a culture and way of life today's generation has no memory of. Although well written I cannot quite understand why this book would receive any special accolades.Bottom line: certainly a good read but not the sort of book worth searching for unless one has a special interest in Jewish/Yiddish American life. Recommended."},{"Title":"The magic barrel","review":"This is a very strange book. There are a lot of small messages that Mr. Malamud delivers in each of his stories. Everything from the mistreatment of others to stealing. He covers many different aspects of life that can help make people better citizens of the world.I did not enjoy his style of writing though. It was dull, and very dry. There was no excitment in any of his stories and I found it hard to keep myself reading. I can see how somebody else might enjoy it though... if you're the type that likes dull, dry stories, Malamud is the guy for you."},{"Title":"The magic barrel","review":"&quot;The Magic Barrel&quot; was a collection of stories that intrigued me, if only for the whimsical sounding name. I was disappointed, however, to find that the stories themselves were themselves not whimsical in the least. Malamud has created a world where paranoia is abundant, and worse, where poor, lackadaisical decisions are abound equally. There are no winners in any of Malamuds stories. I found myself becoming angry at the characters, for the way in which they responded to conflicts was alarmingly pathetic. His character development is strong, however, and I did enjoy maybe one or two of the stories until I found the ending rather dreary. If a literary work is &quot;sad,&quot; that is not a deterrant for me. Malamud's characters, on the other hand, are hopeless. I can't seem to enjoy reading about people who operate in such ways."},{"Title":"The magic barrel","review":"I was looking for a hard to find book in large print. I was shocked to see that they were selling a new edition for about $1.57.

Or better yet, don't sit down to read it at all. This is dry stuff!"},{"Title":"The magic barrel","review":"It was such a pleasure to read these stories. Each story grabs you quickly, and makes its narative thrust accessible. His stories don't stray from his simple narratives; there is very little excess or digression.The stories are very personal and moral without being preachy.

I usually am not too enamored of short story collections, since I don't appreciate starting anew every few pages in a book. But this book is an exception. I was amazed at how quickly one became caught up in each story. The first story is The First Seven Years, and is a most touching story, setting the reader up most felicitously for enjoyment of each of the following 12 stories."},{"Title":"The magic barrel","review":"This set of stories surprises one with breadth of understanding which it exhibits. From the first story (&quot;The First Seven Years&quot;) which deals with a father's desire to provide the best for his daughter through the last story (&quot;The Magic Barrel&quot;)which provides an interesting contrast to the first, all of these stories expand on the single theme of human experience.The frustration built upon in &quot;The Key&quot; and &quot;The Last Mohican&quot; if offset nicely by the humor in &quot;A Summer's Reading&quot; and &quot;The Lady of the Lake&quot;. &quot;Take Pity&quot; and &quot;The Mourners&quot; offer great insigth into growing old and dealing with lonliness. While &quot;Angel Levine&quot; is probably the most off beat of the set it still manages to increase hope, whereas &quot;The Prison&quot; causes an equal loss of faith in the human race.The 12 stories here provide a wonderful evening's reading, however if your looking for more they are included in the books of his complete stories."},{"Title":"The magic barrel","review":"Malamud does three or four tricks in his fiction well, and here he does each one to utter perfection. And when taken together, this collection of stories almost transcends Malamud's normal limits: the stories are compressed, short, and below the surface, charged with almost unbearable tension. Unlike other collections of stories (or when you read too many Malamud stories) Malamud does not parody himself in the Magic Barrell. Everything is where it is supposed to be, and works like a well oiled machine. It is a shame that (as of writing this) only eight people have reviewed this masterpiece of a short story collection. In Roth's The Ghost Writer, Zuckerman explains that the world's morality has already passed by the E.I. Lonoff's (a character based on Malamud). Seems Roth was correct... and this is true even more today, thirty years after the publication of The Ghost Writer. We no longer live in Malamud's world, and it is a shame."},{"Title":"The magic barrel","review":"These stories are pervaded with a certain sadness and disappointment, a sense of life as largely a trial in suffering. They are also however deep in a kind of quiet beauty, a unique language of slightly Yiddishized American colloquial restraint. The title story, and the most famous one tells of the hopes and disappointments of poor Jews seeking to find their ' bashert' their destined mate. It touches upon the world of tormented souls selling illusions to themselves and others. It really moves us with the sense of how the dreams of life turn bitterness into greater bitterness, with longing disappointment beauty. These stories are for those who are willing to read and take inspiration from the sadnesses of life, that nonetheless enrich our human meaning."},{"Title":"The magic barrel","review":"These stories about New York, even when read fifty years later by someone like me from a totally different demographic, in Los Angeles, are still relevant. There are universal self-loathing themes for all immigrants, at all times. I wouldn't call it immigrant lit, but it's more like human diaspora lit, the transience of people, and how people make sense, however limited, of the world around them. Strongly recommend. Malamud is able to make writing about trash untrashy, but not in a falsely glorifying way, but in a humanizing way. These are real short stories, not failed novellas."},{"Title":"The magic barrel","review":"I wasn't sure about this book but decided to give it a shot and I am so happy I did.

This book is perfect. It is divided into three sections: Where Do I Start, What Should I Paint, and What are the Basics. It begins at the beginning, discussing the choice of medium and theme; the selection, acquisition and care of supplies; and the choice of subject. It then moves on to technique: how to render a three-dimensional object on paper; how to compose a study; how to paint color, pattern and texture; painting space, depth and distance. These instructions are augmented by lots of pictures. You will see the step-by-step way to paint a tree, a face, a still life, a landscape etc. The final section really covers the basics -- mixing colors, types of paints, brushes, accessories, palette layouts, preparing canvases, paper, correcting mistakes, pencils, inks ....

It is one of the most profusely illustrated books on the subject of painting, and these are color illustrations. Nearly every single page has nearly half a dozen or more of the most vibrant, colorful, and well appointed illustrations that I have ever seen.So what's the downside of the book? There is no downside. This is 192 pages of the most wonderful instruction on the use of painting that I have ever seen. I discovered this while visiting the art galleries and shops in Taos, New Mexico.The book shows Simon Jennings to be the \\"general editor\\" and Sally Bulgin to be the \\"Consultant Editor\\" and several other names are included in advisory roles. I don't understand the identifications concerning \\"authorship\\" but certainly this is a book to stand out above and beyond the ordinary instruction on painting and the uses of color.In my reviews of drawing books, I've always warned people of the use of buzz words and gimmick phrases such as \\"complete-guide-to\\" as a marketing gimmick. That's because almost no books live up to the promise. \\"Art Class: A Complete Guide To Painting\\" is most certainly an exception to this.\\"Art Class\\" is one of those texts that stands so far above the other books on painting that it eclipses the entire field. It is one of those books that is so visually stunning that it is well worth the trip to a book shop to flip through its pages.I liked the opening paragraphs on page 14, Chapter One, titled \\"Where Do I Start\\" where \\"Art Class\\" says:\\"This book covers many levels of ability, but this page is aimed at the absolute beginner rather than the painter whose interests have been focused and techniques honed through years of dedication and experience.\\"Absolute Beginners! That's who gets the most benefit of this book. It shows all the materials you need to work in water color, oil, acrylic and what you need to work either indoors or out; but the text is so encyclopedic that you are not surprised to learn that the authors also were advised by technical experts from WINDSOR & NEWTON, which is the company that makes fine art paints. This is the most visually compelling art book I have ever seen.It's all about what you need to know to start working in color. More surprising still is the author's division of the book into three sections, instead of the typical ten to twelve chapters. Even the glossary is done in a unique manner. The page backgrounds are yellow, rather than white, and the outer edge of the glossary pages are trimmed in a beautiful red. This book is entirely designed by people who understand visual beauty and how to bring to life all things visually presented.\\"Art Class\\" lists the basics of these classifications as follows:Color, Paints, Diluents, Mediums, Primers & Grounds, Varnish and size, Brushes, Knives and accessories, Palettes, Canvas, Boarrds and panels, Papers, Painting techniques, Pastels, Drawing Equipment.This book is so unlike everything else I have ever seen that it is one of my genuine treasures on the book shelf.

If you're a beginner you may like it, but it lacks so much that is essential for the beginner. Being an art teacher, the flow of the book really makes sense. It works you from still life all the way up to portraiture. You do however need to know how to draw prior to purchasing this book and start painting. It does not provide you w/excersises for learning the elements of art (for example: form and how to create it through value, line, space, and being able to give the object spatial sense). Otherwise, it is a good beginner reference book in the sense that it'll give you direction if you're trepadatious.In the back there is a sort of art equipment index explaining types of materials and suggested ways to use them. There is also a small glossary of terms.At best though, it's a good reference manual for teachers and I'll tell you why. It has breif explinations on materials, just enough to jog your memory (if you haven't used the material in a while). Has a good chronology for a curriculum if you are teaching a full year or 2 consecutive years of a painting and drawing course.There is no history included, but it does show different approches for the same purpose. Example, people approach going to canvas in different ways: 1. carefully sketching in water soluble pencil, 2. sketching in charcoal, 3. Using a very light wash, 4. no pre-sketching at all. In other words, it gives you multiple methods to achieve the same end--how you work depends on which you'll chose.Not a bad buy, not a great one either.You're better off buying \\"The New Artist's Manual: The Complete Guide to Painting and Drawing Materials and Techniques\\" by this author.

It autobiographically tells the story of his part in the Boer War. He started as the sixteen year old son of a prominent Boer politician and ended with him joining Jan Smutts on his raid on Port Elizabeth. This is a story of guerrilla warfare based on minimal resources, for instance they used to visit the abandoned camp sites of British Columns just to pick up ammunition that the Tommies had dropped. They then used this to attack the very soldiers who had dropped it.However, at the end of the Boer War Reitz was unable to accept British rule and went into exile and this is where the second volume, Trekking On starts. After a disastrous effort at hauling freight by ox cart in Madagascar which nearly cost him is life, Reitz is persuaded by Smutts to return to South Africa where he regains his health and enters local politics. At the outbreak of W.W.II Reitz joins the South African Army and takes part in the putting down of the Maritz rebellion and the campaigns in East Africa. Once the Germans are defeated in Africa he travels to England and , having decided firmly which side he would prefer to be on, joins the British Army as a private. Following a chance meeting with Smutts in London he experiences a dizzying rise in rank and ends the war, after seeing much action as the Colonel of a famous Scottish regiment.The final book in the trilogy, No Outspan, covers Reitz's life in South African politics between the wars and concludes with him as Deputy Prime Minister of South Africa sitting on an advisory panel to Winston Churchill. in London. During this time he is visited by an Englishman who returned to him the Mauser rifle he took from him when Reitz became his prisoner during the Boer War.

Reitz prompts a similar question: why does a man volunteer to spend his youth and early manhood fighting? Is it the example of others, the ideals, the adventure, the comradeship? And can any of these compensate for seeing comrades blown apart time and again.The absence of the need for a reply is one of Reitz's great achievements. His chosen role is to describe with apparent total objectivity his experiences in conflicts of historic importance for Britain and subequatoriial Africa. How else but with the exclusion of self can such horrific events be described. And how else except in excruciating detail can such testimony be justified? A torn limb or exposed intestines, when suffered by those you messed with the night before, are not minor things. Through all these tribulations Reitz seems to keep his spirits up. He is always game to push on, to see the field of battle from a better viewpoint, to visit friends in neighboring positions. And all the while he must be keeping notes.Reitz describes both the banal minutia and the broad sweep of war. He records how men suffered and fought and died, and lost and triumphed, in some of the most important campaigns in Europe and southern and eastern Africa, before and during the first Great War.This was no mean feat. Reitz was 17 when he entered the Boer War. What stimulus drove him from such an early age to keep a detailed record of all he saw and did? Was it pure chance that he participated in so many theatres? How fortunate he was fluent in Afrikaans, English and, apparently, German, and that his position, as the son of a Boer leader, allowed him to come into close contact with key figures of the time. These latter ranged from Paul Kruger and Jan Smuts to Winston Churchill. And what luck he could write!After reading \\"Commando\\" and \\"Trekking On\\" so many terrible images stick in the mind: the Boers at the end of their war in the bitter cold, with clothes in rags, collecting fallen unused cartridges in the wake of British columns; the thousands of horses dying of sleeping sickness in the Tanganyika campaign; the violent surreal life of First World War trenches.Reading his account today a century and more later is an illuminating and thought provoking experience and one that generates both abhorrence of war and deep admiration for the man, his people and his brothers-in-arms.But why, in the House of Emslie edition of \\"Trekking On\\" are we deprived of the description of Reitz's time in Madagascar? And why is the CruGuro edition of \\"Commando\\" the worst edited book I have ever come across? Reitz, and readers, deserve better."},{"Title":"Commando;: A Boer journal of the Boer War","review":"The Boers were Dutch colonists in South Africa.

The heroine, Brandy, was the strongest and most self-identifiable female character I have seen since Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum series. The police and detective sequences made the book more enjoyable for &quot;novices&quot; like myself, and the storyline moved along at a great clip. Thank you Ms. Lorrah for such an interesting read.....I am now hooked on the Vampire genre."},{"Title":"Blood Will Tell","review":"Boring, pointless, and badly writen.

It didn't use any of the usual clich&eacute;s of the genre.I found all of the characters intriguing and didn't want to put the book down. I especially liked the way Jean handled the whole relationship between Dan and Brandy.Her theories about vampires are unique and intriguing. I found the last few chapters to be wonderfully nail biting and went to bed rather late because I had to read them before I slept.

In such a place, there should not be a rash of murders, especially not ones as baffling as the ones she is now trying to solve. The first victim was supposed to be only in early middle age, but appeared to be an old man who died with a very odd expression on his face. It is not long before other bodies begin appearing, one of them her own best friend. Brandy seeks help from computer genius, Dan Martin. What she gets is a lot more.She begins to fall in love with Dan, but a mysterious secret keeps them apart at first. Dan has an inside track on the killer that is completely unexpected, and shocking. Brandy finds that she is facing an other worldly villain that will attempt to corrupt her very soul. Small town politics and murders may be what she is fighting on the surface, but the truth is one she can hardly believe. Vampires are real.***** In a complex and fast paced plot, readers are given a new twist on the old legends. Dan is an appealing hero, but not as other worldly and brooding as many heroes in this genre are. Brandy is a modern, strong willed woman whom many readers will find similiar to themselves. If it is possible, this would make a fantastic continuing series."},{"Title":"Blood Will Tell","review":"Plain clothes officer Brenda Mather answers a late shift call from Jackson Purchase State University. There is a dead body of an elderly man in Callahan Hall. Her partner Church, Churchill Jones has already left for the weekend so Brandy answers the call alone. Lucky for her Campus Security Chief is Howard McBride a retired police officer. Coroner Troy Sanford's autopsy results disclose the ancient fellow laying dead in the History Department has died of natural causes due to old age. The case takes a definite turn for the peculiar when dental records reveal that the body is that of Professor Everett Land who everyone knows is a robust man in his forties.Brandy engages the help of Dr. Dan Martin one of the school's professors in the Computer Science department. The pair determine Professor Land assumed a new identity some thirty or so years ago after he had reached his sixties under his previous name. Brandy is dumbfounded when the police chief declares the case closed and tells Brandy to get back to her other cases.As Dr. Martin and Brandy develop a caring relationship she is convinced there is more to her loved one than is apparent. As time goes on Brandy begins to know for certain that Dr. Martin is not your average college professor.Blood Will Tell is a page turner daring to take what is accepted lore regarding vampires and turn that clich&eacute; inside out. Writer Lorrah presents a well crafted work filled with good writing, fiduciary situations and characters, thought provoking situation and stimulating dialogue. Blood Will Tell is an appealing amalgam of romance, science fiction, and police procedure in which solidly punctilious main characters exhibit great strength of character in the face of impossible situation. Blood Will Tell stands in the class of P.N. Elrod's vampire mysteries.Writer Lorrah sets the stage for excitement from the opening paragraph then carries the reader on a roller coaster of excitement right to the last page. Blood Will Tell is not a narrative for a dark stormy night alone when the lights are flickering and the reader is home alone.Reviewed by: molly martin"},{"Title":"Blood Will Tell","review":"Brandy Mather is a detective on the police force of the rural city of Murphy, Kentucky. She is both thrilled and dismayed when a local professor is found dead of advanced old age when the day before he had seemed a healthy man in his mid 40's. This is one of the few genuine mysteries she has come across in her job and for once she sees a real chance to use her detective skills.However, for Brandy this case is going to turn out to be one which throws her perceptions of people and her town in a tailspin. She finally meets a man, Dan Martin, who's willing to take her as she is in a relationship (and not try to make her leave the police force) - but he's a man with a secret who can crack her case right open and lead her into the heart of darkness and corruption in the centre of the city. A darkness which could swallow both Brandy and Dan without a second's thought if they are not careful.This is a well thought out police procedural novel. It is filled with believable, human and fallible characters. Mysteries are not solved overnight and all the characters have a real life and normal day to day problems to deal with. In many ways this has been the best written vampire/detective novel I have read in a long time, and I can see why it justifiably received the Lord Ruthven Assembly Award.If you like the vampire/detective/mystery sub-genre this is a novel you MUST pick up and read. It will be come a yard stick for many other books you might read in the future. Ignore the tacky cover, it doesn't do the contents justice."},{"Title":"Blood Will Tell","review":"It's by no means the worst thing I've read, but it's not really worth spending that much time with, either. It's kind of a shame, because there are some interesting twists on the genre. Most of the vampires seem to want to have a mainstream life, which could be interesting, and she does deal a little with the difficulties for the vampire characters of trying to have a normal life while you have to keep changing identies. She also makes vampirism a genetic disorder, which is a nice science-y variation, but it gets screwed up with a goofy twist. It's genetic, so you can't pass it on, but if the vampire's really, really in wuv with a soulmate, they get to live almost as long as the vampire. Aaaw. This basically is to allow having your cake & eating it too for the main characters, and it's kind of annoying since the vampire character asserts that there's nothing supernatural about the disorder.The big problem is that main characters aren't really that interesting, and have one of the flattest romances I've seen in a while. The \\"mystery\\" is see-through, and if the main character were actually as smart and inquisitive as she's supposed to be, the book would be about 100 pages shorter. The book is also trapped in a \\"Young Adult\\" writing style, so much so that I wonder if it was originally intended as one. If so, it would explain at least one of the rythm-killing tangents the book takes, where lead character cop Brandy goes to give a \\"keep your kids off drugs\\" lecture to the local PTA for an otherwise inexplicable half a chapter."},{"Title":"Blood Will Tell","review":"I was so excited to find this book by an author who is from and still lives in my home state of Kentucky. The excitement ended by chapter two. The romance portion of the story is frustrating and the mystery predictable. The two main characters get together in chapter 1 (yes, chapter 1) and they are in limbo until later in the book...much later. The \\"mystery\\" in the story is probably only a mystery if you don't own a tv or this is the first book you've ever picked up. Free time is precious, spend it on Charlaine Harris orLaurel K. Hamilton."},{"Title":"Blood Will Tell","review":"Blood Will Tell is a great read.

I didn't find the characters that interesting or appealing -- at least, not enough to buy a sequel if there is one. It's so obvious who the villain is. And, frankly, I like my romances a lot steamier. The best we get here is the first delicious kiss that Dan gave Brandy. Everything after that was just bland. I DO have to agree with one reader, though. The cover is so misleading. Who is that vamp on the cover? It certainly isn't Dan Martin who was described as having black eyes and black hair. Black hair? Isn't that a [very unappealing] blonde on the cover? And was that supposed to be a werewolf in the corner? There was no werewolf in the book. One more thing; I thought the last terror scene would never end. Good grief, was THAT ever dragged out. I kept hoping the book would get better. I would recommend any of The Southern Vampire Series books INSTEAD of this."},{"Title":"Blood Will Tell","review":"This book does start slow - but if you hang in there it is a great story.

Dental records later confirm that the dead person is Land, but how did he double in age seemingly overnight?While at the University, Brandy meets computer science teacher Dan Martin, who explains he helped Everett with a web site. Dan assists Brandy by accessing Land's records in hopes of finding a clue. While working together, Brandy and Dan fall in love with one another. However, Dan is not what he pretends to be and soon Brandy questions her sanity as she wonders if she loves a clever killer or something out of a horror novel like a vampire?BLOOD WILL TELL is an exciting romantic police procedural vampire tale that is filled with action, strong sleuthing, and a fresh perspective on the blood-eating creatures of the night. The tale starts with action as the mystery opens rather quickly with the puzzler how does a middle aged person become geriatric in seemingly hours? From that powerful opening gamut, the plot smoothly blends elements from the two genres into a brilliantly conceived, cohesive tale. With superb lead characters and a complete support cast, fans of supernatural mysteries or jut vampiric tales will want to read Jean Lorrah's terrific novel that shows talent will tell.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Wild Weekend","review":"It takes a while to get into the story as the style of writing is wordy and dense.

While I remember little about Napoleon from high school history class, this book highlights Napoleon in an interesting way. Cronin writes well and picks out enough information to give you a good overview of Napoleon.Easily, a biography on Napoleon can run volumes and they do. Cronin, however, presents Napoleon's early days on Corsica, his French military school days, his significant battles in Italy and Egypt, his reign in France, his march on Russia, his exile to Elba, his return to France and his final bannashment to the Island of St Helena, in an easy going manner.According to Cronin, Napoleon is either loved or hated by biographers. While a reader doesn't need to know this, Cronin provides an analysis at the end of his book on primary sources about Napoleon and which, in his view, are credible. Based on this, Cronin appears to present a balanced view of Napoleon."},{"Title":"The case of the stuttering bishop (Pocket books)","review":"This story opens with a man claiming to be an Australian bishop walking into Mason's office and asking for Mason's help in a legal matter against a millionaire. However, the man stutters terribly and after he leaves neither Mason or Della Street can believe that he is actually a bishop. After the man is hit on the head, the story takes on many convolutions, in my opinion it is close to the most complex case that Mason has taken on. Gardner introduces many options, develops them slowly and then suddenly the \\"truth\\" comes out in a few pages.There are many possible suspects and near the end, Mason says that he has come up with an explanation that is a wild one, yet it is the only one that fits the facts. There are impersonations, ruthless con men and other lesser characters that distract you from the search for the real killers.The best part of the book is the scene where Mason is in the office of Hamilton Burger, his courtroom opponent. Unlike many of the other Perry Mason books, Burger is depicted as a man who respects and even likes Perry Mason and not as a bumbling fool with simplistic tunnel vision. This in combination with the complexity of the plot makes this one of the best Perry Mason stories."},{"Title":"The case of the stuttering bishop (Pocket books)","review":"The Case of the Stuttering BishopBishop William Mallory of Sydney, Australia visits Perry Mason about a manslaughter case. Could a sudden emotional shock cause stuttering? Perry calls Paul Drake to see if the bishop is genuine (Chapter I). They find where Mallory is staying, but there is a mysterious attack on Mallory in his hotel room. An ambulance came for him, then another ambulance came for him! They track down the woman who visited him (Chapter II). Her story about a personal ad checks out (Chapter III). But the bishop got on a ship bound for Australia (Chapter IV). Julia Branner, formerly Mrs. Oscar Brownley, visits Perry and tells of her past life and what she wants (Chapter V). Perry visits Renwold C. Brownley and they discuss the case (Chapter VI). An early morning phone call wakes Perry with the message that a woman has shot and killed Renwold C. Brownley (Chapter VII)!Perry finds that Julia Branner had gone to the waterfront, and saw another woman shoot Brownley. Perry tells her to not answer questions and he'll try to help her (Chapter VIII). Julia Branner was arrested for murder, Mallory disappeared from his ship (Chapter IX). Della's impersonation of Janice Seaton draws out two private investigators (Chapter X). Perry meets the granddaughter of Brownley, and finds Victor Stockton, one of the two private investigators, with a scheme that will trap Perry in a crime! Perry meets Philip Brownley, the grandson, who tells what he knows (this substantiates what a witness saw). When Perry interviews Julia Branner in jail he gets an unpleasant surprise. Paul Drake found a yachtsman who visited Mallory (Chapter XII).Perry visits Hamilton Burger to explain his actions. Burger gives Perry little time to justify his story. It doesn't look good for Perry and his client (Chapter XIII). The preliminary examination of Julia Branner begins in Chapter XIV, this reviews the known facts about the shooting. Perry notes the strange facts: if the shooter ran away, and Brownley was dead, who drove the car off the wharf? Perry is in an impossible situation. If Brownley drove off the wharf, he was not shot dead by Julia Branner (Chapter XV). A chance remark by Della Street puts a new light on one person's activities the night of the murder. Perry plays this hand and it pays off (Chapter XVI). They find out what happened to Bishop Mallory (Chapter XVII). Perry explained what happened, and why Julia Branner refused to talk (Chapter XVIII). The next chapter concludes this case.In this story Perry was very close to jail and disbarment. He was involved in more action than in other stories. This 1936 novel reflects the outlook of its day."},{"Title":"The case of the stuttering bishop (Pocket books)","review":"The title character of Erle Stanley Gardner's &quot;The Case of the Stuttering Bishop&quot; enters Perry Mason's office one day and presents an enigmatic story about the granddaughter of a wealthy man. The girl's mother gave up the child for adoption long before, but now the granddaughter is coming forward to claim a share of her grandfather's estate. At the same time, an imposter has come forward--or so says the stuttering bishop. But is he for real, or is he merely an imposter, too?Before Mason can determine the answer to that question, the bishop is attacked in his hotel room and then disappears, apparently into thin air, while boarding a ship. At the same time, Mason is trying to track down the various parties and to determine who's who. When the wealthy grandfather is murdered, though, it appears that Mason has his first guilty client.Unlike many Perry Mason novels, &quot;The Case of the Stuttering Bishop&quot; does not end up in a dramatic court confrontation, and it therefore deviates somewhat from form. The case here is also significantly more convoluted than that in many of the Perry Mason novels. Because of this change of form, I found the novel less satisfying than the other Perry Mason novels I've read. The name Perry Mason, after all, connotes brilliant lawyering, and the emphasis on the detective work here left me disappointed."},{"Title":"The case of the stuttering bishop (Pocket books)","review":"I really enjoyed this book.

I tried a few times to design my own spreads but was only successful in creating one truely useful spread. In the week after receiving this book I created six spreads, four of which I deemed good enough to add to my book of shadows.The trick, the author explains, is to focus on the question first. I had been too busy trying to create a multi-purpose spread like the celtic cross to realize the power of this simple technique. This is not to say that the spread will not be multi-purpose, in fact a whole chapter is devoted to generalizing the spread to fit more situations.

I find him amusing, and have read the trilogy plus his GREEN GROWS THE CITY because they sustained my interest, but he is not P.G. Wodehouse or John Mortimer for that matter.I cannot judge from Nichols books whether or not he had a particularly deep understanding of human nature. From time to time, he allowed himself to be drawn into odd misadventures with eccentric others, and he certainly had his conflicts with busy-body females, and as often as not he had charming female friends. His best friend in the world seemed to be Gaskin, his 'man' and his cats.The central theme of MERRY HALL, the first book in his trilogy, is the restoration of the grounds and gardens at his old Georgian Estate. LAUGHTER ON THE STAIRS covered the renovation of Merry Hall--the Georgian Manor house. His third book, SUNLIGHT ON THE LAWN, has people as it's focus--those who inhabited the area in and around Merry Hall when Nichols lived there in the late forties and fifties. First, there is the sad departure of Oldfield whose gardening days come to an abrupt end. Then, there are various episodes involving the ever meddling Rose, tea with Miss Mint, fractious neighbors, overgrown fields, and wells without water.As always, in a book by Beverly Nichols, there are cats. Nichols had a great love of black cats, and the cats often play a role in one of his tales. Most of the time the story is funny, but sometimes a cat meets a sad end. If you are a cat fancier, you may find his cat exploits familiar and amusing. This is a nice book for bedtime reading and a fitting end to the series."},{"Title":"Sunlight on the Lawn","review":"Beverley Nichols had a rare talent. His writing is witty and humane and perfect for relieving the stress of life lived in the modern world. When you read this book you will be saddened that only two others of his sixty odd minor masterpieces are still in print. Buy this book if you love gardens, or old houses or simply reading well written stories, some of which are laugh out loud funny. Beverley Nichols writes like Oscar Wilde, except his subject is gardening and old houses and the curious people who dwell in them."},{"Title":"Sunlight on the Lawn","review":"This is the third book in the Merry Hall trilogy; a hilarious series of books written by a &quot;proper&quot; British gentleman about the trials and tribulations of finding, remodelling and decorating his home and garden. The books are heaps of fun, filled with his beloved flowers and cats, as well as, rival gardeners and nosy neighbors (if looks could kill! ). Altough his trilogy is chiefly known for its superb humor, it often astounds with deep insight into human nature, and many a times it tugs at the heart strings (I ended up shedding a few tears over each book). I read &quot;Merry Hall&quot; (my 1st Beverly Nichols book) about a year ago, after which I was compelled to read all of his works (which in most cases meant searching for out of print books). I highly recommend the entire trilogy to anyone who wants to laugh."},{"Title":"Sunlight on the Lawn","review":"Sunlight on the Lawn is the third volume in the Merry Hall trilogy by Beverley Nichols. Where the first volume focused on the garden at Merry Hall and the second focused on the house, this volume focuses on the community, providing a humorous glimpse into English village life in the 1950's. Gardeners and fans of Mr. Nichols' spendthrift ways will be happy to know that large-scale projects continue apace in the author's garden.It is a mistake to read the foreword first - it casts an elegiac tone over the rest of the book. Save it for the end. Also putting a bit of a damper on things is the fact that we realize in this book that Our Beverley is something of a coward - he touches so lightly on the death of one of the characters (real people - this is memoir, not fiction) that the reader is left gasping, and spends the rest of the book wondering if he has mis-read. For these reasons I have knocked one star off of my rating for this book.Having said that, if you have already read and enjoyed the first two volumes, you will be eager to spend more time in the company of this author, and see what his friends and neighbors are getting up to. Mr. Nichols is a keen observer of people, and with his deliciously dry wit (and unsparing of himself) he turns everyday situations and relationships into real entertainment.Highlights of the book include the escalating but ever \\"civil\\" fued between Our Rose and Miss Emily, and how Bob helps extricate Miss Mint from a very sticky situation involving the tenants from hell.I'm off to order more books by Mr. Nichols!"},{"Title":"Sunlight on the Lawn","review":"Enjoy Nichols' books and was happy to receive this one, in excellent shape, signed by the author!

A combination of Jerome K. Jerome and May Sarton. This book is about his cats, his friends, and his garden. There are some very funny parts and some very sad parts. Some are almost too sad to read, but that is the way it usually is with excellent books like this."},{"Title":"Sunlight on the Lawn","review":"Having read Trilogy1 and 2 of this series, I just had to get the third. It did not disappoint at all. A continuance of Beverley Nichols life with his beloved garden, and lifes ups and downs.Recommended reading."},{"Title":"V S Naipaul (Writers and their Work)","review":"This was a hard-nosed analysis of Naipaul's work as a whole. Without being overly jargonistic or heavily literary it managed to show the links between different phases of Naipaul's development, and give a sense of the overall development of Naipaul's thinking. It is not a pretty picture, and one that many of Naipaul's admirers will find objectionable. But the argument is persuasive and cannot be dismissed lightly. It is also valuable in providing the context for Naipaul's many books, which are often set in vastly different countries and cultures."},{"Title":"The King's Achievement","review":"This is one of the greatest books written by Robert Hugh Benson during his short life. He incorporates Church history, world history, romance, intrigue, vocations, martyrdom, war, and family into a breathtaking historical novel. The setting is in 16th-century England. The story revolves around the gradual destruction of the monasteries by King Henry VIII and the effects of this destruction on the priests, nuns, and families that held fast to the Faith of their Fathers. The book will hold your complete attention right up to the climatic ending in the Tower of London. There are many parallels to our times."},{"Title":"The King's Achievement","review":"I'm an avid reader.... this is my favorite book of all time.

Wright's review of this book I would not have bought it -- if I didn't already have it, and realized that the reviewer was referring to another publisher's edition! (I followed the link.) This Once and Future Books edition is not only professionally retypeset with the cover designed by an award-winning graphic artist (my nephew is the editor, so I know this -- he made a point of telling me), but has \\"value added\\" in the form of a well-written and instructive foreword. It is definitely NOT just a bound typescript.We should never judge a book by its cover in any event. So what's inside? This sort of historical novel is not my usual cup of tea, nor am I Catholic, but I enjoyed it. It's an entertaining story, if not as exciting as I prefer. I did not buy it for myself, but I'm glad I read it. I also enjoyed the other editions of Mr. Benson's works in this series. They are miles beyond the usual trash available."},{"Title":"The King's Achievement","review":"I bought this based on other great works by Fr. Benson, but have not read it yet.

The poems have been translated into English by Edward V. Coughlin. The book is presented in bilingual format, with the Spanish originals and English versions on facing pages.Sosa's work shows great compassion for the poor and oppressed, especially in poems like &quot;The Poor,&quot; &quot;Three Shadows Reversed in the Mirror,&quot; &quot;The People,&quot; and others. His language is frequently direct and uncluttered, and sometimes surreal and cryptic. He often uses striking images, such as the following: &quot;May there be children who have toys, / bread / and stars under their shoes&quot; (from &quot;The City of the Beggar Children&quot;).Sosa's voice can be prophetic (see, for example, &quot;Testimonies&quot;), and can evoke the style of Walt Whitman (&quot;The Grass Cut by the Peasants&quot;).

I especially liked it, because it was NOT just about Hollywood's legendary stars of the 1950's through the 1990's. But it included interesting background information about the responsibilities and interaction of movie technicians (hairdressers, cosmetologists, electricians, etc.)as well as the author's own story of her life between movies when she lived in California, West Virginia, and New Hampshire with her husband and 3 daughters. The author is VERY UPBEAT and HUMOROUS. And--SHE did not include scandalous incidents which would cause embarrassment to the stars or her colleagues! The book was a PLEASURE to read, and I am looking forward to reading her next one!"},{"Title":"Hairdresser to the Stars : A Hollywood Memoir","review":"Oprah, where are you?! This book is amazing. Blymyer takes you along on her adventures here there and everywhere with the most exciting people you've heard and read about. Not only is she generous in sharing the fun times, but she also shares the most personal turns in her life where she questions what is this all about? She questions her decisions regarding her husband, children and her career and all the while she is searching for a deeper meaning to her life. You'll laugh and cry and feel a little sadness when the book ends and Blymyer has to say goodbye to the reader. You will go back to read this book time and time again and pass it along to your friends.

This is such fun winter reading-especially the parts about the Caribbean."},{"Title":"Hairdresser to the Stars : A Hollywood Memoir","review":"Ginger Blymyer tells her story of working with some of the greatest stars of our time. She tells it with honesty and tenderness. If you love to hear the behind the scenes adventures this is a book for you. Unlike many who have written books of this kind, Ginger makes no attempt to tell you that she knew all of the secrets of the stars she worked with. Instead she reveals them as human beings. She reveals her own feelings of awe in working on daily basis with people we can only dream of meeting...a wonderful book...."},{"Title":"Hairdresser to the Stars : A Hollywood Memoir","review":"What a delight! Humor, pathos, bits of life from an industry few of us know yet most of us can't help but be interested in. Anyone who likes movies or television will get a kick out of this book.

A bargain for movie lovers!"},{"Title":"Hairdresser to the Stars : A Hollywood Memoir","review":"Being the Natalie Wood fan that I am I was particularily interested in the sections of the book that mentioned her but having worked for a movie studio once I found the whole book of interest. The author had the life I wish I had in Hollywood."},{"Title":"Hairdresser to the Stars : A Hollywood Memoir","review":"This book captured me from the first page and I was sad to see it come to an end. This clever, well written book afforded me an education about the magic and wonder of movie making, while, at the same time, debunking popular myths - glitz, glamour, immorality, casting couches and the like. The author shed light on just how much hard work goes into making movie magic. I have always been fascinated by the movie making business but never realized just how much hard work it takes on everyone's part. The bonding of actors/crew during the making of a movie was self-evident and the 'family feel' certainly lent to the creative process. The author portrayed those talented personalities involved in making movies realistically, bubbling over with creativity yet possessing feet of clay. The book was written in good taste - no mud slinging or character assignation. It's a gem, a realjoy to read and has a special place on my bookcase.Hairdresser to the Stars: A Hollywood Memoir"},{"Title":"Hairdresser to the Stars : A Hollywood Memoir","review":"I am not in the habit of reading non-fiction, but considering the fact that I'm a star struck, old movie enthusiast, how could I not love this book? It is absolutely wonderful. I'm sure there were many scandalous incidents that occurred on the sets of such movies as How The West Was Won, The Birds, McLintock!, The Boston Strangler, and on and on, but Ginger Sugar is lady enough not to repeat those in her book. What she did was, tell you her impressions of the actors, directors and crew members she worked with, some of which are very pleasant, while others not so much, as well as tell the reader about life-long friendships with some of those infamous movie stars. I'm not going to put any spoilers in this review because I had so much fun reading about how Ginger Sugar helped such stars as Robert Redford (great story) feel more comfortable, or why Natalie Wood always wore a large bracelet.Another thing I really loved about this book was that it discusses Ginger Sugar's personal life - marriage and children - and how that side of her was affected by her career. It is an honest account of her life's journey and the movie business. This book also discusses following your dreams, even though they may not turn out as you expected.If you are an old movie buff, I highly recommend this read."},{"Title":"Hairdresser to the Stars : A Hollywood Memoir","review":"Although, interesting at times I was disappointed in this book. The author rattles on and jumps around so the book does not flow. She talks about her life and the affairs she and her husband had. I really wanted to read about the stars and not about her.

Whipple, the author of \\"Storm\\" was a survivor of the 1938 \`Long Island Express' hurricane that caught New Englanders by surprise and \\"carved a swath of destruction 325 miles long, from the beach resorts of Long Island through the heart of New England to Montreal and the hinterlands of Canada.\\"Not only is this 1982 Time-Life \`Planet Earth' book a good, concise history of weather forecasting, it also contains descriptions, photographs and diagrams of some of the most fearsome hurricanes, typhoons, blizzards, and tornadoes to have plagued the 20th Century.This is one of the best introductions to meteorology I have read, and the only part that needs updating is the chapter on \\"Attempting to Tame the Weather.\\" Some of the instrumentation described here never did work, e.g. TOTO (the Totable Tornado Observatory). As for attempts to modify weather, the summarization in \\"Storm\\" still holds true: \\"The lightning suppression program is virtually dead, hail suppression has undergone retrenchment, major efforts at hurricane modification have been delayed.\\"The decades since this book was published have seen improvements in storm tracking, but effective weather modification is still beyond our grasp."},{"Title":"Storm (from the Planet Earth series)","review":"This book is a part of the \\"Planet Earth\\" series from Time-Life. It well-written, well organized, and well illustrated. Many of the photos are in color. The first chapter, and a succeeding one, concern hurricanes, and the explanations of hurricane dynamics are excellently explained, abetted by well designed color diagrams. The first chapter concerns the Great New England Hurricane of 1938, and is one of the better narratives I have ever read about this stupendous event. Especially interesting is the disclosure that exactly the same sort of disaster occurred in New England in 1815!!!The book also addresses tornadoes, albeit in less detail than I would have preferred, blizzards, and the not quite ordinary thunderstorm. It seems tornadoes do not lend themselves to detailed narratives very wellI was very impressed with the chapter on how Norwegian scientists discovered and named the processes involving the movement of storms, air masses, and fronts. This was probably the most re-read chapter of the book.This bood will not make you a meteorologist, but it will enable a sensible understanding of the phenomena our turbulent atmosphere casts our way. Recommended highly, especially for high schooler and weather devotees"},{"Title":"Gifted Children - Myths And Realities","review":"Gifted Children merits a ten, because it is easy for parents as well as educators to read. Winner calls the reader's attention to the state of American education in a matter-of-fact way by illustrating the difficulties parents of gifted children have had as they have attempted to obtain a free, appropriate education for their offspring.The author provides specific examples of how anti-elitism has pervaded our country's school system, making the educational environment of academically gifted children hostile to their exceptional abilities.This country is beginning to feel the effects of the education system's insensitive treatment of America's future leaders. Without explicitly stating this, Ellen Winner has exposed the situation to her readers calling them to action whether or not their children are truly gifted. All American children compromise the future of the United States of America."},{"Title":"Gifted Children - Myths And Realities","review":"I enjoyed the book immensely, reading it in one sitting. While I'm glad it's in my library, this is not a book I have opened a second time.I purchased seeking to research extreme intellect, but found it of little value in terms of practicality/applicability for raising a profoundly gifted child. The fact-based approach and research cites appeal to me, but there is little to assist in the day-to-day of raising and advocating for these kids. Further, there was too much emphasis on musical/artistic (creative) genius -- I realize this is one area of her specialization -- and not enough on &quot;global&quot; gifteness, rare as that may be."},{"Title":"Gifted Children - Myths And Realities","review":"As a librarian and parent of a &quot;gifted&quot; child I found Ms Winner's book helpful personally and often recommend to to library patrons. It is a great introduction for parents that might otherwise follow some less than sage advice from friends or relatives. It may also help pushy parents to find reason to slack-off. The comments on which research seems to have been validated through repeated studies and those that haven't is most useful. Ms Winner seems to want to be fair. I look forward to an updated edition in the future"},{"Title":"Gifted Children - Myths And Realities","review":"For a few years now, this is the basic book I push on friends and others who want to know how those professionals who care, but who aren't pretentious and don't promise to be fix-its, see giftedness.Such professionals want to tell you how to identify a gifted child with high confidence, and also how a gifted child differs from the general population in the course of a usual childhood.Winner does this well. It's hard to ask for more from a basic book.Rather than find another book on raising gifted children, one should look for those gifted adults who meet Winner's criteria, decide on their trustworthyness, and ask for their help.Then you'll be setting up a pattern the child can follow for life, and with a next generation of gifted children. An extended family-led pattern.To check if Winner's criteria are met, a simple trick is to teach a child to play chess. It's a game that rewards precocity, one's own drummer, and a rage to master very immediately.Networks of kids who play chess have many kids who satisfy Winner's criteria, whose parents might want to share tips.A small caveat to the book is that it should be updated for the Internet, which spans across school systems, to connect child to child, parent to parent, and child to adult, at low cost.The Internet may not be better than libraries below a certain age. But after that age, a gifted child will find it on his or her own."},{"Title":"Gifted Children - Myths And Realities","review":"This book had so much potential. I was labeled as gifted as a child, and picked up this book in hopes of searching for the truth about why I am an introvert, and why my peers and I have had trouble fitting in at times. Facts seemed to be listed by Winner in a factual order, as if just an expanded outline, when she could have really grabbed her audience with more specifics. For example, the enclosed artwork embellished the book, especially the section on savants. Otherwise, it is kind of an irony that a book on gifted children was written so poorly, even by someone from Harvard..."},{"Title":"Gifted Children - Myths And Realities","review":"I enjoyed read this book and read it in one or two sittings. Written in a neutral tone that will appeal to both professionals and laypeople, it examines the latest scientific and sociological evidence about profound giftedness--what it is and isn't, how it is measured and recognized, how profoundly gifted children differ from their peers, myths about giftedness. The book delivers if you keep its scope in mind: it is intended primarly as an introduction. It is neither a primer nor a how to. The author emphatically rejects the philosophy that &quot;all children are gifted.&quot; On the contrary, she states that profound giftedness is extremely rare and not to be confused with the garden variety brightness that passes for &quot;gifted&quot; in many highly competitive urban and suburban schools today. The most interesting section for me was the chapter on artistic giftedness. The author compares the personalities and drawings of children of &quot;average ability&quot; with those of &quot;exceptional ability.&quot; Parents who suspect that their child may be gifted will find these sections helpful (though I suspect that precious few will be of the same caliber as the children researched in this book."},{"Title":"Gifted Children - Myths And Realities","review":"This is the best-researched book on this subject that I've ever read (the bibliography is 1/4 of the book). While the author doesn't provide any revolutionary insights of her own, she's done a terrific job of summarizing current research on gifted children, debunking commonly held stereotypes about giftedness, and translating researchers' insights into practical advice. While her style is rather dry, the book is accessible and generally free of psychological jargon. The book is a gold mine for parents and teachers, and a benchmark for researchers into giftedness.I was particularly struck by Winner's convincing data showing that gifted children's minds actually work differently from average children's; they're not just &quot;more of the same.&quot; As a former gifted child who went through ten years of educational hell before finally hitting my stride in mid-high school, I think that this point can't be emphasized strongly enough. We're capable of growing up into swans; don't try to convince us that we're defective ducks!"},{"Title":"Gifted Children - Myths And Realities","review":"&quot;Gifted Children: Myths ad Realities,&quot; by Ellen Winner, is an excellent overview of what is currently known about gifted children, including their heredity, information about their early childhood, their learning patterns, their educations, and many more things. I recommend this as an introduction to the study of gifted children, or to anyone who wants to acquire a basic knowledge and understading of ths topic.There is a good balance in this book between individual examples and case studies and more general theories and studies. The author makes her points of view on this topic manifest in many parts of this book; it is not a dry textbook that pretends to be equally accepting of all beliefs.It also has a marvelous bibliography. I recommend to readers reading the bibliography of every chapter that you found interesting."},{"Title":"Gifted Children - Myths And Realities","review":"Although this book was readable, it did not go far enough to explain the problems of gifted children in terms of dealing with them day to day.The characteristics of the gifted child has been known for over ten years with nothing new added.

I was looking forward to something more."},{"Title":"Gifted Children - Myths And Realities","review":"If you are working with or parenting a highly to profoundly gifted child, you should read this book. The case studies are fascinating. Winner seamlessly weaves together anecdotes and information from Terman,Piaget,Kohlberg, and many others whose names will be familiar to those who have studied child development. Myths and Realities is absolutely stuffed with information on truly amazing children. I especially enjoyed the photos of children's art in the section on gifted artists."},{"Title":"Gifted Children - Myths And Realities","review":"Good definition of giftedness: 1) precocity, 2) rage to master, 3) marching to own drummer. Interesting ideas but some myths are still true. Yes, there is such a thing as a globally gifted child (I know, I am the parent of one!). The books strengths are in its elegant chapters about artistic and musical giftedness. I don't think anyone else has really covered these too well before. I don't agree that to be &quot;truly&quot; gifted you must change the domain of your giftedness. For example, someone gifted in math would need to contribute new ideas that changed the way some aspect of math was viewed. I also don't agree that schools can help moderately gifted children simply by raising their standards. Why bother raising standards for children who exhibit extreme precocity, march to their own drummer and have a rage to master things beyond what the school is prepared to teach? Clearly something is wrong with this advice. I also don't agree that the limited funds for gifted education should be at the exclusive disposal of students who are in the areas of extreme giftedness. All gifted students need help. That would be the equivalent of funding only special needs programs for students who are at the extreme low end of the IQ spectrum and leaving those students who are well below average to founder on their own in mainstream &quot;inclusion&quot; classrooms with no accomodations!

And were you one of those kids who teachers just didn't know what to do with?I am a student getting her Master's in Early Childhood Education, and we discussed Gifted Education in our Special Needs class. I chose this book to used as a basis for a project because it seemed to be very interesting.Not only did it inspire me to want to pursue further studies in Gifted Education, I finally recognized students like me in the book. I was not a prodigy, but I was gifted, and mislabeled by my teachers as \\"easily distracted,\\" \\"uncooperative,\\" and just plain mysterious. I was not scoring well in Math, so I could not be placed into the classes for gifted (whereas I tested on a senior level in Verbal abilities in the 4th grade), and so I was bored. This book helped me to understand who I was (am), and my persona was less of a mystery. My self-confidence has increased dramatically and has helped me to recognize who I am.If you have a child in your class that you suspect may be gifted, read this book. If you think you have a child who has not been identified as gifted or whom you think may not be in classes that are at his or her instructional level, read this book.

My only complaint is that the author did not address the variance in scores between the old Standford Binet test and the newer version. The change between these two versions of the test means that there is little meaningful correlation between the scores of the sample population she frequency cites (who were tested many years ago) and the scores that can be obtained on the new version of the test. The new test has a much lower ceiling so that higher scores (150+) are much harder to obtain than they were previously.

When I saw the book in the market, I wanted to know the forces behind such a powerful experience. This book provides a step-by-step process of the purpose and evolution of the Encampment for citizenship from the late 40's to 1964-- to educate young people in the field of social and community organization and civic responsibility to enable them to understand and participate in a democratic society. The vision was to prepare a group of young people that could shape a diverse world into a caring, peaceful, and compassionate place. The book discusses how the vision of Eleanor Roosevelt and Martin Luther King, among others, were passed on to thousands of youths. The ideas introduced in the book are as alive today as they were in the fifties and sixties. This is a must read book for those, who today are looking for ways to bring young people around the world together to develop their skills in consensus building for a better world."},{"Title":"Eskimo-English/English-Eskimo (Inuktitut) Dictionary","review":"Gosh, but I'd love to know what he means by \\"DLERK at the end of a word is pronounced like TSLERK\\". Is this Inuktitut or Klingon?The scariest thing about this dictionary is that it is not a modern reprint of a work of 19th-century missionary linguistics. It was revised by the author as recently as 1970. The introduction shows the lengths to which a Latin-biased missionary will go to avoid admitting that q (here written randomly k, kr or rk) is a letter in its own right. On the other hand, he gets points for not trying to find an infinitive where there is none to be found, and he seems to understand how the language works. Maybe he constructed the whole dictionary from written sources so he never really had to listen to anyone.

Vicious Indian ambushes, narrow escapes, the advent of land mines in combat and the unique introduction of the &quot;Mohawk Ladder&quot; by these hardy Americans while assaulting a fortified citadel.

I would recommend it to anyone from 4th grade up - it is not a child's book but there is nothing in it that could be considered R-rated or close to R-rated.

In fact, H. D. Croly argues from the opposite pole of the Great American Debate as myself. The stars are because he does such a good job of it (other than the long-winded first chapter). Five stars for a deep and revealing understanding of American history, the American character, and individual American politicians - especially Lincoln. Minus a star for occasional windiness. Croly also got my attention by framing the debate exactly as I do, and then framing the entirety of American political history, like I do, in terms of the debate.For example, from the get-go, Croly establishes the opposing visions of Hamilton and Jefferson as the fundamental philosophical split in America and traces the dispute up to the present. Of course, his present is a perfect century earlier than our own, but even now the game is still the same even as party names and ideological labels have changed with some regularity. Now we might name the split progressivism vs. libertarianism.I also give Croly fairly high marks for maintaining a generosity of spirit and understanding for the \\"other side.\\" Such generosity is unusual in the best of times, so even \\"fairly high\\" is fairly rare. His generosity doesn't quite extend to the principal figure representing the other side, though. His skillful demolition of Jefferson's personal qualities is merely skillful, not generous. In the case of Jefferson, anyway, Croly can't help seeing philosophical differences expressed through personality deficiencies.Croly's excellent explication of the frontier culture of the \\"Western Democracy\\" would be worth the price of the book, if it had a price (free on Kindle, as of this writing). \\"Western Democracy\\" added an aggressively militaristic attitude to Jeffersonianism, a contradiction that infects both modern neo-conservatism and modern liberalism alike.This book was great inspiration to Theodore Roosevelt, the imperialist progressive who opened the gates to big government and Pax Americana. Croly's name may be forgotten but his ideas, with the help of T. R. and others from that pivotal generation, are the underpinning for our modern world. Has America's Promise been fulfilled? Some would argue yes, I would say it's barely holding on as Croly's descendents drown us in debt and militarism."},{"Title":"The promise of American life","review":"Considering that Teddy Roosevelt was the first to buy into the Croly line of thinking, followed by Wilson and FDR, it is little wonder we have become the entitlement, anti-business, anti-capitalist, pro-labor nation we are. Croly wrote this book at a time there was much debate as to which direction the country should take. This book is extremely well written. It is impressive how Croly was able to put his thoughts to paper so well. The book is a must read should you wish to gain insight on how America has changed since the Civil War. And from a conservative perspective, I must add, it's very scary."},{"Title":"The promise of American life","review":"Herbert Croly was a journalist and writer who wrote his most significant work just after the beginning of the twentieth century. He makes the case most simply: there have been two contending forces within liberalism fighting for the soul of the country from the very beginning. That is, there have been two distinct liberalisms. One was the Hamiltonian emphasis on the nation as a whole, as something transcendent over narrow interests. He called for a national purpose or interest to structure political dialogue. On the down side, the individual American might be forgotten in the process. The Jeffersonian view, on the other hand, valorized the individual and deemphasized a larger national purpose. Croly argued that both had serious flaws, but that the time was right to try to meld the two together for the good of the republic.His contention was that we had to wed the national purpose orientation of Hamilton with the focus on ordinary people from Jefferson. His appeal was for \\"positive government,\\" the use by government of various tools to advance the national interest and the welfare of the people. This was an early salvo on behalf of the Progressive movement. With the Great Depression and Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal, this orientation became the dominant thrust of American politics for five decades."},{"Title":"The promise of American life","review":"My review concerns the quality of the \\"Qontro Classic Books\\" paperback edition, not the content of Croly's book. Croly originally published the work in 1909 and it apparently has passed into the public domain. This Qontro edition is an oversize paperback, but is very hard to read because it is set in a small and hard to read typefont - I think it's just Courier. I would guess the publisher scanned a library copy into Word and hit the Print button. The table of contents doesn't give page numbers for the beginning of chapters. There is no forward or other comments by recent scholars, just the bare text of Croly's book."},{"Title":"The promise of American life","review":"The book was written as a kind of half-time review of US history. \\"Half time\\" of course as seen hundred years later, with over 200 years of history.The title is at first a bit repellant, smelling of \\"chosen country\\" sentiment. That's not what it really implies. The \\"promise\\" was something real for many immigrants, it meant opportunity and equality. Why then make a title out of it? Because things were moving into a direction which seemed to indicate that the promise was about to be lost. Croly asks what can be done to keep it. His solutions look a bit like the \\"social market economy\\" of Germany in the 50s to me.The language is in parts amazingly fresh and contemporary. The chapter on Jeffersonians versus Hamiltonians could have been written today, same as the short Lincoln bio chapter. The chapter on government by lawyer is a gem.(I am aware that his focus on Hamilton is not generally accepted. Why not Adams? But somehow Mr.Hamilton must have had a period of superiority in estimation, as proven by his face on money, where there is no Adams.)On the negative, in some places, the language is roundabout and absolutely not to the point, to the extent that the point remains hidden. I suspect this is done by age. We have another wave length in many respects. Or maybe Croly actually sometimes wrote less than clearly.I opened the book with some reservation not only due to the potentially ideological title. I read the 89 reprint, not the 2005 version. That was at the end of the Reagan era and the book was sold like some kind of Reagan prophecy. Don't blame Croly for that.He wrote at the time of Teddy, when the US was developing into something new, away from the pioneering age, into industrial monsterdom, on the back of several decades of economic revolutions after the civil war. Society was changing. The old individualist view of democracy was clearly becoming inadequate, a new Hamiltonian view of things towards protection of progress and efficiency of government seemed needed. Society had outgrown romantic start up notions of freedom and equality.Another negative observation: the chapter on the reformers is just sub-standard, no real analysis of their programs, more like contemporary newspaper leader articles. His view of TR is on the level of a state owned newspaper's praise of the Chief.It is not just a book about history, but essentially about ideas and interaction of structure and content.I find it particularly fascinating to watch how words change their meaning over time. Croly uses the word nationalism in a sense which baffled me at first, until I got it: he uses it in opposition to \\"all states for themselves\\", building a nation out of a group of less-than-nations. Being European, I am so used to understand nationalism as something which says: we first, above the others. (Deutschland ueber alles, literally...)Another instance of changed paradigm is Croly's naive assumption of racial stereotypes. He takes it for granted, that \\"negroes are inferior\\". He couldn't have written that at the end of the Reagan period.One editing comment: my 89 edition has a very incomplete list of contents. All chapters have several subtitles, but the content list gives only the first one of each. That might be repaired in later editions; if not, it should be."},{"Title":"The promise of American life","review":"This Filiquarian edition is in a good quality binding and paper but it is not a facsimile so pagination is off. The original had an extensive index [see Gutenberg e-copy]; there is absolutely NO index in this edition. Look for another edition for academic usage. Amazon as usual supplied a copy in Very Good condition even tho they only claimed \\"Good\\"."},{"Title":"The promise of American life","review":"Croly was a radical and an avowed believer in centralized power for gorvernment, business and labor unions. He had no use for the U.S. Constitution and inveighed against it frequently in the New Republic magazine which he co-founded in 1914. He expressed consternation that a document that as he believed, had been foisted on the American people and had been used to oppress working people (his words) had come to be deified.In fact, the entire book could easily have been written by President Obama, the degradation of the Constitution included). It's interesting that a new edition has just been reissued when the American public is about to administer its verdict on Obamaism, Big Government, socialized medicine and centralized planning.This book foresaw many FDR New Deal policies, enacted and implemented a quarter-century later, but soon it will read as a period piece, as the U.S. finally puts paid Bill Clinton's remark from 1996, that the era of Big Government is over.

His son details his father's life from childhood to his final years, sharing intimate letters written by him to friends, colleagues, and family. The books gives a good overview of Hort's beliefs and how they changed as he grew older. It also shows many of the influences on his life. The letters that detail his correspondence with B.F. Westcott concerning their Greek New Testament revision and other subjects are quite interesting to read. What is neat is, if you can get a copy of the Life and Letters of B.F. Westcott (written by his son, also Arthur), to compare what Hort wrote to Westcott and then read the letters Westcott wrote back to Hort. You will learn about such things as hobbies, favorite poems and poets.This book is highly recommended for King James Onlyists who have bought the lie promoted by Gail Riplinger that Westcott and Hort were \\"evil men.\\" If you compare what Hort actually said in this book to what Riplinger quotes him as saying in her book, you can see that lies have been made up about both of these men.

I had to continuously use the Glossary in the back, but in a way this added to the mysteries and fantastical qualities of the story. I was indeed a stranger in a strange land. I was captivated throughout the book. Ms. Aratyr should continue to write. She is seriously under appreciated and unknown right now. I highly recommend this book for fantasy readers who are looking for that feeling you had when you read your very first fantasy book. You know what I mean."},{"Title":"Hunter of the Light","review":"Every nine years, the people of Eire have to fulfill a geas of the gods - one of them ,god-chosen, becomes the Hunter of Eire in the search of the great white stag of the goddess. He or she has a whole year in wich to track down the bringer of light, and if he/she fails, the darkness will rule the earth.But if he/she succeeds, the light is returned by the gift of Eire.The name of the Hunter is not known to many, but the responsability that title entails is much sought after...Third son to a revered priestess (whose other son is a king, and whose daughter is one of the seven great Wizards of Eire), Blackthorne is a gambler, a failed bard and a general disgrace to his family - who love him not the less for it. For nine years, the young man has left his apprenticeship to a great bard, and has learned the ways of the wild with Una, the Seer. But when the stag walks the earth and the Hunt is on, the gods interfere for the benefit of the estranged Wizard Roisin Dubh, who was tricked into madness by one whom she trusted. In order to recover the sacred Spear of Ash he painfully prepared for the Hunt, Blackthorne has to bid the lost Wizard Roisin return it to him, - but he finds instead the Hag, a cruel creature that is all left from Roisin. With her he strikes a bargain that would lead him to death for only one misstep, and his heart will add to Eire's geas, the geas of wizardry (by a magic artefact he's bound to find for the Hag) and by his own will the geas of breaking the cruel spell that binds the young Wizard.Unknown to the Hunter of Eirinn, there's another Hunter for the stag, for one uncalled has been struck by the need to bring down the light - unwanted by the powers of good, he'll take even the dark powers for the pleasure of ending the Hunt...And unwillingly, Blackthorne has to let a coward puka join his quest, for the odd creature is geas-bound to help him, in spite of his fears - and the puka does prove to be of un-hoped for help to Blackthorne, when there's no one else to turn to.This is a most powerful story. It has all:love, magic, elves (light and dark-the scaileana),interfering gods, war, hope andcompelling beauty.You must read this one. This is that one fantasy book that will stay in your memory as the one who started you on reading fantasy - or addicted you to it.And one more thing: it's a stand-alone, so you'll have it all in one, no need to wait for any sequel.Don't let it get away!"},{"Title":"Hunter of the Light","review":"A must read for anyone in to Celtic Mythology and fantasy.

Bravo Risa."},{"Title":"Stranger from the Tonto","review":"Lost in the scorching Sonora Desert, young Kent Wingfield makes an oath to a dying prospector that plunges him into a perilous adventure. At a remote box canyon in Utah, Kent must fulfill his vow and save a young woman by defeating a man called Bonesteel--the new leader of the notorious Hole-in-the-Wall Gang."},{"Title":"Stranger from the Tonto","review":"This is another of the canyon country books with a hidden outlaw haven. Here lives the outlaw leader when not living a double life on the outside; there is an innocent young girl, and then a hero who is sent on a mission by his old friend to rescue the girl. In a scene reminiscent to the prologue of \\"Desert Gold\\" Kent Wingfield is told about Lucy Bonesteel and sent to save her. Riding and depending on his faithful horse, Spades, Wingfield enters the canyon hideout of Avil Bonesteel and his outlaw gang. On the outside Bonesteel is known as Luce Chaney respectable rancher and cattle dealer. This is a wonderful book, one of my favorites, and I think one anybody would enjoy as well--full of action, passion, and characters you won't soon forget."},{"Title":"Stranger from the Tonto","review":"Zane Grey is the best Western Writer in history. I have read almost 80 of his books and never get tired. His books are full of suspense, romance, and action. Each one is better than the last, and they are habit forming. I have orderd 40 of his books for my uncle, who also loves Zane Grey. Zane Grey is unmatched in providing a glimpse of the old west. You can relive the old west by reading his books."},{"Title":"Betsy McCall: A Collector's Guide","review":"As a primarily modern Betsy collector, I was thrilled at the vast amount of information on the Tonner Betsy dolls, and loved seeing the vintage outfits and dolls pictured in the book. Marci has really done her homework, this is one fabulous book!"},{"Title":"Betsy McCall: A Collector's Guide","review":"Originally, I bought this just for the memories! Having grown up with Tiny Betsy, it was so much fun to see (and recognize) my dolls and clothing. When I finally decided to sell my vintage Betsy things, it was a wonderful tool to date items, to find out item names and to see what pieces came in a set. I would highly recommend this book for any serious Betsy Collector or someone who just grew up with a Betsy."},{"Title":"Betsy McCall: A Collector's Guide","review":"If you ever loved a Betsy McCall doll, then this is the book for you. A great listing with pics of the outfits produced for the early dolls. A great resource!"},{"Title":"The Zero-Sum Society: Distribution and the Possibilities for Economic Change","review":"This was one of the most readable non-fiction books I've ever come across. It's written in clear effective English and makes its point (mainly through repetition) very well.Thurow has one basic idea - that the American economy was paralysed in the 1970s because of the variety of groups (upper-class versus lower-class, blacks versus whites, industrial versus agricultural etc.) with conflicting interests that made it impossible for the government to undertake effective policies. As such, this book seems pretty commonsensical and hardly revolutionary nor particularly enlightening. Thurow takes us through the various economic problems that the US faced at the time to show how this is the case.This problem appears to be the combined flaw of democracy - that people have a say in how the country is run - although he didn't explore that; and capitalism - the doctrine of self-interest. The groups all want to protect themselves. This means that any change will inevitably be vetoed/subject to prolonged protest by at least one group - namely, the group that will have to suffer (by seeing their incomes decline) so that the rest of the economy can benefit. This shows up in the protection of inefficient industries such as steel and textiles, the unwillingness to impose strict income and price controls etc. In effect, the economy will continue to stay stagnant until certain groups are imposed on for the sake of everyone else.He also makes the interesting case that inflation was not really a problem, backing this up with statistics that show that the average American's standard of living rose; and income differences didn't widen. Rather, it was a matter of perception and psychology."},{"Title":"The Zero-Sum Society: Distribution and the Possibilities for Economic Change","review":"Having worked on Wall Street for 25 years, by and from experience I can assert that ANY economic behavior by any human does entail a marginal error toward/from the misinterpreted phrase \\"zero sum game.Simply research historic Federal Reserve monetary policy to understand this, let alone structured finance!Prof. Thurow's point is that the US political economy, its citizens, and those \\"elites\\" who make its policy are asymetrically informed. Sooner or later, the US has to restructure its misapplication of redistributing wealth; hence the shock of the 70's, the long-term mess Regan has left; the stock bubble of the mid-90's; the current housing bubble. Another shock a la 1973 and 1978 might redirect this country's \\"elites'\\" thinking towards more long-term pragmatic lines."},{"Title":"The Zero-Sum Society: Distribution and the Possibilities for Economic Change","review":"Couldn't agree with the previous review. Even the title is wrong. The economy... any economy is NEVER a zero-sum game. Here is a quote from the author: &quot;Can economic command significantly... accelerate the growth process? The remarkable performance of the Soviet Union suggests that it can... Today the Soviet Union is a country whose economic achievements bear comparison with those of the United States.&quot; That was in 1989, JUST BEFORE the Soviet system collapsed. How can anyone be more wrong? Unfortunately, these people teach our kids."},{"Title":"The Zero-Sum Society: Distribution and the Possibilities for Economic Change","review":"This book was a sensation when it first appeared in 1980.But then something unexpected (by Thurow at least) happened. Ronald Reagan was elected President and ignited a period of spectacular economic growth, coupled with low inflation and high employment, that lasted through the next two administrations - thus proving Thurow totally wrong!Why do publishers keep reprinting books that have been invalidated by history? Why not allow then to sink silently into the dustbin of failed theories where they belong?As Charlie Chan once said: Theory like mist on eyeglasses. Obscures facts."},{"Title":"THE HOUSE OF ISLAM","review":"Kenneth Cragg has the gift of using his profound understanding of Islam to present his knowledge for the average westerner. He is sympathetic, but also judicious. He is complete, but succinct. The language and sentence structure are &quot;delicious.&quot; The reader gains an understanding of Islam, its roots, its beliefs, its growth and change over the centuries, its practice and the problems currently facing its believers. At this time, when Islam is in the media daily, usually in a negative and distorted report, this book is an excellent antidote to prejudice and exaggerations."},{"Title":"I'm Becoming My Mother","review":"I got this book for my mother, along with the other one recommended by Amazon to buy together, and it's very funny. I was looking for something that would give her a lift and it definitely did; she enjoys them quite a bit."},{"Title":"I'm Becoming My Mother","review":"If you grew up in the 50's this book will seem like it was written for you! Even if you are not a Boomer, you will see the wry humor. It is a book to share with a friend and a book to keep for yourself when you need to laugh. Ann Taintor is great!"},{"Title":"I'm Becoming My Mother","review":"This book is one of the best I've bought. The vintage pictures are wonderful and the humor is wonderful with just a hint of sassy. I will definitely be on the look out for more books or item by this author. I knew that the humor from this author would not be run of the mill, you have to be a little saucy to enjoy it. This would make a great gift for that smart-aleck friend or for yourself."},{"Title":"I'm Becoming My Mother","review":"I am a big fan of old photos with funny captions being used as greeting cards. That is the quality I thought I would be getting with this book. But no. I looked through it and tossed it in the trash. I could have done something better with my money than this."},{"Title":"Sermons on several occasions","review":"There are several versions of Wesley's \\"Sermons on Several Occasions\\" on Kindle; I opted for this one because it was cheapest. However, there is no table of contents or any linked list to the sermons themselves. Since one typically does not read this sort of book cover to cover, but rather uses it as a reference, the absence of such a list is glaring. I returned it and went for a more expensive edition."},{"Title":"A Land to Call Home (Red River of the North #3)","review":"Book 3 in Red River of the North opens with Penny writing to the absent Hjelmer who has fled the area to avoid a &quot;shotgun wedding&quot; trick. Even though he is young and immature, he is a hard worker with an eye for the future and inside information on the plans of the railroad. Kaaren delivers twins, nearly dying. One twin is not healthy and Lars cannot accept his deaf daughter. School is in full swing in the prairie schoolhouse, with Kaaren as teacher.Ingeborg and Haaken travel a far distance by train to escort home the seriously injured younger sister of Kaaren. Solveig is a bitter, disappointed young woman who was on her way to join her sister, but whose future is crushed in a train wreck. Face scarred and barely walking, she goes home with Ingeborg and Haaken. Olaf, Kaaren's long lost uncle, mysteriously turns up after a long absence and his many talents make him useful and loved.Penny has finally decided to travel to Fargo for work and further schooling. The farms continue to progress - a large wooden barn now graces the homestead of Ingeborg who gives birth to another baby, Haaken's first biological child. Metiz continues to weave in and out of the lives of the pioneer families. Her grandson, Baptiste, stays with his friend Thorliff to go to school and help with the farm work.As much as she balks, Ingeborg gives up her plowing and hunting after teaching young Thorliff to take her place. As usual, tragedy does not pass over them without leaving scars. A tragic fire, blizzards and failing farms cause loss of life and dreams. Agnes give birth to a stillborn daugher. She harbors intensive anger toward Hjelmer for hurting her dear niece, Penny.The railroad is coming and the time for proving up their land arrives. Both the Bjorkland widows are remarried with families. Extra people share both homes now. A large sack house stores their grain for direct loading on the train.The book ends with their town becoming a water stop for the railroad, a real town with a real name, Blessing. In spite of the author's confusion with family relationships and forgetting Kaaren's married name, book 3 still deserves 4 stars."},{"Title":"A Land to Call Home (Red River of the North #3)","review":"Those pioneers are sooo brave!

I admire the research the author had done to make this series so interesting. My wife was bedridden and I bought them to read to her and she enjoyed them as well. Having lived a life of a variety of experiences I can spot areas where the author may have erred in describing things but this appears to be very factual and well reseached.

Lauraine Snelling keeps her readers wanting more and more of the Bjorklunds's lives. I don't like to give out too many details on a book, because I would rather read the book and be surprised myself when I read them. You will find love and loss of love on the Dakota Territory prairie. There are again joyous triumphs and total sadness.

Ingeborg's marriage to Haakan is a wonderful blessing to her and her children. There are some new characters to add spice to the books and the discovery of Grace's deafness to add tears, but Kaaren and Ingeborg's faith continues to grown in the face of the difficulties that come from farming and joys of proving up their homesteads."},{"Title":"A Land to Call Home (Red River of the North #3)","review":"I wouldn't have been surprised if the author wrote that the characters \\"cooked themselves up some POSSUM STEW.\\" The dumb hillbilly language started appearing in Book #2, and now that I've finished Book #3, I am so irritated by it that I've lost interest in continuing the series.I am from the South (30+ years) but now I live in North Dakota (10 years). If I was a Norwegian, I would be very insulted that the author portrayed my ancestors as talking like a bunch of country bumpkins. I've got nothing against talking that way. I talk that way sometimes! I \\"cain't\\" help it! It is very endearing IF you talk that way naturally. But Norwegians and North Dakotans don't talk that way, don'cha know? (Oh, sorry, that's Minnesotan). Where did the author come up with that idea, if she did so much research, spent time in the state, talked to locals, and even has Norwegian ancestors? If she wanted her characters to talk like that, then she should've written a series set in Arkansas or Kentucky or Tennessee, etc. - in the South - where they DO talk like that!!Furthermore, I have NEVER heard anyone, ANYWHERE, say \\"if'n\\" in real life. The only people I may have ever heard say \\"if'n\\" would have been Granny or Uncle Jed on the old TV show \\"The Beverly Hillbillies.\\"Kaaren is the community's schoolteacher for a while, teaching all the little Norwegian children to speak English, yet \\"she done picked up\\" some pretty poor grammar skills somewhere, with all them double-negatives and incorrect tenses they all keep using. Most all the main characters are portrayed as Norwegian immigrants, and yet the reader is to believe that they've all picked up on this country slang somehow? And from whom are these characters picking up their hillbilly grammar skills anyway, if most everyone else in the Red River Valley are fellow Norwegians??? There were no hillbillies around there for them to pick it up from. Besides, people simply don't start talking like the locals in a region just because they live there for a while. I've lived in North Dakota for 10 years, and I hear the locals say \\"uff da\\" all the time, but I don't say it. Likewise, THEY haven't started speaking with a southern drawl and southern colloquialisms just by being around me.At times, the characters carry on lengthy conversations with perfect grammar, then next time, bam! back to country slang. Make up your mind. In reading these books, I could \\"hear\\" the native Norwegian accent and dialect when the characters were talking \\"normally\\", but then the author throws in that poor grammar, and it just doesn't fit. Call me obsessed, but it just bugs me...\\"We don't got no slates.\\"\\"Can't a body give a gift if'n they wants?\\"\\"Lessen you'll take a stewing chicken or some such.\\" (Unless)\\"Lessen twenty dollars, I think.\\" (Less than)\\"Well, shoot, if that's going to be your wedding dress, you'll do us all some proud.

We get the picture. Must every mention of babies have to be about nursing, putting them to their breasts, etc.? (Before anyone jumps all over me - I nursed all my children and enjoyed it.) Also, I really did not care to know that Ingeborg was taking turns nursing Kaaren's twin daughters. Who cares if they may have done that in those days. TMI.Kaaren, in her job as schoolteacher, is constantly called \\"Mrs. Bjorklund\\", even though she is now Mrs. Knutson. How does an author make a goof like that? And how does that get by editors and publishers???It appears that they buried the Baard's stillborn baby, Elizabeth, twice - first in Ch. 14, the day after she was born, then again in Ch. 26, when the ground thawed. Author goof again???In Chapter 26 & 27, little Andrew goes from baby talk, to adult-sounding conversation about watering the cottonwood with logical complete sentences, and then back to baby talk again (\\"Astrid so little\\"), all in one day.Someone else pointed out that Ingeborg could not have used the same gun to shoot both deer AND geese. It would have blown the geese to smithereens.Now, all that being said and gotten off my chest....I just have to say that I did not miss the big picture. The experiences and actions and reactions of the characters in this book do inspire me to trust in God more and talk to him more, and thank him in all of life's circumstances, big and small, good and bad. So for that, this book WAS worth reading."},{"Title":"Out of Your Mind","review":"I don't mean to be irreligious with this title, obviously Alan Watts' CD's are not to be put on the same level as \\"The Bible\\" but as someone who has sought answers for most of my life, the set of CD's came as something of a godsend.This collection does an excellent job of covering the essentials of Watt's philosphies. Most of his books (if you get them) are more detailed reiterations of his lectures here (or more correctly these lectures are synopsese of his books).If you enjoy having \\"mondo\\" or enlightening dialogue - these CD's are for you. In them Watt's personality comes across clearly and his philosphy rolls from him naturally. If you're not already familiar with Watts its hard to describe what you're missing. What I can say is this collection is worth the cost. In it Watts speaks in a manner that is recognizably truthful and attempts to present a new 'mythology' by which we can see the world as it really is.I can not recommend this too highly - I have listened to the entire 12 CD set more than 10 times. If nothing else it will help you sleep at night."},{"Title":"Out of Your Mind","review":"After reading the transcripts of his talks, I wanted to hear Watts' voice. There had to be more to what was being said than what could be seen in the page. With my assignments on Watts in college three decades ago, I had just given them a cursory reading for classes on Zen and Taoism. I never gave a lot of consideration about them until recently. Having listened to the CD's and my readings, I was surprised at how much my view points on life were either shaped by those writings or helped along.Like him, I was raised a Protestant. I was felt comfortable about Zen Buddhism because of Watt views. His Buddhism, though, is his own form of Buddhism because down to his bones Watt really is quite the Anglican. You won't understand that until you hear him lecture, his inflections or his jokes.Working through my third round of the CDs, I'm in awe of him. In these discussions he lays out the philosophical basis for the environmental movement. There is a discussion of Basho's poetry that makes me wonder how much impact he had in shaping Beat poetry then and our poetry now. There discourse on bits, bytes and nets that anticipated our digital world and information technology. He was much ahead of his philosophical contemporaries and spiritually unlike them he doesn't hide anything from his audience.What a fine mind and spirit he was.These CD's are worth the purchase.Eric OttoCincinnati"},{"Title":"Out of Your Mind","review":"I don't think I could begin too put into words how wonderful these cd's are! If you are a fan of Alan Watts this collection is a must! His books are great, but to hear him speak puts his discourses on a whole new level. ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL!!!!"},{"Title":"Out of Your Mind","review":"Alan's lectures are at once charming, mind-blowing and gratifyingly substantial. A person like me, trained in Western thought and material objectivity, needs rational exposition on the subject of Zen rather than new age psychobabble. Perhaps it's the high british accent, but Alan delivers the Gospel of Nothingness with commanding intellectualism and endearing modesty. There is just as much bullsh** in Eastern religion as Western; Alan cuts to the chase and finds a Zen ethos that embraces both 'spiritualism' and modern psychology.Basically, DNA biology and particle physics teach us that we are quite literally one and the same as everything else in the universe. Like waves are 'made of' ocean and 'are' the ocean and return to ocean, we are 'made of' the universe and 'are' the universe - now, before we were born, and after we die. Our apparent individuality is a counterproductive artificial construct. Peace, sartori, enlightenment, whatever you wish to call it, comes when we accidentally happen to see the Matrix - when we suddenly reach an understanding that nothing perceived by our senses is real - when, out of nowhere, we lose all fear of death and all desires and simply exist. The lessons of this state of being are to fully live every day as a grateful node of sentience belonging to the entire universe and to help others release themselves from desire and fear. There is no winning in life or defeating death; we are natural parts of the universe that arise, form, flourish and are recycled. Since we are the universe we do not perish - if we detached from desire there would be no sense of time and we would not fear anything, including death.After listening to all of these lectures, I continue to look around for more from Alan Watts. He is jolly and cool and sparkling - he reminds me of a old-style British officer from India regaling us with tales of the Raj and the ways of the strange and wonderful subjects of the Empire!"},{"Title":"Out of Your Mind","review":"In general, recordings of Alan Watts lectures, even more than his books, convey his playful approach to his teachings. The rare gift of being serious and yet not being too serious is a rare quality that makes his legacy enduring. This collection was mostly recorded on his houseboat, on his own turf so to speak. I have heard many hours of Alan Watts lectures from LP, tape, CD, and mp3 sources. In these \\"houseboat lectures\\" he is even more clear, lucid, candid, relaxed, and spontaneous than usual. Whether he is talking about cultural myths and approaches to how the universe was created to sex and a hundred other topics you just get the feeling you are in his living room talking to a bunch of friends and worrying even less than usual, if this is possible for him, about what the officials at a college lecture hall, ministers at a church, or a business conference center would think. This collection is superb in giving you the feeling of what it was like to hear Alan Watts in the most informal of settings. If you are a fan of Alan Watts this CD collection is highly worth the price. I do not know who dug up these recordings and edited them but they did a great job. Thank you."},{"Title":"Out of Your Mind","review":"I first heard \\"Big Al\\" listening to Roy of Hollywood play his talks on KPFK 90.7 the Something's Happening late night radio show down in Southern California. Alan Watts changed my life! It broke my heart when I moved away to go to school and could no longer receive the signal. Roy encouraged me to make tapes off the air and I still donate with gratitude! (KPFK is commercial free/listener sponsored.) I can stream the show over the web now and the local public radio station broadcasts Alan now, but finding this deal here blew my mind! Check the price if you were to buy the discs and get this."},{"Title":"Out of Your Mind","review":"I am a fan of Alan Watts, the quintessential \\"spiritual entertainer.\\" In fact, perhaps I can consider myself more of a student of his now.He is not a charlatan \\"beat\\" Zen professor, nor a wannabe, pseudo Nietzsche.For me he is the catalyst that gently leads me out of my crystallized, biased comfort zones of erroneous thinking.When listening to Alan Watts you should allow his voice, his laughter, his total persona merge with your mind and heart. If you do this, you will be privileged to have known a rare, and special human being. Not a perfect human being, to be sure, but indeed someone who has contributed to the fonts of PRACTICAL esoteric knowledge and understanding.In any event, I purchased the MP3 files instead of the physical CDs and the process worked flawlessly! Everything downloaded directly to my iTunes app (I use a Mac) and then I burned the full 12 CD equivalent to ONE DVD! to archive them. As a test, I dragged one of the mp3 files to my desktop from the DVD, opened it up in QuickTime and it played beautifully."},{"Title":"Out of Your Mind","review":"Great to hear Alan Watts speak. He has a wonderful laugh. This is a collection of many of his talks. It is organized well and easy to follow. Each cd is about 1 hour; each segment about 5 minutes. The segments blend into each other to make a coherent hour. Very enjoyable and beneficial."},{"Title":"Out of Your Mind","review":"I feel in my opinion to find A. Watts as 'one of' the greatest philosophers of our time to be just as plausible to say Quine, Kripke, Russell, or even Ren? Descartes and Goethe to be 'one' of the greatest philosophers of our time (and I assure you I'm not a minority of one to think so).I have been studying the subjects in which A. Watts has repeatedly referenced from C. G. Jung, Nagarjuna, Sigmund Freud, Descartes, Lao Tzu, and many more in fields such as General Semantics (Alfred Korzibski), Biology, Psychology, Neurology, and fields that are so intertwined that we don't have yet labels, or technical words to sollicite a field of study.I feel Alan Watts would be regarded today as Carl Jung in his time, but only to discover him decades afterwards. Like Karl Popper for example maybe a few years down the road (though he died in 1994).As for changing your own perspective of your social culture, Gandhi very rightly put it \\"As human beings, our greatness lies not so much in being able to remake the world - that is the myth of the atomic age - as in being able to remake ourselves.\\""},{"Title":"Out of Your Mind","review":"Definitely worth the effort to listen to all 12 CD's, just to listen to Alan Watt's brilliant laugh! He was certainly able to reduce fairly difficult concepts in eastern philosophy into easily understood ones while entertaining his audience. Everyone should listen to Alan's work at some stage in their lives and there is one thing for sure, if you burst out laughing when you are listening you have definitely got IT."},{"Title":"Out of Your Mind","review":"I still benefit from Alan Watts' insights 50 years after my first introduction to his brilliant intellect. This audio collection of his later talks captures the essence of his knowledge across a broad spectrum of the human experience. While each CD contains a session that is comprehensive enough to stand on its own, the series is organized in such a way as to maintain continuity as a whole.Watts clearly observes and comments on the many layers of social conditioning that obscure our vision without resorting to heavy-handed moralistic lectures or making any unrealistic wish-fulfilling promises for following any particular path. It is for this very reason that he is not without his detractors. His most severe critics are usually the ones who are fond of using the disparaging epithet, \\"Zen according to Alan Watts.\\" But then isn't the indefinable Zen always according to somebody, e.g., Bodhidharma, Lin-chi, Hui-neng, et al?Alan has always been a breath of fresh air when my psyche begins to feel a bit oxygen-starved. His rich voice quality and playful presentation makes for effortless listening. Compared to Watts, most of today's numerous celebrity gurus sound like just so many new age hucksters."},{"Title":"Out of Your Mind","review":"You can read a book, but how you hear it is in your mind. This set is unique not only in its scope, but because it is the voice, personality and character of Alan Watts that communicates the information. This set is something you can keep in your car, or home for a gloomy existential crisis day, and one listen, and you will emerge from the gloom into the sun. He does such a great job of expressing his years of study into simple truths, and embodies the Great Cosmic Joke that will leave you laughing at yourself and how serious you take it all at times."},{"Title":"Out of Your Mind","review":"Alan Watts uses his soothing voice to deconstruct our modern fears by offering ancient Western evidence that all in the world is alright, or something like that. Your worries can only dissolve with each listening. Enjoy."},{"Title":"Out of Your Mind","review":"Listening to Alan Watts was a satisfying and fascinating experience. If you like the idea of listening to a unique and very interesting point of view, then checking this one out is a must.My best explanation of what these recordings are about is this. The speaker presents a series of very basic ideas (not \\"self-help tips\\" and without taking any leaps of faith) which will very likely make you feel genuinely uplifted. How he accomplishes this is by showing you how many of our core ideas (our \\"common sense\\" notions) are based merely on mental images, not concrete on realities. Seeing the everyday world with even a small portion of his insights has really put my mind to ease on so many topics. Because of this, I cannot overstate how valuable these recordings are. Definitely buy them if you can.A Small Warning:Although the discussion does touch the topic of world religions, I promise you there is no attempt to convert you to some particular set of beliefs (nor does he advocate abandoning religion). He brings religion up because it is necessary to get into a particular line of thought (not in order to preach at you in some underhanded way). I believe the confusion, which may upset the devout religious listener, will come when Allan Watts is speaking to the more cynical and/or faithless listeners. So, if you are sensitive about your beliefs, your patience might be tested at times. That being said, these recordings are purely intended to provide entertaining ideas to contemplate, not weapons to attack other people's beliefs with.Anyways...I seriously doubt you will be disappointed. If you are ready to \\"go out of your mind\\" in the best possible way, get these recordings as soon as possible."},{"Title":"Out of Your Mind","review":"At first glance, he may just strike you as an unconventional, off-beat philosopher. A pacifist, he avoided the draft in WWII, becominga clergyman in the USA. He had ongoing marriage and fidelityproblems, and drink problems. He even seemed to feel like suicidewas always a welcome option if the game of life got to be a drag.While some of the elements of his life might lead some people to beprejudiced and dismissive of him. I would say that while this manhad some very normal, natural, human imperfections, he was no smugpretender of holiness. Life and nature is not perfect. It is messyand contradictory and so are we, if we are honest.Watts was a very sincere guide, particularly to a whole generationof americans seeking more than a predictable, materialisticlifestyle in the 60's and 70's.He pointed out some typical sources of the world viewof people which is rooted in their inherited philosophy and religion.Watts is an excellent and thoughtful speaker, a very helpfulelucidator of Eastern philosophies. He was a seeker of whatever isvaluable and essential in the human experience. He certainly valuedthe traditional aesthetics and culture of the Far East and foundvalue in the way of life recommended by the ancient sages. Thisinfluence he brought into a world which then sorely needed, and nowstill needs to hear his reassuring and refreshing message."},{"Title":"Out of Your Mind","review":"I downloaded this spendid collection to my PC and at night I shuffle play these lecturettes over the top of some ambient music from my Pandora. What works really good is some Helpling and/or Jenkins or perhaps some Steve Roach. At any rate, when we were dropping out, we then tuned in and turned on. Who needs the chaos of our modern media culture with its ultra materialistic consumerism. If Watts were alive today, he would be having so much fun with this idiotic chaos."},{"Title":"Out of Your Mind","review":"Alan Watts has a amazing talent of explaining the complex in a way that is entertaining and easy to follow."},{"Title":"Out of Your Mind","review":"This set of talks is fantastic. My only complaint is that there is no information about the location and date of the talks."},{"Title":"Out of Your Mind","review":"He's amazing.But the 2nd disc is not. For some reason the second disc is all a punk band called attack, attack! Not very zen. I wrote to amazon to request an exchange - but no reply."},{"Title":"Out of Your Mind","review":"I had planned on buying this cd set, and was waiting for a used one to become available. I was so looking forward to listening and enjoying one of my favorite teachers. On the 2nd disc, it kept skipping in several places - could not listen to that segment of the track at all. This happened to several of the cd's.The 11th cd is the absolute worse!!! It has visible long vertical scratches all across the cd. When played, no sound at all comes from the cd. silence. I cannot hear the entire talk on that cd. I am so disappointed. He is my teacher, and I relish any recording I have of his.Why did you state this cd set was \\"new\\" when, you knew it was not new. It is damaged. You lied to me, and to amazon, as well. And the price I paid wasn't much below the brand new price from One Spirit. I would like a partial refund, at least, for the broken cd, and the constant skipping on two others. Do respond to my request asap. I just finished listening to all 12 of them, that is why the delay in writing to you.sincerely,Anne"},{"Title":"Out of Your Mind","review":"Pure drivel. Only wish that I could find the author as humorous as he finds himself. There is nothing of any real substance here, but the auther does like to hear himself talk and is easily amused by his own meanderings; unfortunately I was not. I do NOT recommend this audio program."},{"Title":"A Throne in Brussels","review":"This book comes in three layers: it is about the Belgian royal family of Saxe-Coburg, but also about Belgian political history and about European integration. The message that the author brings is that a federal Europe will go the same way as Belgium: a state without a real national identity, held together by opportunism, corruption and the cultivation of a non-identity. But don't expect a long philosophical treatise: this is a book packed with facts, anecdotes and stories about politics, about royal love stories and about royal business and financial ventures. The moral lesson is explained in the preface and in the last paragraphs of the book.The author is a Eurosceptic and a proponent of the secession of Flanders from Belgium. But even if you are not a Eurosceptic nor a secessionist, you will find this unauthorized history of Belgium and its royals very interesting and amusing. You will learn from this book how a monarchy can sustain an artificial state and what the drawbacks and dangers of this type of government are."},{"Title":"A Throne in Brussels","review":"This book is the most honest history of Belgium I have read. For once things that are taboo to the Belgian establishment - the role of Lafayette in the establishment of Belgium; the coup by radical refugees from France that established this artificial state; the scandals around King Leopold I of Belgium (and his successors); etc. - are finally exposed. This is history that reads like fiction. And it is the history necessary to understand the current issues between the Flemings and the Walloons. The pace is fast but the scholarly detective work (and thorough citations) also make this a ready reference tool. The title is a bit of a misnomer because in fact this is truly a revisionist history of Belgium."},{"Title":"A Throne in Brussels","review":"why is luc van braekel writing reviews of his colleagues book...?they work together at the brussels journal a very political organisation.the book is more politics than history with a thinly veiled point.. belgium's failed experiment (country not yet broken up) is the future for eu attempts at statehood. though is the eu a state? some of the assertions made about politics in 19c belgium are a little simplistic so yes the royal family intrigue is laid on thick. its a polemic though not an appraisal and poor really.from the brussels journalWho We AreEditor:Paul BelienWebmaster:Luc Van BraekelWriters:Chresten Anderson, CopenhagenErnest Baert, LondonAlexandra Colen, Brussels"},{"Title":"South Carolina's furbearers","review":"This is an excellent book that I have found to be useful in continuing to develop communication skills.

This compilation--which includes well-known authors such as Phillis Wheatly and Olaudah Equiano, as well as more obscure writers like George Liele and Belinda--is invaluable to scholars of early American, African, and African-American literature. From criminals to Indian captives, the writers in Carretta's anthology illustrate the diversity of the African experience in the English-speaking world of the 18th century. Carretta's introduction and notes are brilliant, his attention to detail and tireless scholarship a model for other academics. While an excellent book for classroom use (I assign it in my survey courses of African-American literature), this anthology will also appeal to readers interested in beginnings of African-American literature."},{"Title":"Men of Extreme Action","review":"The story seemed to be decent, but was difficult to read due to all the typos and other errors that don't get caught by a spell check. It was frequently difficult to determine which character was speaking dialogue and there was at least one instance where the author called one of his heroes by the wrong name. If he can't keep the characters straight how can a reader? There were several minor characters whose names changed spelling from one page to the next.Jim, if you ever write another book, hire a pro to edit it!"},{"Title":"Men of Extreme Action","review":"Men of Extreme Action is a humerous look at what might happen if twoaging action stars, who hate each other, by the way, are forced to workon a movie together in a last-ditch effort to save both their careers.The main characters are Wolfe and Steele, two actors with super-staregos, trying to recapture their glory days.

She makes a sound, coherent argument, and provides all the necessary background on the topic, which many monographs fail to do. If you know nothing about the Commune, you can still read this book because Gullickson covers the history in enough detail to prepare you for her arguments.Since the actual events of the Commune in 1871, the women involved in the uprising have been portrayed negatively. Women were not supposed to be involved in politics and were expected to confine themselves to family duties, so many men -- particularly of the bourgeoisie -- were outraged by their participation in revolutionary activities. As a result, men slandered these women, and those perceptions not only stuck for decades, but they seemed to intensify.Gullickson gets to the root of these misconceptions and points out the hypocrisies and flaws. She also shows how Commune sympathizers and opponents sought to create far different representations of these women, meaning that at least one side, and probably both, were inaccurate. On the negative side, Gullickson is repetitive in this book and occasionally seems surprised at the way women were viewed in 1871, even though, sadly, these images of women lasted well into the next century.The book is easy to read and easy to follow. It's recommended for anyone interested in European history, and if you're assigned this book for a class, consider yourself fortunate."},{"Title":"Caesar: Invasion of Britain","review":"I am presently using this text with 4 Latin students.

There eare some real gems of information between these covers that fill in a lot of the background well beyond the cars, involving customers (or even potential customers...) and the workings of the BRM organisation.Roll on book 4 - which presumably will finish off the whole saga of one of the most interesting of all race car manufacturers.

The description of the book promised as much, love, romance, intrigue, undying devotion. How can I resist! I rushed to ordered the thing. In fact, I rushed to ordered Book Two before I had even laid eyes on Book One. The story must be pretty grand if it goes on for two books, right!? I was giddy with anticipation.The books arrived, I dived right in. Not a few pages into the first chapter, I was bewildered. By the time Will Remington was summoned back to Boston, I was aghast, bemused, and amused. Is the writing really so hopelessly bad, or could it improve with a good edit? The author, in his acknowledgement, thanked his friends for reading the books. (I assume, prior to publication.) Did no one bother to point out the clunky run on sentences, the stilted exchanges, and the torturous paragraphs that ran on for pages?Not only does the writing in these books leave much to be desired, the chronology is often as muddled and as exasperating. Nothing irks this reader more than an author who can't even keep track of his own characters. Here's an example, we have Ben Smithson, who was fourteen (we are told) when he moved to Boston, and there meets his first lover, Michael. Together, they go through four years of High School and graduates in 1868, making him 18 if I did my math correctly. Yet he arrives in Auburn in 1877 at the age of 25? Hasn't 9 years elapsed? Shouldn't he be at least 27? Not to be nit-picking, but there are other instances which detracts. Take Shamus Mouldoon, the evil villain who maims Ben, seduces Chris and subsequently blackmails him. At the time of the blackmail, around 1878/79, we are told that Mouldoon is about 22. What!? Didn't he go to school with Ben and Michael before he was kicked out for good!? Here's the clincher, how about Michael's father dying twice. Wasn't he already dead when Ben went to Boston to fetch Michael in hopes of convincing him to be the town doctor for Auburn. How is it that he died again in Book Two, after Michael had set up house with Kyle? I'm confused.Still, the books do have their little moments. As a 'bodice ripping' romance, or is it 'shirt ripping' romance in this case, there are more graphic gay couplings than I would have anticipated, and not all of it so badly written that they are not down right erotic. There are even a few brave attempts to denounce bigotry and injustice. I, however, could do with a lot less long winded, syrupy sentiments that seems to drool from the mouths of most of the characters like bad spit. So, here's the chance for the author to start anew, the Remington twins, a gay one and a straight one maybe. Surely, there's enough fodder there to continue this 'epic' love saga. But please, Mr. Hill, write shorter sentences; and for heaven's sake, hire a good editor."},{"Title":"The Love You Leave Behind - Book One","review":"A novel of extraordinary interest and scope, epic in the traditions of Mitchner and Stone, riveting and passionate and well researched. I will be insulted if it is not made into a major motion picture. I had difficulty putting it down each evening to get some sleep. It is about time that an intelligent book of this genre has entered into the mainstream literature of America. Suitable reading for those interested in learning about the conditions of life in the Mother Lode of California. As a student of California history I can attest that the events portrayed are not at all far from the realities of the period."},{"Title":"The Love You Leave Behind - Book One","review":"Hang on for the ride of you life !

This work has something for everyone -- it is an epic love story with facets of mystery, suspense, action adventure as well as painstakingly researched historical references. The characters of this work are well developed, multi-dimensional and wonderfully defined; the storylines are artfully outlined and executed -- managing to completely explore all facets and levels of each storyline while maintaining the intregity of the relationships within the story. This book is vibrantly passionate on many levels... while the relationships of the main character are gay in nature, that is by no means the sole focus of this work. This book is much more than a &quot;gay love story&quot;.

Pack some tissues for this one."},{"Title":"THE EGG CODE","review":"Many books have been written about the internet age, but few of them have provided both such contemplative and informed views as Mike Heppner's brilliant debut novel, The Egg Code.From the minutiae of technical detail - i.e. TCP/IP, T1 lines, routers, etc. - which make this a valuable read for anyone merely interested in how the internet works, to the references to culture both pop and classical, this novel carries the reader on a psychological journey through the minds of characters so flawed and thus so human that we cannot help but sympathize with them - whether they be insanely ambitious mothers or Richard Nixon.Despite the non-chronological story, Heppner manages to masterfully link characters and incorporate details so that the book reads with continuity. At once suspenseful and pensive, The Egg Code viciously slashes through the illusions of fact and truth - both in print and on the internet. And it may be this that truly makes Heppner's debut so brilliant - this is not merely a novel about the internet - this dares to examine the continuity of deception in human nature and the vast ability that people have to deceive themselves. In juxtaposing characters that on the surface seem almost diametrically opposite from each other, Heppner manages to bring our attention to their fundamental similarities, letting us see in them our most basic human flaws.The Egg Code is a very satirical work, and yet should not be taken as a mere mockery of Midwestern America today. It is a much richer and deeper look into society as a whole, and into the evolution and corruption of the information dissemination process, from the earliest days of print to our current world of instant internet. Mike Heppner has truly created a modern masterpiece here, and it can only be hoped that his future works will be as stunning."},{"Title":"THE EGG CODE","review":"At first glance, this would appear to be a sci-fi novel with a familar plot: someone is controlling the internet, or the internet has become conscious and is controlling itself, or something like that.But after getting past the first chapter, it's obvious there is a lot more depth here. This book is about its characters. The (convoluted) plot is merely the backdrop.The action is out-of-sequence and as such it is a very challenging book to read (although well worth the effort). The glue that keeps it all together is how much we care about, despise, laugh at, and cheer the Motivational Speaker, Earnest Salesman, Pushy Mother, Our Hero, and the Supporting Cast.WARNING: This book requires an investment of time and energy. It's worth it. Even when you get confused by what's going on at any given moment, you can simply savor Heppner's snappy, funny, and engaging writing. \\"The Egg Code\\" is very long, but there are no wasted words."},{"Title":"THE EGG CODE","review":"Well, ok, not *everything,* but a great chunk of information on the internet is purposely erroneous.

This added spiritual dimension, along with Dr. Amanat's inclusion of his own personal trauma, gives enormous hope to the reader. Whether you suffer from PTSD, have friends who do, look at the world and thing &quot;soon we may all be suffering from PTSD,&quot; this book is a must. Globally, the world is in travail; individually one can feel as if stuck eternally in snarly traffic of frightening proportions. Dr. Amanat gives the concrete view, the technical side of PTST, and THEN takes these conditions to a much higher, spiritual level. He speaks of the alienation humankind suffers from separation from his/her soul/the ground of his or her being; he speaks of separation from nature; alienation which cannot be overcome by addictive behaviors, conformity or authoritarian behaviors. (Lord knows, people have tried). He offers the solution or a solution: the call to spirituality which he refers to as &quot;an eternal summons to love others.&quot; &quot;Spiritual people use limitations and suffering not to create enemies but as opportunities to help others&quot;! Thus despair can be transformed into optimistic hope. There is so much in this book, such as &quot;Beneath our passive surrender to love of God lies an incredible regenerative force that leads to a feeling of atonement and unity with others and with the universe. this unity becomes the antidote to alienation. Reliance on God ends the separation sickness, thus limiting the scope and reach of emotonal illness.&quot; (p 190)The text is clear; accessible, forthright, flows easily. It represents cognitive views, personal intimate views and finally the spiritual aspects of suffering. It is helpful as helpful on the level of Man's Search for Meaning by Victor Frankl. A debt of gratitude is owed to Dr. Amanat."},{"Title":"The Miracle of Love, A Spiritual Approach to PTSD","review":"By reading this book I was able to understand and help my daughter through her trauma. Dr. Amanat makes a complicated disorder easy for the average person to understand and gives many examples of how to love someone through the difficult times."},{"Title":"Alistair Cooke''s America","review":"There are some books that are just so informative that no library should be without them. There are some books that are written so well that it is a positive joy to read the text. There are some people who have such a way of looking at the world that you feel comfort hearing them speak. There are people who have seen so much that their opinion is something you seek.All of these traits are combined in this volume that only Foote's Civil War trilogy can compare with. The small stories that are routinely missed (such as the origin of &quot;the real McCoy) and the relevence of these ordinary people making extrodinary things happen are coupled with the tales of the extraordinary people who had their ordinary vices. (Franklin's advice to take an older mistress because they are both more discreet and more grateful) Both named and unnamed he tells their tale as it fits in the piece of this puzzle of AmericaUnlike much of history which seems to have an agenda, Cooke's masterpiece is classical, telling a story of grandur without fawning and of warts without lambasting. It is a grand overview rather than a list of presidents, wars and laws. He captures the essense of what is importnat. It is as if he wished to give a consice guide to his compatriots in England of what facinates him about this land that he eventually settled as did many in his story.It captures what America and Americans are very well and would be an excellent guide to any person who wants to understand us. With so many Americans ignorant of their own history it would be an even better guide to todays college or high school students to make them understand this land of their birth and how it came to be what it is.This book is 30 years old as I write this (July 4th 2003) at the time he wrote this Cooke was in his 27th year of his Letter from America Broadcast for the BBC. When you finish this book you will find yourself wanting more. Have no fear Mr Cooke is now in his 57th year of his broadcasts telling the story of America 15 minutes at a time continues. Lets hope he dictates a sequel filling in these 30 years."},{"Title":"Alistair Cooke''s America","review":"No stiff upper lip Brit here, not at all. As a transplanted British journalist Alistair Cooke who studied in America's Ivy League universities and then returned to America as a BBC correspondent seems to have been deeply affected and impressed by what he saw here. He stayed here and became a citizen. If the little man and his small cracker-barrel anecdotes represented the collective spirit of the country Alistair Cooke's fascination of the common man's philosophy captured that spirit simply and eloquently in his writings. This simple eloquent approach addressed and exposed the heart and feeling of the people that drove the great country for higher aspirations of the human experience. This is what he wrote about. His observations and examination of the Civil War capture the fervent feelings that Americans held be they morally right or wrong. Yet at the end of this struggle the common purpose of the people did not deter them to find their destiny in this land. The spirit never died and that is what Cooke seems to capture, explore and explain in such eloquent words."},{"Title":"Alistair Cooke''s America","review":"Besides being a beautifully written, poetic portrait of America's history, the author's British background provides for a totally different perspective. This viewpoint provides a different insight on people and events that an American writer might not have grasped and that I found very interesting and refreshing."},{"Title":"Alistair Cooke''s America","review":"Alistair Cooke, who died very recently, was a Briton who first came to America during the dark days of the Great Depression as a very young BBC correspondent. The venerated justice Oliver Wendell Holmes was one of the very first people whom he met - and he writes eloquently of that encounter in the Civil War chapter of this book. Finding our spirit and our optimism contagious, Cooke spent much, if not most of his life here for the next seven decades, getting the know the best and the brightest, the celebrity and the common man on the street, learned about our history with an appreciation that very few - even many Americans - have for this country.The result is \\"Alistair Cooke's America\\" first published as a loving tribute to this country at its Bicentennial in 1976, with a revised forward in 2002, though with no mention of the tumultous events of September 11, 2001. Cooke writes movingly of our history and of the spirit of the American people, the fight for Liberty during the American Revolution, the move westward, that \\"firebell in the night\\" (to quote Thomas Jefferson) as the country tore itself apart over the question of Slavery. He writes of the Civil War, interestingly considering Antietam to be a much more significant battle than Gettysburg. His views on Abraham Lincoln are also surprising, in his view that President Lincoln was venerated in great part due to his death, and being the leader of the winning side.Cooke also spends much more writing space on Woodrow Wilson, whom he clearly admires for his domestic and foreign policies, but either ignores or just wasn't aware of Wilson's Racist policies. By contrast, Theodore Roosevelt, whose Presidency bridged the gap between the Civil War years and America becoming a major power, gets barely two pages.Cooke's chapter on the \\"Arsenal of Democracy\\" is a revelatory look at how America's policy of \\"Lend Lease\\" and our subsequent entry into World War II did save the world from Hitlerism, especially when France had fallen and Britain was on the ropes.Despite some of his views, or perhaps because of them - This well-written and profusely illustrated book deserves the five-star review because Alistair Cooke wrote a history that belongs on every thoughtful American's bookshelf alongside Stephen Ambrose's \\"To America\\". The things we take for granted about how great this country is were never missed by this great British writer."},{"Title":"Alistair Cooke''s America","review":"His prose depicting the American people throughout our nation's historical record are eloquent and shear poetry to read. His endearing objectivity and love of this land through his insightful words are stirring and heartwarming. You do not come across this type of writing with genuine devotion, respect and love for what comprised the greatness of the American spirit."},{"Title":"Alistair Cooke''s America","review":"I am a huge fan of Alistair Cooke. The book is wonderful, the writing is delightful, BUT the formatting for a Kindle is atrocious!The font is not well suited to the Kindle screen, and I had to read it in large-print because in regular size the letters were too thin. I could not change the font. Some letters are split vertically down the center, with a gap between the left and right sides.Figure captions appear to be randomly inserted into the text, and are separated from the actual figures by several Kindle pages. This means that as you are reading along, it appears that the subject has changed abruptly, whereas in fact you have simply struck a caption. (It took a while to recognize the slight change in font).This is the worst formatted Kindle book I have encountered. My 3-star rating is a split between 5-stars for the writing and content, and 1-star for the presentation. Such a shame..."},{"Title":"Alistair Cooke''s America","review":"Cooke's America series on PBS was one of the best historical TV productions. His warm presentation made American history come alive. He did not bore you to death with minutia. As I watched it many years ago, I often remarked that if we had more Cooke-types in the classroom, learning history would have been fascinating, engaging and fun. This book, much expanded from the original TV scripts, is a pure joy to read and captures the style and delivery of one of the 20th century's greatest observers of American culture."},{"Title":"Alistair Cooke''s America","review":"The reviews above mine reflect the quality of penmanship and historical research of a personal kind that is to be found in Cooke's America, so much so that there is little left for me to add. This is no dry retelling of American history, but is a personal journey in words, based on the accompanying 13 part television series (now released on dvd)broadcast in 1974. According to Cooke, his book is more substantial than the documentary series itself because of a lesser restraint on information, but over all each is an excellent complement to the other. If you have the book, but do not yet have the series on dvd, be well advised to purchase it through amazon.uk It is both a sheer joy and a sad reflection of how great TV documentary series were once made.Ironically and sadly the opening sequences pan New York with the Twin Towers fully in view, one of them apparently still under construction. From beginning to end, Cooke takes the viewer on a journey throughout the United States to the places where history of personal interest to the commentator occurred. And so the viewer has the juxtaposition of the present alongside the pleasure of Cooke speaking directly to camera, (and at one point illustrating New Orleans jazz history with his own excellent piano recital) while telling the story of its past - with many anecdotes included. Absolutely enthralling, with so much in each part that it might be best to view just one at a time so as not to induce information overload."},{"Title":"Alistair Cooke''s America","review":"When I received the book it was preserved very well. The book is very clean just likes new. Love it much."},{"Title":"Alistair Cooke''s America","review":"Alistar Cooke's AmericaThis book was ordered as part of geneologic research. Delivery was prompt.

Cooke uses personal observations as he guides the reader through the main events that shaped our country. As a former teacher I highly recommend this book as a primer to get young people interested in our glorious past."},{"Title":"Alistair Cooke''s America","review":"This is probably the very best book ever written on the history and culture of this Nation. It is a must read for anyone who desires more knowledge on America and why we succeeded when other \\"democratic experiments\\" failed. Written first as a series for PBS and then expanded into a book, it will challenge many of the concepts that you learned in school. And, with all of that, it is still a great read."},{"Title":"Blue Streak : Inside jetBlue, the Upstart that Rocked an Industry","review":"Blue Streak: Inside jetBlue, the Upstart That Rocked an Industry, $24.95 US, written by Barbara S. Peterson, is about the history of United States airliners, but more specifically a single company - jetBlue - the most successful discount airline in history.Barbara C. Peterson does an admirable job of profiling David Neeleman, the somewhat unconventional CEO of jetBlue. We get his family history, tidbits about his upbringing in Brazil and Utah, and some personal anecdotes about both his early attention deficit disorder and his unabashed missionary work. Peterson then drags out the fact that Neeleman was a third year dropout from the University of Utah and had two children before he ever tasted one iota of financial success. But being a college drop-out hasn't hampered Neeleman, who simply followed his hearts desire and found a way to soar.Neeleman had a natural gift for numbers, and proved to be excellent at sales. In 1982, he started tracking the potential of the airline industry after delving into a long article that he found in the Wall Street Journal. Eventually Neeleman would back into his opportunity, but only after operating a successful packaged tour business that suddenly imploded in late 1983 when Hawaii Express declared bankruptcy, and took his growing agency down in the process. Unable to refund a substantial number of deposits, Neeleman's first startup was forced into bankruptcy.From the ashes of that debacle, he formed Morris Air after working under travel agency CEO June Morris. By the late 80's, June was the first female CEO in aviation history, and Morris Air - under Neeleman's watch - was a successful airline. At least on paper. The fledgling enterprise existed as a public charter out of Salt Lake, where Morris leased all planes and crews, but they faced competitive disadvantages. Money handling rules were strict, they couldn't accept credit card payments, and they had to keep all funds in segregated escrow accounts. Their advertising also failed to mention their charter status. This drew the ire of both regulators in Washington D.C. and Alaska Airlines, whose home turf Morris was squeezing.Needleman dodged controversy, and with the aid of Tom Kelly, the hamstrung charter received certification to fly as a fully scheduled airline anywhere in the USA. However, less than a year later, Neeleman was stunned when the airline he built from scratch was sold out from under him - to Herb Kelleher's Southwest.What Neeleman thought of as an opportunity to join forces with Southwest, devolved into a disaster as the two boardroom tribes clashed and were at each others throats. Kelleher fired David and Neeleman retreated to Salt Lake with his growing family (and $25M) during the Summer of 1994. Neeleman faced a quandary at this point, for Kelleher had tricked David into signing a five year No Compete when Southwest absorbed Morris.To get around this legal straightjacket, he incorporated a small company named Open Skies, which sold electronic ticketing and reservations software that he'd developed while nurturing Morris. (Neeleman later sold this to HP, and became their best client.) Eager to soar again, Neeleman joined a group of Calgary investors that wanted to challenge Air Canada. David thought it was the best revenge. He got to launch another startup, and was well North of Kelleher's legal reach. The new airline christened WestJet launched in 1996. Neeleman felt alive again, but he was only biding his time.When the No Compete expired, David worked the phones and started talking up investors. He'd assembled a \\"Dream Team\\" in his mind. He'd meld executives from Kelleher's Southwest and Branson's Virgin into a cohesive whole. Southwest because he had something to prove to Kelleher, and Virgin because they had a very strong name brand. Neeleman had that familiar startup itch, and he had to scratch it. He'd been formulating his plan while he sat on the sidelines those five years, and he was ready to shake everything up. And thus jetBlue was hatched.I really enjoyed this one Barbara, a great read!The Book:Blue Streak: Inside jetBlue, the Upstart That Rocked an Industry,Portfolio Hardcover 2005(Portfolio, a business imprint of Penguin)Pages:233 Pages262 Pages including the epilogue and endnotes.Rating:4 StarsChapter Titles:01.

Well, it turns out I absolutely loved it.I picked this up because I have an interest in aviation, and had a desire to learn about jetBlue. This book looks at David Neeleman, the CEO of jetBlue, and how he came to make a successful upstart airline, that as the title states, \\"Rocked an Industry.\\"From his past experience in the aviation field, to every little nook & cranny of detail on how he founded jetBlue, this book has it all. This is a very interesting read as jetBlue isn't the average airline, it's an airline designed to be customer friendly.If you have ever wondered how jetBlue became a success, or how the airline came to be, this is the right book to pick up."},{"Title":"Blue Streak : Inside jetBlue, the Upstart that Rocked an Industry","review":"A Review of Blue Streak - Inside JetBlue, the Upstart That Rocked an Industry by Barbara S. PetersonI knew that JetBlue was something special from the feedback I was hearing from friends and family members who had flown them. I began to understand how the upstart airline had achieved that success when I had a chance to meet the Founder, David Neeleman last year when he spoke at Harvard Business School. As I heard him speak, and then later when I had a chance to engage with him one-on-one, I sensed beneath the smooth and polished executive exterior a personal warmth and passion that embodies the vision of JetBlue - to build a low cost airline that delivers superior service and treats its customers and employees alike as persons of worth.Neeleman loves to tell the story of an encounter with a Delta flight attendant who accosted him and accused him of: \\"stealing all the nice passengers.\\" His retort: \\"No, they are the smart passenger; they know we'll treat them fair and give them a fair deal.\\"Barbara Peterson tells the story of the gestation and birth of JetBlue from the inside out. An experienced travel writer, she involved herself in the lives of the JetBlue leaders and immersed herself in the JetBlue experience to try to explain to herself and her readers why so many individuals have \\"drunk the blue Kool-aid\\"!One of the most gripping stories that encapsulates much of what makes JetBlue unique in the airline industry is the story of how JetBlue employees at New York's Kennedy Airport responded to the unfolding events on 9/11/2001.\\"Doreen Lawrence, head of in-flight, was driving west on the Grand Central Parkway when the news came over the radio. She was heading toward Connecticut with Brian Manubay, an in-flight manager. . . They were halfway across the Whitestone Bridge to the Bronx when they realized they had to get to JFK fast. . . They got to the airport ten minutes later, just before all access to the airfield was closed off. The found Terminal Six packed with passengers, many of whom were not holding tickets on JetBlue flights but, rather, had been expelled from other terminals. Most airlines had shut the doors to their terminals so after the attacks on the advice of the Prot authority, which was acting prudently - who knew if other attackers were still at large? Several strandees told Manubay that a rumor had circulated at the airport that \\"if you go to JetBlue, they'll help you.\\". . . An hour later, the Port Authority told JetBlue it, too, had to evacuate its terminal. Lawrence and Manubay made an announcement: All present, no matter whose customer they were, could go with them to a nearby airport motel, where they could stay until they had someplace else to go. For the next three days, the JetBlue pair slept on cots in the ballroom of a nearby Best Western, with hundreds of displaced fliers; no one, it seemed, could get out.Lawrence had not needed to check with her superiors to approve this act of charity; early in the day Neeleman and Barger [Dave Barger, JetBlue President] had told anyone from the field who called in that they should just follow their conscience and no questions would ever be raised about the expense.There were lighter moments as well. Al Spain [JetBlue's Chief Pilot], who was in Toronto at a meeting of airline safety directors the morning of the eleventh, had gotten back to New York by renting a car and driving nonstop for twenty hours. When he arrived in Queens, he'd gone to the airport to lend a hand. There were so many diverse passengers under JetBlue's wing at that point, he recalled, that they finally secured space in a motel some miles away for a tour group that was due to fly back to Europe on Delta as soon as service was restored. Their luggage was back at the airport, and so that they could have a change of clothes, Lawrence handed out JetBlue T-shirts to everyone. \\"So imagine how Delta feels when they see this huge group show up in JetBlue T-shirts because we - not they - took care of their passengers,\\" Spain recalled (pages 143,144)That is the kind of customer service that earns lifelong loyalty. I cannot wait to fasten my seat belt and taste the JetBlue experience."},{"Title":"Blue Streak : Inside jetBlue, the Upstart that Rocked an Industry","review":"Books and articles about the demise or bankruptcy of yet another airline are not uncommon, but how often do you find a good read about a thriving airline? JetBlue, the brainchild of David Neeleman, has beaten the odds by surviving, thriving and becoming successful beyond anyone's imagination, except maybe Neeleman's. JetBlue reached $1 billion a year in sales in 2004, is consistently profitable while the major airlines are losing billions and has developed a devout following. Author Barbara S. Peterson began reporting on JetBlue before it launched its first plane. She documents its progress from conception and birth to early development. She obviously \\"drank the blue Kool-Aid,\\" an insider's allusion to JetBlue loyalty, and couches even the negative in soft terms. However, we welcome the fascinating story she tells. Curious readers will be intrigued to find out how JetBlue elevated customer service to an art form while keeping its planes running on time."},{"Title":"Blue Streak : Inside jetBlue, the Upstart that Rocked an Industry","review":"\\"Blue Streak\\" is an engaging and readable account of JetBlue, the most highly capitalized airline startup in since deregulation, and its incredible success. JetBlue's growth has been unprecedented, and it is one of the top ten airlines in America entering only its fifth year of operation. It has consistently turned profits since its first year, and is expecting to add seven to ten employees each day in the future and nearly sextuple the size of its fleet. This book is a highly recommended read for anyone interested in the airline industry, entrepreneurship, customer service and marketing, or simply upending those stodgy, inhumane aspects of Corporate America.\\"Blue Streak\\" is about JetBlue founder and CEO David Neeleman's endeavor to \\"bring humanity back to air travel.\\" Barbara Peterson does an excellent job demystifying a complex industry, but the book shines when she lets Neeleman and the rest of his executive \\"dream team\\" speak for themselves. I had the opportunity to hear David Neeleman speak a year ago about JetBlue and his life as an entrepreneur. It was without a doubt one of the best talks I've ever attended. The greatest strength of this book is capturing Neeleman's ease, charm, honesty, and simplistic business sense. Peterson conveys a number of Neeleman's anecdotes and ties them together well. One from Neeleman about a man trying to reach his dying mother captures what has set JetBlue apart:\\"\`So this guy calls Delta, and they tell him the fare is going to be $800, and he asks, \`Don't I get a bereavement fare?' And they say \`Well, that depends ... has she died yet?''That drew an audible gasp for there it is, in just one choice image, the reason why airlines are such poison to consumers: that abject lack of humanity, that twisted logic behind those irritating rules.\`And so he came to us, and we gave him our lowest fare. And now he flies with us all the time ... and he tells everyone he knows to fly us.'\\"The JetBlue insistence on treating their customers with dignity (never \\"passengers\\" because, as Neeleman put it, \\"A \`passenger' is somebody who is just a piece of baggage\\") is why it has proven such a successful challenge to the scathingly inhumane majors. A highly selective recruitment and training process is part of finding the right people to deal with customers, but Neeleman puts it as simple as \\"You treat your people right, and they'll treat your customers right.\\" This book shows how at JetBlue these two ideas are vitally interconnected.The company does come off a bit cultish at times - especially the stories from JetBlue U and the inside joke that JetBlue crewmembers have \\"drank the blue Kool-Aid.\\" But the idea behind the airline is just common sense - charge low but profitable fares, treat your customers right, and they will continue to fly with you. It gives you hope that an industry besieged with customer revulsion and labor strife could finally get it.Peterson conducted on-hand research and interviews with upper management to get \\"a backstage view of the JetBlue experience.\\" Neeleman's history as a serial airline entrepreneur helps explain his motivations for creating JetBlue and his feelings about the state of the airline industry and where it ought to be. The personalities and contributions of other top executives are skillfully woven together, from those such as COO Dave Barger, CFO John Owen, Amy Curtis-McIntyre in marketing, and EVP Tom Kelly, \\"a sober-minded sounding board\\" for a somewhat impulsive Neeleman (Neeleman has ADD, which he credits with helping him in his career), among others.Although Peterson would agree with Neeleman that the verdict is still out, there is no denying JetBlue's current presence and success. As other airlines try and fail to mimic or destroy JetBlue, this book shows why the airline really is something exceptional in its industry. It covers the creation of the team, the startup and naming of the company, its first years, how it reacted to 9/11 (really worth a read in itself), and what it has done since then and plans to do in the future.The book had some confusing sections that seemed to wander and more than a few sentence fragments that gave me the impression it was either rushed or not well edited. But these were overshadowed by a simple, clear style (vital in a genre read by MBA's) that successfully synthesized the vision and success of JetBlue.There were times, such as recounting the customer privacy scandal, that I wished Peterson had been a bit more objective. She even admitted at the end of the introduction that, after learning all about JetBlue, \\"I'd done it. I'd drunk the Kool-Aid.\\"But after discovering JetBlue, it's hard not to."},{"Title":"Blue Streak : Inside jetBlue, the Upstart that Rocked an Industry","review":"I must agree with the other reviews of this book -- it is a captivating read. The only reason it took me two days to finish this book is that I do have a job and family that need a good portion of my time.This book was very well written and provides an inside look at the founding of a business where the needs of the customer truly is what it values the most. In fact, this book should be a must read for anyone thinking of starting their own business regardless of the industry."},{"Title":"Blue Streak : Inside jetBlue, the Upstart that Rocked an Industry","review":"Why does airline travel have to suck? That question served as the bedrock for JetBlue's beginning and continued excellence.This book follows JetBlue from Dave Neeleman's initial conception of it shortly after his stint at Southwest through it's 5 year anniversary (the point at which the FAA no longer considers an airline a startup). Although there were some rocky points, the sheer dominance of simple, creative common sense is inspiring.Just one example: employee ID numbers where not assigned sequentially. Instead of #1, Neeleman was employee #82226. This was done to discourage hierarchy and an the unearned sense of importance based on seniority alone."},{"Title":"Blue Streak : Inside jetBlue, the Upstart that Rocked an Industry","review":"The story of JetBlue and David Neeleman and his team is a fascinating one in the airline industry where red ink at the bottom line is the norm rather than the exception. Here is an airline that has found a firm footing in the hostile airline industry that is characterized by very low profit margins at best. It is even more remarkable that the airline sprang up and thrived during the recession period of the last few years.The remarkable success story of jetBlue to a large extent mirrors that of another legendary airline in the USA, Southwest Airlines, which managed to invent a new airline business model (low cost airline) in the early 1970s, and then had the unique distinction of consistent profitability over several decades. JetBlue appear to follow on these footsteps driven by intense people orientation, a family work atmosphere and exceptional customer service. All the major legacy carriers in the USA are struggling in the face of competition largely from jetBlue and Southwest Airlines.Since jetBlue offers fair prices, provide extremely reliable services and offer value for money services, passengers flock to the airline and spread the good news by word of mouth to their friends and relatives (drastically cutting advertisement and promotion costs for the airline).This book is excellent reading for those airline managers (indeed managers and entrepreneurs in all industries) that need to learn how to earn good money in the airline industry, how to be innovative and think outside the box, whilst providing customers with high quality services. The book will provide valuable lessons to those managers that need to understand the practical application of the oft-stated dictum that \\"look after your employees and your employees will look after your customers\\"."},{"Title":"Blue Streak : Inside jetBlue, the Upstart that Rocked an Industry","review":"What I liked about this book is that apart from the storyline which is well written about David Neeleman and how he started JetBlue, the author gives intricate details of how they picked the name, how they focused on Customer Service (starting from training), what culture they set from the beginning and above all every industry has these Goliaths and how a start-up can face them. This shows how a company totally focused on their objectives can thrive, irrespective of market conditons. Most of the big airline industries blamed 9/11 for their downfall, it was actually the ice berg (airlines are the Titanic) that hit them, but they were also sleeping at their wheel. I thoroughly enjoyed reading it."},{"Title":"Blue Streak : Inside jetBlue, the Upstart that Rocked an Industry","review":"This amazing business success story reads like a fast-paced novel. You don't have to know anything about the airline industry to find BLUE STREAK fascinating. I couldn't put it down once I began. Now I feel I have an inside look at something I knew virtually nothing about before."},{"Title":"Blue Streak : Inside jetBlue, the Upstart that Rocked an Industry","review":"...there are other books about startup companies (Wal-Mart, Home Depot, et al) that are better. The Jet Blue debacle at JFK recently led me to research Jet Blue. I knew little about the company, as it doesn't fly where I currently live. I read that there were two books written on the founder, and this is the only one I could get through the library fairly quickly.It was interesting about the founder's early professional life and how he started Morris Air and other small travel related companies. He sold Morris Air to Southwest Airlines. He got himself an executive position as part of the deal but last only 4-5 months, as he was a square peg trying to fit into a round hole. He had many innovative ideas, such as his reservationists work out of the homes, but cut down his company costs and created some very loyal employees. The story on how his company came up with the name \\"Jet Blue\\" is quite interesting. The history about JFK is very interesting too. I flew into JFK once(1991)and was not very impressed with it, and vowed never to fly into it again."},{"Title":"Blue Streak : Inside jetBlue, the Upstart that Rocked an Industry","review":"As someone who reads widely on the airline industry this book was really quite interesting. This new airline bent the rules in a time when the majors were cutting back and developed a winning formula for success. Peterson does an excellent job talking about the early day of the airline and sets the reader up to be curious about how it will do in the future. She had great access to all of the relevant players. If you are curious about how the airline industry has changed and what they need to do to get back this is a great place to start."},{"Title":"Blue Streak : Inside jetBlue, the Upstart that Rocked an Industry","review":"I live in Chicago, and as I write this review, we still do not have jetBlue airline service into our city. I'm stuck using United Airlines, an airline that has to be rated as the worst customer service experience one can imagine from a multi-billion dollar company. (I know I can use American, but are they really that much better?) Blue Streak is the story of jetBlue's start-up, and how they have been able to start an airline and succeed in an environment where most other start-up airlines fail. If you enjoy books about start-ups, this is one of the better ones. The author spends a considerable amount of time talking about corporate culture, and how it is the culture that makes jetBlue different. I have had the opportunity to fly this airline once, and I do have to admit that the culture is definitely different than most legacy airlines. I definitely recommend the book if you are looking to gain insight as to how to create buzz about your product or service, and how to do so with a limited budget. One of my favorite anecdotes within the book is the process they used in which they came up with a name. Suffice it to say, after spending hundreds of thousands of dollars hiring a branding company, they did it on their own using their own instincts. The book consistently reminds us that ultimately, no one knows your product or company better than you, and stick with what you know, but be different, be better, than everyone else. It is a quick read and well worth the investment of time."},{"Title":"Blue Streak : Inside jetBlue, the Upstart that Rocked an Industry","review":"If you fly JetBlue you will love this book.

Now the airline, which is eleven years old, is one of the best know and heavily flown airlines in the country. There are many tenets within the operation of Jet Blue that are useful for any public service organization. They aren't just selling airline seats but are providing a service to their customers. I knew very little about the airline and thought it was merely a clone of the successful model provided by Southwest Airlines. Ms. Peterson pointed out the similarities and the contrasts between the two organizations. To be sure, the airline has had growing pains since the book was written in 2004, and it's founder David Needelman is no longer with the airline. I highly recommend this book as an inside the look of a successful corporation and the practices they incorporate to satisfy their customer.

Peterson clearly knows the industry inside out -- her \\"set pieces\\" on the founders of Southwest and Virgin are worth the price of admission on their own. My only quibble is that I wished she'd gone deeper into a couple of areas, e.g. Neeleman's personal life. But all in all, a terrific read from an exceptional journalist."},{"Title":"Blue Streak : Inside jetBlue, the Upstart that Rocked an Industry","review":"\\"Blue Streak\\" goes on and on about customer service and happy employees, as though the two are directly linked and create a profitable entity. Forgotten (or neglected) is how much jetBlue's success depends on aircraft utilization (eg. fast aircraft turnaround - copied from Southwest; long hours/day), low fuel costs (eg. Southwest's hedging program), low costs overall (Southwest and AirTrans both beat jetBlue), ability to bypass intense competition (eg. early Wal-Mart and Southwest locations), and ability to fill planes at maximum revenues (eg. using intelligent price discrimination).Recently jetBlue's financial results went into the loss column, and the stock was downgraded. Other airlines are lowering their costs (eg. using bankruptcy court to force union givebacks and shed pensions) and prices, and parking many of their old fuel-guzzlers. Thus, competition is intensifying and it will take much more than employee smiles for jetBlue to succeed."},{"Title":"Blue Streak : Inside jetBlue, the Upstart that Rocked an Industry","review":"The story of JetBlue is far from over and, as I write this, the airline is not doing very well.

At the time of publishing, very few works on these aspects of the post- Revolution time frame had been written apart from works on politicians and American aristocracy and Appleby has contributed a substantial amount to this subfield of United States history.Borrowing primarily upon the autobiographies of those who grew up during and amidst the aftermath of the break from England, the Americans that Appleby writes of did not fight the Revolution, rather they are those who were bestowed with the power to shape the nation into what it becomes during the 19th century and eventually what it is today. This generation was born both into a revolutionary and republican tradition but faced immense questions.\\"The premise of Joyce Appleby's book is simple and arresting: Americans after 1789 possessed political independence and a constitutional blueprint for nationhood, but they possessed neither national political and social forms nor a national identity.\\" By utilizing over two hundred autobiographies of those in this new generation, Inheriting the Revolution is a well documented work. Those individuals looked at range from all walks of life, social status and castes \\"who did something in public- starting a business, invented a useful object, settled a town, organized a movement, ran for office, formed an association, or wrote a publican, if only an autobiography\\" (pp. 7-8)By examining Appleby's previous published books and articles, she is well versed in the concepts of a Jeffersonian America and ties these concepts and ideals into Inheriting the Revolution often. Jefferson, for example, was a slave owner but loathed its existence, during his administration territorial expansion remained important but Native American and foreign governments occupied land on the frontier and government's role in citizens' daily lives remained issues and are discussed throughout in an analysis of these autobiographies and various sources.Economic life is cited and credit to America's new enterprises are shared between ordinary men who made the right choices, weathered economic storms, and financed these risky ventures. A new middle class emerged and Appleby spends a fair amount of time on careers such as lawyers, doctors, writers, teachers, and artisans and how education influenced social life, classes and professions. Stories of religion, family life and morality are also discussed and their bearing on issues of slavery, expansion, public life and politics. Appleby appears to side with the North in that it was the true champion of the American Revolution socially, economically and in cultural development, claiming slavery to have slowed the South's development.At times Appleby does appear to be very optimistic of the changes that took place in the 19th century and an attempt to retain an uncritical stance. Very few autobiographies utilized are pre-1850 making the title of the book slightly misleading. It is difficult to be critical of Professor Appleby as she covers nearly every facet of American life, economics and politics in the post-Revolutionary era. The myth of the celebrated new national identity is fully explained in that nearly all Americans- all white women, slaves, Native Americans, free blacks and some white men were excluded from many of the processes that shaped the country. However, Inheriting the Revolution provides a fine analysis blending primary sources with a well written account and offers a fresh look into a generation of Americans that played a large part in the establishment of America offering a substantial contribution."},{"Title":"Inheriting the Revolution: The First Generation of Americans","review":"The book is heavily anecdotal, based on her reading of some 200 autobiographies written during the period. She covers topics such as enterprise, careers, distinctions, intimate relations and reform, but the theme is the new national identities that emerged, one Northern and the other Southern, during the period. Three primary forces that shaped the Northern identity, economic enterprise, political participation and religious revival, also caused a reaction in the South that no less shaped it, but it ways that left it bewildered, defensive and conservative. Readers not already thoroughly conversant with the period will miss any discussion of the emergence of party politics, though she notes the personal vilification and &quot;unchecked vituperation of public controversies&quot; that resulted from the proliferation of new voices and new publications. The elements behind the rise of Jacksonian radical politics is absent, as is any treatment of the economic factors that encouraged the enterprise and careers she celebrates.More troubling is her misreading of the religious situation during the period. She notes &quot;the religious revivalists successfully challenged the religious hegemony of the Anglican and Congregational churches,&quot; but that hegemony was regional, not national to begin with, and neither the Congregational church, challenged at home by Unitarians and in the western territories by Presbyterians, nor the Anglican church, still attempting to recover from its moribund situation following the war, carried the weight she implies. Moreover, the Presbyterians, Baptists and Methodists had been ceded the field; the proselytizing zeal of the Quakers had long passed, the Dutch and German Reformed churches had never been anything by regional, more concerned with language and culture than with creed and salvation. Apart from the wonderfully vivid accounts of the Cane Ridge revival, I read much of the record of revivals as activities or campaigns that were generated by ministers in established churches attempting to attract new members to church rolls depleted by western migration, rather than an unprecedented religious fervor that swept the country. She does note that women were the vast majority of those affected by the revival and reform movements and credits the Second Great Awakening with bringing blacks, free and slave, into the Protestant church, but neglects any discussion of the significant impact of the African Methodist Episcopal church, for example, in building black communities and opportunity. My conclusion: interesting and stimulating, but unreliable in its interpretation of the major forces of the period."},{"Title":"Inheriting the Revolution: The First Generation of Americans","review":"Around page 20 I figured out I should skip the wordy Introduction. It would make a better Conclusion -- too abstract to follow if you don't already have some factual underpinnings.On to the rest of the book. Chapter 2 is sort of an overview. Remaining chapters cover &quot;Enterprise&quot;, &quot;Careers&quot;, &quot;Distinctions&quot; (about social status), &quot;Intimate Relations&quot;, &quot;Reform&quot; (religious and moral), and &quot;A New National Identity&quot;. The material is undeniably interesting -- dueling newspaper editors (and dueling everyone else), downtrodden young people finding their way, cultural battles between north and south, Federalists vs. republicans, the inception of careers and jobs that had not existed before... and did you know that separate right and left shoes were an invention of this recent time period? Where Appleby stocks the book with primary material, it's engaging. Where she talks in generalities, there are way too many sentences that have to be read several times to sink in. &quot;The intense politicization of public life from political and institutional controversies accustomed Americans to public disclosure.&quot; (p. 41) Is this circular, or what? I imagine the book is most difficult for those unfamiliar with the material, a little easier for those who have some background.One other complaint: The reader is often left to wonder how things got to be as Appleby describes. For instance: &quot;Jefferson and his supporters democratized American politics... by implementing policies that enabled people to work out the terms of their lives with minimal interference from family, church, or state.&quot; What policies? Not one example is given; there's nothing for the reader to grip. I'm intrigued by the statement but I'm left hanging.On the whole, it's a worthwhile bunch of material, and the style is sometimes engaging. Just be prepared to deal with the passages that are less engaging."},{"Title":"Inheriting the Revolution: The First Generation of Americans","review":"Appleby's thesis is that the generation of Americans born in 1776 through 1800 inherited an as yet unformed society whose outlines were based on the revolutionary conception of governance, but that it was that this first generation of post-war Americans who had to actually form the &quot;more perfect union.&quot; She shows how this task was taken up by all kinds of Americans through all kinds of means, including evangelicalism, new mass communications vehicles like newspapers, and the formation of political and social clubs and societies. Empowered as they were by Jefferson's explosive policies, policies which eventually wrested the governance of the United States out of hands of the elitist, self-serving hands of the Federalists, the rising middle class cleared a space for themselves.Appleby assumes the reader knows the basic history of this period, an assumption which enables her to not only cover a lot of ground fairly quickly, but also to treat her material thematically. This approach may leave some readers unhappy or confused, but for those with a basic grounding in the era, the method can provide startling insights into a much-written about period of American history. In addition, the reader is given by virture of this technique insight into the present era. Appleby's one overriding insight is that once the civic religion of America was set into motion by this post-revolutionary first generation, and we Americans have been making only minor adjustments to this national imaginary and our place within it ever since.For fun, read as companion texts &quot;The Education of Henry Adams&quot; by Henry Adams and &quot;Improvised Europeans&quot; by Alex Zwerdling. These &quot;un-common&quot; Americans contrast nicely with the rising middle class population described here."},{"Title":"Inheriting the Revolution: The First Generation of Americans","review":"This is a detailed and interesting compilation of bits and pieces of information about an over-looked but important period in American history. Unfortunately, its thematically-organized chapters become repetitive by the end, and its sentences sink beneath the weight of academic jargon until one is convinced one has read the same sentence three times. At the same time, amid the repetitious treatment of some subjects, interesting topics, such as the prevalence of duelling during the period, surface briefly then are never explored in depth.More attentive editing might have helped. Beyond the structural issues, confusion arises from what appear to by typos, such as the appearances by Lewis and Louis Tappan, only one of whom can be found in the index, leaving the reader to wonder whether these are the same or different persons. If the premise were not an exploration of a relatively unfamiliar period, such lapses might be forgiven. But these oversights, when combined with an overly generous assumption regarding the reader's base of knowledge about the major historical events of the period, and an onslaught of unfamiliar, similar sounding names, can be bewildering.Finally, while it is admirable that the author attempted to explore differences in the experiences of southerners, women, and African-Americans, it would have been more enjoyable had she found a way to introduce such discussions other than inserting an awkward transition in every chapter along the lines of &quot;For women, on the other hand . . . &quot;"},{"Title":"Inheriting the Revolution: The First Generation of Americans","review":"I have some reservations about this book. 1) Its main new primary sources are the several hundred autobiographies that were written in the first decades of the new republic and which Appleby has read. I would suggest that these autobiographies have their own systematic bias. They represent the literate side of the United States, as opposed to the 30%-50% of American whites (and the overwhelming majority of slaves) who were either illiterate, had strictly limited literacy or had little contact with the world of print. Similarly these autobiographies privilege the middle class over the others, the story of the successful entrepreneur over the stories of the unsuccessful or only partially successful. It also privileges the religious over the non-religious. Given the fact that the early United States was an overwhelmingly rural country and that it only had a poor and parochial intelligentsia, it is not surprising that evangelical propaganda had a disproportionately large influence in American publishing. There was a market for accounts in which the subjects feared for their very souls and who wrestled with the demons of the world. There was much less of a market for people who had no qualms with sleeping with their fianc&eacute;es and who thought Methodists should mind their own business. Yet at the turn of the century one-third of New England women conceived their first child outside of marriage, and the rate was probably higher elsewhere. At one point Appleby notes how little interest or affection her autobiographers showed for Andrew Jackson. Yet considering that Jackson was only three men to win a plurality of the vote for the presidency three times (Cleveland and FDR are the other two) this points out an important bias in her selection.2) Appleby has a talent for interesting setpieces, such as the rise of duelling as a symbol for the political passions of the Jeffersonian era, or the dialectic of refinement and plainness while obscure biblical names went out of fashion, or the culture of drink or alcoholism. Yet her account of Americans considering their revolutionary tradition misses something. There is a discussion of the triumph of Jefferson and the failure of the Federalists, an account of party strife, and the limits of Northern Emancipation. Yet there is a certain passion missing about the meaning of democracy and liberty here. This is book which concentrates more on the successful entrepreneur than the unsuccessful working man. It discusses race and gender, but it does not really elucidate the dialectic between slave and citizen, and men and women that are crucial to understanding why such potent ideologies arose and their effect.3) In order to appreciate this book's limits one should compare her work with other recent works of scholarship. One should contrast her appreciative account of Jeffersonian democracy with the subtle, ironical and methodically documented accounts of Alan Taylor which shows the limited gains by Maine farmers, or the political limits of the enemies of Mr. William Cooper. In contrast to her somewhat upbeat account of the industrialization and commercialization of the United States, one should look more closely at Christopher Clark's painstaking narrative of the rise of rural Capitalism in Western Massachusetts. One should contrast her brief comments on love and sexuality, with Nancy Cott's startling demonstration of the fragility of marriage. In contrast to her use of autobiographies one should look at Mechal Sobel's recent work which suggests the rise of a new personality in the United States, more individualistic, less communal. (The discredited concept of bourgeois revolution vindicated by psychoanalysis? We shall see.) And Appleby's account of the triumph of evangelicalism appears a bit complacent, a bit boosterish in its enthusiasm for the winning side in contrast to the recent work of Jon Butler and Christine Heyrman. In conclusion, one might say this book reminds one of Tocqueville. This is not meant as a compliment, since one reason for Tocqueville's abiding popularity and the almost total absence of serious criticism of him is that he provides a complex picture of modern society and its disconents in which questions of liberty and justice are ultimately irrelevant. When such questions arise they are not values in their own right, but problems which must be ably managed by the wise elite Tocqueville is part of. Of course Appleby cares very much about liberty and democracy. What is not so clear is whether she has thought through them enough."},{"Title":"Inheriting the Revolution: The First Generation of Americans","review":"Appleby provides an excellent survey of the culture of the \\"first\\" generation of Americans and what influenced and shaped their interpretation of the American revolution that laid the groundwork for our governance and society today. Appleby notes that the first generation of Americans had to grapple with a yet unformed political and economic structure and much of their thinking and actions completed the formation of our national institutions and culture.Many themes run through the work. First, Jefferson's election in 1801 was critical because it marked the beginning of the expansion of democracy and participatory politics to the masses and reaffirmed the predominance of state and local control over politics. Literacy and the wide consumption of newspapers and books, social and physical mobility,inventiveness, the embryo of industrialization, the proliferation of religious denominations, the blurring of social distinctions, and the formation of political and social organizations are just a few of the many themes she touches upon. These cultural tides, and others, broadened and made more inclusive participation in the structuring of economic, political, and religious decision making in both formal institutions and informal channels of influence.Appleby also illuminates the growing isolation of the South from the rest of the country because of its rationalization of slavery -- an institution that was anathema to the ideals (if not the reality) of the nation's founding and ran counter to the democratization and upward mobility experienced by the rest of the nation. In hindsight we see the cultural beginnings of the schism between North and South -- here in cultural terms -- that explains how our nation could bring itself to such violent conflict in the Civil War years later.These are just a few of the themes in Appleby's work -- and does it little justice. It would take me 20 pages of run-on sentences to describe many of the thought provoking elements in this book. So in short, I highly recommend it for those interested in the nation's founding."},{"Title":"Inheriting the Revolution: The First Generation of Americans","review":"The book's contents are an assortment of anecdotal information about individuals, comments by foreign travelers in the early United States, historical facts, and the author's analysis and interpretations. It is not a complete history. It is a commentary on the social/economic/ political/religious development in the United States during the country's first half century. It was a time when people had been set loose from the law's and restrictions of England. The constitution's guarantee of freedom of religion and other freedoms caused a splintering of the church into various denominations, and a person could become a preacher simply by declaring himself as such. Likewise, people with a minimum of training (if any) could hang out shingles as doctors, attorneys, and teachers. Various entrepreneurs flourished, some successful, some not, as people struck out on their own to seek their fortunes. Schools developed as people sought education to improve their positions, and publishing boomed (partly because of the education, partly because the newly affluent bought books, and partly because of the freedom people had to publish their opinions). The author covers many aspects of the era including the split between north and south, the prejudices against African-Americans, the rise of the Baptist church, the rise of the temperance movement, and westward expansion of the nation. Many other aspects are only brushed over, such as the bloody conflicts with native Americans on the frontiers. The book barely touches on the maritime activities that brought the United States into the forefront of maritime nations (see Charles Tyng's autobiography, &quot;Before the Wind,&quot; for an interesting account of that), and only briefly mentions the War of 1812 which occurred during that period. It is not an easy reading book as the author seems wrapped up in rhetoric and sometimes writes with an echo, i.e., repeating information or points previously made. The overly long introduction can leave a reader glassy-eyed."},{"Title":"Inheriting the Revolution: The First Generation of Americans","review":"An excellent historical analysis of post American Revolution cultural and character regional developments responsible for much of the future general nature -- religous, economic, and social -- of both male and female Americans.

It is a profound, in-depth work of the true scholar and historian to be thoroughly enjoyed. One learns much from such historical preparation."},{"Title":"Inheriting the Revolution: The First Generation of Americans","review":"Joyce Appleby's Inheriting a Revolution: The First Generation of Americans examines a post-Revolutionary America that looked differently than many founders had imagined. The focus of Appleby's book is the altered political, social, economic, and familial environment in which Americans who came of age after 1790 had to live--and in which many prospered. Appleby is prudent, however, to illustrate that not everyone flourished in the new America. Chroniclers recorded the American way of success as the qualities of the period's successful northern white men. \\"A new ideal character was created: the man who developed inner resources, acted independently, lived virtuously, and bent his behavior to personal goals\\" (11). White women, enslaved Africans, besieged Native Americans, and white men who did not adapt do not factor into this analysis.The Revolution bequeathed the first generation of Americans a society awash in opportunity. In the eyes of post-Revolution Americans, \\"Independence made possible the creation of a distinctive American society that honored individual initiative, institutional restraint, and popular public participation\\" (5). The subjects of Appleby's study seized new opportunities and recorded their stories of challenge and success in diaries and memoirs. Appleby credits four post-Revolution phenomena for facilitating early national success and growth. First, she continues the discussion of the radicalizing of politics, which Gordon Wood brilliantly began inThe Radicalism of the American Revolution. Men of different classes and occupations found new voices in local, regional, and national politics. \\"Twelve years after the ratification of the Constitution, a national elite, established with such high hopes for forming a stabilizing center, had been ousted and with it went that union of social and political power essential to ruling class\\" (52).The second phenomenon which helped to shape the American social landscape was a revitalization of religion. As Nathan O. Hatch's excellentThe Democratization of American Christianityalso details, Christian revivalists, many of whom held little education--in an outright rejection of established church structures--preached of love and redemption in Christ. Religious movements brought together men and women of different backgrounds--including Africans--and inspired the establishment of voluntary religious associations. No one could \\"have predicted that the cool, rationalist attitudes of the Enlightenment would be overwhelmed by the warm passions of religious awakening\\" (8).The third important element for early America's success was new opportunity for the young. The availability of land, access to credit, and increased literacy rates prompted young people to take risks with their career ambitions. More importantly, young men departed rural areas in search of jobs and entrepreneurial experience. Family relationships changed dramatically as boys who would have once stayed at home to carry on his father's name and occupation traversed the expanding country in search of money and adventure.The fourth and most prevalent aspect of Appleby's study is the abolition of slavery in the Northern states. The decision to outlaw slavery by 1800 freed the North of the task of defending the bondage of humans in a post-Revolutionary America and it challenged the region to diversify its economic practices. Artificially cheap labor became a commercial crutch for the South. In addition, \\"the new distinction of free and slave labor with all its social entailments divided the United States in ways that could not have been imagined at the time of the Revolution\\" (8). Relations between those on opposite sides of the Mason-Dixon Line became and remained frictional for decades.In Appleby's view, the North is the true winner following the Revolution, and the South's decision to hang on to slavery retarded its political, social, economic, and cultural development. This part of her argument, which is prominent throughout the book, may affront some southern historians. Her not-so-generous view of the South does, at times, reach beyond objectivity. Appleby's zeal of argument, however, should not cause scholars or general readers, from North, South, East, or West, to hesitate to engage a brilliantly-formed and eloquently-reasoned thesis of how first-generation Americans understood their world in the wake of the Constitution. Inheriting the Revolution rightfully places the early national period at center stage, rather than treat it as a footnote."},{"Title":"Inheriting the Revolution: The First Generation of Americans","review":"This is an excellent book.

The works in this particular volume are mostly urban landscape/architecture. To the modern eye they may seem slightly banal, but we have to keep in mind here that the reason they seem slightly common is that Achet is the source. Anything that looks even vaugely like this work came from Achet. There are very few of these later works, however, that are done with such mastry of light and composition as is constant in Achet's work .

Silver Spring, Maryland: Bartleby Press. Pp.xii, 190; some pictures; some vague maps.Nasir Shansab&#65533;s book deals with the Soviet&#65533;s expansion into Afghanistan. His book chronicles Communisms rise in Afghanistan, the Soviets&#65533; invasion of Afghanistan in 1919, and the subsequent jihad that has followed. However, it is important to note that this book was written in 1986, before the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan had ended. However, Shansab does a wonderful job on giving a detailed history of the fifteen to twenty years that led up to the Soviet invasion, as well as details as to what took place during the occupation. The book begins by telling the reader &#65533;Russian expansionist ambitions in Central and Southwest Asia had taught Afghan rulers to be on guard.&#65533; Thus rulers of Afghanistan were always cautious of their northern neighbors. The book itself is divided into four main parts. The first part of the book deals with how and why Soviet Communist ideas spread into Afghanistan. Shansab feels that because of &#65533;[p]overty, lack of opportunity, social injustice, and political subjugation,&#65533; throughout the seventies and earlier, has left Afghanistan as a prime place for instilling communist beliefs. He goes on to state that the Soviets planned to use this social unrest and the public&#65533;s frustration to their own advantage. Thus during the 1950&#65533;s they began to loan Afghanistan money and began trading with them in an attempt to make them seem as a more powerful, yet charitable ally, while in reality making Afghanistan dependent on the Soviet assistance. In the sixties, the Soviets began funding groups in order to spread communism into Afghanistan. Shortly after, a small group of Marxists met in 1965 and formed the People&#65533;s Democratic Party of Afghanistan. This group felt that they needed to abolish the existing political system, and replace it with a Communist regime. Thus, part one ends with Daoud being overthrown by the Communist party by announcing their victory on radio in Kabul.The second part of the book deals with the different social and cultural aspects of Afghanistan, and how they dealt with the new Communist leaders. Shansab details incidents, especially one in Heart in March of 1979, where the lower class and middle class people revolted against the new Communist regime by ransacking government buildings and killing local officials. These incidents began to grow in number, as well as the death toll of Communist leaders and Shiite Muslims. The protests and executions grew so bad that by the summer of 1979, the Soviets were convinced they had to invade Afghanistan and put down the rebellions. In part three of the book, Shansab deals with strategies and tactics of the Russian army when they invaded Afghanistan. Their first step was to assassinate the old ruler, Hafizullah Amin and installed Babrak Karmal as president, in an attempt to have him and the PDPA consolidate power. Shansab describes this new phase of Afghani history by explaining that &#65533;The tragedy of a nation engulfed in civil war caused by internal socio-political factors now took on the form of a national resistance against foreign occupation.&#65533; The soviet army began to kill protestors and students that were in opposition. By 1981, the Soviets had shown that they were incapable of putting down the resistance movement. Shansab feels that this weakness was due to the fact that all of the army&#65533;s orders came from Moscow, a place not used to fighting guerilla wars. The resistance continued, and in 1985, six years after the initial invasion, the Soviet soldiers hadn&#65533;t accomplished any of their goals and were still trying to stop the resistance fighters. In fact by 1986, all the Russians had accomplished was forcing 3 million refugees into Pakistan and one million into Iran. Since the book was published in 1986, part three ends here with Afghanistan&#65533;s neighbors dealing with the refugee problem. Part four deals with Soviet geopolitics and American efforts to help the Afghani people and refugees. Shansab feels that the reason the Soviets have not found success in Afghanistan is because they did not count on such strong resistance. According to Shansab, there are 10 different factions of resistance, each being unique in religious or social backgrounds. &#65533;In spite of its obvious shortcomings, the Afghan resistance has continuously grown from its isolated pockets of rebellion into a nationwide war of resistance.&#65533; Shansab feels that this is a war that the Soviets most likely will not win. He feels that the only reason that the Soviets are trying to invade Afghanistan is because they feel that they are in completion with the United States for influence in the smaller countries of Asia and Europe. However, Shansab feels that because of this event, this has forced the United States from a passive observer into an active challenger. He notes that the United States has been giving covert assistance to Afghanistan and its neighbors in order to hinder the Soviet&#65533;s operation. However, Shansab feels that the United States must now deal with either trying to build democracy in other Third World countries, or whether it should help the existing governments in order to ensure the public&#65533;s safety. Thus in his final statement, Shansab states that he feels that this conflict is bigger than just the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, he feels as if the United States should help the Afghani people not only because they are being oppressed but for the sake of the free world.Bryon Wait"},{"Title":"Soviet Expansion in the Third World: Afghanistan a Case Study","review":"Mr. Shansab's book, written ten years before the Taliban, is nothing short of prescient. His narrative is succinct, forceful and descriptive. The author's analysis of Afghanistan's pre-communist days, the Soviet invasion, and the Afghan resistance eerily transcends the subject of his book."},{"Title":"Soviet Expansion in the Third World: Afghanistan a Case Study","review":"Shansab describes social affairs like Naipal writes about religious problems.I found Shansab's analysis refreshing and would recommend this book to anybody who is interested in the Middle East and Islamic fundamentalism."},{"Title":"THE BEST OF RALPH WALDO TRINE. With Selections from His Many Books Including the Full text of: In Tune with the Infinite.","review":"When I began reading the work of Mr. Trine, In Tune with the Infinite, I wanted others to read about his persuasion. His words meet me on every conceivably high point."},{"Title":"Go Tell it on the Mountain.","review":"One of the side events of the 2008 American presidential elections, the one that resulted in the election of the first black president, was the widespread exposure of the role of the black church as a central social, political and religious institution in the black community, for good or evil. That centrality, the subject matter of black writer James Baldwin's first novel back in the early 1950s and from there carried back by him to his youth in the 1930s, is longstanding. Moreover, the black church and its activist clergy, despite it long role as adhesive, healer, protector and face of the black community is not an unambiguous legacy as Baldwin, very wickedly, and profoundly demonstrates here.Baldwin uses the old tried and true novelistic devise of using a two-tier plot structure to delve into the lives, the loves, the likes and lies of two generations of a black family, a family that although it found itself in the North, in the black metropolis of Harlem, had deep and continuing roots in the old worn-out land of the South that most of the characters fled, willingly or unwillingly, at some point. The first tier discusses the present status of most of the main figures, including the transparently autobiographical John and his \\"father\\", Gabriel, a born-again Christian preacher, a character not unknown in the black community. The second takes place through personal recollections in a store front, primitive Christian church, also not an unknown phenomenon in the black community, or the white one for that matter.The details of the various relationships of the very mixed clan can best be appreciated by the reader. What I would note here, as I have noted elsewhere when discussing James Baldwin's work, is his ear for the various voices of the black community even though he himself seemed, by the facts of his biography to have been fairly removed from the mainstream of the black community. He clearly knows \\"religion\\" and the role it plays in the community. Also of the teutonic struggle between the old ways of the de jure segregated South and the de facto segregated North. While I am more devoted to the works of Langston Hughes as an exemplar of black literary blues, James too knows that condition. James can sing those chords. And the late Norman Mailer was not wrong when he noted that his contemporary, Baldwin, in 1950s America was \\"one of our few writers\\". I will say amen to that."},{"Title":"Go Tell it on the Mountain.","review":"Sometimes, when you finish a book, you look up and take a deep breath and say, \\"Wow.\\" This is one such novel.The descriptive and intricate prose is woven so tightly and consciously that Baldwin amazingly delivers prose masterfully without having to use complex language - this book will never send you to the dictionary. Some courtier designers need fine fabric to make quality attire. This designer can take rags and sew them into gowns with only his sewing skills - Baldwin is an artist of words.Overlapping the life stories of John's mother (Elizabeth) and stepfather (Gabriel), together with Gabriel's alienated sister (Florence) against the backdrop of John's 14th birthday, reveals to us the soul and character of the individuals and how their torments and incredible journeys affect and play upon John's coming-of-age manhood rite - which in this case is an out-of-body experience/revelation to the Lord before the congregation at Gabriel's church.John's 14th birthday will and should never be forgotten by he or the congregation. And, we readers, who are delivered into the secret realms of the tortured pasts of Elizabeth, Gabriel and Florence, can better appreciate and, in turn, should better remember the moment the young John emerges as a man.In the end, as a less-than-religious person, I asked myself whether Baldwin's constant references to the Bible (the story of Noah and Ham plays a large part in the end in contrast to the tortured relationship between Gabriel and John) and religious revival experience of John are meant to employ others to follow their lead, or to dispel their self-proclaimed truths because of the contradictions between religion and the religious which we have been permitted to learn about in Gabriel and others. But, I would have to conclude that Baldwin leaves that decision to you - but allows you to make the decision knowingly or after having learned about how what Gabriel preaches is not synonymous with what Gabriel lives.I would give this 6 stars if I could. Few books have touched me as much as this book has."},{"Title":"Go Tell it on the Mountain.","review":"It definitly helps to do some bible pre-reading before reading this book. I was assigned to it for class and never would have read it otherwise. However, the ending made the rest of the book worthwhile. The main character, John, finds God. I did some research on James Baldwin and found that this book is largely autobiographical. I think the author may have actually experienced a &quot;calling to God&quot; as John did, because it was wrote so incredibly well that you could imagine and feel John's feelings as if you were feeling them yourself. Many parts were religious tangents that didn't grab my attention, but for the most part, the book gave me an incredible inspirational feeling."},{"Title":"Go Tell it on the Mountain.","review":"I recently had to read this book for my college African-American lit. class. I didn't think at first that I would be able to relate to the work (being a white boy from the rural South), but I found a wonderful truth in this novel. The overall message about religion and hypocricy was universal. Baldwin is a wonderful author and now I can't wait to read some of his other works."},{"Title":"Go Tell it on the Mountain.","review":"Go Tell it on the Mountain is a wonderful book about self-discovery and familial &amp; religious duty. The characters in this novel are wonderfully full: flawed, but hopeful. I disagree with anyone who feels that an extensive knowledge of the Bible is required to appreciate or enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Go Tell it on the Mountain.","review":"Identity and societal roles are integral to &quot;Go Tell it on the Mountain&quot; - and interpreting it is certainly an uphill struggle.... John's quest for identity pervades this Baldwin novel, as he is faced with the dichotomy of choosing the evangelistic religion of his despised father or the street vice of his brother Roy. Baldwin explores his own biographical experience in the notion of the illegitimate child, a feature that pervades the text and many characters (his father abandons his child, Royal, and John himself is without a father). The absence of paternal love reflects Baldwin's own life and illustrates an isolation within John which can only be resolved on the threshing floor. Contrary to many opinions on this novel, it does not condemn religion, but endorse a deep, personal religious conviction that soars above the harsh evangelism of &quot;The saints&quot;. John is able to find his identity through a final resolution with and conversion to religion, which exorcises his fear of his father and enables him to discover a future in the church. The roles for women must also be considered. Baldwin places them in certain roles - first seen in Harlem as whores or &quot;Saints&quot;. This polarisation blurs however, upon meeting Deborah and Elizabeth, who experience isolation because of their sexual condition: Deborah is raped and left barren by whites, and Elizabeth is left pregnant as her true love, Richard, dies from the scars of white abuse. As such, we can see that these womens' intended roles, as a mother and wife respectively, are scuppered by white attack. Similar to this is the abuse of black women in the pseudo slave narrative of Janie's grandmother in &quot;Their Eyes were Watching God&quot;, and the narrative of Baby Suggs in Morrison's &quot;Beloved&quot;. Not to ignore his own race's deficiencies, Baldwin also shows a repression of women within the black community, as Deborah is shunned by blacks, and the women are segregated in church. Baldwin's novel is certainly not easy reading - it conveys the ultimate struggle: that of the search for one's own self."},{"Title":"Go Tell it on the Mountain.","review":"This was my second reading of James Baldwin's initial novel, first read 40 some years ago, and it rang even more powerful the second time around. Baldwin is the essential chronicler of the Black American experience, in all its anguish. The novel was first published in 1953, and was primarily set in mid-Depression Harlem, with flashbacks to the rural southern antecedents of the main characters, reaching all the way back to the days of slavery. It was Florence, who must have been approaching 60, whose mother was a slave and who \\"lost two children to the auction block.\\" Baldwin only briefly sketches Florence's mother, but this slender fact seemed to explain so much of the tragic and often dysfunctional family life of the descendents of those families which had been forcibly broken up.Religion is a major theme in the novel; that particular raucous, tambourine shaking, speaking-in-tongues spirituality espoused in store-front churches that set out the folding chairs before the service. It sure does help to know the Bible to understand many of the references. If I found any weakness in the novel, and perhaps it is a personal weakness instead, it was the lengthy passages of pure \\"preachin'\\", but I persevered, knowing that it really did give the flavor of an authentic experience. Baldwin depicts a world of good and evil, with the church as the vehicle to salvation, but he is also relentless in describing the hypocritical lives of the preachers, especially Gabriel, who \\"falls\\" and falls again. Although the church is featured as the one solid bedrock that can help anchor family life, I agree with another reviewer who points out that the anchor impeded Black economic development by promising the otherworldliness of \\"pie in the sky,\\" which distracted the believers from taking actions that would remedy the injustices that society imposed, as the legacy of slavery lingered.The novel unfolds around John, the 14 year old son of Elizabeth, who is married to Gabriel. Florence is Gabriel's older sister. In part I of the book, the stage is set; all the characters are introduced, and the drama centers around the knifing of John's younger brother, Roy. In this section we learn that John is illegitimate, and that Gabriel loves his own son, Roy, more, and has pinned his hopes of salvation on him. Yet it is Roy that seems to have the \\"mark of the devil\\" on him, no doubt reflecting the same mark on his father. It is in the second part, by far the largest portion of the book, that Baldwin tells the story, each in a separate chapter, of the three principal adults: Gabriel, Florence, and Elizabeth. These portraits are dazzling, and Baldwin has immense narrative power, revealing one aspect of their lives in a sentence or two, and then several pages later explaining how this occurred. The women \\"who have born the weight of men,\\" no doubt literally and metaphorically, come off the better, and the stronger. Gabriel's hypocrisy is not as all-encompassing as, say, Elmer Gantry, for he does truly struggle with the demons within. All the characters did indeed have the steep side of the mountain to climb.There are many scenes whose depiction can take your breath away. One that I found particularly strong was a down south revival, with 20 or more preachers. The night is when the young Gabriel makes his mark as a preacher. Afterwards, the preachers partake of a banquet. They are seated separately, upstairs, the women serve them. They tell ribald jokes, and even ridicule one of their servers who had been gang-raped by whites. That woman would become Gabriel's first wife, but the insights he might have gathered from his fellow preacher's conduct did not endure.For those who have a copy of the collection of photographs entitled \\"The Family of Man,\\" it is impossible for me to look at the picture on page 129, the black woman laying on the bedcovers, the black man sitting on the edge, each in deep middle age, obviously talking about \\"their troubles,\\" without thinking that this is a picture of Gabriel and Elizabeth Grimes.Finally, in terms of foreshadowing, one wonders when Baldwin wrote this book if he anticipated his own fate. Florence's husband dies, and is buried in France, during what was once called \\"The Great War.\\". Baldwin could no longer stomach the anguish that he depicted, eventually seeking solace in France. He is buried high on the hill, at St. Paul de Vance, overlooking the Mediterranean. A wonderful 5-star plus read, especially again."},{"Title":"Go Tell it on the Mountain.","review":"The first time I encountered this book was on a summer reading list in middle school. The title alone was so appealing I spend the rest of English class daydreaming what it was about. I didn't get around to actually reading it for nearly 30 years. Now I wish I had read it much sooner.Not then, at the tender age of 13. The rude realities of Harlem life circa 1930 come at you right away. Never mind that the protagonist, John, is 14; I probably wouldn't have gotten very far given the novel's unsentimental look at the hard realities of life, the baseness of sex, and the shortcomings of religion.Yes, \\"Go Tell It On The Mountain\\" is a tough book, but it's brilliant, too. Baldwin gives us the story of John, who in the course of a single day wavers between faith and doubt, love and hate, community and isolation, culminating at a \\"tarry service\\" at a Harlem storefront church where the man he calls father, Gabriel, is deacon. Gabriel is not, however, John's real father, nor is he that great an exemplar of faith, something we learn as Baldwin's narrative effortlessly takes us across time and space into the heads of John, Gabriel, and others at the tarry service, where extraordinary events are about to take place.I wasn't expecting \\"Go Tell\\" to be so good, but it is, not because Baldwin draws on big themes so much as the visceral way he presents them, every emotion raw. John's enormous self-doubt is the fulcrum upon which the rest of the novel turns; looking at himself in the mirror, he wants to know \\"whether his face was ugly or not\\".It's a story about growing up black and poor in a racist society, but it's more about the stuff of life, a universal tale about growing up. Gabriel is a tough man, but when we get inside his head we discover a more complicated story, about a man who tries to stand up for his faith but keeps being undone by his baser passions. His religiosity, an easy target for many readers, only serves to cloak his essential stubbornness.For a first novel, \\"Go Tell\\" is amazingly accomplished. Baldwin moves effortlessly back and forth in time, like Faulkner, yet you feel completely connected to reality throughout. His narrative has the moment-by-moment feeling of Joyce, but without the ephemera. He finds the core of every character he lights upon, which he reveals with such studied gradualness he sweeps you along with every soap-opera-ish development.Baldwin's 1953 novel seems a proclamation of his life's calling. John is not presented as a fledging writer, but his truth-seeking, and truth-finding, is one any committed person of letters can relate to. At the end of the book, when the sun lights upon John's forehead and affixes a \\"seal ineffaceable forever\\", it is the writer's call he is discovering.Baldwin says this was the book that made his career possible; I sense many others could say the same. It's a book with a lot of gas in the tank. Like I said, I only wish I had read it sooner."},{"Title":"Go Tell it on the Mountain.","review":"If you are a reader of fluff literature only, then GO TELL IT ON THE MOUNTAIN will not appeal to you at all. This book marks a journey, and not just a journey for its main character, 14-year-old John Grimes. It is also a journey for the author. Baldwin said before he could write anything else, he had to write GO TELL IT ON THE MOUNTAIN. The Odyssey that John Grimes embarks on towards manhood, towards his religious development, and yes, towards his own sexuality, is mirrored very succinctly within the life of Baldwin. Anyone who reads this as purely a religious conversion is missing the point. In my opinion, this novel is less about John's discovery of God, and more about his discovery of himself."},{"Title":"Go Tell it on the Mountain.","review":"My mother and I read this book together. It was very hard for us to read because it was so tedious. The characters in the book seemed to seek a relationship with God. However, their relationships with God were not joyous, but more almost painful. I think that religion oppressed them. They also had many tensions: -black man versus black man -black man versus white man -man versus woman -sinner versus the saved -inner-self tensionThey sought a relationship with God to relieve themselves of this oppression and tension. Songs, which played a major part of the worship service, gave them temporary relief from oppression, but it was nothing more than temporary. John was almost relieved of oppresion when he went to hell and back in the end. However, just walks right back into his house, a harbor for oppression.One of the reasons it was so frustrating to read was because, like the characters, you became oppressed with all that emotional buildup. There were little bits of relief for the reader, but then it just all started over again. It was like a Greek tragedy- with catharsis, except the final huge emotional release never happened. John was like the hero with a fatal flaw and the tragic fate. Also, the book was filled with intense run on sentences full of modifiers that made it hard to read. Then it skipped back and forth vey unevenly from generation to generation.You should read it just for the experience. Some of the characters are very interesting.I have heard that Giovanni's Room is much better."},{"Title":"Go Tell it on the Mountain.","review":"First of all, after reading the other reviews I was surprised to find a touch of ignorance in namely peter32574 from Nevada and Drofwarc Mail from Washington. It seems that ole Peter likes to use big words, mainly to seem 'intelligent', implying that Baldwin's writing is not. While Mail likes to assume that the book was terrible. I doubt that Mr. Mail has ever read anything of importance, and if you think that Baldwin is hard to read, pick up some Nietzche and then we'll talk. To the point, Baldwin uses his choice of words in this book ever so effectively. He brings about his own spiritual experience in an interesting light, fusing the racial problem of the time, to the spiritual problem in his soul. It is Baldwins poetical writing that seems to warrant my interest though. His unnforced skill is a testament to his genius, and many seem to agree. All in all, the book is a good one to read for a poets view of a racial and spiritual quest to rise above the transitory stage so often dealt by Wright and Hughes. A great book, and even greater writer."},{"Title":"Go Tell it on the Mountain.","review":"This is a well written story of the lives those working out their salvation amid poverty, hardship and seeking a strong spirituality."},{"Title":"Go Tell it on the Mountain.","review":"The great truth of the Christian faith is that you are accepted just as you are... flaws and all.Many of the great narratives in the bible include flawed but teachable people. From: Adam to Abraham to Jacob to King David, God inspired the writing of these accounts to show us he uses people just as they are and he does the work not us.This is just the case in James Baldwin's story, Go Tell it on the Mountain.The main character is John, a young boy just turned 14 struggling to develop his identity and to get to know God.During the course of the story we see his family history revealed and get to know the truth that his mother and step father are very imperfect people but redeemed nonetheless.That is what John must come to terms with. Baldwin's rendering of this internal spiritual stuggle is masterful.The way that Baldwin reveals the truth of the family little by little is extremely well done. This story is short and packed with punch. It is a moving and thought provoking book."},{"Title":"Go Tell it on the Mountain.","review":"Religion and Race are the two themes of this novel, with religion being the more dominant.

He wants to go outside and play with his friends and do what any normal kids his age do. His father is a very strict man; he doesn't want any of his children to go out a play. So they stay inside.James Baldwin uses setting to describe the time and the place in the book. His doesn't put in the year, but he describes the time period very well. For example when John kind of sneaks out of the house to go see a movie, as he is walking down the streets he hears noises and when he comes to the theater, he sees and reads a sign that said white only and black only, then you automatically know what time period it was."},{"Title":"Go Tell it on the Mountain.","review":"My youngest daughter - in college - seems very well pleased with this selection... like the professor gave her a choice, right?"},{"Title":"Go Tell it on the Mountain.","review":"I admire Baldwin's writing but this story had a bit less interest for me personally as it's about the hold of the black church on its people and being &#34;saved&#34;.

Perhaps one must be somewhat further along in life to appreciate the beauty, wisdom and empathy packed into this book. Baldwin wraps his pen around the poetry and majesty of the King James Bible and, through the mechanism of a family praying at a Saturday evening tarry service at a black Pentecostal storefront church, transforms it into a searing portrait of the suffering, survival and faith of an oppressed people in the Deep South and the slums of Harlem during the first third of the 20th century.This is not an easy book or a quick read. If your taste is limited to thrillers or murder mysteries or romances, stay away. Had I encountered it as a high school reading assignment, I would have thrown it against the wall in frustration. Today, I found myself stopping to catch my breath after almost every sentence, to take it in, to think about what it had to say, to marvel at the writer's artistry. At the same time, I was completely absorbed in the characters and their stories and could hardly bear to put the book down.I used to think \\"The Great Gatsby\\" was the finest American novel of the 20th century. \\"Go Tell It On The Mountain\\" catches up in a photo finish and joins it on my very small shelf of books so well-wrought that I wish I'd written them."},{"Title":"Go Tell it on the Mountain.","review":"James Baldwin often said that for his first novel he had to grapple with his childhood in Harlem and his memory of his abusive stepfather if he were ever to write anything else; the novel that appeared in 1953 was so stellar and accomplished that critics expected to get more of the same from him (and were stunned when his next effort, GIOVANNI'S ROOM, instead was about gay white men in Europe). There are few major debut novels that are grimmer, but that are also more resonant and more powerful.GO TELL IT ON THE MOUNTAIN forms itself around young John Grimes's ability to come into his own voice (a Pentecostalist's speaking in tongues on the \\"threshing floor\\" of his family's church), and how that moment was preceded by the tremendous and shattering efforts of his adopted father and aunt to come Northwards, where their lives were not much better than in the South, but which had more promise, and of his mother to form a home for herself. The structure of the novel (which breaks down in the middle into \\"prayers,\\" or narratives, of his parents and aunt) owes much to Faulkner, but Baldwin's voice is like no one else before him; this is one of the greatest of all novels of the Black Northern migration of the twentieth century."},{"Title":"Go Tell it on the Mountain.","review":"What a great way to buy books. I am not really into the tablet reading devices. I like touching the actual pages."},{"Title":"Go Tell it on the Mountain.","review":"James Baldwin's novel is very interesting and unique. The main character, John Grimes, lives in Harlem New York with his mother, father, brother, and sisters. Gabriel, John's father, is a preacher at the family's church, and religion comes up various times through out the novel. The focus is on problems brought up between John and who he thought was his father. Elizabeth, John's mother, became pregnant with John before she met Gabriel, and her lover died before she had time to tell him her condition. When Gabriel and Elizabeth got married, Gabriel promised that he would treat John as if he were his own son. Sadly enough, Gabriel did not keep his word and treated John harshly. Gabriel tended to favor his biological son Roy throughout the novel and this brought up issues as well. The novel journeys thorough the sinful pasts of the characters and John deals with his stepfather as best as he can trying to make the best of life. Above all, the novel was very interesting to read and I would recommend it for any readers looking for a book based on family, religious, and racist dilemmas."},{"Title":"Go Tell it on the Mountain.","review":"In my mind, as I was reading this, I could not chase away the comparison to Richard Wright'sNative Son (Bloom's Modern Critical Interpretations). A simple gloss on the plots of both would tell you the same thing. A young African-American man grows up in a northern city during the early part of the twentieth century.The cultural conditions are different for Wright's proxy character and Baldwin's. Bigger's cultural antagonist is white culture, while John's is the religious inheritance of his people. While the world of _Go Tell it on the Mountain_ makes me feel less guilty and indignant than the milieu of Bigger Thomas's Chicago, the world is more alienating because so unfamiliar.The unfamiliarity carries over to the structure of the book. While it ends and begins in the same place, the bulk of the text is discursive and showing the back-story behind John's life. I kept finding myself on my toes tracing where I was. While this can be an effective technique to really think about what is going on, it does take the reader away from the story.For me, this is a narrative with some momentum, so it is troubling that Baldwin uses the structure to slow the reader down. The book is powerful and well-written, but it is lacking a certain something that you can find inThe Fire Next Time (HRW Library)that I cannot fully place but is not here."},{"Title":"Go Tell it on the Mountain.","review":"It's funny, the reviewer below me also first read this back in the 70's - as did I.

Even those of us that can afford to sit in our plushy chairs and scratch our proverbial backs of creativity by means of writing reviews that ultimately wind up doing nothing more than contributing to this capitalist system and simultaneously stroking our puny egos can admit that there are some--and by some I mean countless--things in life that can bring us grief and send us spiraling down into the pits of depression and madness. Of course, this is all limited to our own specific systematic frameworks. Imagine how it must be for someone that doesn't have a warm home to live in or even a family to support them. Indeed, I've never heard of any third-world teenagers cut their wrists because their significant other of two and a half weeks decided to cut things off. Concepts of \\"problems\\" and strife are indeed very malleable according to what is or isn't available to us.Baldwin, in what is widely considered his best work, presents us (and more specifically his audience of the time) with the problems of a people who in the time in which the novel takes place had a systematic framework of trouble that was far \\"below\\" the standards of the referential framework of concern of the average American at the time. And what's more, he presented the public with these images in a time when these people (these people being poor African-Americans) didn't have a distinctive voice to elucidate the tears and pain of their world. Indeed, Baldwin managed to take what many readers of this book would look at today as caricatures and carve them into catalysts of understanding and sometimes even tears.This novel is split into three sections. The first section is told through the eyes of a child who has unfortunately fallen victim to fate and was born as a poor, gay black male in America. In addition, place him into the most dysfunctional family this side of the Mississippi (or so the reader would think; I'm sure many black families were the same way but only by necessity) and you have an amazingly sympathetic character. It doesn't take long for any reader with half of a heart want to take this poor boy into their arms and hold him tightly while showering him with tears. You also grow to despise the characters--most notably the father figure--that bring such anguish upon such an innocent soul.However, we are then presented with the second section: The Prayer of the Saints. In this section, we get background information on three of the principal adult characters in the aforementioned section and we soon learn: these people were unfortunate victims of circumstance as well. Like our protagonist, these characters were born into less than ideal family circumstances. However, they share our protagonist's racial and social burden that he has yet to confront personally. All three of these characters face these things and have their ups and downs which ultimately wind up forging them into the figures that you meet in the first chapter. When these prayers have been completed, you are simply unable to look at the characters in the same manner again. See what wonders a little dialogue and honesty can bring to you? However, the average American instead opts to stay detached from these figures and forever shove them into the position of caricature, which ultimately winds up leading vulnerable figures like our protagonist down a road of anger and hatred.The final section, however, shows some hope of salvation. Though, it is a very ambiguous conclusion. I won't tell you what happens but it spirals into a realm of mysticism and surrealism that this reviewer personally found surprising. However, this is where this strong novel becomes a little weaker. While I can see it working within the context of the story, this surrealism isn't as stimulating as what one could find in say, the stream-of-consciousness exhibited by Faulkner, Pound or any of their perspective contemporaries. However, it is not Baldwin's prerogative to challenge the traditional notions of art. Instead, he simply opts to present us with a world that few ever get to see and great job."},{"Title":"Go Tell it on the Mountain.","review":"I was required to read this book for an English class and I thought that this book was great but the transitions from past to present were not handled well and I would often have to go and re-read the text again to help comprehend the situation. Go Tell it on the Mountain is a wonderful book about self-discovery and familial &amp; religious duty. The characters in this novel are wonderfully full: imperfect, but hopeful. I do disagree with anyone who feels that an extensive knowledge of the Bible is required to appreciate or enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Go Tell it on the Mountain.","review":"The members of the family in James Baldwin's Go Tell It on the Mountain suffer because of their color, their poverty, and the conflicts and disappointments that are part of any life. Most of all they suffer because of the demands that their intense, dogmatic religion places on them. While they love and fear God, they have little appreciation for God's creation. For them, everyone and everything in this world is carnal and corrupt. They aspire to an otherworldly existence but their nature leads them to defy God and suffer terrible guilt. They think and speak in the language of fundamentalist Christian religion: \\"witness,\\" \\"wandering,\\" \\"wilderness,\\" \\"wickedness.\\" In James Baldwin's hands, this language is beautiful but it's disturbing, too, and this short novel will not be forgotten easily."},{"Title":"Go Tell it on the Mountain.","review":"I liked this book much more than anticipated. My initial expectation was a nicely written and overly poetic jumble about religion and identity crisis, probably a little too sentimental.Half right--Go Tell It On the Mountain is a powerful study of boyhood and parental expectation as well as the glories and the horror of religious conviction. It's more of a song, really, with dense, rhythmic prose that sings its song in a ramble that comes across almost like preaching. The effect is intended I would imagine, and produces results that are frequently stirring.This book transcends any mundane consideration of justice or political justification and breathes out a far more individualistically human story. A very quick read--"},{"Title":"Go Tell it on the Mountain.","review":"I enjoyed this book. Being a Christian, I could relate to John's journey as he turned to Christ. The style of the book was a little confussing. It was hard to know if Baldwin, as the narrator was simply narrating so we as an audience could know what the characters had been through, or if he was telling the character's thoughts. The characters, each with their own struggles, add variety. I liked how everything in the end doesn't just work out wonderful, and that we don't know if John changes his ways. Only knowing his heart has changed, we can imagine anything, good or bad for the rest of his life's journey."},{"Title":"Go Tell it on the Mountain.","review":"I was first turned on to James Baldwin when I read the book &quot;Black Girl In Paris.&quot; Afterwards, I began reading other works from Jame Bladwin.This book was so well written and so realistic in nature. The story line was simple to follow without any dull moments. It's a story of a young man's plight into manhood which made me wish I had read this book when I was a teenager.This and many of James Baldwin's works are an excellent addition to any literary collection."},{"Title":"Go Tell it on the Mountain.","review":"What a joy it was to have James Baldwin's first novel as my first taste of his literature. I already am looking for &quot;Giovanni's Room&quot;. This story provides an in-depth look into the biblical Christianity of African-Americans. African-American Christianity can resonate with what St. Jerome said: &quot;To be ignorant of the Scriptures is to be ignorant of Jesus&quot;. But it is also a story of Black history in America. From the dangerous South to the disheartening North, we trace the journey of the Grimes family. Most notable is Baldwin's delineation of conversion: how Gabriel seems to dodge it, and how his stepson, John, wrestles with it. The characters of the story are real! You may know people just like them! Baldwin is keen on the role of one's honesty, and gift of self in the process of coming to Christ. He delineates well the ethos of Black Christianity in this work, which I recommend highly."},{"Title":"Go Tell it on the Mountain.","review":"Ok, I'll quickly comment on some previous reviewer's comments in order to frame my view of this book. First of all, I agree with some of the others that if you have little faith, then this book may not be for you. However, if you have read Malcolm X's autobiography or any other african-american novels than you will absolutely love this one. Being fond of poetry will also help. So much of this book could be considered great poetry even outside of it's story-context. This is the &quot;door&quot; to Baldwin for me, and I have read &quot;Blues For Mister Charlie&quot; and will be reading the rest of his books soon, I have already purchased a few of them. If I had to make a &quot;level-comparison&quot; of how high I would rate him I would say he is similar to Jack Kerouac in how he makes you truly &quot;FEEL&quot; the character's emotions and really draws you into the story. Try not to mis-read this review. I am not saying that Jack and James write similar novels...I am just saying that I rank them both at the top. As far as having to know the St. James Bible, I would say that you really don't need to know much about it to appreciate or understand this book as long as you're well-educated."},{"Title":"Go Tell it on the Mountain.","review":"Go Tell It On The Mountain, the autobiography of James Baldwin, is an excellent rendition of life in New York City during the 1950's as an African American. The rough lifestyle, domestic drama, and racial clash of his childhood unfold over the course of this book. The autobiography is written in the third person, so as to interpolate black history rather than his life facts. The book is not so much about his life but rather the essence of his lifetime. His story is told through dialogue and the stories of others. He places the reader in his shoes as a witness. This is an incredibly interesting choice of the writer. Religion is also a both negative and positive influence in his family life. He faces much domestic pressure in an unaccommodating country. This is a worthwhile read and is significant to life. His view is intriguing. Life is like a mountain."},{"Title":"Go Tell it on the Mountain.","review":"Why?? Because they're written by either pseudo-erudites whose biggest complaint is that the vocabulary is not challenging enough or a 10th grade student who finds non-linear writing \\"too confusing\\". Wow. If that's the major complaint of Baldwin's style, don't even attempt to read Joyce, Faulkner, Hesse, or any other great author for that matter. Stick to Rolling Stone articles and F.Scott Fitzgerald. Regardless, here's my review of Baldwin's classic.Baldwin's prose is truly a gift of American English. The language is very fluid and while it does flashback numerous times, keeping track of the story in not overly difficult. His interpretation of familial conflict merges with racial inequity in a salient and thought provoking manner. The real beauty of Baldwin's work, however, is that the author does not coerce the reader into feeling guilty about the subject matter; rather, he presents the social status quo and challenges the reader to grasp it's power. In all, the book sparks conversation about the African-American experience, albeit many of the themes transcend more than just that.

Received in excellent condition and would purchase from this seller again."},{"Title":"Go Tell it on the Mountain.","review":"Go Tell It on the Mountain is a book written by James Baldwin. The book is divided into three parts instead of chapters. In The three sections, there are 221 pages. It has small font but it isn't too small to the point where you can't read it. The book is about a fourteen-year-old boy who is trying to figure out what he wants to be when he becomes an adult. In general, it talks a lot about what teenagers think. I personally think that this is a good book. It has all the qualities of a masterpiece. There are some parts where it might get a little confusing because of the way they go back and forth. There are flashbacks and those are the parts you really want to pay attention to. They might confuse you at first but sooner or later you start to understand what is going on. The only way you will understand is if u pays attention to the book. If u doesn't then you will be really confused and then will get frustrated.

I don't remember what I thought about it then, though I remember it leaving an impression. The writing then and moreso now is writing at its best from a master in my opinion. Yes it is complex, convoluted, disturbing at times but for me it flowed. Not everyone can write fire and brimstone, sin and redemption in literary terms. I am in awe of his genius.During one night at a prayer service, four individuals stories are told. John, on this day has just turned fourteen years old and is trying to make sense of his life. Gentle, intelligent, he wanted so much to please the man who he thought of as his father. He had potential to expand his life beyond the limitations in front of him. Gabriel, wretched, tortured soul, a man who refused to take responsibility for his actions. Saved, sanctified and fill with the Holy Ghost, his mistreatment of his first wife, Deborah, his discard lover, Esther, his present wife Elizabeth and his son John is what kept him from being the minister that he was in his youth before he fell from grace. Elizabeth, proud and determined, she wanted John to have the same love from Gabriel that he gave to his other \\"natural\\" sons. A woman who accepted her circumstances; she has lost her first true love, Richard and was resigned to accepting Gabriel's hand in marriage to redeem her sin. Florence, too proud for her own good Bitter, resentful of her brother Gabriel and now perhaps facing death, she has lived a live of unfulfilled dreams.Where we they all stand after they haved poured their hearts and souls on the alter? Secrets, dreams, hopes are revealed. Told in a language of complexity full of allegories, symbolism, Bible similies, it is no wonder it is taught in universities around the country. I am on a quest to read re-read Baldwin's books that I have read and read others that I have not. Nobody does it better."},{"Title":"Go Tell it on the Mountain.","review":"Looking over the reviews, I was surprised at how often reviewers said this books was tedious to them. I found it one of the strongest and most powerful books I have read it a long time, with language that was exalted, and often hymn-like in its quality.Concerning the book, then, I would like to suggest a couple of things to readers and to those who suggest books for others to read:1)Don't read this book unless you know your Bible well, particularly the King James version. Without this as your base, I would guess that you'd find the language incredibly dense, and most of Baldwin's allusive power will blow past you.2)Don't read this book unless you have some experience in life. Again, I would think that the way Baldwin is able to put deep inner struggles and the feelings that rise from hard experience into words will remain lost to you unless you've had some hard experience of your own.3) If you're not African American, a little pre-reading into the Black experience in America might be helpful first, looking into particularly the Great Migration, the Azusa street revival, and the rise of the storefront church.4) Practice reading the book out loud!! Many passages were written in an almost oral form, the kind one hears in preaching, with rolling sentences that seem to go on forever. Don't let the long sentences intimidate. Rather let them sweep you along, phrase for phrase, as they're meant to."},{"Title":"Go Tell it on the Mountain.","review":"Jesus said, \\"A man's enemies will be the members of his own household\\" (Matthew 10:36), and \\"No prophet is accepted in his hometown\\" (Luke 4:24).This idea certainly plays out in the Grimes family of James Baldwin's \\"Go Tell It on the Mountain\\" (1952). Except for John's mother Elizabeth, the adult Grimeses have no idea that love, familial love, is supposed to include favor (not favoritism like the father Gabriel's), the idea of blessing each other with good words, good will, and heartfelt affection. Unfortunately, the novel's Black Christians' idea of goodness and holiness is colored by the master's idea of a good slave: docile, acquiescent, submissive, silent in the face of abuse, always needing to prove your worth. \\"Blessed Assurance\\" isn't one of their songs.\\"Go Tell\\" presents not only the story of John's 14th birthday, but the past stories of Elizabeth, Gabriel, and Aunt Florence. Whereas Gabriel's spiritual journey--if you can call it that--at about age 21 is born of desperation and remorse after much self-abuse and self-indulgence, John's spiritual journey on his 14th birthday is one of insight and refuge after much abuse and neglect. Gabriel indulges and denies his dark side, projecting his evil onto others. John wonders over his own evil thoughts, seeking to reconcile his light and dark sides.John's family and people have been cursed by the white-oriented world, and by a false interpretation of the scripture, namely the curse of Noah upon Canaan. Believing this curse, Gabriel in turn, without meaning to, curses his children. Will any of the Grimes family truly experience being, like Israel, heirs to the promises of God, as well as heirs to the world's persecution and heartache?John perceives that Gabriel, or some unacknowledged dark part of Gabriel, would rather see him damned than saved, would rather keep John as a bastard child, \\"son of the slave woman\\", as someone to look down upon--similar to the cutting attitude that Gabriel and his sister Florence have toward each other. However, John, born in New York City, a generation removed from Jim Crow, just might become the first person in his family to start to throw off the reproach of Egypt (see Joshua 5:9)--that is, of slavery. That is, if his anger and hatred don't overtake him first.\\"Go Tell\\" is an excellent exploration of how the \\"Black church\\" has both upheld and held back African-Americans through slavery, Jim Crow, the Northern migration, and racism."},{"Title":"Go Tell it on the Mountain.","review":"First I want to say. I really don't understand how anyone with enough intelligence to load this site and write a review (and it doesn't take much) could speak so critically about such a powerful book. I can't even dismiss two of the reviews as complaints of illiterate teenagers. How can anyone ignore the universal theme of the book, the human condition. The entrapment of an individual inside personal, ethnic, religious, racial, and/or ancestral bonds. As for the &quot;boringness&quot; of the book, it seems to me that any one could appreciate this book, it is jsut as captivating as any thriller. John's struggle with his own identity as a person, a &quot;saint&quot;, and African-American, is captivating. Yes we all go through the same type of self-discovery, but no one captures, in such eloquent wording, the angst of such a revelation. In response to the critique of Baldwin's writing style. I can see how some people might not be able to have patience for his elongated sentences, and biblical references. And if you are too frustrated to make it through the entire book, I think I might understand...but please don't downgrade what you have read. Baldwin's work is likely the &quot;Pit and the Pendulum&quot; of the 20th Century.I would aslo like to say to the highschool students who read this book, that if I can appreciate it (and I am sixteen) I think you can too."},{"Title":"Go Tell it on the Mountain.","review":"The primary action of Baldwin's &quot;Go Tell It on the Mountain&quot; takes place in Harlem in 1935. John Grimes has just turned fourteen and his family expects him to become a preacher like his father Gabriel. However, John realizes that he has reservations about this profession, partially due to a mutual lack of respect and love for his father. After a turbulent scene in which his younger brother Roy (the name is significant, referring to a ghost in Gabriel's past) has been brutally injured in a knife fight, John and his family attend a Saturday night service at the storefront church where his father is a deacon.The night's passionate prayers evoke flashbacks to the personal histories of the adults in John's family, depicting the events that brought them to Harlem from their respective towns in the South and the development of their attitudes towards religion and love. John's Aunt Florence, Gabriel's older sister, fled from her ailing mother and drunken, disorderly brother and came North to seek better opportunities, only to end up in an unhappy marriage with a man who turned out to be not much different from her brother. Gabriel cleaned up his life after his mother died, became a preacher, and married an older woman who was sympathetic and supportive to him during his troubled times, although he strayed in one fateful instance, for which Florence still harbors resentment towards him. John's mother Elizabeth originally came to Harlem with her boyfriend in a doomed affair, and later she and Gabriel got married after he became a widower.Although John is the central character, the novel focuses more on the lives of Gabriel, Elizabeth, and Florence, and how their respective backgrounds shaped John's physical upbringing and spiritual development. Generally, it is a statement on religion as an important influence on the American black experience. And it is a brilliant example of style: The structure is unique and effective, the prose is beautifully eloquent in its symbolism and imagery, and the dialogue is sharply realistic and thoughtful."},{"Title":"Go Tell it on the Mountain.","review":"In many ways, \\"Go Tell It on the Mountain\\" is an act of exorcism, wrestling with the demons of an adolescent past. Baldwin's first novel examines his love-hate relationship with the religious traditions from his youth, tackles (albeit indirectly) his conflicted and nascent homosexuality, and (above all) struggles with his ambiguous feelings about his true-life stepfather, whom he detested while he was an adolescent and whom he tried to understand when he was an adult.The narrative unfolds in a single 24-hour period (sunrise to sunrise), although flashbacks are scattered throughout to explore the backgrounds of the characters and, in particular, to describe their past wrongdoings. The opening and closing sections describe 14-year-old John Grimes and follow his family as they prepare for and then depart from a religious service. The middle core of the novel, consisting of three chapters, takes place in the neighborhood storefront church on Saturday night, a spiritual oasis in a cesspool of back-alley crime and lowlife iniquity.These three chapters are the prayerful meditations of, respectively, John's no-nonsense aunt Florence, whose act of liberation from unappreciated familial duties early in life led her to the \\"freedom\\" of Harlem; his abusive father Gabriel, who lived a life of easy debauchery until he converted and became a Baptist minister; and John's mother Elizabeth, who is quiet and forbearing and who is beginning to comprehend the extent to which Gabriel has not lived up to the bargain of their marriage. Hovering in the background of this quarrelsome family is Elisha, a young leader at the church, to whom John is attracted both spiritually and, to John's vexation, physically (\\"in his heart, yearning tenderness for holy Elisha; desire, sharp and awful as a knife, to usurp the body of Elisha\\").There's always the temptation to read too much biography in an autobiographical novel. Although the characters and events in \\"Go Tell It on the Mountain\\" are surely shrouded in a mask of fiction (for example, it does not appear that Baldwin ever knew learned the identity of his biological father), there are just as surely parallels with Baldwin's own life and family. His stepfather was also a Baptist minister whose animosity towards the young Baldwin was especially pronounced. As a teenager, Baldwin also underwent an intense religious awakening and became a minister for a Pentecostal assembly in Harlem. And, of course, Baldwin rather famously wrestled with his own sexuality. When the novel was initially published, he tried to downplay its autobiographical elements, but, reflecting on the novel three decades later, Baldwin admitted that it \\"comes out of the tension between a particular father and a particular son. No matter that he was not my biological father.\\"The only passages I thought cumbersome were those that detailed the sermons preached by Gabriel as he began his ministry as a young man. (The problem with such literary representations is that the best evangelical sermons depend largely on performance, delivery, and audience response--largely to mask the fact that they are inherently formulaic and often studded with cliches, repetition, and all-too-familiar biblical allusions.) Otherwise, the novel is very tightly written and emotionally raw, and it dynamically presents the paradox of human transgressions and moral rectitude, the complexity of a genuine conversion experience, and the ambiguity that remains in its immediate aftermath."},{"Title":"Go Tell it on the Mountain.","review":"James Baldwin created a masterful first novel in Go Tell It On The Mountain. I loved his smooth flow from character to character, era to era, place to place. We are given young John's story through his family, one person at a time, and it is through them that we understand the complexity of where he is. Physically, it's Harlem, as the son of Southern parents who have seen only hard times in both the South and the North. Emotionally, John is bouncing back and forth between a life of religious fanaticism and a life of unbound freedom.Religion is a central force in the book, especially the disappointment and shame of sin. The hypocrite stepfather Gabriel is the darkest force, and the author's knack for showing the complexity of this character and the harm he exacts on so many other lives is perhaps the crowning achievement of the novel. Gabriel's may not be the ugliest or rarest of sins, but they completely devastate his life and the lives of those around him. Gabriel doesn't learn though and he might be regressing all the way back to the debauchery of his own youth. In hints throughout the story and at the end especially, we see John discovering the courage to escape the hypocracy and injustice of his upbringing, and to create for himself a new life of opportunity and promise. It isn't a long book, and I think it was meant to leave you wanting more. But in it's structure and incredible language, this is a very unique and powerful novel that deserves more recognition."},{"Title":"Go Tell it on the Mountain.","review":"I am truly apalled at some of the reviews and interpretations of what Baldwin was trying to convey in this book. Honestly, and truthfully, this has to be one of the best books ever written by anyone of any race in any country. I've read Dostoevsky (whom I love), Tolstoy, Dickens, Hughes, Walker and many other writers of different nationalities and talents and Baldwin ranks among the most important writers of this century. One of the things that I think people fail to realize (it took some time for me, too), is the purpose of a book. In my opinion, books are not only meant to entertain (some are, but most important books are not), but to give the person reading the book a perspective of someone else's life and experience, and also to allow the reader the opportunity (the responsibility) to apply or interpret what they've read to some how apply to their own lives. We must be always introspective when we are reading something and think of our lives and society and how and people do the things that they do. Any good book will reflect that and ultimately make some things clearer to us and make us have to think that much more about other things that are not.Baldwin gives an excellent (I cannot think of another superlative)insight into the lives of these people. Not just their lives, though, but how they think and why they think the things they do, how their thoughts give way to their actions and how their actions give way to the consequences that made (make) their lives what they were. I am inspired by that.If you are a shallow thinker and only want to be entertained, and can only see that what is only in front of you, then I can imagine you would find Baldwin (or any other) great, thought-provoking writer boring (it almost hurt my hand to type that word in the same sentence as Baldwin). So, we must move ourselves outside our boxes, and see more than just what we know of ourselves.I'm also sorry to say, O. Wilder, you have it all mixed up, you need to read this story again, to see what it's really saying. I'm not even going to address some of the other ridiculous reviews of this book.I read this book a long time ago (I was 16) and thought it great, but without quite knowing why. I'm 27 now and I realize it for the great work that it is because of what it made me feel inside."},{"Title":"Go Tell it on the Mountain.","review":"For me, the central problem of James Baldwin's beautiful and poetic account of growing up in a religious, African American family is the ending. The question is this: does Baldwin take this ending to be merely a description of what sometimes happens or is he implying this is what should happen?Throughout the novel, religion is seen as a force that stagnates, lies to and weakens the characters. However, by the end, it has become a force that the main character thinks will help him get through all the trials he still must face. It hasn't solved anything. In fact, nothing has been solved at all. We've been merely given a view of all that's come before and how those past events will probably shape the future. For example, John still has to face his unloving step-father - even though he is still unaware that the man isn't his biological father. How knowing he was \\"saved\\" will help him is hard to imagine.The most heart-breaking incident in the book is what happens to John's real father. Though pathos abounds in this book, that is the incident that truly hurts the most.Throughout, the writing is poetic and precise. Baldwin certainly matured in works like \\"Giovanni's Room\\" and developed his themes of homosexuality - a thread hinted at here but left unresolved like all the book's themes.The problem is just that we're left with so much unfinished. It's almost like Baldwin stopped writing the book in the middle. It seems he wants the import of John's religious experience to make everything else at least bearable. However, how this is to be accomplished in light of such darkness is hard to imagine or even if something else might be more desirable. Moreover, is Baldwin suggesting that all the negatives of religion he has been cataloguing throughout the book are somehow justified?In any case, \\"Go Tell It on the Mountain\\" is a gorgeous book about very ugly things. Good luck sorting out that ending."},{"Title":"Go Tell it on the Mountain.","review":"I stumbled upon this book a few years ago and was amazed at how great it was. While Richard Wright's &quot;Native Son&quot; and Ralph Ellison's &quot;Invisible Man&quot; appear to receive most of the attention as the best novels by black authors during the mid-twentieth century, I still think Baldwin's achievement in &quot;Go Tell It On the Mountain&quot; was a lot more important and long-lasting. I think this is chiefly because his aims appeared to be different, focusing more on the less dramatic ways that blacks have attempted to cope with the frustrations arising out of American Racism as well as the limitations it placed on their prospects for a fulfilling life. It is far more difficult it seems to me, to convey how the vast majority of blacks in those days sublimated their rage and pain through a more acceptable venue like the Black church, rather than illustrate how that very same rage and pain explodes in acts of violence (Native Son) or political agitation (Invisible Man). Perhaps Baldwin's novel receives less acclaim than these other two because it's more of a challenge to read, more difficult to connect with on a visceral level, because it aims at bottom not so much to entertain as to enlighten. I thought it was an absolutely first-rate piece of fiction, and it's method of flowing back and forth in time between one generation and another give it a certain unconventional, experimental quality that was rare for it's era."},{"Title":"Go Tell it on the Mountain.","review":"James Baldwin's first novel, \\"Go Tell it on the Mountain\\" (1953) is set primarily in a storefront African American Pentecostal church in Harlem in 1935. While the book explores the role of religion in African American life, its portrayal of religion is broader. The book also offers a portrayal of race relations in the United States, both North and South, through the first half of the 20th Century. The novel has an autobiographical component and is in part a coming of age story.The book focuses on young John Grimes. who has just turned 14 when the story begins, and on his family. Besides John, the primary characters are Gabriel, a deacon at the Temple of Fire Baptized and formerly a fiery southern preacher, Elizabeth, John's mother, and Florence, Gabriel's sister and thus John's aunt. Each of these three people spent their early years in the South and ultimately found themselves in Harlem as part of the Great Migration. There are a host of other important characters in the book, including several other children of Gabriel and Elizabeth and Elisha, 17, a preacher at the Temple of Fire Baptized and John's friend, to whom John appears to have an attraction.The book is in three parts. The first part \\"The Seventh Day\\" critically sets the stage for the book. It takes place in the Grimes' poor apartment on John's birthday as his younger brother, Roy, comes home with a stab wound. As the story unfolds, it develops that Gabriel had an earlier son, Royal, who died young from a stabbing in the throat. The family life is harsh and tense and filled with seething. After a scene of violence in which Gabriel strikes his wife, the scene shifts to the Temple of Fire Baptized for the Saturday evening service. It is the expressed wish of the family that John, a quiet, small, intelligent boy will find God and be saved.Part two of the book, \\"The Prayers of the Saints\\" is the heart of the novel. The \\"Saints\\" are Gabriel, Florence, and Elizabeth. As they pray that Saturday evening, their minds are filled with flashbacks of their earlier lives and relationships to each other. They grew up against a backdrop of racism, but there is much more to each of their stories.Each of the three carry heavy burdens, and none more so that the preacher, Gabriel. Their stories are vividly told and poignant.In the final part of the book, \\"The Threshing Floor\\", John has his epiphany and salvation experience. This experience is ambiguous in character and the reader is left in skepticism about whether one would wish for such an experience or rely upon it if it happened. Baldwin describes it vividly. In a sleeting March early morning following John's conversion experience, family tensions again rise to the fore, especially in the continued angry and hateful relationship between John and Gabriel.Baldwin writes with great detail in examining places, North and South, and character. The sentences are long and filled with extensive adjectives, repetition, and force. The book is replete with Biblical allusions. The narrative voice is in formal, correct American English. In the passages of dialogue, Baldwin captures the rhythmic, colloquial capture of African American speech of his time.The novel takes a complicated view of religion. As a young man, Baldwin himself left the church where he had been an adolescent minister and never again professed adherence to any organized religion. Much the book portrays religion as sexually repressive, superstitious, and hypocritical. There is a suggestion as well that the African American churches discouraged their adherents from addressing the woeful discrimination against them. Yet there is a sense of mysticism and wonder in this book and of piety beyond the formalities.I read this novel in a book group that focuses on works written by black people, in the United States and throughout the world. It took a long time for me to find this book. \\"Go Tell it on the Mountain\\" is widely regarded as an American classic, and so it is. It deserves the accolades it has received and more.Robin Friedman"},{"Title":"Go Tell it on the Mountain.","review":"When first reading \\"Go Tell it on the Mountain\\", the names places and time element where somewhat perplexing, but once the characters were identified the book was hard to put down.

I found the style of using flashbacks somewhat annoying at times, and consequently the plot was confusing in places. If you desire intense issues to be presented in a reasonably entertaining fashion, then this is the book for you, but beware if you desire a book of easy reading.

Dell Publishing.ISBN: 0-440-33007-6James Baldwin's, Go Tell It On The Mountain, tells the story of two generations of an African-American family who began their migration from the south to the northern city of Harlem beginning in 1900. John, the 14-year old stepson of Gabriel Grimes, begins our journey as an up and coming preacher on his 14th birthday, March of 1935. Walking that night with his family to the storefront church in Harlem, the story jogs backward to the previous generation's struggles migrating north to escape the oppressions both outside and inside the family--finding its way back to the storefront church to witness John's cathartic awakening. Each family member has his or her own riveting story of the past, yet each is interdependent and leads back to young John's awakening. John, a young black man in 1930's Harlem must deal with a religious zealot of a step-father, a community of poverty and violence; yet he finds hope in this insular black community in America which preached the self-worth and intelligence of the black for the first time. Baldwin speaks through a style of veiled biblical references dotted with nuggets of prose that transcend any race and time.

If you read this, you will understand how he feels and what he struggles for. That is what a good novel does, and this is very good.Recommended with warmth."},{"Title":"Go Tell it on the Mountain.","review":"\\"Go Tell It On The Mountain\\" starts with John, a 14 year old narrating his family story, living in Harlem. His parents had migrated North to New York as young adults and he is the first generation to grow up in the \\"liberal\\" North rather than in the \\"segregated\\" South.John's father dislikes him, but the secret to his dislike is hidden from John. John has deep scars from his father's dislike though which emerge when he enters a trance-like religious state in church:\\"Then his father was upon him; at his touch there was singing, and fire. John lay on his back in the narrow street, looking up at his father, that burning face beneath the burning towers.'I'm going to beat it out of you. I'm going to beat it out.' His father raised his hand. The knife came down. John rolled away, down the white, descending street, screaming: 'Father! Father!'\\"The father seems to symbolize both John's father and God who is invoked by each character as an overpowering presence who must by appeased, despite uncertainty as to what his wishes are. John's vision seems to be a way of reaching an understanding of his father and his relationship with him.[...]"},{"Title":"Go Tell it on the Mountain.","review":"Like others have mentioned, this book was over-written and the prose was too lyrical. Some of the descriptive passages and religious mumbo-jumbo were very tiring to get through, and it stalled the little action the novel did have. And in the end, there was a lot Baldwin set up in terms of plot that was left wide open. Especially The Letter (when you read this you'll know what I mean). Why did Baldwin dedicate so much character dialogue to the letter, leading readers to believe the revelation of it would resolve the story, then end things before it was revealed??? WAS it even revealed?This could've easily been a novella, and a good one, if he had revised the manuscript better."},{"Title":"Go Tell it on the Mountain.","review":"James Baldwin's &quot;Go Tell It On The Mountain&quot; depicts the story of a young preacher's son who struggles with religious meaning in his life. Discerning between his own beliefs and what everyone around him expects becomes an internal battle for him. Interpreted through a rather slower plot-with several series of abrupt flashbacks and drawn-out paragraphs-you often find the story hard to follow. For example, in the period of time the book covers, which elapses in a single day, you get in-depth looks into the complete life-stories of three individual characters. Moreover, Baldwin's descriptive writing tends to inform you of more details than you want or need to know. However, in the midst of such confusion you are able to hear Baldwin's voice protrude. He clearly understands the people he portrays, and I'll give him that. So, if you are searching for a book with a confusing plot, little action or dialogue, and abrupt scene changes, you've got it. But to the rest of the readers in this world, I wouldn't recommend this book."},{"Title":"Go Tell it on the Mountain.","review":"I find it humorous to read all of these reviews and decided to add my tid bit of info.

James Baldwin is anathema to me--but this book--as a work of art, as an example of human effort--is outstanding.Not at first, though. The exordium is tedious and boring, and I was flipping pages with alacrity, saying to myself: \\"AHA! Overrated! And I know why.\\" But once the narrative sea-legs get set with the history of Gabriel Grimes, the novel becomes special. You can tell Baldwin read almost every book in his local library, and that he had uncommon talent at organizing words, piecing sentences together, and constructing something greater than the sum of its parts.The heavy emphasis on religion would normally be an impediment to my enjoyment of any work, but here, though it did get old, it did not vitiate the flow. God played an important role in young Baldwin's life, and the book reflects those years.The MLA has decreed to the unwashed masses that Go Tell It On The Mountain is the thirty-ninth best novel of the 20th century. That places it ahead of superior works such as Pale Fire, Of Human Bondage, and Lord of the Flies (to name only three), but also behind inferior works such as To The Lighthouse and the Studs Lonigan Trilogy.No matter the placement, this is a significant book that deserves to be read on its own merits."},{"Title":"Go Tell it on the Mountain.","review":"Go Tell it on the MountainIf you would like a book to read that really, hit the topics on family relationships, deals with prejudices and leadership.

Lexon, the main character, is an African American that is very strong with his family, by stepping in and taking care of his younger siblings and watching over his parents. With the racism going on in the book, it seems like most people in this situation that Lexon was in will just take the misbehaving actions, but he stepped up and took a stand. This surprised me being the reader because Lexon seemed like he was a shy person in the beginning of the text. By him taking a stand, change his whole outlook of the character that I though was before as I was reading.Go Tell it on the Mountain , if truth be told is a excellent paperback because I bet everyone at one point in there life had deal with a least one of theses issues in there life at one moment at another as there journey of growing up as a child to a teen. The great thing about this book is that it is not a black only or white only book; this book has no gender or race with it, just because it the topics of going against African Americans. I enjoyed the book because I noticed this about on how open it was and emotional.This text touched me in a special way because I was going through similar responsibilities as Lexon.

The book revolves around several different individual plots that are hard to follow. The characters are confusing, and there is no division between the present and the past. The whole time, I felt a negativity towards Christianity (even though I am a Christian). Also, I was shocked by the amount of sexual material in a book focused on Christianity in the African American Church. It is weird to be reading about breasts in the same book where a lot of the plot takes place in a church.Hypocrisy is a major theme. John, the main character, sees this hypocrisy in the church and has a very negative view of the church. Suddenly, all his hesitancy towards the faith is wiped clean during his conversion. I have a hard time understanding how he could change, even though everyone around him is still the same (except his \\"father\\", who seems to get worse).

This book is divided into three parts instead of chapters. In the three sections, there are 221 pages. It has small font but it isn't too small to the point where you can't read it. It has a reasonable amount of words per page and a reasonable amount of pages per section. The book is about a fourteen-year-old boy who is trying to figure out what he wants to be when he becomes an adult. In general, it talks a lot about what teenagers think about and what goes on in some people's lives. I personally think that this is a good book. It has all the qualities of a masterpiece. There are some parts where it might get a little confusing because of the way they go back and forth. There are many flashbacks throughout the book. The flashbacks are the parts you really want to pay attention to. They might confuse you at first but sooner or later you start to understand what is going on as long as you pay attention. The only way you will understand is if you stay focused on the book. If you don't then you will be really confused and then will get frustrated along with the confusion you already have. This is why it is crucial for you to stay focused the whole time while reading.

I become less interested when the point of view shifts.

Baldwin's desctiption of the religious fervor, the \\"tarrying\\" meetings was sensitive and clear. It took such a person to reveal so much about himself and the selt-deprecation (or self-flagellation). This was a significant part of the lives of those--both black and white--who were taught to despise self to gain the greater approval and glory of God.This book, especially, was a major turning point in the attitude of those who did not know or care about the \\"holiness people,\\" the pentecostal, the poor black, or even the acceptance of one whose gender choice was of the same sex.I would recommend that everyone find a copy before they become out-of-date printings. We live in a much more accepting and tolerant society today but we can continue to improve."},{"Title":"Go Tell it on the Mountain.","review":"I was really looking forward to reading this book since I knew it had religious overtones. However, the book tried to tie religious feelings with characters that only on the surface appear to be faithful. At least Baldwin created an interesting struggle with faith and temptation.

These people just go through the motions of a faithful life and therefore, the character descriptions are incorrect."},{"Title":"Go Tell it on the Mountain.","review":"Have you ever read a book you know would be great, if the sentences weren't so long and drawn-out? And you try to read it, but it is just too descriptive? Go Tell It On the Mountain, by James Baldwin, is exactly that book for me.The story is about a young boy, John, and his family growing up in Harlem. Or at least that is supposed to be the plot. But in reality, not even half of the book takes place in Harlem. Each person in Go Tell It On the Mountain had their own mini-plot. Usually, mini-plots are a useful tool for writing a book. But to be useful, the plots must first, all fit together.When reading this book I was continually confused by the way the author jumped in and out of flashbacks. Characters during these flashbacks are not explained the way they should be. Baldwin takes a little too much time using big words, and not enough time introducing new characters.If you are interested in reading this book, I would suggest to do so.

Go Tell It On The Mountain by James Baldwin tells the story of the deep spiritual struggle of a fourteen year old black boy growing up in a Harlem community in the 1930's. At times, the book sounds almost poetic until an abrupt, and occasionally disturbing, flash back jumps at you from out of nowhere. Eventually, the story turns into somewhat of a bad soap opera with adultery, gangs, attempted murder, child abuse, suicide, and rape. Baldwin has shown through this book his mastery of fitting someone's life story into a single sentence as he attempted to do several times, losing the reader mid sentence. Baldwin also went on for pages describing dust in a house and adulterous moments-a euphemism of course. I cancertainly agree with New York Times' review, \\" with vivid imagery and lavish attention to details.\\" But I never imagined it to be this bad. Where details lacked in some areas, theygrew like weeds in others. Attention to details many people do not want to hear about proliferated, distracting from the supposed focus of the book, the spiritual struggles of teenage boy.In five words or less: sick, twisted and way to long.

I liked this autobiography but then again I do not so that id why I know how both kinds of people would feel. So, if you really like and support your religion then I would recommend this book. However, if you really do not care about it then I would not recommend this story to you.This book is an autobiography of James Baldwin. He wrote of how his life was supposed to end up just like his fathers without question. His father was a pastor (father). He also never really paid attention to that because he was so use to hearing that he would become just like his father. He never mined about it until he turned 14 year old.

The protagonist simply goes into fits of self-loathing and predictable &quot;White man oppresive, Black oppressed, so let's sink down to their level.&quot; But I just can't get over the prose.

The grammatical errors of this speech just annoyed me. Ok,ok, I know that is probably how the characters talked in real life back then but I struggled to follow it. I also thought the writing style (other than the type of speech used) was rather self righteous and long winded. Even 101 pages in, the author had not really made a point, or at least not one that I noticed.If this is the \\"most important novel written about the American Negro\\" then I really need someone to sit down and explain why.

This book is a great example of characterization. The reader is almost left with more questions going out that coming in. For example: What is evil? John was not certain of his holiness at the beginning of the book, but after his experience on the threshing-floor decided to join it. This is after we have found out about all the misdeeds of several of the members present at the service. So are we to conclude that John is just as disturbed as the others? Or are we to conclude that some characters were really better than we thought they were after all the details about the relationships come to light?The author went a bit too far trying to find profound descriptions and metaphors. The book would have been much lighter and easier reading without them.I hadn't picked up a fiction book in a number of years.

In this societies' point of view God is real and he is the higher law. What we see is on of the members of this society not sharing the same opinion. Many people like my self might not enjoy religion for religion to be part of their educational enrichment in school. If you as an individual become distracted, dull, or simply uninterested in literature with the religion topic addressed please do not consider this book as part of your summer reading choices. You will end up hurting yourself because on e of the goals for summer reading is to enjoy yourself with educated reading. I for the most part did not feel excited while reading and writing responses for this book. In addition, if you have problems with reading elevated books Go Tell It on a Mountain may be suitable for you. It is not a difficult book to read, because the vocabulary is not elevated. As a reader, I prefer books with a high vocabulary. When I was reading I was not challenged and that added to my discontent with this novel. One thing that might help with reading if having problems with understanding the text is to write notes to the side or on post it notes. I myself wrote notes when it came to a point that I had to create reading responses. Writing notes helped me, because when I needed to write the reading responses I could simply refer to my notes and not be confused about how I concluded or were I obtained some observations or information. If reading this book I recommend discussing it with a friend of someone else to make stronger connections to the text. Go Tell It on a Mountain is an interesting book in its own way. There\`s a picture in the cover that shows an event in the book. I is nice to have a picture to look back at when trying to imagine one of the scenes described in the book It may be even of great help to read the critics reviews on the back to have an idea of what kind of book it is and how it may be to your help or interest."},{"Title":"Go Tell it on the Mountain.","review":"Go Tell It On The Mountain is a very bold book. In an era when \\"Ebonics\\" had not been coined yet, when being black was not every white kids style, James Baldwin stayed so true to the African-American colloquialism. James Baldwin has written with complete truthfulness and self-questioning this parable of finding yourself, finding your belief, finding your God. Are these even different things, or is it one? It is this honesty which keeps you engrossed. Whether you'll end up loving this book or not probably depends on your personal equation with the Supreme Being, but what you will definitely admire and carry forward is his honesty, honesty about the lives of African-Americans, honesty which is also echoed in the language.Go Tell It On the Mountain is a biblical story of a youth dealing with his personal demons with regards to religion at an age where sin has not manifested itself in any form whatsoever in him. John finds himself in the difficult position of questioning his faith. John's mental turmoil in separating the men of god from god itself and paving a religious path for himself is very touching. This mirroring of thoughts which are timeless in nature, pulls you into the story. You find yourself questioning along with John, praying along with his mother Elizabeth and feeling betrayed by his father Gabriel.James Baldwin delves into each characters personal quest to achieve a place next to God. He frankly describes the African-American homes, the depth to which they are influenced by Christianity. So much so that at times you find it disconcerting. The two-facedness, the fake righteousness of the sanctified men makes you cringe with discomfort, followed by skepticism. Which is why, when John ends up being saved, I felt deceived. What brings about John's confirmation to the faith? Is it the hope to be freed from suffering that is passed on to him from generations? Is it to assuage the curiously skirted guilt of homosexuality? Could it have to do with the evangelist nature of African-American church services, where the charged up atmosphere, the childhood influences, the trance-like energy which may make one forget all inhibitions, insecurities and embrace that which is core to one and all, an eagerness to believe.That this is a story of a different era is not to be forgotten. The depth to which James Baldwin writes about the African-American psyche, their hope in being freed from their suffering, their expectant belief in their faith, gives you reason to half-heartedly agree to the biblical end to the story.This book, makes me curious of the role that guilt, fear and a hope for change, plays in bringing people closer to their god. Yes, signs of a true skeptic, but maybe in one of my trance-like states caused by certain unmentionable substances that might change and make me a believer.[...]."},{"Title":"Go Tell it on the Mountain.","review":"I am a 10th grader and was required to read this story for English. Although Mr. Baldwin used vivid imigery, it was extremely hard to follow, and seemed to skip around in time a lot. Also, this book was centered to much on Religion, nad not the characters. For anybody who is looking for a easy read this book is not a very good choice. To understand this book, it would be helpful to take your time while reading it and take notes on what you have read."},{"Title":"Go Tell it on the Mountain.","review":"As an author with my debut novel in its initial release, I hope to one day write a book with the depth of James Baldwin's GO TELL IT ON THE MOUNTAIN. We all have dreams, and that dream is one of mine. GO TELL IT ON THE MOUNTAIN is a multi-layered novel dealing with the African-American experience during and after the massive migration of African-Americans from the rural south to the urban north.

Here John is being raised, in a extremely religious environment, by a step-father who does care a whole lot about him, and puts added pressure on John by deciding that John become a &quot;God-fearing, hell-fire&quot; preacher like himself. His mother doesn't approve, but doesn't come to her son's rescue either. The step-father's own son is allowed to do as he pleases and nothing is said or done about it.

There are hidden parts of ourselves that are never revealed, even to those closest to us. Many of the characters in Baldwin's \\"Go tell it on the mountain\\" have similar secrets that are revealed only to the readers, as we gain insight into their innermost thoughts.The setting is Harlem, New York. The story opens with John, a young boy of fourteen who is at that age of great confusion in his life. He has a wild brother Roy, who is always getting in trouble, and eventually ends up getting stabbed. He has an abusive, self righteous father, Gabriel, a kind mother, Elizabeth, a boisterous aunt, Florence, and a spiritual role model named Elisha.John wanders the city in the first part of the novel, trying to come to grips with what he wants in life and who he wants to be. His family is very religious, and soon after his brother Roy is stabbed, they end up at their church one night. John, his mother, his father, Elisha, his aunt and two other sisters join together in prayer and worship. During this praising the book shifts focus first to Florence, who is deep in prayer and meditation, and we are carried back into her past. We learn of her failed marriage, her rocky relationship with her mother, and her inside hatred of her brother, which is John' father Gabriel. After we hear her thoughts and her story, the direction shifts focus to John's father, Gabriel. Gabriel ponders on his destructive life. In the early stages of his life Gabriel was deeply involved in sin until one day he is \\"born again\\" and becomes a preacher. We learn about how he marries a woman he does not love, commits adultery, and eventually remarries John's mother. All through this process of his flashbacks we learn the cruel hypocrite that he really is. The focus next shifts to John's mother, Elizabeth. We learn of her sorrow and heartbreak in dealing with the murder of John's real father. We learn of the struggle of her to live with her husband Gabriel, and his rejection of John. Gabriel gives John the title \\"bastard son\\", and cannot accept him.The story ends with a climax just as it began, as we are inside the head of John. As the praying and singing is going on, he is overtaken with emotion. He battles his inclination towards evil, and good tries desperately to enter into his hard heart. The final sequence is a poetic, magical scene of words. John conquers the battle inside of him in a desperate attempt to become \\"born again.\\"I love this book; it is without a doubt one of the best books I have ever read. The language is beautiful, Baldwin has masterful storytelling prose; he has great influence and power as an American writer. I never read a book that can deal with so many issues like slaver, racism, and abuse without being heavy handed, or ever staying from the powerful theme of the novel.I can't say enough about \\"Go tell it on the mountain.\\" It does everything right, and it does everything well. It is a flawless novel in every single aspect. Emotional, poetic, breathtaking, heartbreaking, vivid use of metaphors and language. The most powerful element in this novel is the human element. We care about the characters struggles, their victories, and their character. It is about real life, and the time period is described perfectly. I was never bored, always moved, and constantly in awe during the entire reading experience. Colossal in its vision, yet simple and unflinching in it's message. Brutally honest and never contrived into doing anything that deviates from the central core of the novel. This is one of the few novels I have read that does not fall short in any aspect of storytelling. \\"Go tell it to the mountain\\" will remain with you long after other classics fade into oblivion.Grade: A"},{"Title":"Go Tell it on the Mountain.","review":"&quot;Go Tell It On The Mountain&quot;, probably titled after the Negro Spiritual, was James Baldwin's first novel. Published in 1953, it tells the story of a fourteen year old boy, John Grimes. Part One, &quot;The Seventh Day&quot;, makes it known how John fights to bring into existence his self-identity while facing many obstacles. Keeping with societal times, one of the obstacles that Baldwin has John face is that of racism. It is the racism that John feels is keeping him from gaining all that society has to offer. In addition to facing obstacles outside of his home, he also is faced with familial problems. John is the son of Elizabeth and stepson of Gabriel. His biological father, Richard, committed suicide due to ridicule by white policemen. After Richard's death, Elizabeth slowly fell in love with Gabriel, a superficial, religious man, and the two of them parented three children. As an outsider of the &quot;family&quot;, John must try harder to fight the isolation he's feeling to become a part of the family. Because of Gabriel's beliefs, he felt that John was doomed or cursed and would not accept John for who he was.&quot;The Prayer of The Saints&quot;, Part Two of the novel, tells the stories of Florence, Gabriel, and Elizabeth; people all significant in John's life. Interspersed with stories of their pasts, each of these three are vital to John's development as they pray for his salvation. Florence's prayer centers around the anger she feels being a woman in a family dominated by men as well as the anger associated with racism. Although Florence became a very religious women deep in prayer, initially, she could not find any comfort in religion. Gabriel, a man anointed by God to preach first married Deborah, a young woman who was barren, was overtaken by the flesh while talking to a co-worker, Esther. Although he felt guilty and tried to repent for his sin, the conceived child died. After becoming a widower, Gabriel married Elizabeth and promised to provide a good family atmosphere for her and John. As time went by, Gabriel fell short of his promise, and although he and John attempted to work through their differences, they were both overcome by feelings of unworthiness. Although, long Part Two is well written and creative in the sense that the other saints are mentioned in someone else's prayer.Part Three, &quot;The Threshing Room Floor&quot; tells us how John receives the Holy Ghost, something he has been searching for, and is found in the middle of the &quot;threshing&quot; floor surrounded by saints. The reader is left wonder if, now saved, will John be accepted by Gabriel. Also, Baldwin used an excellent play on words by naming the church &quot;Temple of Fire Baptized&quot; because it is water or the blood of the lamb that baptizes and saves people from sin, not the fires often seen in hell.Although the book well-written, it was at times difficult to focus. This book is recommended to an avid reader, but not to one who is looking for &quot;a first novel to read&quot;. However, I believe that &quot;Go Tell It On The Mountain&quot; is a good book for someone to read if they are fighting with salvation and looking for acceptance in church."},{"Title":"Go Tell it on the Mountain.","review":"Go Tell It on the Mountain is James Baldwin at his best: fiery, passionate, tender and all-seeing. The novel is written so that three of the main characters get a chance to tell their own stories, which heightens the impact of the story of the boy John. There are many reasons why Baldwin is considered one of the greatest twentieth century American writers, and this is one of them."},{"Title":"Go Tell it on the Mountain.","review":"I felt such a connection in reading this book. All the sayings and the scripture quotings reminded me so much of my childhood and growing up in church and of my elder family members. I felt at one with John's experience. I could totally relate. I am in awe of Baldwin's writing. The metaphores and symbolisms were well placed. Some of the scene transitions could have been a little more seamless. I found myself a couple of times back tracking to understand if I was in the past or present. Character development was to a T.

Instead of the church being innovative, they separate themselves as though &quot;they are better&quot;. The churches are &quot;luke-warm&quot;.

Critically, many of Rudolph's buildings seemed to have stood equally between being famous and then also being infamous (his Menatal Health buiding at Boston's Government Center and his buildngs at UMass have had mixed reviews).

For sure, this isn't Grandad's Sherlock but I found the Great Detective remains true to his character, even through trauma and a bit of romance. Watson is not just a note taker in this either; he is an intelligent man of action with hints of more depth than we've seen in long time. Nice period setting with a lot of Victorian England touches.

It takes less skill to have someone hurt him and put him out of action than to show him using his reason to deduce the solution to a crime. It's so much more 'modern' to have him beaten, tortured, humiliated, and reduced to the same murderous level as the criminal. It also 'helps' if you have him swear and have at least one nude scene thrown in for good measure. (I might just help this wretched book's sales with that last statement, but trust me, there is nothing here worth spending the money on.)If this sort of thing amuses you, then you might want to read THE MONSTER OF ST.

Since it was marketed to Sherlock Holmes readers, I expected some resemblance between the plot / characters and the original Doyle works. Instead, I got overblown horror, a romance for Holmes, artificial dialogue, and basically a run of the mill horror story into which two unrecognizable characters named Holmes and Watson have been inserted. It might have been an OK horror book on its own, but it's misleading to market this book as any kind of continuation of or homage to the Sherlock Holmes series."},{"Title":"The Monster of St. Marylebone","review":"Wayne Worcester has completely missed the Sherlockian boat I'm afraid. Yes the book features two characters familiarly named Holmes and Watson, but neither of these fellows behave anything like Conan Doyle's timeless creations.

In deference to those who will read it, I'll not give away much of the plot here but wish to make some criticisms. Worcester not very subtly bludgeons Holmes for being a man of the 1890s and not the 1990s--he was a sexist instead of recognizing the equality of women. One of the main characters in the book is the widowed Mrs. Abigail Masterson, who comes to have something of a relationship with the Great Detective and who assists Holmes and Watson in solving the case. Worcester employed 1990s PC language in places, for example referring to Mrs. Masterson's &quot;gender&quot; rather than her &quot;sex&quot; (which is the word Conan Doyle used). There are some other less annoying moralizings from the author's 1990s perspective that also detract from what otherwise is not a bad story.Why is it that many modern pastiche writers feel compelled to judge Holmes and Watson from a late 1900s perspective and to interject strong female characters (sometimes having them romantically involved with Holmes), especially when these women are not consistent with the spirit of the Canon? Aren't the Holmes and Watson of the Canon good enough to stand on their own merits?"},{"Title":"The Monster of St. Marylebone","review":"If you seek characters and a story with fidelity to the Doyle canon, look elsewhere. Holmes here is dim and vulgar, missing many obvious clues up to the end. His conversations with Watson feature a late twentieth century emotional intimacy wholly foreign to the Victorian era.The plot is lurid and overly extended by improbable characters and happenings, including Holmes' remarkably consistent incompetence."},{"Title":"The Monster of St. Marylebone","review":"A fairly interesting story that's made less effective by the all-too-modern dialog that the author puts in the mouths of Holmes and Watson. He builds a believable image of this hidden horror lurking among London's upper class, and then shatters the mood with a line that would be more at home in Magnum P.I. than Sherlock Holmes. Maybe he was trying for an edgy, unvarnished tale, but it really doesn't work for me. There are a few other lapses, some already noted in other reviews, but this was one that kept bugging me. With some more work on this aspect of his storytelling, however, the authors future stories should be quite enjoyable.-Bryan"},{"Title":"My Bondage and My Freedom","review":"I agree with others in that this should be required reading for everyone. The picture of slavery that has been painted in other books is much niceer than what Frederick Douglass portrays. I tend to trust what he says more than what I have read by others because he lived through it. For example, he is very clear that married slave couples were regularly sold to separate owners.

Thank you, thank you, thank you."},{"Title":"My Bondage and My Freedom","review":"This book, not in complaint of Frederick Douglass' speech, was fairly boring. Its text is fairly small, and accompanied with approximately standard sized paper size I found I couldn't concentrate on finishing each page. The well educated, more language arts drived people I do reccomend to them buying this book because it is insightful. To you I warn that you should have a high level of concentration on reading and understanding his speech because it was written a long time ago when peoples speech was filled with what we would call grammatical errors(I.E. persons instead of people), which I find completely unnerving and losing my concentration on reading his great and insighful words that played a factor in interracial mingling."},{"Title":"My Bondage and My Freedom","review":"I cannot convey how highly I regard this book. My only regret is that I hadn't discovered it earlier. It may sound strange, but this book reminds me of the Bible in that it is narrative with moral commentary. He describes his life as a slave and intersperses it with the thoughts he had at the time and the thoughts he had currently as an adult after an accumulation of knowledge.The narrative is often intense. You feel for him and for what he sees. When he is hurt, you feel hurt; when he's angry, you feel angry; when he is hopeful, you feel his hope. You share his longing to escape and are disappointed when his attempts are thwarted. I often got choked up in parts of this book. While some of his slave masters were better than others, there are really no decent white people in the first 21 chapters. When he meets the abolitionists and visits Europe, decent white people show up and you can feel his (and even your) estimation of white people go up.This book often epitomizes the struggle between good and evil. The white slave masters represent conniving and tyrannical evil and our protagonist represents the good man, highly ethical and faithful to his dreams of overcoming oppression. I often could see ideas that would later show up in Martin Luther Kings writings and speeches. His experience of white people in Europe reminded me of Malcolm X's experience of white Muslims; in both cases their opinion of white people were elevated. One of the biggest surprises of this book was Douglass' humor. Often when I saw pictures of him, he appeared very stoic; this was far from reality. He often indulges in humor and even poignant sarcasm. His sarcasm impressed me because it is so like my own. I laughed and smiled when he would attack racism sarcastically.One further thing I think is worth pointing out in this book is the portrayal of religion. I had often thought that people who wear their Christianity on their sleeve are usually the biggest frauds. I've been a Christian for 11 years and I have not changed that view. Frederick Douglass describes the slave owners that appeared to be the most religious as the most abusive. This did not surprise me. I have always been suspicious of Christians that go out of their way to make their faith apparent. This book proved what I have always thought about religious pretensions.This book was a blessing to read. I had a difficult time putting it down. I am now looking forward to reading a collection of his speeches."},{"Title":"My Bondage and My Freedom","review":"Frederick Douglass' life story deserves to be read by every person on this earth - but NOT in this edition unless you are comparing editions. Oddly enough, when I access the info on my Kindle, the info page says \\"not currently available.\\" Yet here it is for free on my computer Amazon...go figure. But this better edition is free as well!Beginning of the 1845 edition, titled Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, also available on Kindle:\\"I was born in Tuckahoe, near Hillsborough, and about twelve miles from Easton, in Talbot County, Maryland. I have no accurate knowledge of my age, never having seen any authentic record containing it...I do not remember to have ever met a slave who could tell of his birthday.\\"Beginning of this 1855 edition, titled My Bondage and My Freedom\\"In Talbot county, Eastern Shore, Maryland, near Easton, the county town of that county, there is a small district of country, thinly populated, and remarkable for nothing that I know of more than for the worn-out, sandy, desert-like appearance of its soil, the general dilapidation of its farms and fences, the indigent and spiritless character of its inhabitants, and the prevalence of ague and fever.\\"In Garrison's introduction to the 1845 edition, several autobiographical writings by Douglass are mentioned. This one's not awful, but Douglass obviously changed his style significantly in this ten-year period and his approach to telling his life story, unless the editor has required changes...perhaps he tailored them to a changing readership as the conflict over slavery and possible secession grew more intense.I much prefer the directness of the 1845 edition - right into the story.You be the judge.Why doesn't Amazon separate reviews according to edition so that you can tell what edition is being reviewed? At least the titles here are different - but often that's not the case and you have to paw through lots of reviews to find one that actually reviews the edition, in addition to reviewing the work itself."},{"Title":"My Bondage and My Freedom","review":"Frederick Douglass' command of the English language and his emotional appeal to reason are at the highest levels in My Bondage and My Freedom. Frederick Douglass' account of his life as a slave is chilling and shocking. To think that such a cruel, dark and evil slave system could have existed in the land of the free is laughable if it were not so very true. Frederick brings to light every damning fact about slavery in My Bondage and My Freedom. This novel should be read by every US citizen so that they might clearly understand what African Americans experienced as slaves and so that it may never be forgotten."},{"Title":"My Bondage and My Freedom","review":"Really deepens your understanding of what it was like to be a slave.

This contemporaneous account of some of the nation's most excruciating growing pains is difficult (emotionally) to read, but critical to getting a grip on what the USA is now and from whence we came.This is a powerful, important work."},{"Title":"My Bondage and My Freedom","review":"Fredrick Douglass was an important figure in the fight against slavery and just as deserving of a movie as Abe Lincoln.

What would you say about Douglass observation that &quot;conscience cannot stand much violence? Do you think it was possible to be a good slave owner?Why or why not?

Why do you think the white children's attitude toward slavery is different from that of their parents? How would you describe Douglass attitude towards Mrs. Auld?"},{"Title":"My Bondage and My Freedom","review":"Standing in line at the Lincoln Memorial, a book beckoned to me that I previously hadn't seen before. The face of Frederick Douglas grabbed my attention; a man that I've respected for many years, encountering him mainly through my study of Abraham Lincoln. On the spur of the moment, I snatched up a copy of &quot;My Bondage and My Freedom&quot;, and within a few days, my admiration in Frederick Douglass was transformed from interest to awe.Frederick Douglass orginially penned his book as a response to people's accusations that someone as articulate and composed as he couldn't possibly be a former slave. With that goal in mind, Douglass wrote his memoirs, in a straight forward, powerful way. In the book, he painfully and honestly documents the path his early life took; the memories of being owned, how slaves coped during these times, and how he managed to pull himself out of it all.While Douglass' life in itself is amazing, (as he describes the amazing process he undertook to learn how to read), what amazed me even more are Douglass' discourses that he sprinkles through the book, discussing relevant issues during the time. In one instance, he addresses the concern about why slaves simply didn't run away from their oppressive situations. It's almost as if you can actually hear the people talking to Douglass and he responding to them.This book does not only tell the tale of a truly amazing American, but gives us a unique insight to the times. This book should be required reading in every high school in this country."},{"Title":"My Bondage and My Freedom","review":"Having read a biography of Douglass many years ago, I thought I knew his story. Hearing through his pen was an entirely different matter. What a master of the language and insighful set of observations on human nature.I am a man of many words, but words fail me in my endorsement of this book. The letter to his former master in the appendix is worth the price of the book by itself."},{"Title":"My Bondage and My Freedom","review":"My Bondage and My Freedom, one of Douglass' several autobiographies, a very important book that should be read by anyone interested in United States history generally, or the crucial and often tragic role race has played in that history. Douglass, a former slave, was one of the few African-Americans who achieved prominence in the largely white, new england abolition movement. Douglass was an eloquent writer and (by historical accounts) speaker. His recounting of his experience as a slave, and his reflections on his role as a black former slave in America, are powerful."},{"Title":"My Bondage and My Freedom","review":"Historians often call the Civil War the first modern war, a precursor to the great battlefield slaughterhouses of the twentieth century. Frederick Douglass shows that America was also first to invent the totalitarian police state. It's hard to believe Stalin didn't have MY BONDAGE AND MY FREEDOM prominently positioned on his bookshelf for frequent consultation because the Soviet system of oppression had so much in common with the system of oppression in the American South. The only significant difference was that, in the Soviet system, absolute power was vested in Stalin; in the American system, absolute power was vested in each slavemaster. Each slavemaster was, in essence, a little Stalin, with life and death power over his slave property.The slave system rigorously withheld news and information from slaves. A slave often would not know his father or even his own date of birth. He could not lawfully learn to read. He could not travel without written authorization. He could not associate freely with other slaves. He could not safely trust anyone or confide his private thoughts to anyone because planted informers were so numerous. Slaves had to avoid even certain thoughts for fear the slavemaster would see in their facial expressions what was in their minds.Disguised slave catchers would sometimes help and encourage a slave to escape, only to capture him for the reward. The slavemaster demanded and enforced absolute, immediate, and unquestioned subservience through fear, a liberal use of the lash and the constant threat of transferring a recalcitrant slave to an even harsher labor camp in the deep South.Yet MY BONDAGE AND MY FREEDOM is by no means a depressing book, thanks to Douglass' irrepressible courage, wit, spirit and good luck when he most needed it. There are even a few intentionally hilarious moments, which I won't give away in this review.To avoid capture after his escape to the North, Douglass used the fees from his speeches in Great Britain and royalties from his book sales to legally buy his own freedom from his Maryland owner.The book covers a period of American history I knew little about, the period between the War of 1812 and the Civil War. I didn't know, for example, that the abolition movement early in that period favored secession from the United States on the belief that the Constitution favored the South and backed to the hilt the slave system. An excellent recent book that supports that view is SLAVERY'S CONSTITUTION by David Waldstreicher.Even though Douglass was a religious, believing Christian, he leveled his most scathing criticism at the way Southerners used Christianity to justify and advance the slave system. He often noted that the cruelest slave masters were also credited as the most religious members of their communities. Some of the worst even had \\"Rev.\\" attached to their names. The only slavemaster Douglass credited with relative decency and kindness also happened to be an atheist."},{"Title":"My Bondage and My Freedom","review":"I have to be honest, I never knew that Frederick Douglass published another volume of his autobiography. I foolishly believed that A Narrative in the Life of Frederick Douglass was his only book regarding is life as a slave and his life as a free man. I was so wrong. Sometimes I wonder how many other people still believe as I once did...My Bondage and My Freedom is an exceptional example of auto-biographical writing. Douglass' mastery of the English language is superb! In reading his story and the way he's able to describe his past as a young boy, raised by his grandmother and then sent to begin working, with little knowledge beforehand that he was in fact a slave was so eye-opening. I had no idea that some children, raised during this time were actually allowed to be child for a few precious years before they were introduced to the vile world of slavery.This book give such a detailed account of a man's struggle to unleash the genius kept constrained by the world into which he was born and raised, is just amazing. I'm still astounded by him even though it's been some time since I finished the book. While a majority of the book describes his life as a young boy and slave (told in the My Bondage section), the rest of the book (My Freedom) tells of his life after he escaped from slavery, his experiences given lectures against slavery, his time abroad in other countries where he was treated as a human being and not as a piece of property and then of his struggles to create and manage his own newspaper once he returns to the United States.The appendix is also a treasure, as it reprints many of his speeches and lectures on the injustice against humanity that was the slavery system. A Narrative in the Life of Frederick Douglass is one of my all time favorite books and I find that My Bondage and My Freedom is definitely a worthy companion, especially if you are looking for a deeper understanding of the life of Frederick Douglass.One thing that was missing and that I would love to come across one day, is his writing on his actual escape from slavery, as it is never fully explained in this book. As a reader you only know that he planned it and obviously executed his daring escape with help from others. That would really be a treat..."},{"Title":"My Bondage and My Freedom","review":"Douglass's second, and lengthier, narrative fills in many of the gaps left in his first autobiography: we learn about his mother, his siblings, and more details about his psychological transformation from brute to man. It's quite insightful, as Douglass is careful to relate each of his personal experiences to the innate evil of the peculiar instituition, for both the slave and the slave holder."},{"Title":"My Bondage and My Freedom","review":"An amazing account by an incredible person. No need to elaborate on others' reviews of the book itself.However, the Kindle edition is missing hymns, poems, and songs that Douglass quoted (for example, see section [141] quoting the poet Whittier, and the \\"juba\\" song example after section [195]... compare with a paper edition or the e-book on Google books). I started noticing this half-way through the Kindle book, so I don't know what else is missing that I already passed over. I guess I can't complain too much given that the Kindle version is free, but readers should know that it is not a complete version of the book."},{"Title":"My Bondage and My Freedom","review":"I downloaded this to my kindle only because I knew the name from reading about Abraham Lincoln and thought it might be interesting.It went beyond interesting and into the realm of unforgetable.Why wasn't/isn't this book required reading in school?There's not a lot to say, it's a free download for your kindle..

I felt uneasy as to know what my great, great, great, great grandmother, or grandfather lived through. The book was written by Fredrick Bailey, who changed his name to Fredrick Douglas. I saw everything through his eyes, felt everything he felt as if it was me, I could not put this book down. I felt anguish, disgust, hurt, and despair to know first hand what happen to a slave, then a free man, not a made up actor in a book. I also felt vindicated once he was free I felt free, I am glad that the pursuit of an education was his priority or else we could not have read this from his words to describe something that we can never imagine, see, or describe. The evil that existed, were inhumane, but the legacy Fredrick Douglas has left let us know that GOD, wisdom, and the pursuit of education can make us all free, I would give this book a thousand stars, for the clarity, and non-fiction in the book, and to give us insight to not what only took place in Maryland, but to also describe the deep Southern States.

Drakulic's attention to the impact of big events on small things, like toilet paper, makeup, and pizza, makes for a startlingly up-close examination of life in post-communist eastern Europe. Ever since that history class, this book has been a touchstone for me. I've passed it along to friends and to both of my parents. It insists that you rethink your ideas about what's &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; for feminism, and focuses your attention on the connection between the political, the material, and femininity. Fascinating, wonderfully written, a must-read. I've learned my lesson about lending out my copy...my best friend moved to Texas and took it with her. Of course I must buy another...I just can't be without this book."},{"Title":"How We Survived Communism and Even Laughed","review":"This book is a reality check and an eye-opener to a lot of people, I've asked several of my friends to read it. My mom and I both cried when we read it. My mom's family is from eastern Europe and I had only heard little bits and pieces of stories from my grandma. This book helped me see things a lot better. If you have any interest in eastern European culture, history or the modern history of feminism and human rights, and you like reading about more personal accounts, then this would be a good book to read. Because of the cold war and American/Western attitudes towards this area of the world (whether those are right or not is another story for another book), there is a lot that happened that we don't know about during this time period. It's interesting to see things from a different POV and Slavenka does a great job showing us what it was like to be there."},{"Title":"How We Survived Communism and Even Laughed","review":"I will read this eye-opening book again and again.

As the years go by, Soviet Times with probably become a more romantic time, like \\"The good ole days\\", which often were not all that good. Anyway, if you want a good taste of that era, this book is good reference."},{"Title":"How We Survived Communism and Even Laughed","review":"Slavenka Drakulic created a book that's candid, poignant and intelligent. She wrote this book as if she'd opened her brain and heart, and allowed all the noise to come tumbling out. It was written during a time of great change in the formerly Eastern Bloc countries, and even as it was being published her circumstances, and those of her fellow Croats, were in flux. So don't expect a book written with the most current perspective. Instead, look at this as a truly revealing view of what many women in that part of the world had to deal with. While there may be some who had no shortages, or very few, this was her personal perspective and very much aligned with what I have heard from women in the former Soviet Union and East Berlin.I recently spoke with a young woman who grew up under the communist era in Slovakia, and she told us that it was understood that anyone - even your favorite uncle or your sister - could well be spying on you and reporting you to authorities, in exchange for favors by the party. She said that this was one of the things they had to 'get over' when the changeover happened - that basic mistrust that predominates. She took shortages for granted because that was what it was like when she was growing up - but for someone who had some other experiences, this would have been difficult. To be decades behind the rest of Europe with some of the things we take for granted like sanitary products must have been so frustrating. Much of Europe is actually ahead of the US in those products - as i learned when i lived in Italy for 6 months in the 70s. They actually had better personal products than WE did. So much for that old American superiority complex.The author Slavenka's comments about how, now that they lived with such shortages, it's hard to see what we waste here - this is very valid and while it's 'just the way it is' in the USA, I believe that businesses like Second Harvest are fighting the waste all the time, as they figure out ways to help feed the growing number of people in the US who are short of food and other necessities."},{"Title":"How We Survived Communism and Even Laughed","review":"This is a books of essays written by a Yugoslav journalist about the day-to-day pragmatic aspects of being a woman in the Communist regime.Outspokenly non-academic, she pains visual imagery to give one a new paradigm of what it really was like. No tampons or sanitary napkins; plastic bags collected over decades that rival an anthropological treatise on economy; shopping; need. How can 'ecology' be used to explain why one should not have when one is living in a third world country and could not attain something in any case - - fur coats, lipstick, clothing, etc.A feminist, she examines the politics of oppression from a calm, measured and bull's eye perspective, from the soup bowls to the meaning of soup to sharing intimacies and constancies of life for and among women. She compares East to West and laughs at the pretentious academics who think they can analyze women's roles and place in pre-revolutionary communism from and analytic and critical perspective or a Western vantage point.This is a good book for anyone interested in what it was like to be a woman in communist Russia."},{"Title":"How We Survived Communism and Even Laughed","review":"Book was in the condition that they described and came to me in a timely fashion."},{"Title":"How We Survived Communism and Even Laughed","review":"This collection of essays on life under Communism in Eastern Europe provides a unique perspective on the failure of the Communist system. Particularly memorable anecdotes include the author's misgivings over buying her daughter a Barbie doll and the actions and behaviors which became commonplace in a society in which (and this is emphasized) everyone lived in moderate to extreme poverty.It is extremely difficult to find any personal narratives concerning Communism which are more or less politically unbiased. The author of this work seems to hold a sort of nOSTalgia for the days under Communism as a time of equality, even though this equality set the standards of living extremely low. The perspective of which this book comes from seems to be predominantly a feminist, as opposed to left or right wing, perspective, making for an enlightening read.The bare bones downfalls of Communism are extrapolated and explored with an eye and mind which rarely condemns Communism, but rather identifies problems with an air of disappointment. The most striking shortcoming is the lack of tampons or alternatives, demonstrating the government's inability to deal with even the most basic needs of the female population.I recommend this book as a valuable primary source for the study of the Eastern Bloc, the disinitigration of the European Communist regimes, and for a feminist perspective on some of the most glaring political issues of the 20th century."},{"Title":"How We Survived Communism and Even Laughed","review":"I have read Drakulic's later book Balken Express, and thought this book far better. Drakulic's book is a series of essays about the difficulty of life in Eastern Europe from a woman's perspective. Communism collasped because it could not satisfy the demands of the population. Drakulic details many of those shortcomings in her book. Not only did Communism produce poor paint and bad toilet paper, it did not even produce tampons or other products for women. That is why Communism failed. Few history books will detail this perspective, but from a humanistic point of view, it is true.The other perspective Drakulic tries to point out is that of a journalist pointing to the failures of both Communist and Western society. Drakulic portrays the homeless of NYC with the fact that in Communist society everybody is poor but not homeless. These perspectives are needed as well, because some aspects of Communism were indeed noble.A good book about the failure of Communism. This book was a short informative read about a doomed political system."},{"Title":"How We Survived Communism and Even Laughed","review":"what can you say about a book? it came on time in good condition."},{"Title":"How We Survived Communism and Even Laughed","review":"This book is written in interesting bases, but I have to say that It's sad that so many people nowadays try to change this nation into communist or socialism ( same role, just different name) not really knowing the truth, just based on some political ideology that human history had repeatedly proved to be failed. In fact communism is the worst political system that ever presented on earth. Because of its brutality, I escaped from that regime. And I am happy to be in this country where human freedom is mostly respected, and protected. Communist lies saying every one shares equally: In fact only, those few comrades who caused the shift of power enjoy the wealth and power, but the rest of the general citizens have no equality nor basic human right. Any one speak against government---disappear next day to \\"concentration camp\\" w/o fair trials nor justice. Communist shut down all religious freedom, or freedom of speech ( all medias are government controlled) Communists deny any form of gods but instead, they set the status of Stalin or Ma chiding, or Kimjung ill, and have to sing songs and salute for them, worship them. From elementary children to elders... Anyone dares to go against the government, ---labor camp! Several millions who stand for their freedom were killed brutally in early 20th century, during the communism overturn.1989, Tinamen square, a million chines college students marched to protest against their communist government of oppression: it was broadcasted all over the world, they were asking communist government to give them ;freedom for speech, freedom of media, business, religion, true-democracy ( not like few communist party people controlling, governing) but by election. Sooner the communist government sent them tanks and guns and indiscriminately shoot them and ran over with tanks. Whole world watched through television broadcast and shocked by their brutality. There is no \\"equal Justice\\" like the communist ideologist deceives people. Only \\"Elite Party Comrades\\" have the privileges of special health care, food market for themselves only, supply stores for them only, but the rest of the citizens live in dirt poor situation deprived from basic human rights. It's just a power shift from have to have not. Maybe somebody should arrange some \\"exchange living tourism\\" between these communist countries and America, Send those \\"Deceived communism lovers\\" to live in those communist countries for a year or two years by themselves without any privileges as American, but just as like their citizen, then maybe all these communism, socialism, totalitarian movement in American will learn the true lessons of the reality, and waken up. Also, reading the books by real defects form those communist countries will give real ideas, not just full of bologna, lying ideology (theory) books out there.Now some ignorant Americans already forgot about this just 20 years ago's brutality that we watched with our own eyes, want to change this great nation into communist?Please study the real history. I mean the \\"real history\\" not just that stupid \\"ideology of communist\\". In a word, if you study the true history, communist repeatedly failed last 150 years.and it's the most evil regime in the history. Why?: Stalin communist government killed 90 millions including the vicinity nations that were turn into communism, Macho-tong communist killed 100 millions, 2 millions by North Korea, by Cambodia each, 2 millions in Africa, 200,000 latin America..so on . But most of all they all became terribly poor after communist regime,oppressing the free capitalism, except China, because they started to adapt the partial capitalism from 10 years ago after they realized the harsh economic state. Now history tells also other totalitarianistic evil regime; Hitler killed 6 million jew with other 4 million of Europeans; Japan' imperialism killed 20 million Asians during WWII, ..so on.When communism and socialism oppress people's creativity and force them to work for \\"common Good\\", the productivity drops automatically. Why? men were not made to work for Common good. Maybe some aliens from different planet or maybe Jesus will do for common good. But not men's nature. That's why communism make every one poorer and poorer from their establishments throughout the history. When men get prosperous by working w their hards, with their creativity, they eventually help others if they are normal. because normal people appreciate God's wisdom of love and peace. But if the much power goes to God-hating communist, socialists or totalitarianistic government, you will see the corruption everywhere in their regime, instead of trying to help others or common good. Because they basically don't know, or appreciate God's wisdom of love and peace for all, they will fully manifest their selfishness and brutality filling only their throats. Why? that's the human nature w/o god. Human nature could be most brutal and selfish if they don't learn the true love from the creator as history repeatedly teach us.Men can't govern themselves.They are naturally selfish, greedy and evil w/o god. If any political party, government have too much power, they will certainly hurt others unless they truly know jesus who always teach love and peace. That's why our America's constitution is truly great, because it was written by the God's fairness and wisdom protecting basic human rights that is originally from God , over any political unbalance. I realized only those who hate God fall into these\\"denying the constitution, or \\"let's change it \\"theory saying they are too old or whatever nonsense. Too old constitution? Then why the whole world always look upon America when it comes, most well practiced freedom and human right? Please have reasons.If USA turned into communism, the power will shift to only those who hate the existing American system. They secretly controlling medias ( I already see it happened ) and brainwashing the youth with distorted facts in textbooks last 20 years. They keep change their names, their activity, and theory. Why? if they openly speak up, they know they will fail because any normal mind people will see the deception and its perversion. Look at these behind scenes of the head members. They are not normal mind, full of hatred, and causing always divisions, manipulations. Sadly this government & Geroge Soro' socialic, communistic, riots causing union leaders, hired many \\"paid bloggers from 4 years ago intensively promoting public hatreds & division. Real sad thing is most American publics are so ignorant, not knowing the behind scenes, get brain wash step by step through facebook, twitters, googles' net traffic.Many good people's web site had been already blocked from public access from 2010.Do u know who r the major donors to all the ivy league schools in America? Middle Eastern Islamic terrorists sponsoring extremists. We pour our oil money into these middle eastern countries, these islamic extremists trains terrorists w our money, sending back to USA to brain wash college kids, funding mosques, from 1960' pouring into American textbook committees to distort our history, fanning the Anti-america propaganda w socialists, communism movementtogether to destroy this great nation, but Americans are sleeping. While these trillion's forein oil money are eating up our nation, last prolong Democratic congress, government prohibit our own oil production saying \\"environmental protection\\". no wonder our debt is no more controllable. To any nation to be strong, they have to have their own supply of power sources. Get it? Can't go on with debts, especially to middle east. Though we fully develop all forms of green energy,it is still less than 50% of our energy sources. Before polar bears or dolphins, we are getting total broke, can't even protect them from international slaughters. Please think people & wake up from those hired bloggers & medias who were own by few extreme liberal bosses.Collect the real historic facts, separate from the author's propaganda. Lineup the real facts, then you will see the history more accurately. Always develop the \\"reasoning power\\" of your own this way, not swayed by many false propagandas in most books, medias out there. If you don't have your own reasoning power, you will be always vulnerable and get deceived.Interestingly always angry, poor people seem becoming the front line of deceived victims of these evil ideology. So instead, ask God to enlighten your heart to live with love and peace& goodness with others and ask your personal blessing instead of trying to destroy others who seems have.If you believe somebody or some classes hurt your people, look at this. Bible says: forgive your enemy, don't live with your past: Don't covet your neighbors: work diligently on your own hands so you don't steal, become a burden to others. And lastly, love your neighbors as yourself. Then you will live in the true blessing of God, the creator.Robbing others' or violance, riots r not the answers. God wants us to be : good, righteous, & truthful. Those citizens of china and all the other communist countries, including north koreaa, who are brutally oppressed in the middle Eastern Islam tyrannies still wants their human freedom with the destruction of the oppressing totalitarianistic regime still today. So why move to backward of mistakes people?"},{"Title":"How We Survived Communism and Even Laughed","review":"Slavenka explores the perplexing lives of Eastern European women living in Communism through her short essays. There is nothing funny about these stories. The author displays how Communism failed its people, and how it failed its women. A visit to Yugoslavia in the 1980's, opened my eyes to the trials these women faced. I lived like these women. I brought with me stockpiles of medicine, sanitary napkins, soap and detergent. These items were impossible to buy and if you could find these items they were outrageously expensive. I washed my clothes by hand, scrubbed them in the basins Slavenka talks about. I walked around with the same fear, the same hopelessness for the future. Live for today, survive today. No bother to worry about tomorrow. This book should be a part of all woman studies programs, it gives insight to the lives of women living in Eastern Block countries. It gives insights to the trials they face and the fear of the future that goes along with it."},{"Title":"How We Survived Communism and Even Laughed","review":"I would have given this book three and a half stars if I had the option; but I don't, so I am giving it four, all on account of its good narrative and occasional wit.I keep hearing and reading about what an &quot;eye-opener&quot; this book has been for readers in Western countries. That is all well and fine; many of the things she describes are valid information.The problem is that this book, by empathizing (and rightly so) with the everday noodle-and-darning plight of &quot;sisters&quot; in other so-called Communist regimes (all of whom had a MUCH harder time than we in the former Yugoslavia ever did) tends to blur not only the HUGE political and social nuances and distinctions among the various &quot;Communist&quot; countries, but also inside ex-Yugoslavia itself. In short, the so-called Communist &quot;block&quot; was never really a &quot;block&quot; - it was a tapestry of many nuances and textures, depending on the country.Admittedly, I belong to a different generation than Ms. Drakuli. Furthermore, I was born and grew up in the northern part of the country, called Slovenia (now, an independent state), which was, incidentally, the &quot;richest&quot; part of Yugoslavia. (And BTW: I don't recall any of her interlocutors in the book being a Slovene... Why not? Maybe because the situation in Slovenia wouldn't fit in with the utterly dismal picture that she is painting?)Here are some facts: often, there were (usually short-term) shortages of different things: sugar, bananas, chocolate, detergent... I even remember a shortage of toilet paper, once. But never all at the same time, and never for very long. We never queued, like the unfortunate peoples of the Soviet satellite states. I for one DID have dolls, very pretty ones (no, NOT rag dolls) - 18 of them! If there ever was a shortage of tampons (I never use them), I certainly don't remember any shortage of sanitary towels. We were always nicely dressed and made-up; and if the clothes on offer in our own country didn't suit us, we'd make a 2 hour trip to nearby Italy, where we could buy more trendy attire. (Nobody in my family ever did that, BTW.)No, I am not one of those short-memoried &quot;nostalgics&quot; who mourn the demise of the Titoist regime and the fallacy of the infamous &quot;unity &amp; fraternity&quot; slogans of those days... In fact, I did every thing that I could to help erode it and bring it down.I just resent history - ANY history - being &quot;tailored&quot; to suit the prefabricated expectations of foreign readers.Had Ms. Drakuli decided to include a &quot;girl talk&quot; with a Slovene or two - who were even her &quot;compatriots&quot; in those times, after all - a picture slightly more complex would emerge. And maybe then people elsewhere wouldn't have been surprised by the news that Yugoslavia was falling apart... It already WAS - always had been - several different countries within one artificial structure.In short: enjoy this book, for it tells the truth - and it tells it well! Just not the ENTIRE truth."},{"Title":"How We Survived Communism and Even Laughed","review":"Drakulic is a journalist by trade, and as such has a no-nonsense writing style: stark, factual. She interviewed women of various countries and captured stories of what they endured mentally and physically under communist rule. This is one of my favorite books, one I will read again and again, and which I have given copies of to my friends."},{"Title":"How We Survived Communism and Even Laughed","review":"I read this book while I was living in Prague. Living in Eastern Europe does not automatically ensure an understanding of the people or the culture, and this book was very helpful. The position of women in Eastern Europe (and of course, the world over) is consistently marginalized, so this book is important in that it finally brings the woman's perspective and experience in Eastern Europe out into the open.The other thing that makes this book extremely worthwhile is that it continues to bring home the difference between Eastern Europe and the West. As a woman from the US, it was impossible for me to conceive of and understand these women's experiences, and where those experiences have brought them today. It becomes very easy, in the interests of simplification, to essentialize the experiences of all european women, or all white women. This book shows us that it is not that simple, or easy, or fair, to do so."},{"Title":"How We Survived Communism and Even Laughed","review":"In my opinion, Ms. Drakulic did exaggerate some things related to Yugoslavia (now abstract and gone). I guess this was done for the sake of keeping readers animated and interested in finishing the book. I do agree with the reader from Slovenia, as I was also born in the former Yugoslavia. Yes, we did occasionally have shortage of some items in the 80's, but not to the extent it was presented in this book. Not even close to her book \\"Cafe Europa\\", in terms of being informative about the Eastern Block (Warsaw Pact) countries, which by the way, Yugoslavia was never part of. This book will make readers, unfamiliar with the Eastern Europe, think just that."},{"Title":"How We Survived Communism and Even Laughed","review":"A fascinating collection of poignant vignettes on being a woman in communist Yugoslavia (with stories of the author's friends and acquaintances in other Eastern European countries.) Ms. Drakulic shares with the West the reasons whereby 40-plus years of communist-engendered habits and viewpoints and tendencies cannot undergo an overnight &quot;attitude adjustment&quot;. This book is a must for anyone who seeks to begin to sympathize and understand the thoughts and roots of people (especially women) who were born and raised in Eastern Europe. I bulldozed through it, and am now reading her &quot;Cafe Europa&quot;. Eye-opening!"},{"Title":"How We Survived Communism and Even Laughed","review":"Slavenka Drakulic's writings are to be savored. Read her collections of essays in chronological order. She is amazingly perceptive and her ideas evolve with every new year of experience."},{"Title":"How We Survived Communism and Even Laughed","review":"I have grown up under communism in Czechoslovakia, and was excited to read this book.The book started slow and the writing was choppy and un-engaging. I was surprised that the first pages were full of bitterness, negativism, and self obsession. I have diligently dragged my feet thorough the initial muck in hopes for a memoir style telling. I couldn't wait to read about all the illogical things I have witnessed my self but couldn't word clearly enough to put in a book. I found those stories... \\"200%\\" exaggerated, out of context, full of negativism and body image obsession. The book is a big disappointment. Here is why in detail:My first issue with this book is that it is not dated. None of the events are approximated to certain time frame. So when S.D talks about her travels I'm never sure if she talks about the time of my granny's youth (1945s) My mom's youth (1970s) or my own childhood time (1980s).My related second problem with this book is that her narrative is based on short stories in the life of her family and friends, in different time frames not chronologically organized. So it is difficult for the reader to determine correct timeframe.Why is the timeframe such a big issue? If I write about the shortages of certain things, I must also account for the item's availability elsewhere at that time. In post 2 W.War era, there were shortages everywhere. So to rave about the lack of choices in perfumes, or lipstick colors when there were shortages everywhere is a form of deception.Another issue was her outlook, or if you may the spirit with which this was written. I believe the author meant to ridicule and discredit communism as a whole based on the lack of consumer choices. This approach is simplistic and short sited. She for ever stresses the lack of diversity in manufactured goods and the importance of body image. S.D makes a point to ridicule those who wear out of style makeup or cloths, while at the same time she looks down on those who follow magazine fashions with sew-it-your-self-at-home imitations of said fashions. Her approach is shallow and shows lack of understanding.I would like to correct some misconceptions from the book:Though it is true that many things were made in limited diversity, their price made them affordable for everyone. A pair of winter boots w. rabbit fur cost today's equivalent of whooping $15, basic flats run around $8. There were about 20 designs available at any one time. My mom had her hair colored and curled regularly since her 20s. There were 8 different color choices readily available anywhere. There was a full pallet of eye shadows and lipstick colors. If Polish women wore red hair it is because their hair on average is dark brown or black (often previously died mahogany to enhance the shade and to make them shine in sunlight). It does not take a chem. genius to figure out, that their hair would not go fully blond no matter how much peroxide they used or how much they pinned for blond, (as was the fashion obsession at the time).The trade women that sold stuff in Yugoslavia, and then exchanged thus gained currency in Czechoslovakia or Poland, had a specific nick name 'vekslak'. It implies a dishonest person intent to gain in excess through little or no work. Those women were more often then not gipsies, and were just as often incarcerated for being a burden on the state or other criminal activities. In other words, everyone had the right to have a job. Everyone had a duty to go to work. Those who skipped work were not only an embarrassment to their families, but were committing felony. Also and more importantly, being a 'vekslak' or vagrant was often the gateway crime. Once you got on the shady side, redistribution of stolen property, prostitution, drugs, smuggling or robbery were often part of the 'occupation'. To speak so fondly and with such pity of people who were considered the scum of society shows lack of understanding.And here is THE BIG QUESTION: Why should we condemn communism based on such shallow crimes such as lack of quality toilet paper? I'm not sure how to answer this one. If this was a humorous book, I could laugh about the ridiculousness of such regime, and know it is good it is just a memory now. But it has the feel of Shakespearian drama, without the smooth writing. S.D does not give the reader a single positive thing that made lives of the citizens of communist countries better. Such as free schooling, free daycare, free school books, free medical care, retirement at 50, guaranteed jobs, free housing (apartments with low rents) free summer camps for kids (or priced at today's equivalent of $40 for 3 weeks stay).... there are many things that were centered on improving the life of a family as it was considered THE nucleus on which the state is build. On the other hand S.D fails to mention the political suitability tests, where a little child's single out of the crowd clap for president's speech could put 'unsuitable' on its political profile, that would prevent it from studying for the occupation of it's dreams. There is nothing about persecution and incarceration of religious representatives (Priests) and their family members, of writers, thinkers, or those whose family member emigrated behind the iron curtain. There is absolutely no food for thought, be it positive or negative.This book is a shallow mish-mush of S.D. life, views and opinions without reliable references, or the truly important events that mattered to women under communism. I have never seen my granny worrying about the lack of eye shadow choices, she worried about earning enough money to support 3 children with her husband loosing his legs in work related train accident. And even though she had hard manual job, her appearance was always flawless. With makeup and tailored dresses and suits (home made) she looked smart, and attractive. She was also 6F tall and very strong not just physically but also mentally. She was the matriarch of our family. She also was the living, breathing representation of the poster girl for the communist's ideal of perfect womanhood; beautiful, efficient, strong, productive. But in no way has she EVER resembled this image S.D draws for us, this drab, overworked, over-weight, bla-bla woman, with McDonald's red hair, wild colored, ill fitting cloths and obsession of self.Summed up, it makes me wonder if S.D. ever truly lived under communism, for any prolonged period of time."},{"Title":"How We Survived Communism and Even Laughed","review":"This book is a poignant portrait of personal resistance to the hardships of the Communist era. It was required reading in graduate school, so I expected it to be informative, but it is so much more than that. It makes the reader question not only the Communist regimes of the not-so-distant past, but also one's very notion of what femininity and feminism are. Drakulic tells these personal stories with humor and empathy. Unlike many \\"feminist\\" books, it's actually accessible to men, maybe because of the quotidien details that make each story so real. I've had overnight guests pick it up to read themselves to sleep and then find themselves still up late into the night because they can't put the book down!"},{"Title":"How We Survived Communism and Even Laughed","review":"This is not a great book. This is a pretty good book. It is an interesting book, but not an important book. Slavenka Drakulic, itinerant Croatian writer, gives us communism on the ground. There are no ideological struggles here, no discussions of the finer points of Marxist theology. Instead Drakulic demonstrates clearly that communism is empty, that it failed its citizens, its leaders, and itself. Forty-five years of communist leadership in Yugoslavia failed to produce livable apartments, affordable telephones, sanitary products for women, dolls for children. In short, communism failed because all along it was a massive shell game where the party members were haves and everyone else were have-nots. It failed because it generated fear instead of happiness.Worse, communism continues. We in the West like to use 1990 as a pushpin year for &quot;the end of communism&quot;, but Drakulic demonstrates that communism thrives, if not in the government ministries of eastern Europe, then in the hearts and minds and habits and fears of its inhabitants. The funereal atmosphere in Zagreb as Croatia held its first democratic elections in decades, the compulsive hoarding by a populace made wary by the unreliability of supplies of staples and everyday products, the resignation to lives no better than those of parents and grandparents. These sensibilities endure in eastern Europe, and they probably will go on for decades until a younger generation with no memory of communist economic planning and political oversight steps to the fore. &quot;The end of communism is still remote because communism, more than a political ideology or a method of government, is a state of mind.&quot;Finally, Drakulic shows us that the &quot;trivial is political&quot;. That communism has successfully achieved it aim of raising the political consciousness of the masses, for when trivial acts such as buying toilet paper and making a phone call are made contingent on political decisions by faceless, scary bureaucrats in forbidding buildings, then every act and every person becomes politicized. Politicized in silent yielding opposition to authority, but not politicized to challenge the legitimacy of such an illegitimate regime.Drakulic's essays are touching and humorous. They are as sad as the story of half the women in Poland suddenly sprouting red hair, because red was the only color of hair dye available. These essays bring us nose-to-nose with the unfortunates forced to endure in a political system whose strong point was always in theory and whose weak points were generation after generation of misery for millions of people in dozens of countries."},{"Title":"The Middle Game in Chess","review":"Reuben Fine was one of the world's leading chess authors - as well as being a strong master himself -and was extremely influential and well-known. I bet if you asked 100 Grandmasters and authors, 98 would've heard of Fine. In this book, Fine emphasizes developing in the player the ability to analyze a position and to proceed accordingly. There are sections on mating attacks; combination play; how to handle superior positions, even positions; continuations of the openings; and transition to the end game. Maybe many of us think that the old books are outdated and stodgily written. Not so with Fine.

When intellectual historians look back to that strange time when cultural studies was trendy in the late 80s and early 90s, this might be the one book they cite as evidence that cultural studies raised very important questions but gave us intellectually obtuse answers. The questions that Grossberg poses are definitely significant, and more so today--the rise of the right-wing as \\"popular conservatism,\\" the condition of postmodernity and its simulated depthlessness, the death of rock music, the waning of affect and ironic cynicism among young people,, etc. But his prose is notorious for its obfuscations, its fetishism of French theory (especially the dadaist Marxism of Henri Lefebvre and the incomprehensible Deleuze and Guattari), and the fact that Grossberg built his career writing about music and youth culture but never quoted a lyric or talked at length about a particular band. It's still a worthwhile read for lefty intellectuals and if anything I think too many have dismissed Grossberg's work on the basis of its cult stud/pomo pretensions.

At times it was so disturbing, I had to put it down for a short period. Every page I found to be profound. I believe this book is the most open, honest portrayal of sadistic child abuse I've ever read. The author gives us a disturbing picture of how easy it is for someone to look professional and respectable on the outside yet be the complete opposite on the inside. It is very unsettling to think that both light and darkness can be found in same person. It is also unsettling to realize that the more educated and brilliant the predator's mind, the more easily the predator can connive, manipulate and cover his tracks, so that no adult would ever question his integrity.This book was a real wake-up call for me. It gave me ideas about what signs to look for in my children should I suspect any kind of abuse. It gave me ideas on how to protect my children from this day forward.I highly recommend this book to every parent with children under the age of eighteen. I thank the author for giving such an profound, honest, open and complete picture of what a pedophile really looks like and a complete picture of the murder of a soul which occurs in each child abused.Most of all, I would highly advise any man who has ever been molested in any way, and to any degree, to read this book. I believe it would give you understanding of what happened to you, lessen the shame, and make you feel free to get the help you so deserve. Being abused as a child is a horror for girls, but I believe it is even worse for boys as they deal with more shame and questions about their sexualiity. This burden of shame and humiliation keep many men from seeking help. This book may be the key to the beginning of healing for every victim of child abuse."},{"Title":"Never Let Me Go: A Portrait of Sexual Predation","review":"Like it or not. This type of situation happens more than we'd all like to think. I have researched the facts of this case I can tell with an unbiased certainty that it is all true. It disturbs me to see people who still try to cover up for the man portrayed in this book. Just goes to show you how such a man is a master of persuasion and manipulation. To get a real story, warts and all, of an ordinary, respectable man and an ordinary, unsuspecting youth, read this. By far the most intriguing part about this account is that the villain isn't a classic villain and the victim isn't a classic victim. It will blow your mind. This isn't Hollywood, it's Pennsylavania.Thanks Roscoe."},{"Title":"Never Let Me Go: A Portrait of Sexual Predation","review":"I went to the university that Mr. Rosenthal teaches at, and this book was recommended to me by one of his students. Some people, like the commenter who claims that this book is full of lies, have a hard time confronting the sad, sick fact of Chuck's abuse. Read it. He couldn't have fabricated this story. It reads like a textbook case of child molestation. The way he builds into the abuse gave me so much insight into the process that I feel as though I have studied the topic. Now when people say \\"but he wanted to\\" or \\"he was old enough to know better\\" or the worst \\"I bet he enjoyed it\\" I have a quick response for them. This book is brave, awful, courageous, emotional, and strong. It teaches more than any course in child (or adult for that matter) psychology could: how and why molestation happens. How it changes you. How it ruins lives. If you are a victim of abuse or are dealing with a person who is, this book will help you understand."},{"Title":"Never Let Me Go: A Portrait of Sexual Predation","review":"This is one of the most moving memoirs I have read.

However, it has been years, I graduated in '91, and it does not play a part in this review.This book is honest and complex, as is the subject that it addresses. It does not easily create an arc that allows for redemption, but clearly and distinctly portrays the characters that are the center of this story.I don't believe that stories such as this should be easy or \\"neat\\" and this is an honest and deeply felt portrayal of a situation that has the benefit of reflection, and enough memory of the decisions made by the characters that helps us get closer to the central dilemmas faced by the young person who had to address situations that were more than could be expected at that age.This is an important subject, and this is a key book that includes reflection regarding this topic."},{"Title":"Never Let Me Go: A Portrait of Sexual Predation","review":"This book was lent to me by a friend of the author when my husband and I were grappling with his own childhood abuse. Mr. Rosenthal's courage in presenting such a difficult and deeply personal tragedy without any sentimentality, with such brutal honesty, and lack of concern for ego-driven personal validation, has been a valuable starting point for me in understanding what my husband, and many other boys and men (and abuse victims more generally) experience at the hands of predators who hide behind prestige, charm, wealth, and other forms of material success.

And the answer to the mystery--it just never would have happened that way in real life. But never mind--this is not great literature, just entertaining listening, just the right length for a car journey."},{"Title":"Rear Window and Three O'Clock","review":"Cornell Woolrich made his reputation writing short stories for the pulp magazines in the '30s and '40s. The two stories selected for the Audiotape presentation here are among his best. Keir Dullea does a wonderful job in bringing the stories to life and bringing out all the drama and suspense inherent in them.&quot;Rear Window&quot; is the short story that formed the basis for Alfred Hitchcock's film of the same name. It is interesting to see the similarities and differences between the two (for example, Woolrich's protagonist remains relatively unknown to us, while we learn much about Hitchcock's version of him).&quot;Three O'Clock&quot; is probably the best of the over 200 stories that Woolrich wrote. This is the noir story of a man who wants to kill his wife, even though he has no reason to. We are put into the skin of this man as he makes his preparations, and is ultimately trapped in his own machinations when an unforeseen circumstance places him across the room from the activated bomb, but unable to do anything to stop his destruction. We feel his mounting desperation and terror as 3:00, the time the bomb is set to explode, nears and he tries to somehow stop it.Dullea's performance on both stories brings out the despair, the suspense, the excitement, that lie in the original stories for both. These audiotapes more ressemble the best of classic Old Time Radio theatre dramas than books-on-tape. It is hard to imagine better adaptations."},{"Title":"Augustine: A Very Short Introduction","review":"This compact book is perfect.It provides just the right background information, from influences of people who lived before St. Augustine to influences of his modern world, as well as lots of other information about the early Christian era &amp; pagan dissidents, numerous similar &amp; conflicting spiritual beliefs -- without getting boring by losing focus on the topic, Augustine, or by focusing on him too much which would mean omitting information about the strata he found his place in.It offers a great framework of biographical information which sheds much light on Augustine's works.It also, significantly, contains brilliant scholarly summaries &amp; explanations &amp; assessments of many of Augustine's beliefs without becoming subjective or dry ever.I recommend this as compulsory background reading for anyone interested in mysticism, medieval history, philosophy, saints, or especially Augustine himself."},{"Title":"Augustine: A Very Short Introduction","review":"Firstly, it should be noted that this book is not 895 pages! It is, in actuality, 144 pages - and it is a detailed 144 pages, too. This is actually the first book I ever read that got me interested in the thought of the early Church Fathers and it is a great introduction to St. Augustine. (The entire series is great, actually.)Although this book is only a sketch, it provides some really helpful information when it comes to issues such as the Pelagian controversy and Augustine's views on Original Sin. It is interesting to note that although Augustine is held in such high regard by many today, his own ideas were sometimes reviled and considered heretical in his own time. Of course, it is also worth noting that Augustine's ideas are oftentimes completely misunderstood today; people sometimes force later developments onto Augustine.Due to his continuing controversy - and the man is one of the more controversial orthodox thinkers in the history of the Christian Church - this book is worth reading. For those interested in further reading, the suggested readings in the back are a great place to start (I myself just picked up Peter Brown's autobiography on Augustine). For those who have no desire to become scholars on Augustine, however, this &quot;very short introduction&quot; is a very fine introduction as well. It is a great place to start."},{"Title":"Augustine: A Very Short Introduction","review":"Man, I wish I had these books when I was in school.

A profound thinker with a talent for poetic prose, St. Augustine was a prolific writer. More of his writings survive than of any other ancient author.The book is small, but don't let the size fool you--the typeface is also small. Chadwick crams more information onto fewer pages than you could think possible. The typeface and the dense content lend themselves to a rather tedious reading experience, but the reward is well worth the effort.Augustine's thought is placed in the context of contemporary society, and the reader learns of the little-known Manichee and Donatist heresies. The way the ancient Church dealt with the Donatist heresy stands in stark contrast to the way the medieval Church dealt with heretics.Chadwick, of course, discusses the \\"Confessions\\" and \\"The City of God,\\" but he does not neglect Augustine's other writings, taking pains to point out how indebted Augustine was to the Old Testament and the Classical authors (Cicero in particular) for his language, but not his ideas. It is ironic that Cicero, such a mediocre philosopher, had such a profound effect on St. Augustine, such a towering figure in the fields of philosophy and religion."},{"Title":"Augustine: A Very Short Introduction","review":"This book was an absolute pleasure to read. Henry Chadwick's erudition is evident in his writing, but his style keeps the reading highly enjoyable. Anyone should be able to sit down with this book and read it in a matter of hours enjoying every minute of it.This is not a biography of Augustine's life as much as a biography of Augustine's thought. It traces the development of his thought in neoplatonism and his reliance upon Plotinus in particular, his time as a follower, but later opponent against Manicheeism and his prolonged arguments against Donatism. The book is not comprehensive, but gives brief introductions to Augustine's thoughts on Creation, Trinity, Politics, Sacerdotalism, and a few other topics and shows how they developed through his life and ministry.I highly recommend this short volume and would suggest that it would be a perfect read for a short introduction to Augustine at an undergraduate level."},{"Title":"Augustine: A Very Short Introduction","review":"A wonderful book for anyone wishing to learn about the theology of Augustine and the excellent work of Henry Chadwick. Chadwick is a venerated figure in modern theology having held positions at Oxford and Cambridge and manages to explain Augustine's theology in a surprisingly easy to read manner. Chadwick also explains the complex influence of Greek philosophy, specifically Neoplatonism on Augustine's thought. Prior to Chadwick this was something that many theologians had downplayed for obvious reasons. This is a fascinating read and should inspire readers to learn more about Augustine and the Early Church in general. I would recommend moving on to Chadwick's The Early Church when you have completed this book."},{"Title":"Augustine: A Very Short Introduction","review":"Chadwick approaches Augustine with an appreciation for Augustine's context, influences, challenges, imperfections and lasting contributions. He offers a brief biography that focuses on Augustine's scholarly road to Christianity as much as anything. Chadwick highlights the influences of philosophers like Plato, Plotinus and Cicero on Augustine throughout his life. Eventually, Augustine accepted Christianity through the writings of Paul and the influences of his mother Monica and mentor Ambrose.Chadwick leads the reader through Augustine's life, mind and spiritual biography by highlighting key topics that impacted Augustine's life and theology. His flirtation with the monastic life while upholding the responsibilities of being a bishop reveal the tension of engaging the world while having a heart in heaven. Chadwick spends some time of key doctrines such as free will, creation, the Trinity, City of God, and grace to illustrate Augustine's mind on these matters.This book is complete in itself while whetting the reader's appetite to take the next step in his or her discovery of and relationship with Augustine."},{"Title":"The Rhythm of Life: An Antidote For Our Busy Age","review":"I absolutely loved this book.

From the outset, however, Iraq's declarations were incomplete and contained numerous false statements and distortions. When the U.N. agencies eventually uncovered irrefutable evidence of an undeclared site or activity and demanded that Baghdad account for the missing data, the Iraqi authorities typically responded with another partial admission, indicating at each stage that they were making a full disclosure.

Read it."},{"Title":"The Greatest Threat","review":"Richard Butler, career diplomat from Down Under, authored this book in 2000 about his experiences fighting for nuclear disarmament, non-proliferation, and then as the head of the UNSCOM weapons inspection program in Iraq during the 1990's. The book plays out chronologically, beginning with a history of nuclear proliferation during the Cold War, and ends with the end of the 2nd Clinton administration. The meat of the book deals with his experiences in Iraq during the late 1990's dealing with Tariq Aziz and the rest of Saddam Hussein's regime. The author gives equal verbage explaining his experiences dealing with Saddam's regime, as it does to his experiences with the international community such as the US, Russia, France, China and the UK. By book's end, the reader gets an image of Iraq as highly dangerous both to itself and to its neighbors. Though the author never explicitly states that Iraq had WMD at the close of the 1990's, his writing implies that Iraq is hiding something; either WMD, or the infrastructure to construct WMD. Of course, all this came to naught after Operation Iraqi Freedom found nothing but spent shells from the Iraq - Iran War. Interestingly, the author refutes the claims made by US Marine Scott Ritter that he was taking orders from the US intelligence agency with the ulterior motive of assasinating Saddam Hussein.Outside of the fact that the author made the wrong conclusion about Saddam's regime covering up WMD, I have several other complaints about the book. First and foremost, for a book dealing with a complex subject that involves physics, engineering, chemistry, and other science fields; the author gives zero explanation of the science of weapon inspection. The book should have gone over the basics of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons; the technologies, instruments, tools, and industries involved in developing these types of weapons, the labor and resource requirements, and how an inspector like him goes about examining a site, such as a factory, and determine what to look for. The author should have also gone into greater detail into what actions he and his team did in order to look for WMD, and how Iraqis subverted this. Instead, the book focuses more on the dialogue between him, his team, Iraqi officials and diplomats from other countries."},{"Title":"The Greatest Threat","review":"INTRODUCTIONThe failure to complete the task of disarming Saddam and the politics on which it has rested-including the failure of the Security Council to maintain its own authority-constitutes a serious crisis in global security. Saddam's statements indicate that he sees Iraq as threatened on virtually all sides, particularly by Iran and Israel. He has sought weapons of mass destruction (WMD) to deal with that threat. He has used them against Iran, and, to some extent, Israel. In addition to seizing Kuwait, he has also attacked Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, and Turkey. Every thoughtful leader in the region assumes he may do so again. Simple terrorist action -easily possible with WMD- would bring us to a virtually unmanageable place, a situation in which angry Americans are baying for blood; the more sober heads at the Pentagon and the White House are trying desperately to figure out how to keep the situation from exploding; and leaders of dozens of other countries-from Russia, China, and France to Syria, Iran, North Korea, and maybe even Cuba- maneuvering to exploit the crisis to their own advantage. It's likely that all of the choices facing the U.S. president (and, for that matter, world leaders at the UN and NATO) would be horrendous, not readily promising peace and justice but, more likely, more death and terror.1. A Glimpse of Terror.... [a] relatively minor display of the brutal and tyrannical nature of Saddam's regime ... has haunted me. ... [At the end of a day's discussionswith the Iraqis] I rose, along with the rest of the UNSCOM (UN Special Commission) team, and prepared for the usual phony, polite, formalleave-taking. Stepping around to the Iraqi side of the conference table, I extended my hand to Aziz [Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister]. He then beganthe unexpected sideshow. Rather than shake my hand, Aziz signaled to a group of figures barely discernable in a dark corner of the room. Twouniformed men strode up into the light, pulling between them a third man. He was a slight fellow dressed in the typical garb of an Iraqi farmer: anopen-necked shirt, rough cotton trousers, and a pair of much-worn sandals. He had the gnarled skin and dark complexion of one long exposed tothe harsh Mideast sun, and he wore the black moustache affected by nearly all Iraqi men in imitation of Saddam Hussein. But what struck me mostforcibly was his obvious, intense fear. He was hunched as though to shield his body from expected blows, he was trembling all over, and when heglanced at me, I saw in his eyes the look of terror.The men in uniform held this man firmly and thrust him toward me. Aziz declared, &quot;Mr. Butler, I want to show you something important. You have accused us of testing biological weapons on human beings. It's an outrageous lie. In particular, you have shown a photograph of the forearm of a person on which there were sores. You said the sores were caused by the testing of weapons. You asked for an explanation. Well, here's your explanation! This man is the man in your photograph. Look at his arm!&quot; Aziz yanked up the left sleeve of the farmer's shirt, exposing an unmarked forearm. &quot;So much for your claims!&quot;I felt deep pity for the farmer. Aziz has had his thugs grab you off the street and drag you up here for this charade, I thought.

To Disarm SaddamUN Security Council system to disarm Iraq:1.UN Security Council demands declaration by Iraq of all illegal weapons within 15 days (full, final and complete disclosure statements). 2.UNSCOM and IAEA verify declaration (anticipated duration: several months). 3.Joint Iraq/UN destruction of weapons. 4.Monitoring dual use facilities (nuclear, biological, chemical).Enforcement by UN (sanctions) was necessary because from day one Iraq has refused to cooperate with UN disarmament plan. Oil-for-Food program only partly used by Saddam: he turns sanctions against his own people. Oil-for-Food misused by Iraqi military. Iraq builds up a system of concealment against weapons inspections (as became apparent after the Kamal defection). UNSCOM was forced into digging, probing, questioning, challenging and cross-examining a system designed to obscure, confuse and deceive, Rolf Ekeus (then UNSCOM's director) creates UNSCOM's Concealment Unit.

Saddam is a scary dude and he's commited to build up his arsenal of particularly nasty weapons. Butler explains how UNSCOM (the group that was to insure that Iraq's weapons of mass destruction were neutralized) tied to carry out its mission despite the attempts of the iraqis and some of the members of the UN security council. It opens your eyes and makes you see that they are serious threats to peace, and that air raids may not solve the problems. You get a good explaination of how the convuluted world of UN politics works. There time when the book bogs down in details, but finally international politics is all about the details and the wording. It is a great book. Weapons of mass destruction can effect everybody in the world, so unless you live in an underground bunker in the Artic, this book is worth your time."},{"Title":"The Greatest Threat","review":"10.

It is now known that there are no WMD's in Iraq. Saddam did not pose a threat to America and the world at-large. It's just sad that the trumpeters of the Iraqi war were playing to the wrong song. It's packed with faulty and \\"highly dubious\\" intelligence. The CIA has since admitted as much but I do not expect as much from a hack writting a book to profit from a \\"massive intelligence failure\\"."},{"Title":"The Greatest Threat","review":"Weapons of mass destruction are a matter of great concern, yes. The fact that seems to escape the esteemed Mr Butler ... is that the U.S. possesses more of them than any other nation on earth and seems willing to use at the proverbial drop of a hat. ...Richard Butler (who I am ashamed to say comes from my own country) was almost fired by the UN Secretary General Kofi Annan for his disgusting behaviour in Iraq on more than one occasion. He was repeatedly called before his superiors for his lack of restraint and professionalism. Evidence is mounting to support claims that Butler was a U.S./Israeli spy.His total lack of respect for the culture and desire to be in control of UNSCOM teams made him blind to the need to relax/remove sanctions on Iraq. He thus prolonged the misery of a population and should be held partly accountable (along with Clinton, Bush, inter alia) for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of innocent Iraqis. This book is drivel. Propaganda of the worst kind."},{"Title":"The Greatest Threat","review":"...Book Review: Snatching Defeat from the Jaws of Victory by David Isenberg Thursday, May 18, 2000...There is no way to say this delicately so I may just as well come right out and say it. This is a painful book to read. Why? Is it badly written? No, it is both informative and engaging. Does it deal with an unimportant topic? On the contrary, it deals with a critically important issue: the effort to stop the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, nuclear, biological and chemical weapons. Why then the pain?This book is essentially the story of a failure, one that has consequences for the entire world. Specifically, it is the telling of the undermining and destruction of UNSCOM by Saddam Hussein. The West set up UNSCOM, short for the United Nations Special Commission, in the aftermath of the 1991 Persian Gulf War to disarm Iraq of its weapons of mass destruction.Rolf Ekeus, a Swedish diplomat, headed UNSCOM for its first six years. In 1997, after Ekeus left to become Swedish ambassador to Washington, Richard Butler took over as executive director. Butler was an experienced Australian diplomat who had previously worked on many other disarmament issues. This book is the story of the final two years of struggle with Iraq in accordance with the original U.N. Security Council Resolution 687 of 1991. This struggle more or less ended -- unsatisfactorily -- when the United States and Britain bombed Iraq in Operation Desert Fox in December 1998, an event that marked the end of UNSCOM inspections in Iraq.Caught cheatingBear in mind that the various global arms-control regimes are based on the presumption that if those being inspected are found breaking the rules, some sort of enforcement will take place -- usually through the U.N. system and specifically thorough the Security Council. When enforcement fails, as happened in Iraq's case, the consequences are critical. As Butler notes: &quot;Saddam's cheating has been detected, but it has not been stopped. Nations that could take action have chosen not to. The implications of this for the maintenance of the strictures against weapons of mass destruction, built so painstakingly over almost half a century, are dire. If Saddam finally gets away with it, the whole structure could well collapse.&quot;Butler's is a story of many disappointments. He faced lack of political will and crass appeasement on the part of member nations of the U.N. Security Council. Constant obfuscation and deception by Iraq are the main themes, highlighted by vignettes of pettiness on the part of U.N. bureaucrats, such as the advisers to U..N Secretary-General Kofi Anan, and brazen lying by such Iraqi functionaries as Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz. Butler had a reputation as a plain-spoken man. It is a reputation that is deserved. It is refreshing to see a diplomat use words like &quot;outrageous,&quot; &quot;appalling,&quot; &quot;word witchcraft,&quot; &quot;blackest lie,&quot; &quot;phony&quot; and &quot;facile.&quot;Back to Iraq?In the first two chapters, Butler briefly describes his childhood and later working for the Australian Foreign Affairs department and the work he did prior to taking on his position as head of UNSCOM. But the remaining chapters constitute the core of the book.Much of the book details the two wars that UNSCOM waged. Sadly, it lost both. The first and the better known is the daily war of attrition it fought with Iraq, which used ceaseless tactics of cheat, retreat and cheat in order to thwart UNSCOM. As Butler explains, Saddam Hussein did not believe he lost the Gulf War. Though Saddam was driven from Kuwait, he viewed the Dessert Storm coalition's real aim as to remove him from power or turn Iraq into a vassal state. Thus, for Iraq the battle with UNSCOM was simply the last battle of the Gulf War. And for Iraq to &quot;cement its &quot;victory&quot; in that war they had to defeat both UNSCOM in general and Richard Butler personally. In fact, Iraq paid Butler an ironic compliment when it demanded his removal as item 9 of a list of demands presented to the Security Council in November 1998 in its attempt to forestall the Clinton bombing.The other war UNSCOM fought with the U.N. to both preserve its independence and to get the Security Council to support its documentation of Iraq's continuing refusal to live up to its pledge to allow UNSCOM inspectors to carry out their work.One of the more intriguing sections of the book deals with the allegation by Scott Ritter, former UNSCOM weapons inspector who resigned in 1998, that Butler had taken direction from the U.S. government and that UNSCOM had allowed itself to be a conduit for U.S. intelligence collection in Iraq. Ritter's view was detailed in his book Endgame published last year. We may never know the exact truth of the matter, but Butler musters a good case that his charges are false.As Butler makes clear in his conclusions, we cannot expect UNSCOM's successor organization, UNMOVIC (United Nations Monitoring Verification and Inspection Commission), created in December 1999, to accomplish anything worthwhile. To name just two flaws, unlike UNSCOM it will be under the direction of the U.N. secretary-general; its staff will be U.N. civil servants instead of technical experts.The conclusion that Butler leaves us with is both dismaying, and even worse, true. &quot;When a determined criminal flouts international law under cover of the principle of state sovereignty, the world system, as currently constituted, appears able or unwilling to stop him,&quot; he writes.In short, we should be afraid, very afraid..."},{"Title":"The Greatest Threat","review":"There is an advantage to reading a book a few years after it is first published. The advantage in this case is that the Saddam dictatorship is history and many of the assurances that lead us to war have been proven to be a little over hyped, to be generous. That comment leads us to this book. The author was the head of the UN weapons inspectors in the last two years they were in place, ending in 1998. This book is his review of his time on the job and the obligatory musings about what needed to be done with Saddam circa 2000. I had heard in a number of other articles and some books that the author was a bit arrogant and pushy. To be fair, those personality traits, if they even exist, did not come out in the book. The author presented his case in a rather fair sounding and well thought out process. There were no over the top dramatics nor did it seam to me that the author was trying to stretch the truth to prove his point.I started this book thinking it would be one case after another of how Iraq had hid WMD\`s, yet they were hardly ever mentioned. By this I mean that the author only detailed out a few cases of papers being found and old weapons parts being dug up. In all his pages on the inspection process, the author gives the reader no finds of the actual weapons the world was looking for. All the author really detailed was the unlimited number of ways the Iraqi's found to be unhelpful, arrogant, and just plain nasty to his team. If there ever was a case for how not to play well with others the Iraqi's are the hands down favorites. In hind sight, what is rather humorous is that if they would have just swallowed a little crow and let the UN run all over their county unmolested for a few years, they would have left and the Saddam cronies would still be in power. This could be the first dictator to loss power due to unending amounts of arrogance coupled with a good helping of plain ignorance.The last item I found interesting was the side story that bordered on a male cat fight. This author and Scott Ritter, another of the weapons inspectors, had a few words while working together and both decided to finish the disagreement in the press. About the only value in the comments is that it makes you smile a little to think that this author lowered himself to grade school play ground name calling in a book for the masses. Overall, I found the book interesting in its detail of the way the Iraqi government dealt with the UN and how the French, Russians and Chinese all interacted with the US. I also thought the very apparent lack of evidence of WMD\`s being discussed in the book was a precursor of things to come. If you are interested in the conservative thinking that lead up to the Iraqi war, then this book is an interesting bit a the picture."},{"Title":"The Greatest Threat","review":"What an eye opener. The Greatest Threat gave me goose-bumps. I couldn't put the book down. Scary! Everyone needs to read this book. It grabs you right from the start as if you were right there with the UNSCOM inspectors. I agree with the author on American and International politics needing to be over-hauled. Maybe the mess we find ourselves in today could have been avoided if our country and other countries had worked together to promote disarmament. Then, inforced it when the country refused to comply instead of sweeping the issue under the rug.The book is well written and reads like a the latest thriller. The trouble is it is very real. It's sad that one ruthless leader can cause so much pain to his own people and the world. I don't like war either, but it looks like that is the only choice we have as the author pointed out. This book is a must read if you want to know what is going on with Iraq and how we got where we are today."},{"Title":"The Greatest Threat","review":"This book is exceptional on so many levels I scarcely know where to begin. Richard Butler former Executive Chairman of UNSCOM is very definitely a man of deep integrity driven by an equally deep concern for the issue of arms control not solely in Iraq but throughout the world. This book is his story and how during the course of two years he battled to achieve the complete dismantling of Iraq's stockpile of weapons chemical biological and nuclear.He describes in detail the stand-offs between himself and the Iraqi authorities and how ultimately the united nations through weakness and division have allowed Saddam Hussein to hold onto much of his deadly arsenal. He charts the use of these weapons by Iraq in its war with Iran as well as the use of gases on ethnic minorities inside the country itself.The reader gets an incredible look at the UN Security Council attempting to apply a, geo-political rules as usual approach, to the problem of Iraq's non-compliance with UN resolutions. The role of the Russian diplomats along with the French and Chinese come in for close scrutiny. If Butlers understanding of Israel's defence posture during the gulf war is accurate then the reader can take it that if Saddam were to use a chemical weapon or worse against a city like Tel Aviv then almost certainly and without consultation Israel would respond with tactical nuclear weapons against Iraq. During the gulf war Israeli Jets sat fuelled and ready to fly against targets in Iraq following the deployment of some 39 Scud missiles fired at Israel during the conflict. This analysis and so much more is contained in this sober but authentic look at how dangerous the world has become. Worst of all is the ongoing capitulation by the United Nations in terms of forcing Iraqi compliance with its own resolutions."},{"Title":"The Greatest Threat","review":"The story of UNSCOM's final two years in the effort to dismantle Iraq's weapons of mass destruction is rivetingly told in this book, full of rich, sometimes delicious detail. There are subplots involving the Secretary General and a former weapons inspector with their own agendas, a back story of Presidential misdeeds, and for added flavor, the French and Russians each with their own, financially motivated policies to pursue in Iraq. It all adds up to a fine, refreshingly candid read about how something so right-the need to find and eliminate long range missiles, chemical and biological weapons-could go so wrong.Richard Butler deserves credit for having the courage and ability to step outside the world he has inhabited for so long professionally--diplomacy with all its deliberate, oppressive opacity-and tell a story plainly. He admits that the bombing of Iraq under Desert Fox has hurt rather than helped the cause of weapons inspections and that sanctions have outlived whatever usefulness they had at one time. The characterizations of various senior officials, in all their self-absorbed pomposity are not to be missed (e.g. de Mistura briefing the Security Council on his mission to \\"map\\" the presidential palaces, or Russian Foreign Minister Primakov \\"whose heaviness and pedantry were so redolent of the Soviet\\" era).Equally compelling is Butler's prescription. He rightly observes that there are few issues facing the international community that are grave enough to command an exceptional level of action and agreement. Chief among these, he argues, should be the need to control and ultimately eliminate weapons of mass destruction. He calls on the five permanent members of the Security Council to act in concert to enforce the various nonproliferation treaties by, among other things, not threatening use of the veto in a way that precludes any useful collective action to remedy serious cases of noncompliance. Sadly, Butler's invitation to the U.S. to exercise its considerable leadership in achieving such a worthy objective is likely to be ignored."},{"Title":"The Greatest Threat","review":"Butler's very sobering firsthand account of the effort to disarm Iraq after the Gulf War provides the essential reasoning of why it is necessary for President Bush and Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld to continue to push for the replacement of Saddam Hussein.Butler was a career Australian diplomat who had been the Australian Ambassador for Disarmament. He was named head of the United Nations Special Commission on Disarming Iraq. Butler depicts the unwavering determination of the Iraqi government to acquire weapons of mass destruction. He details the politics of Kofi Annan and the United Nations leadership as they tried to paper over Iraqi deceptions so as to achieve a diplomatic \\"victory\\" in the face of a startlingly different reality. The ultimate triumph was handed to a very dangerous Saddam and a defeat to both the UN and the Clinton Administration.Hitler's Mein Kampf explained Nazi Germany's future for those who would read it (as Churchill did). Similarly, Butler brings his readers face to face with Hussein's twisted world. He explains clearly what it is and why Saddam is working so hard to develop weapons of terrifying capability.Butler illustrates a frightening Iraqi worldview captured best by Deputy Prime Minister Aziz who \\"had stated quite plainly that Iraq had used chemical weapons on Iran, that it maintained biological weapons, and that these were intended specifically for use against Israel.\\" Aziz declares his government's vision of an Iraqi future \\"leading and defending\\" a united Arab world. One that is \\"vigilant against the Persians in the Northwest and the Israelis in the Southwest\\". In order to achieve this dominant role for Iraq \\"it had sought, obtained, used, and would use again in the future weapons of mass destruction.\\"Butler asserts: \\"Iraq's main triumph was the removal of all disarmament inspections and the shutdown of all monitoring systems.\\" Butler writes that many weapons were removed but \\"Saddam still satisfies the three criteria usually advanced in judging whether or not a crime was committed: motive, means, and opportunity. He clearly continues to have the motive and means to threaten great danger, and now the opportunity for renewed weapons development, given the extended absence of international arms control in Iraq.\\"Butler introduces Iraq in a chapter entitled \\"A Glimpse of Terror\\". He recounts again and again the true character of Saddam's regime. \\"Its brutal and tyrannical nature has been documented in detail for almost two decades. The political currency of his regime is homicide, frequently threatened and often delivered, the callousness of the regime toward its own people--a quality we witnessed daily in our dealings with Iraq, something which gives the lie to Saddam's public protestations that his primary goal is to lift the awful burden of international sanctions from the backs of the Iraqi people.\\" The truth is that he could get relief from sanctions, as Butler puts it, \\"at any time by giving up his weapons\\". Saddam \\"has resolutely refused to do that, thus trading off the welfare of the Iraqi people.\\" Butler is unequivocal in his indictment of his regime: \\"cruel, lying, intimidating, and determined to retain weapons of mass destruction--weapons capable of killing thousands, even millions at a single blow.\\"Butler, who led his inspections team in Iraq, reveals in his findings on chemical weapons that \\"essentially Iraq made virtually all of the prohibited agents and used some of them both in and outside Iraq. But VX was and is the most devastating of them. It can be sprayed as a liquid or scattered into the atmosphere as an aerosol. A missile warhead of the type Iraq has made and used can hold some 140 liters of VX,...enough of the chemical to kill up to 1 million people. A single droplet on the skin constitutes a lethal dose.\\" The UN has imposed a missile range limit on Iraq, \\"a limit Iraq is now breaching\\". Iraq successfully protected its secret chemical weapons program and \\"the overall size of Iraq's VX production remains unknown to this day.\\"Butler draws an equally disturbing conclusion on biological weapons where he notes the \\"intelligence materials I had seen indicating that Iraq may have transferred some of its biological weapons equipment in shipping containers for safe storage in another country.\\"Butler, who is pro-United Nations and pro-multilateralism, recount Iraq's propaganda efforts, the rise of a French-Chinese-Russian effort to lift the sanctions, the dishonesty of some of Kofi Annan's staff in trying to manipulate information, suppress reports of Iraqi behavior to help lift the sanctions. Those who would reform the United Nations would do well to study Butler's account of internal maneuvering and manipulation. It is an institution that should be taken seriously and should be made more transparent and more accountable.Butler's logic is irrefutable, \\"weapons of mass destruction are fundamentally different from other threats to peace. They cannot be the subject of politics as usual because of their capacity to destroy everything.\\"We don't know exactly what is happening inside Iraq because \\"no one is watching Saddam Hussein. You can be certain that he is not waiting idly for the UN to suddenly realize its fault. He is building--building weapons, as are other rogue states...If a single missile loaded with nerve gas was to hit Tel Aviv, the world will never be the same. If a single canister of VX was released into the New York City subway system, the world will never be the same. If a single nuclear explosion hollowed out central London, the world will never be the same.\\"The book opens and is concluded with this quote from Edmund Burke; \\"The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing\\". This testimony to Saddam's evil by an Australian should be a must read for every American uncertain of the need to replace a madman."},{"Title":"The Greatest Threat","review":"Notwithstanding its ominous title, this book is a reasonably conventional professional autobiography of a career diplomat. Author Richard Butler served as executive chairman of the United Nations Special Commission (&quot;UNSCOM&quot;) charged with disarming Iraq from 1997 until 1999. Prior to that, he was Australia's ambassador to the United Nations and Thailand. Most of the book is devoted to disarmament issues, especially efforts to enforce U.N. Security Council resolutions requiring Iraq to destroy its weapons of mass destruction and to forbear rebuilding them and the subsequent decision to abandon those efforts. These issues must concern anyone interested in global security because, in Butler's view, the post-Cold War &quot;new world order&quot; may be every bit as dangerous as the frostiest years of the United States-Soviet Union confrontation.Butler repeatedly demonstrates that he took a narrow, fundamental legalistic approach to his duties. He insists that the Security Council's decisions are binding on all of its members and that the Security Council has the ability &quot;to enforce its decisions by military force, if needed.&quot; According to Butler, Security Council Resolution 687, which codified the terms of the cease-fire of the Persian Gulf War required Iraq to destroy all of its weapons of mass destruction - nuclear, chemical, biological, and missiles. Resolution 687 also set up the UN Special Commission - UNSCOM - as an organ of the Security Council to conduct the actual disarmament work, and the Security Council made completion of the disarmament work a prerequisite to the lifting of the economic sanctions imposed on Iraq in 1990. Butler clearly believes that Iraq never intended to cooperate with UNSCOM. As a pretext for reusing to cooperate, Iraq systematically blocked UNSCOM inspections, and this sparked a crisis that continued for 18 months. While Butler and UNSCOM were involved in an increasingly-bitter dispute with Iraq, Secretary-General Kofi Annan visited Iraq in February 1998 and proclaimed that Saddam Hussein was a man &quot;I can do business with.&quot; In early August 1998, Iraq notified the Security Council that it had &quot;decided to suspend UNSCOM's disarmament work.&quot; This led to a serious division in the Security Council, with the United States and the United Kingdom pitted against Russia, China, and France, which sought to end the disarmament work and discontinue the economic sanctions. UNSCOM was eventually disbanded and replaced by a body more sensitive to Iraq. Butler's outlook on the future is pessimistic. Butler asks: &quot;Is Iraq as dangerous as it was a decade ago? And he answers: Elementally yes.&quot;Although it is a clich&eacute;, I believe that this book is an extended exercise in preaching to the choir. Readers concerned with international-security issues already know and probably will agree with Butler that the UNSCOM period revealed &quot;the real shape of the post-Cold War world,&quot; and they will share his criticisms of Russia, France, and China for having &quot;clearly defined, separate interests in addition to their obviously shared concerns about a unipolar world.&quot; Much of this book is a detailed, sometimes tedious, narrative of Butler's two-year tenure at UNSCOM. After a while, it is mind-numbing, but, to the extent that Butler sought to make a historical record, he succeeds. This is an important book which ultimately asks: Can anyone have confidence in the United Nations if it allows cynical self-interest and endless palaver to prevail over principle and action?"},{"Title":"The Greatest Threat","review":"This is a very good book by Richard Butler. Who is Richard Butler? He is an Australian diplomat who has been in the nuclear disarmament field for decades and was the Australian ambassador to the United Nations. Richard Butler was appointed the head of UNSCOM, which was the United Nations' body set up to oversee the Iraqi dissarmament of weapons of mass detruction after the Gulf War. If anyone should know what the world faces from Iraq, Richard Butler is the man and his story needs to be heard.His views on Iraq are frightening and his information on the United Nations as a body and some of the countries that belong to it are disheartening. Throughout the book Butler explains why Iraqi leadership actually thinks they won the Gulf War. He explains how the United Nations waffled on enforcing the rules that they had instituted. His take on Kofi Annan and the politicians that made it easier for Iraq to evade the international laws passed by the U.N.Is Iraq still harboring weapons of mass destruction? I think that is a foregone conclusion. Iraq has lied, cheated, broken treaties and evaded international law. Saddam has succeeded in stonewalling international monitoring.Would Iraq use such weapons once they gather enough? I think the judgement on that is also already concluded. Saddam and Hitler where the only two people in history to use chemicals for genocidal purposes. Saddam already proved he would when he used them on the Iranian soldiers in the Iran-Iraq war, on the Iranian POWs (testified to by Iraqi defectors) and on the Kurds - citizens of his own country. Saddam showed once again his sinister side in 1991, shortly before the Gulf War, when he dispatched hit squads around the world to take out \\"coalition\\" diplomats.Richard Butler's words should be read, his thoughts and insights should be considered.

Richard Butler accurately hits the nail on the head in his book. He relates events and issues to our present day situation with Iraq prior to them happening. The book helped me to see that situations and concerns that are being debated today have been known and existed many years. There is a lot of knowledge about Iraq that has existed for years and hasn't been dealt with, just swept under the rug.Accusations about Saddam are true. I can see why when reading this book that France, Russia and China are against helping. I couldn't understand that before. It is scary and chilling to read each and every word - because each and every word validates the move against Saddam.Richard speculates about a terrorist attack against New York and how it would be difficult to track the Saddam connection, but it most likely would be there. This book gives the evidence many are asking for, and confirms what it is being discovered everyday in Iraq.Richard speculates that if the terrorist connection could be made or will not disarm who would be bold enough to start a war against Saddam. It would most likely be America and Britain, and that France, Russia and China would oppose.Richard talks about evidence of chemical, biological and weapons of mass destruction that was found, but how Iraq squirms, lies and avoids answers, etc. They are aided by forces to help deceive.You will feel like you are reading a newspaper of today - a newspaper that gives the un-muddled cold hard truth of the situation in Iraq.Scarier than a Stephen King book."},{"Title":"The Greatest Threat","review":"No doubt about it. Saddam Hussein is one of the major problem in the middle east.This book is written by Unscom's Head Richard Butler.

Saddam bears heavy responsibility for the suffering of his own people.The book tragicaly tells us how Saddam was able to divide the UN on the sanction issues, with Russia France and China on one side wanting to end the sanctions (and to have economic relationship and to have there own interests) and the US and UK on the other who wants the sanctions to be in place until UNSCOM does it job (However US and UK action's would seem \\"genocidle\\" which the State run Iraqi Media plays over and over).The book also tell's us of the author's fustrations in dealing with the Iraqi Goverment.

He is doing it so that the US cannot take him out (the US is tied up in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict).Enjoy reading this book. It will give you a lot of insight."},{"Title":"The Hidden Clue (Judy Bolton Series #35)","review":"Kudos to Applewood Books for reprinting \\"The Hidden Clue\\", one of the hardest to find titles in the 38 volume Judy Bolton mystery series (1932-1967). This high quality softcover is slightly larger in size than the original Grosset & Dunlap picture cover edition which was originally published in 1964, but otherwise contains an exact replica of the original, with the cover art and internal illustrations intact. The only slip-up appears on Applewood's introductory title page in which the book's illustrator is identified as Pelagie Doane; Doane illustrated the first 19 titles in the series, after which an assortment of (mostly unidentified) artists took their turns.Unlike many other contemporary series like Nancy Drew and the Dana Girls, the Judy Bolton books maintain a chronological order, with characters and events in each book affecting the plots of succeeding volumes in the series. For that reason, it is superb to see \\"The Hidden Clue\\" - a very difficult book to find since the original print run was so small - back in print, so that many of Judy's devoted fans can fill the holes remaining in their collections."},{"Title":"The Hidden Clue (Judy Bolton Series #35)","review":"My LAST addition to my collection of Judy Bolton books, begun about 50 years ago when I was very young.
