This should be on everyone's shelves!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This has got to be one of the greatest books I will ever read. And this is coming from a 5th grade boy. I love classics, and have read books like Treasure Island and A Christmas Carol. But this may just be the best of the three.Now I want to say specifically to Pete, yah, you know who I'm talking about, that how the heck could you say this book is bad? IT'S AWESOME! And then I want to say to aaman or whatever your name is, come on. Really? Did you have to write TWO reviews on how bad this book was? No. And then there was someone else who said they tried to read it twice with their mom, but hated it. Anyway, I'm on very low battery, so I need to go. Good-bye."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"this is an awesome book. READ IT.it took obout a month for me to read it but worth it10 AND UP"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Where have I been? Or where has this book been all my life? I remembering hearing about it a little when I was younger and thinking it was fluffy boring stuff, but I love this book! It is now one of my favorites, right up there at the top with the Lord of the Rings trilogy and A Tale of Two Cities! Alcott's writing is not stiff or formal, but rather personable and believable. I fell in love with the March sisters and laughed at their idiosyncrasies and cried at their heartaches (I did!). There are even a couple parts in the book, relating to managing anger and nurturing marriage, that spoke deeply to me and have helped me in my personal life. Even the poetry \\"written\\" by the March sisters in different parts of the book are amazing.This is a must-read! It is also an easy read. Do not think for a moment of not reading it, because it is such a heart-warming tale of one beautiful family and how we can all triumph no matter our circumstances and achieve happiness. Love, love, love this book!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Of the three versions of this story frequently seen on movie channels, this is the best. The beautiful New England scenery, the excellent background music which somehow conveys the Civil War period, the fine acting - all make this a very enjoyable rendition.I somewhat reluctantly have withheld the 5th star - possibly unfairly so. I re-read Louisa May Alcott's book just recently. My conclusion was that because the book provides a much more comprehensive development of the lives of the four March daughters, no movie, within its modern time limitations, can really do justice to Alcott's plot. While I liked the portrayal of Professor Bhaer very much in this latest version, I think the movie adaptation made him much more &#34;modern&#34; than the book would allow - more youthful in appearance, more advanced views of culture, a manufactured love scene, etc.But all in all - highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"5 stars!!!!

As always the book was better than the movie."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"The classic Little Women is a phenomenal book that anyone who is coming-of-age should read. It is definitely worth it reading all 444 pages. Little Women leaches lessons, and tells a thoughtful story of a family who comes close to losing everything but manages to live happily and love each other no matter what. Some tragic things happen, but the March family definitely cares about everyone that comes into their lives and stays strong even while the man of the house is fighting in the Civil War. I highly recommend this book to anyone who would love to read a story about this strong family. The author, Louisa May Alcott, is very talented."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I read this many times as a child and am enjoying it all over again.

I can't believe I haven't changed my mind about that. It is stunning in that it has so many words I had to look up. Such a shame that novelists today are discouraged to use such language.

They are poor and their father is at war,and they have all sorts of, um, not really adventures, but you get the point. Well, it tells about their daily lives- not that interesting. Alcott devotes whole chapters to something as trivial as making dinner- and doesn't make it even that interesting. In the end, they are all happy and married with kids, thus giving the message to reach true happiness the ultimate goal must be marriage- not.I can't believe Alcott managed to write 647 pages of this- it was so dang boring! Of course, it had its interesting moments, but for the most part, I can't believe I'm alive, writing this review. Overall, this book hasn't affected me much- just another book.Plot- boringEnding- pretty satisfying, especially because it's the endingFlow- I still don't know which character is which, and the book went from, say, a tea party, to a dinner, and back to the tea party; confusing!Would I buy this book- I already did, but it was free (meh heh heh)Would I reread this book- NO!Bottom line: Must I say it again? BORING!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"its a great classic novel that teaches many morals and values in the life of a family. it might have a long exposition which you have to patiently wait to get over with. an all age book"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I loved this book! It was sometimes happy, sometimes sad, just like real life. I recommend this book to people who like realistic and historical fiction."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I would have never picked up this book had it not been assigned in one of my college classes. I was not too excited about having to take this 'American Culture' class, and on top of it being assigned to read this lame book, Little Women. Oh, but how wrong and narrow-minded I was, as this turned out to be my all-time favorite book! We were only assigned to read the first part, but I loved it so much I let my other classes slide to read part two. If you're not too sure about this book, throw your doubt out the window and read it!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I consider the book Little Women a five star book because it is a well educational story of 4 young ladies that grow up to be women. They learned how to be women by taking care of themselves when there mother left to go help there father since he got sick while fighting in World War 2. Beth got scarlet fever. She was very sick and they sent a telegram to the mother. The mother came home and Beth got better. A few days later the Mr. Lawerence boy brought home a sepcial surpirse...the father. He came home just in time before Beth got sick again. Soon after she died. Amy went off to Europe with her Aunt March and Mr.Lawerence and the boy Mr.Lawerence were there. The boy fell in love with Amy. They soon got married.When they came home everyone was surprised. It was a great celebration. Meg was married,then Amy was married, then Jo was soon to be married. They all celebrated and lived happily ever after."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Meg Jo Beth and Amy could be alive today They are the kind of people you care what happens to them and though some of the values are old fashioned the girls were probably modern for their day"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Little Women is one of the best books I've ever read. I like the TV show &quot;Little Men&quot; so my mom suggested I read the &quot;beginning of the story.&quot; I was reluctant at first, but once I got into it I couldn't put it down! I like how all of the 4 sisters were close to eachother. Amy really got on my nerves because she was so snobby and ladylike, but all of the other characters were interesting. It is definitely one I'll read again."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Most people either hate or love Salinger's novel because they either relate to it or they don't; Little Women was a novel in the same way. If my 53 year old dad read this, he would not have appreciated it as much as 19 year old me, who loves Jo and Beth the most because they struck a chord in my heart. Alcott, more than any other author, invites you warmly to sit on the couch with the Marches as they laugh, cry, think, and charm you right into their home and their lives. I was a silent cousin while reading this novel, and I still think Jo and Laurie should be together. Feminists, put your guards down because this book is not about submission or female inferiority, it is about overcoming everything with love, both for males and females. Don't watch the movie EVER. You'd strip away all the justice of Alcott's classic by watching the Cliff Notes."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This book is by far the most compelling book of the century. This book shows the struggles and hardships of four girls and the people around them. Throughout the book, there are many difficult situation that the girls have to overcome. If you haven't read this book, you really should because it redefines our modern day concepts of family life and love."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Many people think diferently from me about the point the author wanted to put across in her writing. I think that the author wanted us to see the struggle that everyday life can be for the rich and poor alike.I also thought that she potrayed the girls as wanting to be good, becuase she wanted us to realize that deep down inside of all of us there is a part that wants to do its best."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Little Women is a great book for anyone to read! It is a tear-jerker but at the same time it a laugh-out -loud great book. What is everyone waiting for ? Get up and read this great book!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I'm not usually the type of person who likes to read, but when I started reading &quot;Little Women&quot;, I could not stop. I read for hours a day, often with a flashlight in the middle of the night. I cryed when they cryed, and laughed when they laughed. I felt as if the March sisters were my own, and Marmee was my second mother. As I read, I would loose myself into a world filled with love, warmth, tragedy, and hope. I have two sisters of my own, and as I read, I realized how special they are to me. The book inspired me to be a better person. I recomend this book to any woman, young or old, for the chronicles of the March family are not just a story, but a lesson in the true meaning of life;love."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I was introduced to LITTLE WOMEN at the age of 12 or 13. I have read it scores of times since and loved it unceasingly. I have cried with the March sisters, shared their joys, their tragedies, rejoiced in their triumphs, and laughed at their mishaps.

Thanks"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I read this book as a young girl and thoroughly enjoyed it then. Forty plus years on I enjoyed it just as much if not more the second time round. A book of it's time, very engaging and endearing the story follows four sisters throughout their moral upbringing to womanhood. Lots of lessons are learned by all four of the sisters, Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy. who all have very different characters. Much laughter, fun and sad times too, the mother is portrayed as a loving, nurturing parent who directs her children through trial, tribulations and turbulent times. I would definitiely recommend for a heart warming story. I read it in abou four long stints, so be prepared to put some time on one side!Denise12/12/23"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I have long been a fan of Louisa May Alcott and highly recommend Little Women be read to younger children as well as for teens. The engaging girls in this story are examined for their faults as well as their virtues. While it is an old fashioned tale, the message is timeless regarding choices that are made by young people. Also highly recommend &#34;Eight Cousins&#34; and it's sequel, &#34;Rose in Bloom&#34; by LMA."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I was pleasantly surprised by \\"Little Women.\\" It was one of the best books I have ever read.

I was a little surprised to see how small the actual copy was as the copy I had years ago was very thick and bulky.

As the reader is taken through the journey of each of the girls lives, they are introduced to valuable lessons. It is a lovely and inspiring book."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Little Women is about a time and a place that our generation knows nothing about. I'm 36, and the world today is nothing like the world when Little Women was written. It's a great story about a mother and her daughters, and their struggles and joys at a time when the country is at war and their father/husband must go off and fight. The story is filled with happiness and sorrow, love and pain."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"The characters , you got to feel like you really got to know each one of them and you could feel the love between them like every family should be but which very few families really are. It is a long book and that was good with me because i didn't want it to end."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"The beginning is very slow and hard to get into, but once u get to the middle it is a very fun, lighthearted piece. I will say I don&#8216;t think there is a clear point to the story other thenLife never turns out exactly as you plan."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I really liked Little Women... the only problem was that in some parts the book got a little boring and wordy. I read this book as a school assignment, and had to read it in one week. I'm eleven, so it wasn't too hard to finish it before the due date ,but it was really good, and some of the parts in the book made it worth it. I liked Jo the best because she was really tomboyish, which was nice and different from all the other characters. For all of the people who read Little Women I recommend reading The Diary of Anne Frank, because it.... well, actually it doesn't really have to do with Little Women at all. I guess it's just a really good book. The part I liked most in Little Women was when, at the end, everyone got married and was happy! Well, almost everyone. Beth didn't."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I read Little Women as a girl and loved it so I was excited to have the opportunity to review an audio production of the book. However, I was quite surprised when the audio book abruptly ended in the middle of the story. I discovered that Little Women was originally two volumes: Little Women and Good Wives. They were first published together as one book titled Little Women in 1880. Most versions of Little Women published today are both volumes together in one book. This audio recording is just the first volume. Because what most people read as Little Women is actually both volumes, I feel like there should have been some indication on the box somewhere that this audio book does not include the second volume.(I don't want to spoil it for anyone who may not have read it yet so I'll say this - remember the Friends episode when Rachel convinces Joey to read Little Women? And he has to put the book in the freezer because of one particularly sad part? This audiobook ends before that sad part happens.)Even though this book was written more than one-hundred years ago, it still has relevance today. I think that the four March girls and Marmee have some good lessons to teach young girls that are timeless. Reading it now as a mother myself, I marveled at Marmee's patience and wisdom. I could learn a lot from her! I was very impressed at how independent and free-thinking the girls and their mother were given the time period the book was written in and took place. (Of course, Louisa May Alcott was a Unitarian so I shouldn't have been surprised at that.)Lorelei King narrated this audio book. I thought she did a great job for the most part. The two voices I didn't like were Beth and Amy's. I thought Beth's was too breathy and Amy's was too babyish - they didn't sound realistic to me. Overall, I enjoyed this audio production. My biggest complaint is that it left unexpectedly hanging at the end."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"A classic I always enjoy reading. Such an endearing story. Timeless characters that you love to come visit again and again."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This book had such an impact on me as a kid, it was fun to re-read it. I love the Jo character and really identify with her. I think it's interesting that even though it was set in the past, the concerns of the girls are very similar to those of people today. While each person wanted something different in life, they were all things I could identify with. It may be a classic, but the writing is still easy to read in current times. It moves quickly and I can see why it continues to be popular. If you haven't read this one, read it!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This was actually the first book that I read on the kindle available for my phone and I was slightly skeptical.

At first I thought that it would be a girlish book, and I did not accept the offer. I will now mention that I LOVE to read. Several years later, one of my very good friends that had the same taste as I handed it to me and said, &quot;Read it.&quot; I obeyed and it turned out to be one of the best books that I had ever read. This classic story about the March sisters and their joys, hardships, and growing up has proved to be a great lesson to me and my friends. My favorite character is Beth (although I am nothing like her) because she is exactly like the person tht everyone wants to be. She is so kind and thoughtful, but so humble about her generosity. If you have not read this book, I highly reccomend that you do!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I would have rated this book a 5, except the author played with me the whole time, when all I wanted was for her to get down to the point.

This book has a very strong romantic field, but yet it has all of our child hood fantacies. The story is about four remarkable young girls, and as the pages turn they all grow up. Each one finds thier own love but desperate times happen more often. I love this book and, I think that this is a remarkable story of four sisters growing up together. As you read this book you may feel sad but everyone faces tough times. So read this book, It truly is worth reading."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Little Women is a charming book for all ages old and young. It has been cherished in our libraries for so many years and it never gets old. The story is one of four sisters battling not only with perosnal issues but family issues. The March family is not exaclty wealthy and they must find their money is places they wish not to. But despite their financial issues the sisters make believe they live in other places, putting on theatricals, plays, making up clubs and tellong their most apauling secrets. With their father in the Civil War and their mother having the reputation of helping a young black girl, Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy must search for ways to fit in. The book tells their story from when they are young girls in the Pickwick Portfoliio, to young women getting married and having a family of their own.I can relate to this book a lot because having sisters of my own I went and still go through a lot of the same things. When my sisters and I were little girls we played with eachother and made up games together much like the March sisters. And as we a growing older we find that life is not always as simple as when we were kids, like Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy all find out together. The book captures the essence and wonderful things to come when you have a sister that you love and care for and can tell all your secrets to. When you doubt yourself your sister will back you up and love you no matter what. There is nothing like a sister and to quote the book, \\" a sister's bond is one which that is stronger than marriage\\"."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I read this book when I was 12 and I can't remember how many times I've read it in total. I think every child growing up should know this story. It's a classic. It's enchanting and heart warming and I'm sure boys and girls alike would enjoy it. The movies are also enjoyable. There are 3 versions that I can think of."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I finally read Little Women last Christmas break after seeing all of the movie versions many times. I like the movies but nothing compares to the book. Even though it was written so long ago and I expected it to be hard to read, this story really touched my heart. If you have always wanted to read this book, you should do it!!! I put off reading it for so long and I was so glad when I finally read it. The themes of family and love abound and will really move you.

It has humour and warmth writtn into it. A Great book. Really a must-read. If there was a 6 stars mark i would have given it to Little Women:)"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This book is my favorite of Mrs. Alcott's. It's wonderfully done; extremely descriptive. It is realistic, with ups and downs. Each character has its own personality; nothing has ever been like it before, in all my almost 13 years. It really takes you back in time, as if you are really there. My favorite character was Beth; I cried really hard when she died!! Jo was creative; Beth was a darling; Amy was prissy; Meg was vain. I liked how Beth was close to her cats, and I also liked how she \\"took in\\" rejected dolls. I also loved the fact that Jo was a writer, because that's what I am; I just LOVE to write stories, especially about horses. I recomend this book to any old fashioned girl like me."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Have you ever thought about what it would be like to live during the Cicil War? Little women, by Louisa May Alcott is a sterling example of this. In Little Women, there's a family of seven. Marmee(the mom);Meg, Joe, Beth, and Amy(sisters), a maid, and the father who is a chaplain in the Civil War. The sisters are good friends until their handsome neighbor Teddy moves in with his grandfather. Then they start vying each other for his attention. Through all this, there are fires, dances, family problems, etc. Towards the end one of the sisters dies from scarlet fever.Little Women is a book written for middle to high scholl students. The language it is written in, and some of the things that happen would confuse elementary. It;s a very good book for sisters, friends, etc because it teaches you not to become jealous.Little Women can be both sad and humorous at times. Throughout the story the dialouge switches back in forth. For example, when Amy was talking to Joe she said \\"You like Teddy, You like Teddy\\". Then in the same paragraph it talks about there father. At sometimes the girls are happy with each other, while sometimes they are angry. For a chapter at the end it's very sad when one of the sisters dies.The content of the book is very good. It goes back and forth from fictional stories from the civil war to non-fictional stories. A lot of the places in the book are real to. For examole, Virginia. The book teaches a very good moral. Not just for sisters but for anybody. It teaches you not to get jealous, and yearn for things others have or want.If you want to read a fictional story about sisters set in the Civil War, then this book is for you!!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I just finished reading Louisa May Alcott's Little Women and I thought it was okay. Some of the problems that she wrote about I would not have to worry about today. One problem that I wouldn't have to worry about would be having a good dress to wear to a party,like Jo had to. Not many girls wear a lot of dresses to parties. Some parts of the book were better than others,like when all the girls pitched in money to buy a present for their Mom instead of themselves. Louisa May Alcott also wrote the book kind of like a sequal to Little Women called Little Men,if you would like to know what happens with Jo."},{"Title":"Undertones of War","review":"I was inspired to read this book by a visit to the Thiepval War Memorial this past Spring.During World War I, Blunden served as an officer in the Royal Sussex regiment. He fought through the war to its end, serving in the battles of both Ypres and the Somme.Undertones of War is the memoir which he wrote about that period.Delicately written and insistent, Undertones of War focuses on both the nostalgia for the countryside left behind and on the deep sorrow of trench warfare. It is a lovely and haunting little memoir. The Penguin edition is bound with a selection of Blunden's poetry. This works well for the overall effect of the book.Recommended, particularly for those with an interest in World War I or military memoirs."},{"Title":"Undertones of War","review":"\\"A pleasant summer-evening read\\"? So says a negative reviewer. Huh?Undertones of War is, with those by Siegfried Sassoon and Robert Graves, one of the best English memoirs of the First World War (John Lucy's 'There's A Devil in the Drum' is by far the best British memoir, and perhaps the best of all time). Blunden is, however, more subtle than they. An intellectual and poet, he portrays himself as a \\"pastoralist at war,\\" and pays especial regard to the sacrilegious impact of war on the countryside--and life. And while his style may not provide the in-your-face appeal so dear to many American readers, it rewards the careful reader with an elegant, insightful view of the meaning of war.Yet it can also be brutally honest. Who can forget the eyeball on the duckboard?Read it while listening to Ralph Vaughan Williams' 'Pastoral Symphony' #3, which was composed behind the front lines of WWI. It goes with the book.I have read hundreds of World War I memoirs. This book remains in my top five. Take your time reading it. Ponder it. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Undertones of War","review":"Right up there with Graves' Good-Bye To All That, Undertones takes you right into the trenches of the Western Front. I re-read every few years."},{"Title":"Undertones of War","review":"This is a great book. Unlike Seigfried Sasson's \\"Memoirs of George Sherston\\" or Robert Graves \\"Good-Bye to All That\\" or Vera Brittain's \\"Testament of Youth\\", Blunden's book has no non-war introductory chapters. You are simply in the war from the outset of the book. Blunden arrived on the scene - the Western Front - at age 19 in time for the Somme offensive of July 1916. His writing has a poetic sense to it and sometimes the beauty of nature and Blunden's recording of it appear as a wonderful counterpart to the killing and agony going on almost everywhere Blunden happened to be. Although nature doesn't make-up for the horrors of World War I with its poison gas, rat filled trenches, relentless artillery, murderous machine guns and loss of friends and comrades, it is a tribute to Blunden's mind that he could take the time and remind us of the resolute qualities of nature. It also gives us an opportunity to get a sense of what soldiers on that front may have experienced by way of gettting away from the battles and wondering how they still lived. From the Somme offensive - a terrible slaughterhouse in its own right - Blunden is moved to Ypres just in time to be part of the Third Battle of Ypres. In this battle the blunders, the rain, the mud, the death, the confusion are everywhere on display. Fortunately Blunden survived it all and was able to chronicle this sad, sad war in a most poetic manner."},{"Title":"Undertones of War","review":"Blunden set out to be honest, not to embellish, to tell it like it was. And succeeded magnificently. As others have commented, it can feel like hard going compared with Graves or Sassoon - there are some rather obscure references and tangents; but if read with the necessary patience - that is to say, with respect for the way in which Blunden has clearly measured every word a dozen times in his quest for accuracy - it is a deeply rewarding book, and takes one down into the gutter-like trenches, the putrid mud and the thudding nightmare of minenwerfers and nine-fives like no other. A book that absolutely cannot be rushed."},{"Title":"Undertones of War","review":"This is a classic memoir by an English intellectual who was drawn into the massacres on the western front as a young officer from 1916 to 1918. Beautifully, elegantly written with an understated elegiac tone of a thinking man seeing his world destroyed. I'm keeping this on my book shelf. I probably won't read it again, but I just feel better having it there, along with other books that have made a real impact on me."},{"Title":"Undertones of War","review":"I bought this book due to the author's being a poet thinking that only a poet could best write of great war and trench experience. The quality of writing is very good with passages of excellence. An area of frustration was his reticence of his own experiences. Two of special note was failing to mention how he earned the military cross (possibly this was not to be covered in this book) and another was the landing of a dud artillery round near him with no personal reaction."},{"Title":"Undertones of War","review":"The writing is too flowery for what it is about. There are times that it is difficult to imagine that he is in a battlefield of carnage, waste, and mud rather than out on a rambuctious hunting party. He seemed to be somehwat disconnected from the fighting; he rarely mentioned his own emotions or fears and his descriptions of battle are somewhat vague. If you don't reagrd it as a book about WWI and think of it as strictly literature it can be a pleasant summer-evening read."},{"Title":"Discovering the New Testament: Community and Faith","review":"From the book:This book is a solid scholarly contribution to the introductory college level study of the New Testament.

If you've seen comparisons of the various Bible versions, the NASB generally is described as the most literal version (word-for-word accuracy) of the Bible that sometimes suffers in readability for that very reason. I believe the reputation has been largely undeserved. There were occasional awkward constructions but, all in all, it was quite readable. With this version they have gone back over sentence structure, vocabulary, etc. with a view toward improving the readability and flow of the language. They have also removed archaic words like Thee and Thou. I think they have succeeded in producing a readable translation without compromising the accuracy. We now have a literal, word-for-word translation that reads with the best of the modern versions.With this pocket NT with Psalms and Proverbs, I think they have done an excellent job balancing overall size of the Bible and font size/layout. It is small enough to comfortably fit in your pocket, but it is also quite comfortable to read. The quality is outstanding as are all the other Foundation Publications products I have seen. They really do a great job publishing Bibles.Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"New American Standard New Testament with Psalms and Proverbs; Blue Imitation Leather","review":"Finally found a pocket-sized New Testament that is readable.

FOr a personal study Bible, I would recommend the ESV. But the NASB would be my second choice.But that isn't even what this review is about. It is supposed to be about this little pocket version in particular. I like it. I did give it four stars because the cover is not very protective of the pages. I have a little New King James Version that I was given by the Gideon's and it's cover is much more protective. But still I take this little guy to school every day with me and it holds up.

It's a bit bigger than the NKJV Gideon's NT+ that I was carrying, so it sticks a 1/2 inch out of any shirt pocket. The print is a good size, and I find myself using it often.I like the NASB, but there are a few points I wish they'd done differently. (#1) Before the 95 updated version (and in the ASV and RSV), there was always a footnote on Matthew 19:9 saying that some ancient versions read like Matthew 5:32. This touches a very important doctrine, divorce and remarriage, and the footnoted variant should have been made the main reading, as it is from earliest reliable manuscripts, and is the only variant cited in early Christian writings. (#2) In 1 Corinthians 11, two different Greek words are both rendered \\"covering\\". The ASV distinquished by rendering one of these as \\"veiling\\", and the RSV maintained that distinction, but the NASB has blurred it by using one English word for both. (#3) In 1 Peter 3:3, the word \\"merely\\" is inserted, which waters down the real intent of the passage. At least it's still clear in 1 Timothy 2:9 that women should shun jewelry, etc.. The NASB is good about italicizing these added words so that you know what they added, but it would've been better to leave that word out (like the ESV does).It's because of \\"small\\" things like these that some conservative churches still use the KJV as the bible they can trust for doctrine."},{"Title":"New American Standard New Testament with Psalms and Proverbs; Blue Imitation Leather","review":"Great pocket size, this is the second one I purchased, so I must like it and plan on getting my to give away.

It is also probably the best Old Testament volume in the Word series. Biblical specialists will find a wealth of information here, including Williamson's detailed arguments about authorship, date, and history of composition of these books. It was Williamson, along with Sara Japhet, who finally broke the decade old consensus that the Chronicler wrote Ezra and Nehemiah. His previous arguments on this issue are significantly advanced in the commentary. Williamson's translation and text-critical notes are detailed and thorough. At the same time, Williamson's discussions of literary structure, his careful exegesis, and his theological commentary should be accessble and of great value for non-specialists. Some advances have been made on archaelogical and sociological issues over the decade and a half since this commentary was written, but it still stands as the best single reference to these two biblical books."},{"Title":"Word Biblical Commentary Vol. 16, Ezra-nehemiah (williamson), 470pp","review":"We just finished an expository preaching series at our church on Nehemiah during which I picked this commentary up to delve deeper as I follow along with the series. This commentary along with the New International Commentary on the Old Testament (NICOT) by Charles Fensham as well as Derek Kidner's (Tyndale Old Testament) according to various sources seem to make up the top three commentaries on the books of Ezra and Nehemiah.This is a great commentary. The Word Biblical series can be more difficult as far as navigating the actual book goes compared to other series. The author provides plenty of historical context while at the same time seeking to provide helpful and faithful exegesis. This commentary is more lengthy and technical than both Kidner's and Fensham's (NICOT). I actually chose this one as my favorite technical commentary for Nehemiah after spending a few weeks with the one by Fensham. I found this commentary to be more faithful to the text, helping to clarify it's meaning, and showing it's part in the Biblical storyline. I would recommend this as a very helpful commentary as one seeks to study and meditate further on the book of Nehemiah.Remember that the more commentaries and opinions you can read (from perspectives that are trying to be biblically faithful) the better. The point is not to believe everything exactly as the commentator says, but to use his expertise and research to ask better and deeper questions of the text of the Bible. Commentaries are helpful, but only when they are in submission to the Bible as fallible, yet helpful resources."},{"Title":"Word Biblical Commentary Vol. 16, Ezra-nehemiah (williamson), 470pp","review":"This was recommended to me by Dr. Tigay of the University of Pennsylvania as the best English language commentary on the subject.

Whose fault was it? Why the Jews, of course! Borrow this from the library, along with \\"They Dare To Speak Out,\\" and you'll find that Findley is nothing more than a bitter ex-politico, looking for someone to blame for his electoral ineptitude."},{"Title":"Deliberate Deceptions: Facing the Facts About the U.S.-Israeli Relationship","review":"Why Paul Findley hates Israel is not clear. What is clear is that he has written a book with lies from the Arab world.The U.S.-Israeli Relationship is the only democratic relationship in the middle east. Let's respect it, not attack it."},{"Title":"Deliberate Deceptions: Facing the Facts About the U.S.-Israeli Relationship","review":"\\"Deliberate Deceptions\\" is the second Paul Findley book I have read. The first, of course, was \\"They Dare to Speak Out.\\" Findley, a former congressman from Illinois, is a crusader for truth in the relationship between Israel and the United States. In \\"They Dare to Speak Out,\\" Findley discusses the sinister influence of the pro-Israel lobby on American government. In this book, Findley broadens his criticism well beyond the borders of lobbying. The importance of Findley's books take on additional dimensions of meaning since the terrorist attacks of last summer.\\"Deliberate Deceptions\\" exposes serious concerns about Israeli-U.S. relations. Findley argues, convincingly, that Israel is an aggressive, hostile state that will stop at nothing to further its own ends at the expense of others. Israel suctions billions of dollars out of U.S. coffers, with special deals on loans and military hardware that no other country in the world gets. Israel also has the bomb and refuses to allow international inspections of its facilities in the Negev desert. Findley reveals Israel's spy networks in the United States, its cozy relationship with the South African government (during the Apartheid era), and its tendency to resell American military technologies for self-enrichment. The amount of statements and evidence Findley marshals is both amazing and disgusting. Where is the United States government when all of this is happening? It's in large part our government that reinforces this bad behavior. Politicians, according to Findley, are scared of Israel's lobby and influence. The result is that the U.S. turns a blind eye to these shenanigans.The Palestinians are the primary victims of Israel's aggression. Since the founding of Israel, the Palestinians have endured non-stop forced deportations, land seizures, violence, torture, and murder. Occasionally, the Palestinian people tire of Israel and events like the Intifada occur. Findley shows how Israel responds to these incidents by instituting policies that encourage soldiers to break bones and attack children and senior citizens. Palestinians that are considered citizens of Israel are treated as second-class citizens, as Israel considers itself a purely Jewish nation. The United Nations runs itself ragged denouncing Israel for its actions towards the Palestine people, and Findley provides a list of UN edicts towards Israel that is staggering to behold. Findley argues that great strides could be made in the Palestinian-Israeli problem if Israel would quit building settlements in occupied territory and withdraw to its UN mandated borders. Israel refuses to do this, and the whole world has to deal with the fallout, with endless peace plans and negotiations that go nowhere.One of my criticisms with the book concerns Findley's account of the Intifada. Findley lists how many Palestinians were detained, murdered, and injured. I think he should have included figures on how many Jews were killed in the uprising. This would bolster his arguments better, in my opinion, as those numbers are probably lower than the Palestinian numbers. Still, this book is shocking in its implications and should be read by all Americans. I recommend reading this book before reading \\"They Dare to Speak Out.\\""},{"Title":"Deliberate Deceptions: Facing the Facts About the U.S.-Israeli Relationship","review":"For those who find themselves confused and misinformed, because of the sheer flow of distorted information and propaganda regarding the Palestinian question and Middle East crisis, I would strongly recommend this book. Here Findley portraits, in a readable and simple fashion, the basic illusions under which the american public has been nurtured, regarding the true intentions and policies of the theocratic government in Israel, and the suppression of palestinians fundamental human rights.This is a book that must be read to aquire a more balanced view of the Middle East drama, specially now that the fundamental right of a Palestinian State to exist is being again denied by the ortodox driven government of Sharon.Here you will find, in a very simple and understandable presentation, the basic information about the British ill fated handling of the palestinian land; the meaning of the Balfour Declaration; an explanation of the U.N. Resolutions regarding the State of Israel and its policies; and revealing facts about the deceptions and the wars that have been fought, not usually presented in a truthful manner to the american voters.Only if the true facts are known, and this is why one must read this book, the appalling tragedy of the palestinian people can be understood. Only then, will it be possible for the U.S. to shape a different foreign policy towards the Middle East based on the premise that all fanatical and totalitarian views must be abandoned, including those of the right wing in Israel, in order to seek a solution to the problem. The U.S. has unduly financed and permitted, through a miopic view of the situation, the furtherance of an expansionistic vision by Sharon, and the destruction of Palestinian Authority. This will not stop until the cries of the moderate Israeli politicians prevail. On the other hand, the problems that terrorism has brought to America will increase if we keep giving unconditionally military aid to a country that practices terroristic tactics with our weapons, while we preach to the world that we are on a crusade against terrorism. Double standards must be put to an end because now they are directly jeopardazing our security and our fundamental interests.Findley has been persecuted because of his books and his quest to present the required material to form an objective view of the situation. For this, he has been named an anti-semite. But we dont need more propaganda. JUST THE FACTS. AND FACTS SET FORTH IN THIS BOOK CAN AND HAVE BEEN VERIFIED. If Findley were a jew, he would be called a self-denier like the jew professors and moderate Israeli politicians that have valiantly revealed those same facts, and cannot accept that a sistematic violation of human rights, no matter the motivations, is being perpetrated by the same people that suffered brutally at the hand of Hitler."},{"Title":"Deliberate Deceptions: Facing the Facts About the U.S.-Israeli Relationship","review":"Findley has researched his subject carefully and is in a personal position to know what he's talking about. The American-Isreali relationship richly deserves the close scrutiny he has given it in this book. A must read for anyone interested in the current situation in the Middle East."},{"Title":"Deliberate Deceptions: Facing the Facts About the U.S.-Israeli Relationship","review":"BY FAR ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS PUBLISHED ON THIS HORRENDOUS DRAIN ON AMERICAN TAXPAYERS DOLLERS. PAUL FINDLEY IS A TRUE AMERICAN TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM OPENLY AND WITH ENDLESS DOCUMENTATION. VERY BALANCED ON THE FALLACYS AND FACTS. WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO SOMEONE WANTING TO UNDERSTAND THE LOPSIDED PRO ISRAELI ATTATUDE IN AMERICAN GOVERMENT AND THE MEDIA."},{"Title":"Deliberate Deceptions: Facing the Facts About the U.S.-Israeli Relationship","review":"Findley's book represents a very fine introduction any person could have to the topic of Israel, Palestine and the United States. It covers almost all major historical points of the conflict, as well as Israeli-American relations and the Israeli Lobby. Findley's goal is to present the many wrong doings of Israel toward Palestinians, Arabs, AND Americans; he certainly is not trying to present a balanced view on the topic. This book is an alternative to the view presented by Western media which, in my view, is almost dedicated to vindicating Israel from most of its wrong doings.In the introduction Findley explains how, countrary to what is being presented to the public, the Israeli left (Labor) is actually more dangerous than the right (Likud) in the sense that both work towards the same goals (e.g. increase illegal settlements), but while the right does it in-your-face style, the left preach one thing while doing the other. In the book, Findley also talks about the many Arab initiatives for peace offers and how Israel turned them all down as they included the return of Israel to the June 4th, 1967 line to which Israel opposes.Many times the breadth covered in the book limits the depth of the addressed issue. On the whole however, for a beginner who gets his news from the usual sources: CBS, CNN, NBC, ABC, U.S News &amp; World Report, NY Times, Washington Post, Findley's book is the missing link and a major hole filler. Most of the issues discussed in it are rarely, or addressed only in-the-passing in the main stream. These include: Israeli attack on the USS Liberty and the U.S. refusal to conduct a propper followup investigation, Israeli cooperation with Apartheid S. Africa, passing of American technology to China and Russia, Israel's Nuclear program, the colossal U.S. Aid, Christian population decline, Israel's discrimination policies towards non-Jewish citizens, and the Palestinian refugee problem.Almost every statement made is properly referenced, which adds to the value of the book. Every topic and sub-topic is addressed by first listing a &quot;Fallacy&quot;, which is a statement made, often, by a pro-Israel person or group on that topic. Then a few paragraphs would follow, titled &quot;Fact&quot;, aimed at refuting the fallacy by listing many facts. Most statements used for refutation are quotations by Israeli (mostly), American, and Arab leaders, such as Rabin, Meir, Dayan, Begin, as well as many Israeli, British and American historians and connoisseurs, such as Beit-Halhami, Sachar, Chomsky, Morris, Pape, Cockburn, Eban, and Melman.As an introduction and a quick reference, the book deserves a 9/10, with the only drawback being the lack of depth on some of the topics."},{"Title":"Deliberate Deceptions: Facing the Facts About the U.S.-Israeli Relationship","review":"An outstanding book in explaning who is controlling US policy in the Middle East.Paul tells you the facts and nothing but the facts.....this is a book that is worth reading if you are wondering what is happening in US politics and who is controlling what is going on inside and outside America.You should also consider reading \\"The Holocaust Industry\\" by Norman Finkelstein.

No matter what anyone says about this book being slightly unbalanced, one thing remains true. And that truth is that Mr. Findly gives a reference to every single claim and fact that he makes. A book is only as good as how well it is researched and if the author gives references to check his own work then it is in this context that true academic scholarship is presented. Two thumbs up. Bravo. I can never look at the Arab/Israeli conflict in the same light again. If you think Paul fundly is lying all you have to do is read his well documented sources. It almost seemed as if there was a reference in every sentence of the book. A must read to all political science students. Also shown is the nature of Israels apartheid regime and the complacency of our government to allow this."},{"Title":"Deliberate Deceptions: Facing the Facts About the U.S.-Israeli Relationship","review":"I read &quot;They Dare to Speak Out&quot; and it opened my eyes.

If you want to read what really happened, instead of reading propaganda, read this book!"},{"Title":"Deliberate Deceptions: Facing the Facts About the U.S.-Israeli Relationship","review":"Former U.S. Congressman Findley points out in this book how Israeli propaganda has succeeded in presenting the American public with a misleading picture of Middle East events. He also demonstrates the difficulties successive American governments have faced when they tried to influence policies of the state of Israel which ran counter to those of the world at large.The book comes in three parts which are : Statehood and Conquest; Collusion and Conflict; Perils to Peace. In addition the book contains: a list of major organizations focused on Middle East policy, notes which document the statements made as well as a good bibliography. In each of the three parts Findley takes brief statements from Israeli sources, the press, and individuals who are friendly to the policies of the state of Israel and compares them with actual events that have transpired. It is apparent that the American public has been and continues to be skillfully misled by propaganda efforts which insist that the policies of the state of Israel are identical with the interests of the United States.From the Israeli standpoint this is perfectly understandable because a small embattled nation requires the powerful support only the United States can give. Findley provides a much needed American perspective from his personal experiences in Congress and meticulous research of the relevant literature. He also points out that the commonly perceived fundamental difference between a Likud and a Labor government is more in terms of tactics rather than goals. Both types of government want to preserve and expand the settlements in the occupied territories. The book was published in 1993 and subsequent events have proven Findley correct. It is becoming quite apparent that, regardless of who is in power in Jerusalem, the coalition governments are averse to a genuinely sovereign Palestinian state which has contiguous borders. Although lip service is being paid to &quot;autonomy,&quot; which can be interpreted in different ways, the facts on the ground are steadily being altered in Israel's favor, and United Nations resolutions are steadfastly ignored. Findley lists 69 specific resolutions (from 1948-1990) critical of Israel's policies and documents how America consistently vetoed, as the only Security Council member, Resolutions which might have investigated or alleviated the plight of the occupied Palestinian people. This fact alone shows an enormous bias in U.S. foreign policy in favor of Jerusalem's governments and does not give us credibility as an &quot;honest broker&quot; of the conflict either in Arab eyes or in those of the rest of the world.In order to make his points, Findley is at times somewhat repetitive but since the topic is so important and relatively neglected by American non-Jewish authors that is a minor fault. Since events continue to go from bad to worse in the Middle East, and the United States is still throwing its full weight behind Israel's policies, we are now reaping the fruits of our conduct. Deny it as we might in our media, our unquestioned support of Israel's policies is one factor which has led us into our current &quot;War on Terrorism&quot; and this war cannot be won as long as we do not act in an even-handed manner.Findley's book deserves to be updated but even in its current version should be required reading for all who are in influential positions in government and the media. To ignore or villify the book will become increasingly dangerous."},{"Title":"Age-Proof Your Mind: Detect, Delay, and Prevent Memory Loss--Before It's Too Late","review":"One night I spent a good hour frantically searching for my cell phone, which I thought I had misplaced.

Apparently, they were both very popular back when they were first published, in the late 1890s, but have become mostly forgotten. They're more novellas than anything; Detective isn't even 100 pages long. The illustrations are really good, and I plan on buying the other volumes in the Mark Twain Library, each of which include the original illustrations that were present in the first editions. Both Abroad and Detective are entertaining, but they're not in the mold of the Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. You know how in Huckleberry Finn, Huck goes through all these little misadventures, all the while growing up and gaining all kinds of wisdom, and then in the end, the book takes a harsh turn and goes back to the juvenile exploits of Tom Sawyer, when he and Huck try to free Jim? It's like the end of the book really doesn't have much to do with the rest of it, it's just Huck and Tom doing dumb, yet funny, kid stuff. Well, both Abroad and Detective are like that; only very occasionally do you get any of Huck's unique flashes of insight. Jim himself only appears in Abroad, which is a fantasy tale in which he, Tom, and Huck happen to be kidnapped onto a high-tech balloon (!) and go across the Atlantic to Africa. There's really not much of a plot or resolution, they just float along over the desert, Tom tells them about the Arabian Nights, and Jim gets stranded on the head of the Sphinx for a little while. Abroad picks up not long after the events in the Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, and apparently Detective picks up not long after Abroad, though the events that transpired in Abroad are never mentioned in Tom Sawyer, Detective. Maybe Twain considered Abroad more of a whimsical tale, something that never really happened. Who knows...but I think Detective was the better of the two, even though Jim doesn't even appear in the book, and it's more of a mystery novel than anything. Huck basically plays the role of the reporter in Detective, just relating all of the incidents he witnessed in an unusual murder/crime, and describing Tom Sawyer's scene-stealing exploits in the trial that follows. Many of the characters that appeared in the last half of Adv. of Huck Finn make a return appearance in Detective. But anyway, both books are enjoyable to read, especially considering that both are written in the 1st person, from Huck's perspective, yet don't read them expecting the depth and emotion that are found in the Adv. of Huck Finn. I think these books were written for a younger audience, and that's how they read. But, for a frustrating, yet very interesting look into what might have been, had Twain finished his other two planned sequels to Huckleberry Finn, you should check out the book &quot;Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer Among the Indians,&quot; which contains two unfinished sequels that are both heads and tails better than Abroad and Detective: Among the Indians and Tom Sawyer's Conspiracy. But that's all I have to say about that."},{"Title":"Tom Sawyer Abroad and Tom Sawyer, Detective (Mark Twain Library)","review":"This book picks up right after the hallaballo has died down from Tom and Huck's triumphal return. Tom kinda craves notoriety as he competes for the unofficial title of Hannibal's First Traveler. Kidnapped by a mad inventor Tom, Huck and Jimfind themselves sailing in a hot-air balloon. They eventually realize that they are alone over the Atlantic, but when they sight land, it is not Europe! This first-person story is narrated with youthful zest and slangy vocabulary by an admiring Huck, so that he can praise Tom's leadership skills and power of argument.The three unprepared argonauts finally understand that they are floating over the vast Sahara Desert, where they experience a variety of adventures--interspersed with juvenile deductions and lively debate. Their challenges are right out of the Arabian Nights: no magic lamp or genies, but Twain serves up caravans, lions, mirages, warring Bedouin tribes, and a devastating sand storm. All this action is spiced with his wry humor, as he slips in snide remarks about more serious social issues (spoken through the mouths of babes). Although this tale is Plot Lite, there's plenty of lively dialogue, as the boys argue using kid logic, while indulging in youthful dreams of sudden fortune. A fun read with sly social criticism. But really, Mark Twain--tigers--in Africa?"},{"Title":"Tom Sawyer Abroad and Tom Sawyer, Detective (Mark Twain Library)","review":"Mark Twain's 1876 novel The Adventures of Tom Sawyer and its 1884 follow-up The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn are two of American literature's most famous works and the latter one of its most acclaimed. It may thus seem strange that 1894's Tom Sawyer Abroad and 1896's Tom Sawyer, Detective are now almost obscure. The truth is that this is not entirely undeserved. Huck Finn is a masterpiece of world literature, and anyone expecting them to be anywhere near it will be sorely disappointed. They lack the more famous work's seriousness and ambitiousness, making them inevitably minor. However, like nearly everything else Twain wrote, they are eminently readable, very entertaining, and often funny. Fans of Twain's lighter work, especially Tom Sawyer, will love them, and there is something for all to appreciate it. They are notable for taking the series and its characters in surprising new directions, for example leaving the rural South for distant Egypt in Abroad and adding character development in both. Though not great literary works in other respects, they perform surprisingly well in the latter area. Those eager for more adventures from Tom, Huck, and Jim will certainly warm to them. Like the book that bears his name, they are narrated by Huck with all his delightfully provincial grammar and spelling; \\"prostitution\\" for \\"prosecution\\" in Detective's court scene is my laugh aloud favorite. His navet&eacute; and ignorance also come into play in skillfully unprecedented ways, particularly in Detective.The two novels are now often packaged together, which makes sense in many ways. Both are short - about one hundred pages each - and of course have many of the same characters and numerous other similarities. Those who like one will probably like the other, making an omnibus convenient and, depending on the edition, perhaps cost efficient. Those who want only bare bones can easily find cheaper editions, but this is the one for enthusiasts. Unlike most versions but like other Mark Twain Library Series entries, this includes the original illustrations, which Twain considered important. Perhaps more notably, they have been carefully edited to ensure accuracy, correcting errors perpetuated for a century, including some expurgations.As for the stories themselves, like most of Twain, they can be read and enjoyed on several levels. Most simply and obviously, they are rollicking, picaresque adventures of the sort later classed as Young Adult or Juvenile. Similarities aside, each is a distinct part of genres then immensely popular - travel and detective fiction respectively. They can be read on these terms alone or as burlesques. There are thus some significant differences despite all the similarities. However, both are notably entertaining and quite humorous even in this limited sense, particularly the dialogue. While far from politically correct by current standards, they can easily be enjoyed by the very young as well as those of all ages who will take it on their own terms.The discerning can see significantly more, even if no one can see greatness. Though less savagely biting than later work, they are vintage Twain satire in many ways. Huck Finn's infamous closing section satirizes Romanticism in its various forms, including medieval ideals of chivalry, and Abroad works similarly. The new target is a type of book then immensely popular - travel adventures like Jules Verne's Around the World in 80 Days. Twain mocks such works' implausibility and superficiality but only gently, arguably even good-naturedly, especially compared to his vicious later satire. We get the feeling that Twain appreciates such books even as he mocks - not least because this story itself can legitimately be taken in such a way, and not without enjoyment. He also throws in a few shots at more serious issues. Those familiar with his life and thought will recognize several - his ongoing feud with Sir Walter Scott's work, his near-fatal run-in with patents, etc. - and laugh appreciatively. He treats these subjects more seriously and bitterly elsewhere, but it is notable that he was able to write of them relatively lightly, if effectively, here.It is indeed remarkable how subtle yet piercing Twain's satire can be even in a minor work like this. An example will suffice. In one scene, Tom sends a letter that says it comes from the \\"welkin.\\" Huck and Jim have never heard the word and are mystified. Tom initially acts as if they are ignorant fools but, when pushed, admits he does not know what it means but that every description of a great noise says that the hubbub was so loud it \\"made the welkin ring.\\" Anyone familiar with the word - or who bothers to look it up - will realize that, while ostensibly only poking fun at the ignorance of rural Southern boys, Twain also mocks writers who use conventional phrases without thought. Those who appreciate such points will see that they are well-made.No one should put Abroad with Twain's great work. Befitting its status, it can be read quickly and easily. It is at least as episodic as Tom Sawyer, and the little plot that exists is highly implausible. Yet even within this we can easily sense repetition and strain, as dialogue starts to seem canned and jokes become overly familiar. It almost seems at times that Twain had a simple template and stretched a little too far. Finally, the ending is very abrupt and a sort of deus ex machina. One may at first feel that Twain could have stretched the adventure out rather longer, even that he ends just as he seems to really get started; the characters after all visit but one country. However, he was right to stop when he did; anything more would have stretched the thinness past the proverbial breaking point. It is no great loss, as what we have is quite good for what it is - and, more importantly, Twain's satirical purpose is accomplished.Detective is in multiple ways very much like Tom Sawyer Abroad and, indeed, The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, not least in returning to the latter's rural South. However, it also differs significantly in obvious ways. First and most clearly, as the title shows, it is a detective story of the kind then very popular; this was after all when Sherlock Holmes was a sensation. Those who, like me, love such stories can appreciate it simply on this level. It is set up like a typical one with a murder mystery and has exciting elements such as a false confession, a dramatic courtroom scene, a climactic discovery, etc. - and, of course, eventual justice. Seeing all this play out is exciting, and Twain milks it for all it is worth. Unlike most of his works, this is filled with literary devices conventionally used for entertainment value, especially in modern popular fiction: foreshadowing, suspense, dramatic irony, etc. The revelation and ending are in particular highly wrought. Anyone who likes blazing stories of this sort, particularly detective ones, will enjoy and appreciate this and find Detective well worth reading for it alone.As for the satire, detective fiction itself is the target, but Twain's burlesque is gentle; we feel he lightly pokes fun at something he himself enjoys - not least because his satire could be far more bitter. He has some fun at the expense of the genre's conventions, using them in slightly exaggerated fashion to show how superficial they can sometimes be. What may seem exaggeration if read straight comes into play here: melodrama, implausibility, clich&eacute;s, etc. This is where Huck's navet&eacute; and ignorance are important. Many, perhaps even most, readers will be able to deduce some - or even all - of the ostensibly revelatory events, turning what would normally be suspense into dramatic irony. Those who miss the satire may think of these as defects, but those who see what Twain is doing will know they are intentional knocks at a) provincial Southern ignorance, and b) detective fiction conventions. Even simply moving from popular detective settings - i.e., Victorian England - to Twain's rural South makes the genre seem slightly ridiculous. However, that the story itself can still be enjoyable shows that the genre can as well. Indeed, Twain's satire is so subtle that many, perhaps especially detective fiction fans, will not even notice it - with whatever ambiguous result. As for those who dislike the genre, they may well like the story significantly more - indeed, may think it a riot. Twain at any rate did not cut off his satirical take on the genre here, returning several years later with the novella \\"A Double-Barreled Detective Story,\\" which drops Tom and Huck but actually has Holmes(!) and is significantly more biting.Tom Sawyer, Detective is thus quite a strange book - a light-hearted satire that most will not get and that many will likely enjoy for the very reasons Twain tries to mock. Its canonical status depends on how well one thinks he succeeds here. It will certainly delight fans of the associated stories and characters. The story itself is better than Tom Sawyer Abroad, arguably even better than The Adventures of Tom Sawyer; it has more plot than either, and characterization is strong. Conversely, there is significantly less humor, especially in the dialogue, except for those unusually alive to the satire.All told, the stories are a worthy edition to the series and to Twain generally even if only hard-core fans, especially those who treasure associated works, should read them in the end. He hardly wrote anything not worth reading, but these should be among the last stops. They are pleasant reads even if the fact that they have survived more than a century has more to do with Twain's name and his better works than inherent quality. Even so, they are surprisingly enjoyable proof that he was ever-readable even when far from this best."},{"Title":"Animal Alphabet: Slide and Seek the ABCs","review":"This board book features twenty-six sliding panels that illustrate the letters of the alphabet with attractive, well-drawn animal pictures: A for Alligator, B for Bear...etc. This one is a favorite at our household... The biggest selling point of this book is its durability: most pop-up books and panel books are easily ruined by overeager or rambunctious children. This one, however, has sliding panels that are encased in tough, solid cardboard pages, and is almost impossible for small children (ages 0-2?) to tear apart. The sliding action helps develop eye-to-hand coordination, and the panels move easily from side to side, avoiding the frustration that some movable parts can create. The pictures are nice, some of the animals are unusually named (urial and xenops, for example...) and once your kid gets the hang of it, he or she can be left alone to explore the book with no fear of it winding up in pieces. Recommended!"},{"Title":"Animal Alphabet: Slide and Seek the ABCs","review":"My 15 month old loves looking at the beautiful pictures of animals and sliding the parts back and forth."},{"Title":"Animal Alphabet: Slide and Seek the ABCs","review":"This is a must in every child's 'learning to read' phase. This thick cardboard book can withstand the action of children and will be in your library for years to come.There is a slide on each page allowing the child to interact with the alphabet, the book, and the animals on each page. The upper- and lower-case letters are each shown with their corresponding animal (A for alligator and B for bear).I continue to buy copies of this book since I discovered it a few years ago, and the children I give it to have had hours of fun looking, reading, and playing."},{"Title":"Animal Alphabet: Slide and Seek the ABCs","review":"This book is a great concept and designed really nicely.However, a little pressure on the seam and it just tears and comes apart. For us, this book was damaged not after weeks or months of use, but after about an hour or two of supervised use. The paper holding each page together is too thin."},{"Title":"Animal Alphabet: Slide and Seek the ABCs","review":"My 18 month old twins love this book (Santa gave it to them for Christmas). The animal pictures and interactive sliding panels are great! My one complaint is the same one that others have mentioned too, and the reason I didn't give it 5 stars . . . the binding connecting the page to the spine needs to be a little thicker. Because of this, it's not a book that I would let them look at on there own. Which is fine for us, and a great way to teach them to 'be gentle' when turning the pages."},{"Title":"Animal Alphabet: Slide and Seek the ABCs","review":"This is an extra tough board book that works on a variety of levels. Initially, the pictures (artistic and well done) and sliding animals are very entertaining. Next, it helps children learn the letters, and has both upper and lowercase clearly laid out (not common among many ABC books), and next it has the names of each animal with the letter highlighted. In the front of the book it also has the full alphabet on one page for easy viewing of the order.This book has given our daughter many many readings full of enjoyment, and she asks for it repeatedly. She now knows all her letters but still comes back to this again and again for the animals, sliding, and words.If you only buy 1 ABC book, this is a great option. It is durable, travels well, and will provide a lot of entertainment."},{"Title":"Animal Alphabet: Slide and Seek the ABCs","review":"My 22 month daughter really enjoys this book and I think it is helping her learn her ABC's. She especially likes to slide the letters to reveal the animals."},{"Title":"Animal Alphabet: Slide and Seek the ABCs","review":"I'm not surprised at the 5 star reviews as this is a beautiful book, I am however surprised at the \\"durable\\" comments. I bought this book for my daughter a little over a month ago. She's not big into books at the moment so it's only been \\"read\\" a few times and the spine binding is already totally separated from the book which thus allows the cards on a few of the pages to just slip out of their housing. (see pic I uploaded). My daughter is very girly and dainty. She's not rough with anything and she would take just a finger and move the cards to reveal the animal picture. The separation occurred just from her turning the pages. I guess being that the book is thick, too much stress is put on the first and last page when flipped open. I tried to tape up the book but that of course didn't work. She can see the tape and that makes her curious and so she picks at it. Although I loved the look of the book and all of the animal pictures I wouldn't buy it again especially since I got so little use out of it."},{"Title":"Cross-Examination: The Comprehensive Guide for Experts","review":"Cross-examination. The mere utterance of these words can strike fear in even the most seasoned testifying expert. Never testified before or just starting out in litigation consulting? The prospect of cross-examination can provide more consternation, self-doubt and sleeplessness than a teenage first date. And, with good reason. The purpose of cross-examination is for opposing counsel to find any little chink in your testimonial armor and exploit it to discredit you, your credibility, your honor, and ultimately, your professional viability. Still don't have your attention? Try this on for size.\\"No expert is immune to cross-examination. Whether it's their fees, their bias, their lack of familiarity with the facts, or their faulty methodology, every expert has an Achilles' heel. Through creativity, determination, and, above all else, hard work, you should be able to find it. Once you become adept at doing so, you will be able to destroy any expert, every time.\\"This passage comes from the very text designed to teach attorneys how to \\"destroy\\" expert witnesses. If this doesn't grab you, I would strongly suggest you find a different field of practice.So, how does the expert witness proceed? Preparation, preparation, and more preparation. In addition, there are many sources of reference an expert can utilize to mitigate this \\"destructive\\" attitude. Steven Babitsky and James J. Mangraviti, Jr., have made it their quest to utilize their considerable trial experience to galvanize the expert community by providing just such resources. Their latest treatise, CROSS-EXAMINATION: THE COMPREHENSIVE GUIDE FOR EXPERTS is a marvelous example of just such a resource. Published in 2003, this book is destined to become an invaluable addition to an expert's library.In the Preface, the authors state, \\"This book has been written to be an expert's comprehensive and advanced guide to excelling at the art of responding to cross-examination.\\" They have succeeded in high fashion. Like most of their previous offerings, the authors provide numerous examples of question and answer exchanges along with the requisite \\"lesson\\" from each exchange.The authors reserve 117 pages of this book for a chapter titled, \\"What Experts Can Expect To Be Asked on Cross-Examination,\\" one filled with representative question and answer exchanges. These exchanges cover a variety of areas, which are the subject of hard-line questions an expert can expect. A few of these areas are bias, qualifications, prior testimony and writings, honesty and credibility and interaction with retaining counsel. Each of these potential lines of impeachment is covered with various question and answer examples and the requisite lesson. This chapter is probably one most experts will want to revisit when preparing for difficult cases or when facing an attorney with a reputation for being hard on experts.The last chapter of the book is reserved for what the authors describe as becoming a dangerous expert. This is defined as \\"an expert who is highly resistant to cross-examination and who is able to take advantage of the opportunity to turn the tables on opposing counsel.\\" The dangerous expert is one who concerns opposing counsel, who produces very few positive results for opposing counsel and who can easily trigger a backfire to opposing counsel on cross-examination. These experts are deemed uncommon and in high demand. Albeit the shortest chapter in the book, it is one of the most powerful.As advertised, this book is comprehensive at 399 pages however, don't let the length of the book fool you. It flows very smoothly and is absorbing with the voluminous question and answer passages. The chapters contained in this book are:Chapter 1 - Introduction and Executive SummaryChapter 2 - How an Attorney Prepares to Cross-Examine an ExpertChapter 3 - How to Prepare for Cross-ExaminationChapter 4 - How Jurors Perceive Cross-Examination of the ExpertChapter 5 - Advanced Cross-Examination Techniques for ExpertsChapter 6 - What Experts can expect to be asked on Cross-ExaminationChapter 7 - Legal Limitations to the Scope of Cross-ExaminationChapter 8 - Defeating Counsel's Cross-Examination TacticsChapter 9 - How to Answer Trick and Difficult QuestionsChapter 10 - How to Become a Dangerous Expert WitnessThe only criticism I have for this offering would be Chapter 7 - Legal Limitations to the Scope of Cross-Examination. This chapter provides a variety of case citations relative to a variety of situations and reads more like a legal textbook than the rest of chapters. That said, it will provide the expert with case cites relative to specific situations that an expert could use in testimony.As stated in the opening, it is my belief this book is destined to become a staple in any expert's library. Once read, it will provide an invaluable reminder to every expert when preparing for a trial or deposition."},{"Title":"What It Is to Be Human: Hope Lies in Our Ability to Bring Back to Awareness","review":"If this book was a drug the FDA would make it Class 3. It is that powerful and will have that strong an effect on your life.While it is described as account of a Malaysia tribe, it is, more importantly, a window into another way of thinking about WHAT IT IS TO BE HUMAN. That is also the name the book was originally given by it's author. Robert Wolff opens our eyes to see and think about possibilities for being human that our western world's schools and media do not teach, do not suggest.Every person I know who has read this books says it changes the way they walk through the world, the way they see, the way they know.It discusses ideas that impinge upon parapsychology, shamanism, Carlos Castaneda's works, intuition, healing...The book is a precious gift that will make you feel joy and sadness-- joy from knowing the possibilities of being human, and the beauty of the Sng'oi, sadness, because the Sng'oi were reported to be &quot;absorbed&quot; by the Malaysian culture several years ago. They are gone.Read the book and see if you can find a way to begin seeing as they did, and find a part of them in your heart.The book has been re-issued under the title Original Wisdom, so it is readily available without a wait."},{"Title":"What It Is to Be Human: Hope Lies in Our Ability to Bring Back to Awareness","review":"This book is an autobiographical account of psychologist Robert Wolff's time among indigenous/aboriginal people, mostly in Malaysia. It's rich, exciting, fascinating, insightful, thoughtful, and an incredible exposure for those of us in the &quot;modern&quot; world to what life was like for our ancestors of the past 100,000 years and what life is today for those still-extant tribal people. This book, and Peter Farb's &quot;Man's Rise to Civilization&quot; are *the* two classics in this field."},{"Title":"What It Is to Be Human: Hope Lies in Our Ability to Bring Back to Awareness","review":"I recently found this book on my home bookshelves as I organized them. It had sat there, in fact, unread since I purchased it in 2002.I took the book with me this weekend on a family camping trip and was so deeply touched by the stories Mr. Wolff shared of his encounters with \\" The Ancient Ones\\" that I read many of them aloud to my husband and two twenty-something sons. We were all entranced and inspired by these true tales of people who lived their lives guided by a deep and simple wisdom , undistracted by egoic pulls and open and fully present to life. Like Mr. Wolff himself, I fell in love with these magical yet very real human beings who have so much to teach us all.I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"What It Is to Be Human: Hope Lies in Our Ability to Bring Back to Awareness","review":"I was completely amazed at this book. Robert Wolff beautifully illustrates the reality that has only been presented as fiction in books like &quot;Mutant Message Down Under&quot; by Marlo Morgan, and idealized for the future in Daniel Quinn's &quot;Ishmael&quot; series. It gives one hope to know that not all humans live out of harmony with their surroundings, and indeed, each other. I was impressed by his candid portrayals of the various adventures he has had, and the honesty with which he presents his misconceptions, mistakes, and cultural blunders. It makes me hope that one day, books from great minds such as his will be included in high-school required reading curriculums, so that maybe a new great thinker will learn from the past, and give us hope for the future."},{"Title":"What It Is to Be Human: Hope Lies in Our Ability to Bring Back to Awareness","review":"If you are interested in learning more about primitive societies prior to civilization, thinking outside the box of western or eastern culture, observing civilization from a unique perspective, this book is for you.

This man went on this incredible journey, never wasable to get to know the people, or enjoy the beautiful countryside. It was like theAmerican who goes and comes back from abroad and didn't have an appreciation for theculture,food, the people or even the beautiful places he went. Very disappointing. I wasexcited to get this book, because I had been to many of the countries he went across.He did have one beautiful motorcycle made for the trip, and the few pictures in the bookwere good."},{"Title":"One-man caravan","review":"I really enjoyed this book. As a motorcyclist, I bought it because it was the first around the world motorcycle trip ever documented. Those kinds of trips are now as common as climbing Mt Everest.This is not Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance. At first I was disappointed that he did not relate more to the bike as he wrote, although there is a little bit more of that at the end. This book is really a travelogue.The thing I liked the most is that this book is a picture of the middle east in the Post World War I era. You really get a feeling for many of the Asian third world countries. Robert Fultons observations about the warring personalities of some of the tribes he encountered are very relevant to the situation in some of the mid-east countries today. There are also a lot of very sweet people he met too. Many of his descriptions are quite vivid, and you realize he was either bold or just young and not realizing what he was getting into at the time. The author wrote well for being so young at the time. I agree with the reviewer that said it seems like the end was finished in a hurry.I would buy this book again. Robert Fulton sits on my shelf between Robert Persig and my Haynes BMW Service and Repair Manual."},{"Title":"One-man caravan","review":"I was put off by this for awhile---until I realized that the book was all about the social content of his travels and not so much about the motorcycle which is treated in very low key. I'm more than half way through the book now and haven't any idea how his bike performed----but he writes interestingly about the people he meets and the events which occur during the course of his travel Eastward from Europe through the mid East and India. It's not the kind of book that you cannot put down---and I read it in my spare time. The book gives little detail as to the hardships that he must have incurred----and his focus isn't on that kind of detail but is a sort of narrative of what he sees and does along the way. There are better books for someone interested in the how's and why's of motorcycle travel."},{"Title":"One-man caravan","review":"This is an absolute gem for anyone interested in motorcycle travel considering the times, the quality of equipment and well, the journey himself. I can only assume, like all the best adventures that ignorance of the task involved was bliss!This is the story of a real hero."},{"Title":"One-man caravan","review":"if you liked this book, you'll like his followup DVD: Twice upon a Caravan where footage he shot is displayed.full review:[...]"},{"Title":"One-man caravan","review":"I'm glad this was the first bike journey I found to read. \\"Living\\" Robert's experiences even though vicariously, amped up my desire to make yet another solo or duo bike journey to places I've never been. I have to hand it to these authors who tread out of country into the third world corners. The way the world is these days, I believe the USA and Canada will have to remain my playground. This book was a must first read for all journey enthusiasts, whether you cut your teeth on Zen and Maintenance or not. My most memorable cruise was a twenty three day solo of more than 8700 miles around the US and Canada on an 87 Heritage just months before 9-11. It's amazing how the world has changed since then."},{"Title":"One-man caravan","review":"This book is the parent of the motorcycle travel genre. Mr. Fulton took off on a \\"round the world\\" for the first time that is documented. The amazing thing is that through this book we get a look at places that are very much in the news today. Travel in Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, Iraq, Turkey and India are in the book along with the difficulty of his passages in these countries.From the seat of Mr. Fulton's motorcycle we see a world 1930's world that had not felt the effect of the second world war. The Dutch East Indies are in place, the French are in Indochina and the mid east, and Japan is still at peace. This book shows the world as it was on a classic motorcycle trip."},{"Title":"One-man caravan","review":"I've gone through a few of these motorcycle books in the recent past (see my other reviews). Some were really good, others not so much. This book by Robert Fulton is not too shabby for a 1932 account of a 'round the world motorcycle ride. And not as dated as one would think. I kept thinking to myself as I read this that the stories aren't that unfamiliar and sound like the author might've just finished the ride.Some may cringe at Mr. Fulton's very non-politically correct manner of describing foreign cultures. I wasn't offended in the least and accepted his descriptions as \\"snapshots\\" of the past. Hey, the guy doesn't like monkey meat or the manner in which the animals are prepared for cooking -- and he said as much. If you are prone strict PC reading or easily offended by those that aren't, perhaps a more modern telling of a motorcyclist's travels would better suit your needs. If you want to read about a pioneer's experiences in an easy-to-read style, this book is for you.One thing is certain--the author respected and admired the people he met as he sojourned through their lands and obviously enjoyed each experience without being patronizing. As well, he's one lucky dude. He lucked into many situations that could've ended or severely hampered his travels.All in all, I enjoyed this much more than some of the other comparable -- and more recent -- books on the subject."},{"Title":"One-man caravan","review":"I read review on this from another reader who was upset that the book was more of a travelog than a bike adventure. Based on his opinion, I almost did not buy this book. I am very glad to say I did buy it and will read it many more times. Understanding that the book was written 70+ years ago, the travel was more of an adventure than the method of travel, and what this man accomplished on a relic of a bike is astounding. You cannot buy this kind of adventure today for any money. Read it with an open mind, place yourself in the writer's boots, and imagine trying this today on a modern bike. Would you write about the bike or the travel? The writer's bike receives enough space to satisfy and intrigue the reader, the adventure of his travel will stay with you much longer than the type of bike he rode. Buy this book, it is a classic."},{"Title":"One-man caravan","review":"This book would be a fantastic story if it was written TODAY. It's even more incredible that it all happened in 1932-33.There are so many levels to enjoy in this book ...* The pure adventure of it all - setting out on a motorcycle (a 750 pound, 6-horsepower monster, no less!) to travel around the world in 1932. It simply is mind-boggling that he pulled it off.* The observations he makes along the way and how relevant they are even today. His observations of Afghanistan, in particular give insights into what has always been a war-torn country. If Bush & Co. had read this book, maybe we'd have left well enough alone.* His pure tenacity and luck to get in-and-out of the situations he stumbles into. Being in jail is just part of the gig, and he takes it all in stride.* The writing itself ... clean, crisp, and engaging. I couldn't put this book down.This book is fantastic whether or not you ride a motorcycle.HIGHLY, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."},{"Title":"One-man caravan","review":"&quot;One Man Caravan&quot; is a story very much like adventure travelogues I used to read as a kid.In 1932, a young man of maybe limited resources, but unlimited resourcefulness and &quot;chutzpah&quot;, saddles up his motorcycle and travels around the world in 18 months. En route, he encounters exotic locals and locales, battles bad roads, breakdowns, injuries, officials and wanders into hot zones of civil wars - such as the British fighting some rebels in fictitiously-sounding Baluchistan.This would be quite typical travel adventure fare, except that it really happened. The author is Robert Fulton (later known to Cold War afficionados as the inventor of CIA/Navy Skyhook recovery system), grandson of steam-ship builder Fulton. In 1996 (re-publication time of the book) he was alive and riding his motorcycle at age of 87.Well-written and spell-binding, particularly in light of its authenticity."},{"Title":"One-man caravan","review":"Grandson of the Fulton Engine Genius, and Discoverer/Inventor in his own right, rides around the world on a Douglas Twin during his twenties on a bit of a lark. Out of his off-handed remark to impress a young woman we have one of the best motorcycle travel books ever written. Published umpteen times, I can imagine this book spurring on new generations of riders for decades to come.The writing is excellent and extremely detailed, we get a breakdown of his trip during each section, along with Fulton's own sketchings and maps of the areas and people he met along the way. Photographs, of all things, to boot: images of a bike in the sea of sand, desert nomads and marketplaces; this book feeds your imagination. After 1 year of reading it a memorable item comes immediately to mind: That of Fulton being saluted and waved straight through road-blocks without stopping, to his incredulity, in occupied and dangerous Warizistan (yes, you've heard this place in the news recently), only to find that he shouldn't have made it past the first gate. It was his safari hat and fatigues that made them believe he was Indian-Army/British attache of all things. ;^)Fulton himself is still living life with adventure. Still kicking with his old Douglas Twin and flying his own plane at the age of 87+.If you want the best grab the first. You'll never put it down, and you'll go back a few times just to make sure you got it right when you read it there the first time.[For other two-wheel journey books I recommend Jupiter's Travels by Ted Simon- inspiration for Ewen McGregor's recent \\"The Long Way Round\\" and Ted made the trip without cameramen and support crews!]"},{"Title":"One-man caravan","review":"Mr. Fulton's style of writing is very straightforward and not nearly as dated as you would think. The narrative moves forward quickly as he describes his adventures in a matter of fact tone. But what a story and what a commentary on how our world has changed!One vignette. He is out of food in the middle of a desert. An Arab shows up and, as was the custom, shares exactly half of his food. Then he disappears inside of his closeby hut. Looking inside, Robert sees him setting up a homemade backgammon board. The Arab beckons him in and begs with his eyes--do you play?? They played all night and he gets trounced by his new friend.As I was reading about his trip from Damascus to Baghdad, our troops were attacking Iraq. I thought that this young man's journey simply could not be made today. The world, despite the technological advances in communications and plane travel, is not a safer place for the American adventurer.Get this book! You will not be able to put it down."},{"Title":"One-man caravan","review":"The best travel book I have ever read. As a young man in 1933, almost on a dare, Robert Fulton rode a Douglas motorcycle (which he still owns) around the world, not only seeing some increible places but writing about them in a highly entertaining and informative way. The book, like the trip, lacks the higher agenda which mar so many travel stories. Fulton simply set out to have a grand adventure and to write about it with humor and respect for those he met. You'll want to go right now to see some of these places for yourself. My favorite is the spot where Krakatoa once stood, marked by flames on the surface of the sea. A must read for anyone who likes a good travel story."},{"Title":"One-man caravan","review":"This is the first young man to travel around the world by motorbike. According to him he had no intention of doing so but blurted it out to impress a young girl and then he had to go. Lots of wonderful, funny, self-deprecating humor. He is well educated, highly intelligent, and it shows in his writing. Many wry phrases sneak into this book, &quot;The driver cried out for in&quot;. Great reading, and very interesting to learn what traveling was like in 1932. He is apparently still alive and kicking. What an adventure."},{"Title":"One-man caravan","review":"In One Man Caravan, Robert Fulton has caught the magic of exploring new places and meeting people from cultures very different to his own. He writes with real fluency and his words evoke the graphic images of the colourful lands through which he takes the reader on this wonderful journey."},{"Title":"One-man caravan","review":"Overall, the book is interesting and informative. It gives some great detail about the middle east, India and Asia in general. From a people perspective, I liked the fact that Mr. Fulton goes into some detail about what the people were like and some personalites. I did find however, that in some spots he focused too much on what people thought and not enough on his thoughts and feelings about \\"where\\" he was. Toward the end of the book, he rushed. He spent 80% of the time on the Middle east and India, 10% in the rest of Asia, and no time at all anywhere else. Again, overall, it was interesting and informative, but it did not capture my attention like say Jupiters Travels (same genera, by Ted Simon)rk"},{"Title":"One-man caravan","review":"I really enjoyed this book; it was too soon over.I have ridden motorcycles for many years and would liked to have seen more comments on the practical aspects of the trip, even though it was many years ago. I suspect that Mr. Fulton did not keep daily notes but probably wrote down his memories at the conclusion of the trip, thus the detail is not always there.The portrait of the middle East gives something for the people of today something to think about - basic beliefs and attitudes in that region may not have changed at all. Our expectations may need to be adjusted.A long trip on a motorcycle is an unforgettable experience for anyone, even today. Four or five days from home, and the resources available there, projects the rider into a state of independence and freedom that I have not found any other way - imagine what it was like for Fulton to be riding across the desert, months from home, no road in some cases, towards the unknown, his life dependent upon his machine continuing to run, and totally on his own.Every rider should get to read this book - a great treat for the imagination."},{"Title":"One-man caravan","review":"I could not put this one down.

Jorge Ramos put a lot of work into this talking to the survivors and getting probably the closest inside look to their stories. What i wish Jorge Ramos did is get more information on other peoples stories than just a few and really make this a heartbreaking story for those who had to live through this but is able to tell their story today.Conflict in Dying To Cross is filled with emotion and will keep the reader attached. these conflicts that you read about will open your eyes to the problems that were faced when trying to cross the border. the reader will read about some stories in this book that will keep them into the book, that will keep them wondering what else happens. As you read and get into this book more and more you will feel for these people and be able to feel what they are feeling just by the descriptiveness that this book possesses.The theme in this book is saying that illegal immigration needs to change, immigrants die just to get over the border. Lives have been lost and the people that were involved in this have been remembered through this book. Dying To Cross will let you learn some of these stories, Dying To Cross will give the readers flashes of the environment they are in. The horrid images these immigrants have seen.This historical event based on immigration is a tragic story about crossing the American border. This book has been well thought out by Jorge Ramos and points out the main parts of this event that has taken place in may of 2003. prepare for an intense insight for 1 of the worst American tragedies.ether and sequence of events in it. Dying To Cross' events are constructed with stories of immigrants that have been involved in this event. what i think could be different about this book is that it be a little more descriptive about the situations that were faced during this tragedy so the reader may understand other tragedies that happened.Work CitedRamos, Jorge, Dying To Cross: The Worst American Tragedy In American History, New York: Harper Collins, 2005."},{"Title":"Dying to Cross CD: The Worst Immigrant Tragedy in American History","review":"It was rather depressing but I realize it's important to get the info out there about what goes on."},{"Title":"Dying to Cross CD: The Worst Immigrant Tragedy in American History","review":"Hard to listen to it, but is a story that everyone should hear for a better understanding of the desperation of illegal immigrants and the horrible, lowlifes that prey upon them.

By the end of my readings, I was confused and saddened that such a natural, beautiful gift was made to be so complicated. Luckily, I was familiar with Dr. Pransky's loving, humble, simple book Parenting from the Heart.

Sometimes it seems too simple, but when that thought comes to me, I think of the other options and realize that only coming from love, holding my children as the perfect wise people that they are helps us move toward understanding and growth together.

The elements found in this book include:1. Counting. My son greatly enjoys how the numbers of Miss Muffet's visitors keep growing.2. Rhyming. One thing that really grabs my son's attention is rhyming. The rhyming in this book is very clever and definitely rivals Dr. Seuss's best works.3. Rhythm. This book is easy to read quickly. Not that the book is short, but that the words flow extremely well. As a result, even an 18 month old doesn't have time for attention to wander.4. Color. The illustrations are full of color and wonderfully illustrate the story. Looking at the pictures is as much fun as reading the story.5. Story. The story is interesting! My son is excited by each page every time we read the book.This book, on it's first reading, became one of my son's favorites. I even look forward to reading it!"},{"Title":"Little Miss Muffet's Count-Along Surprise","review":"...I have seen quite a few books cross my children's hands. Little Miss Muffet's Count Along Surprise was an immediate hit with all. They read it and reread it aloud to each other constantly. The imaginative words are cleverly knit together and flow with an ingenious rhythm almost completely absent in much of modern children's monosyllabic literature. It is a PLEASURE to hear--even over and over.The illustrations are imaginative and full of vibrant color and action. They ably embrace the counting element of the book but more importantly, I think, they appeal to children's taste for inventive combinations of related bits of information: \\"Little Miss Muffet sat on a tuffet, eating her curds and whey, when along came three magpies with taffeta bow-ties and silk vests of very pale grey.\\" Or, \\"Little Miss Muffet sat on a tuffet, eating her curds and whey, when along came nine gibbons with balloons tied with ribbons and bananas arranged on a tray.\\"..."},{"Title":"Little Miss Muffet's Count-Along Surprise","review":"Let me begin by saying they have got the age range wrong. I think any child 5 and under would enjoy this book. (My eldest just turned 5 and she certainly likes it.) The artwork is colorful and pleasant and as you turn the pages the pictures become increasingly dense with added characters and action. Certainly there is enough activity to keep older children occupied. And because of the repetitiveness they might even *read* it themselves.We adore this book. It has humor and warmth and it extends the old short rhyme with an even better story. In this version, Little Miss Muffett's spider doesn't chase her away, instead he asks her to stay. Then come lemurs with streamers, magpies with bowties, foxes with boxes, pussycats with partyhats, poodles with oodles of noodles, bears with chairs, puffins with muffins, gibbons with ribbons and crocodiles with 10 greedy smiles. But to what end? Surprise! It's a birthday party.There is so much to this book. It teaches counting and rhyming. It introduces animals that are not typical in young children's' reading: puffins, lemurs and gibbons. For my children, it elicited in them the desire to memorize the poem (it was so much fun). To me this indicates that they are learning to love literature and reading.I think it would make a great birthday gift, but don't buy it just for that. Think of all that your child could learn."},{"Title":"Little Miss Muffet's Count-Along Surprise","review":"We first checked this out of the library and it was so wonderful that I requested it by name as a Christmas gift from family.

His verbiage is not egotistical, but it does reflect the confidence with which he and his teammates and others in his unit carried out their very speciallized and unique operations. They were a fine unit and this book gives testimony to their memorable combat achievements as part of &quot;The Herd&quot;, the 173rd Airborne Bde. This books ranks right up there with the best of Gary Linderer's series of books and other great combat narratives of the Vietnam War. He puts the reader right out there &quot;in the bush&quot; and explains tactics and actions in a manner even those who did not serve in a LRRP or Ranger unit can readily understand. He tells what his unit did, where they did it, how well, and &quot;lessons learned&quot;, all in a very candid way. It is particularly good considering that this is apparently his first book. I hope more are forthcoming from him. I speak from first-hand knowlege as a former LRRP in the 1st Infantry Division in Vietnam.

I joined the 75th N Rangers a few months after Bill left. His recollections brought back many long forgotten, or perhaps more accurately, submerged, memories. It was a highly accurate description of how we operated... although he did leave out a lot of detail and there were some minor inaccuracies. For example, we never all went to sleep at night, there was always one guy on sentry. I could also grouse about the mis-spelling of my name in the back of the book, but that's not important.

Bill and his co-author John Brackin have created a book that gives the reader a fox-hole view on a unique kind of warfare. In Vietnam at this period of time, the Army and the Marines were all engaged in large operations with big units going into battles. Meanwhile, small Ranger units began to play by another set of rules with the enemy forces. They would ambush and engage the enemy where and when they chose. Sometimes the NVA and VC had greater numbers but these silent and invisible killing forces were able to pull success after success.The authors give the reader some rich imagery through their wording and descriptions. This story is well worth telling and it will inspire and entertain. Bill was a real hero as were the men he fought with in his Ranger unit.

Told in the first person, this book is very informative, interesting, exciting, and free of unnecessary embellishments. The story of the inception and development of the Rangers as told by a man who actually lived it gives one a profound appreciation of the accomplishments our military. For those of us who remember that era of our history, and how relatively primitive the equipment and weaponry of the Viet Nam era was, it underscores the high degree of technological sophistication that our fighting men and women have in these current times.

The way the author shares his accounts from his time in Vietnam puts you at a level of understanding unlike that of any other book on the subject that I've read.

Billy's book is what we have been wishing for; factual, good read, and conveys the emotional bond between our fellow LRPs. Many of us didn't talk about the experience, because no one would believe it. Billy tells it like it was. The reader can understand, through Billy's experiences, the lives of men who took the war to the next level. There was a saying, &quot;the night belongs to the enemy&quot; when American troops talked about the NVA and the VC. Billy shows why the NVA and VC belonged to the Rangers. When a LRP or Ranger unit struck it was usually on our terms. Good Job Billy!!!"},{"Title":"Stealth Patrol: The Making of a Vietnam Ranger, 1968-70","review":"Brackin is obviously one of the foremost authors of our time.

At the time, I accepted full blame for her misery, and because of her hot and cold mood swings, learned at an early age what it felt like to be confused and depressed. My sister and I tiptoed around our mother, wondering if she was in a good mood, or in a bad one. If bad, we knew to avoid her and stay out of her way.We learned early on to live underneath a shroud of denial, about our alcholic father and our verbally abusive grandmother, who we lived with.Our mother would badmouth them to us, revealing innappropriate secrets so she could let off steam, then expected us to supress our own feelings. We were never allowed to vent or acknowledge that we were unhappy about our invisible father and overbearing grandmother.My mother enjoyed using subtle psychological abuse. It left no physical scars, but was just as damaging. You were more likely to blame yourself than admit your mother caused your pain. Because my mother was not a big physical abuser, only having spanked us on rare occasions, we thought we had it pretty good, and had no right to complain.As a young adult in my early twenties I became stepmother to a daughter who was diagnosed as having Attention Deficit Disorder, a difficult behavior problem which requires much tolerance and understanding on the part of the parent.Needless to say, I had trouble. I wasn't sure about what I had a right to expect and what I didn't have a right to expect from this child. We had endless power struggles because she had her own head problems brought on by her drug addict mother who abandoned her, and kept showing back up only to keep disappearing out of her life.When I read this book, it made me only too aware that I was falling into the sinkholes of my past, in ways being much like my mother. I realized to my horror that I subconsciously set my daughter up at times to fail, so I could enjoy berating her. I never would have known had I not read the book. The book showed me in undeniable ways what was acceptable and what was unacceptable forms of parenting.In every chapter I found something I could apply to my past. What a great relief it is to find out that all along, you didn't do anything wrong, after all. You can finally dump that huge weight of guilt, because it never belonged to you to begin with. And furthermore, nobody had a right to lay it all on you. How free, and light you feel after reading it.My stepdaughter is not guilt free, it would have taken a strong individual to deal with what I coped with, but I wish I had this book from the beginning. Things would have been a lot less stressful, and much easier to understand.I loved this book so much that it had inspired me to begin writing a book of my own, an autobiography about my life and what it was like to grow up with hostility, denial, and guilt. I am presently working on it and hope to publish it one day soon."},{"Title":"Healthy Parenting: How Your Upbringing Influences the Way You Raise Your Children, and What You Can Do to Make It Better for Them","review":"This is a great book for people who have grown up in troubled families.

But I also was annoyed at times by what seemed to me to be a scolding, moralizing tone. Also, I felt the author should have shown a bit more empathy for her audience (as she does in her other books on alcoholic families). I finished the book with a bubbling rage toward my parents. Why did they get -- and exercise -- the option to fail their kids, while I am stuck having to work extra-hard to parent differently? Why do they get let off the hook so easily, yet I remain accountable? I've been stuck with this anger ever since my 4-year-old daughter was born, and even therapy hasn't thoroughly eliminated it.

Obviously there is a large market out there for this book, sales are astronomical in metropolitan cities, and no wonder. Jamoo treats his subject with enormous respect, and more than a bit of awe. To all purveyors of gay-male porn, Kristen Bjorn is a household name. The Steven Spielberg of voyeurism and orgies. (not to distant from the real Spielberg in one sense, they both revel in camera angles, foreground and background shots, and dewy cinematography) Porn has been attacked for being an assault on women, and I tend to agree, however gay men have discovered a world of porn which celebrates their sexuality in a manner that heterosexuals can never hope to comprehend. This book covers Mr. Bjorn's career up to publication date, and Jamoo does a credible job of interviewing the master. Fans of his films will decree this b! ook to be a must-have. The book's strengths are it's focus on detail, respect for it's subject and those lavish photographs which try their best to represent Bjorn's skill in still shots that are R rated at most. Good for Jamoo! Bible thumpers aside, there is an audience for this handsome little book. Gay men need to be able to read about their porn industry which is so prolific, if they are to begin to understand the social implications of their desires."},{"Title":"The Films of Kristen Bjorn","review":"Kristen Bjorn's camera captures and celebrates the world's most perfect men: buff, muscular and uncut! Jamoo's book-length interview with the king of gay pron is a treat for all fans. Bjorn's comments about his models - many of who are not gay-identified - tells us a lot about the fluent nature of male sexuality.

So here goes. The fact that the book was originally titled The Life And Strange Surprising Adventures Of Robinson Crusoe illustrates the major flaw in Defoe's literary form. Put simply, this would be a far more interesting and gripping story were it not so superfluously lengthy. The author makes a habit of repeating himself, especially when it comes to the act of dispatching kittens, which seems to be more of an obsession here than octogenarian ladies are to MatronsApron. It is difficult, you may think, to keep the subject matter fresh when describing the daily tribulations of a fellow stranded on an island for thirty years, without occasionally repeating yourself. True, but perhaps a straightforward solution to this diminutive quandary would be to simply truncate the duration of the story. There are some wonderfully intriguing and suspenseful moments, and some juicy action to boot, but sadly these are gratuitously diluted by lengthy descriptions of the unremarkable everyday goings on in Crusoe's life, and rather than serving to build up the suspense, they merely obstruct the reader's relationship with the more exciting parts of the story.However, those with more patience than my ignorant self will find in Robinson Crusoe a delightful tale, which as well as being a fictional documentary of the most unusual thirty years of Mr. Crusoe's life, also has time to ponder upon philosophical and theological ideas, in a style that makes the reader feel as if they are involved in the conflicts between the functionalist and cynical thoughts going on in Crusoe's mind. It may not be a gripping white-knuckle adventure, being rather more leisurely and acquiescent, but it is still rather easy to see why Robinson Crusoe is regarded by some as one of the greatest novels of all time."},{"Title":"The life and strange surprising adventures of Robinson Crusoe of York, mariner","review":"This review is based on a mid-century reprint of Heritage's edition of Robinson Crusoe.Defoe's book was a hit when first published and this Heritage edition was a hit as well, reprinted several times over the couse of the 20th century.This is a fun Heritage with a number of novel flourishes.

It is a pity but unavoidable, given such a broad subject, that the many interesting characters who appear and their activities get only a very sketchy description.However, what disturbed me a bit while reading was that so many names seemed to be misspelled. I did not keep track systematically, but a quick look through the index reveals entries for \\"William Jennings Bryant\\" (and others for \\"Bryan\\"), Daniel J. Boorstein (the historian), Henry Morganthau, Shuyler Colfax, general Phillip Schulyer (two errors in one name) and Carl Ichan. The law firm of \\"Cravath, de Gersdorff, Swaine and Wood\\" is called \\"Cravath, de Gerdsdorf, Swaine and Wood\\" on page 454.

Of course, many discoveries about weather are relatively recent. In November of 1944, B-29 aircraft were flying a bombing mission at an altitude of 30,000 feet. Their target was Tokyo. Turning toward the east to make their approach, the B-29's suddenly found that they were being pushed by 150 mph winds. It was not until after the war that that meteorologists discovered the jet stream.On April 12, 1934, Mount Washington Observatory in New Hampshire recorded the highest wind velocity ever recorded: 231 mph.In January and February of 1977, the people of Buffalo, NY, must have thought an Ice Age was returning. The President sent in the National Guard to help dig the city out of the snow, and they soon ran out of places to pile it. Finally they decided to ship the snow south in railroad cars.There may be a coming ice age or there may be a significant change due to global warming. The recurring lesson that Margery Facklam has in her book is to plan ahead. To that I might add one obvious item and that is to study the weather."},{"Title":"Passageway West: My Escape From East Germany","review":"This book truly brings history to life.

It is also wonderfully free of the dense prose and meandering sentences which plague so much serious writing on Latin America. This book is indispensable for anyone attempting to understand how savage Maoism found purchase in the Andes."},{"Title":"The Shining Path: A History of the Millenarian War in Peru (Latin America in Translation/En Traduccion/Em Traducao)","review":"The book by Gorriti I call an account rather than a history, because it conveys the movement in medias res, published in 1990 as the SL prepared to assault the capital, well before the 1992 capture of Guzm&aacute;n and the persecution of Gorriti. In a 1998 preface, he briefly describes how, when president (elected in 1990) Alberto Fujimori staged a coup in 1992, he was arrested for his investigational journalism into the president and his \`Creole Rasputin'-right before the arrest of Comrade Gonzalo. Gorriti managed to escape, files spirited out of the country too, and wound up in Panama working for its paper La Prensa. There, in 1996, he again faced his enemies as that government threatened him after he exposed a campaign financed by a Colombian drug cartel. He lived in his office for weeks, so as to foil police plans for his deportation. He emerged victorious, determined to uphold-in what he calls \`cosmetic democracies', a free press.At the time Gorriti compiled his tale of the SL, he had intended it as part of a three-volume work on the Peruvian Communist Party and its many alphabet-soup off-brands. This shows, as I was instantly immersed into a detailed narrative of unions, strikes, police machinations, and bureaucratic-to me-trivia. The book is probably not the first place to go for a quick introduction to the situation into which Sendero Luminoso stumbled. Gorriti clearly addresses an audience more familiar than I was with his country. Still, the gifts of his journalistic verve carried me through pages of departmental decisions into powerful chapters that highlighted the deadly nature of Guzm&aacute;n's millenarian blend of Lenin, Marx, Mao, and messianic apocalypse that plunged-literally-much of his nation into darkness and resulted in at least 70,000 deaths, half of these at the hands of those who claimed to liberate the people from their imperialist oppressors. Half of these at the hands of those who claimed to protect the people from their revolutionary oppressors.This is Gorriti's achievement. Eschewing the glib slogans of the left and the harsh vows of the right, he tracks the rise of the Shining Path from a few students tossing dynamite-a commodity readily nicked from the mines-to police reprisals and the spread of societal breakdown across the Andes and into, as the book ends, the edges of the city. What the history lacks is a context for foreign readers into which Guzm&aacute;n and his ilk can be placed. Not even his birthdate is given; we know nothing here about his early schooling, what kind of a doctor he was, or how Jos&eacute; Carlos Mari&aacute;tegui founded the PCP, apparently in the 1930s. This information, which any academic editor would insist upon in a conventional manuscript, is, I assume, assumed by Gorriti not to matter or to be common knowledge to his Peruvian audience. Robin Kirk (who has written a lefty's view of Per&uacute;, The Monkey's Paw) translates what, given my knowledge of Spanish, I presume carries the uneven rhythms of the original prose, with its leaden \`he said, she said' reports from within the corridors of power as well as its nearly cinematic vignettes of attacks and reprisals from the front.Given these drawbacks, nonetheless, the uneasy mixture of dry minutiae about police intelligence sloshes against a potent additive. Excellent analyses of Sendero rhetoric and the emergence of his death cult demolish naive leftist praise for this deadly insurgency; on the other hand, the reprisals that the Senderos provoked and received resulted in innocents being taken with the guilty--and the two sometimes becoming blurred.The energy with which he describes the attacks by the guerrillas on the Ayacucho police stations, the torture of suspects, the funerals of officers and cadets, the rain on a tin-roofed shanty where a teenaged girl guerrilla shows her interviewers the marks of her abuse by her captors: all of these vignettes unforgettably inscribe themselves on your memory.(Edited from a review article, \\"No Escape from the Anthill\\" at the on-line Belfast journal The Blanket)"},{"Title":"Animals Divine Tarot","review":"When I found this deck, I was so excited to have finally found a deck that really incorporates the elements! The typical problem I usually have are like pentacles is a representation of Earth, first, and should reflect that. I get irritated easily with those decks that cater to the idea that pentacles means money when that's not always the case. In fact, in my experience, it's often incidental and rarely the case.Looking through this deck initially, I was a little disappointed with some of the mythos choices made for major arcana and court cards, but it didn't take long to recognize the virtues of placement with such beautiful artistry and recognize them for the intended meanings (the companion book helps too). It has been easier than I thought it would be to ignore the names (and my own bias on the names) and take the intuitive stance on the cards the way they are thrown.Overall, I am extremely pleased with this deck with its beautiful artistry, symbolism, colors and representations.

I was rather shocked to see such blunt, very pessimistic meanings that immediately put a \\"sword\\" through my heart. I am specifically thinking of the sword suit itself, for in my reading some of my cards I chose were of the sword suit, and the meanings were horrible, putting FEAR immediately into my BEing..... worse then many reverse meanings from other card sets I use. There is no point for me to use tools that instigate FEAR in me when I am so focused on eradicating FEAR from my life, thereby allowing only LOVE to reside. What this author was thinking of when she came up with the meanings of some of the cards is beyond me.

This is the best book on the Tarot I have ever read."},{"Title":"Animals Divine Tarot","review":"The Animals Divine Tarot is an animal themed Tarot, beautifully illustrated by Lisa Hunt. This deck merges creatures, gods and goddesses related to the animal kingdom with the tarot tradition.Each card in this deck is numbered and labeled at the bottom, showing the name of the creature, god or goddesses at the top. A golden border surrounds the imagery on each card.The Major Arcana are numbered with roman numerals, but starting at 0 with The Fool. Deities related to the animal kingdom are used to represent these. I found all the correspondences right on, although it relies on your ability to recognize the deity depicted in relationship to the Major Arcana it represents. I liked them all, but these are my favorites:The Fool -- Coyote (Native American)The Hermit -- Cernunnos (Celtic)The World -- Gaia (Greek)In addition, some of the cards have been renamed:Wheel of Fortune -- The Wheel -- All AnimalsThe Hanged Man -- The Hanged Woman -- Spider Woman (Native American)The Devil -- Challenge -- Rhiannon (Welsh)The suits on the Minor Arcana (swords, wands, cups and pentacles) are represented by a group of animals related to the corresponding element (air, fire, water and earth). These are the correspondences for the suits:swords (air) -- flying animalswands (fire) -- reptiles and insectscups (water) -- creatures that live on the seas, lakes and riverspentacles (earth) -- mammalsThe imagery on the Minor Arcana is intriguing, integrating an amount of symbols (swords, wands, cups or pentacles) as part of the image of the animal or animals for the Numbered Cards. Here the use of creatures is less intuitive than in the Major Arcana, but still works well. I like the Firefly as the Ace of Wands, the Vulture as the Three of Swords, the Chameleon as the Five of Wands, the Octopus as the Eight of Cups, and the Whale as the Ten of Cups. In my opinion, the suit of Cups contains the best correspondences.The Court Cards are as impressive as the Major Arcana, using deities as well. There are some correspondences that go without question, like Poseidon (Greek) as the King of Cups, and Venus (Roman) as the Knight of Cup. Some are somewhat odd on a first glance, like Quetzalcoatl (Aztec) for King of Sword. This is the \\"Feather-Serpent\\" deity, which may correspond to either reptiles (wands) or flying animals (swords). However, this deity is related to the gods of the wind, which make the correspondence to swords the best fit.In addition, this deck include two quick reference cards: the Animal Journey Spread (five cards), and the Animal Wheel Spread (seven cards).Knowledge of the deities and animals presented in this deck is almost a must to make the connection to the tarot they represent. For this purpose, the companion book is an indispensable tool.The book is divided into the following sections:Introduction: Connection with Animal Powers1. Animals as Divine2. How to Communicate with Animals3. The Major Arcana4. The Minor Arcana5. Tarot Layouts and MeditationsThe Introduction, Animal as Divine, and How to Communicate with Animals sections briefly discuss how to use these cards as a medium to connect and communicate with the spirit of the animal depicted. Then the book goes into the cards. There are nearly two pages of information per Major Arcana, providing the deity's name, a few words for meaning, an explanation of the symbols and the deity's description. For the Minor Arcana, the information's layout is similar. The final section, Tarot Layouts and Meditation, shows three layouts with a sample spread to use with this deck: a Four-Card Spread, an Animal Journey Spread (five cards), and an Animal Wheel Spread (seven cards).This is definitely not a deck for beginners. However, it is a must-have for tarot collectors, more so for those who like animal themed tarot since this is the best.

The Animals Divine Tarot by Lisa Hunt is one of the most beautiful and awe-inspiring decks I have ever run across in my 10+ years of collecting tarot decks. The watercolors come to life with bright, vibrant colors that stir the soul. The animals depicted look incredibly life-like and the Artist also paid a great deal of attention to the background. Her efforts have resulted in the creation of a deck that is both useful and beautiful - a rare combination these days with myriad of decks published each year.The accompanying book is very thorough, written by the Artist herself, as opposed to the common practice of the publisher matching the artist up with a professional writer who writes the interpretation of the cards. Ms. Hunt goes through a blow-by-blow interpretation of the main symbols depicted on each card, the significance of that particular animal being depicted, and each card description then ends with its tarot interpretation.If you love tarot and if you love animals and art, this deck is a definite MUST-HAVE!Blessings!Dr. Mary E. GutierrezMagickal-MusingsWhere Magick is a Way of Life!"},{"Title":"Animals Divine Tarot","review":"Animals Divine Tarot is a gorgeous deck that follows Rider-Waite structure and incorporates original symbolism. Artist Lisa Hunt uses well-chosen myths, and gods and goddesses from many cultures to breathe new life into the major arcana and court cards. Animals, birds, insects and a variety of sea life prowl, swim, prance, meander, climb, slither, flutter and fly through the minor arcana. Truly this is a deck in motion, mirroring the constant changes and cycles of the earth and all of her life forms.The art is exceptional and the imagery powerful and evocative. When first looking through the deck, I could not put the cards down. Each one beckons you to enter and once drawn in you are transported to a magical place where the spoken or written word is extraneous and meaningless. Each time there is something new to experience.I found myself smiling and nodding in recognition of some of the visual interpretations, whilst others were a bit more difficult to grasp at first. Further pondering upon those more difficult to grasp has proven to be very rewarding. The animals are wonderful teachers. I am delighted by the new understandings that Lisa Hunt's fresh use of symbols has facilitated.The accompanying book is well done and fairly detailed and includes some writing about each card, two spreads especially designed for the deck, and thoughts on meditation and connecting with the images. I haven't used either of the spreads, but have used the deck in a few readings for others and the insights shared through the imagery have proven to be relevant and helpful.The cards themselves come alive beyond the book to lend new insights and imagery to old themes. The Empress represented by Hera, languishes comfortably upon a rock, bare feet grazing the grass. A cow stands behind her. A peacock is to her left (the right side of the card). Only the body and head of the peacock are visible; the tail is hidden. In the forefront and all around the peacock colorful flowers bloom. This seems to suggest that the Empress is highly creative, but uses her creativity to nurture and beautify the earth. Instead of parading it around for show and solely personal gain (peacock's tail) the colorful flowers embody instead the fruit of her creative endeavors.I especially love Lisa's choices for the court cards; White Buffalo Calf Woman, Poseidon, NaNa Buluku, Ahau Kin and Quetzalcoatl to name a few. These mythic figures capture an archetypal energy that offers another layer of interpretation and meaning; perhaps a more pure one.Another choice I find particularly meaningful for humanity today is her use of Sedna for the Death key. Other favorite majors include Tara as Strength, Thunderbirds as The Tower, and Xochiquetzal as Temperance. Favorite minor arcana animals include Tiger as the Three of Pentacles, Firefly as the Ace of Wands, Whale as the Ten of Cups, Crow as the Nine of Swords and Alligator as the Five of Cups. Altogether the animals, myths, and legends weave a magical tapestry of wisdom that speaks to the Soul.Animals Divine may not be the best choice for beginners interested in learning the traditional symbols. It is an excellent deck for anyone wishing to read intuitively, for those desiring a fresh new perspective, for animal and nature lovers, and for those just wanting a feast for the eyes.After watching the progress of and eagerly anticipating this deck's release, I was delighted to find it was even lovelier than I had imagined it would be. Animals Divine has already become a favorite and I'm certain it will withstand the test of time."},{"Title":"Animals Divine Tarot","review":"\\"The animals that are showcased in the Animals Divine Tarot serve to bridge the divide between conscious resistance and unconscious knowledge. Their appearance is one that can help you to re-center and redefine who you are. If you tune into animals, you can learn to tune into yourself and identify the wealth of potential that lies within your grasp.\\" - From the companion bookAccording to author and artist Lisa Hunt, re-establishing a connection with animals can help us better understand the deep layers of the human psyche. By observing all manner of wildlife--such as the predatory instincts of a shark or the diligence of a beaver--we can marvel and appreciate each unique expression. With further contemplation, we can examine how wildlife behavior may apply to our life, including developing insight for navigating situations and cultivating growth.With the Animals Divine Tarot, Ms. Hunt has created 78 exquisite, luminous paintings of animals, reptiles, insects, fowl, and fish--marrying them with mythological figures from around the world. Many cultures honor the sacredness of animals, which often accompany gods and goddesses, with some of these divine beings actually shapeshifting into various animals.For the Major Arcana, each card highlights a different myth connected to a particular animal, god, or goddess. The Trickster Coyote, a beloved figure in Native American lore, makes an appearance as The Fool. The elephant-headed god Ganesha, a mover of obstacles according to Hindu mythology, is The High Priest (Hierophant) in this deck, while the Welsh goddess Rhiannon represents the archetypal Shadow (Devil). The fierce but glorious Thunderbirds make their appearance on The Tower, and Horus epitomizes the blazing energy of The Sun.Various deities from all over the world depict the varied approaches of the court cards, while critters majestic and tiny comprise the Minor Arcana. For example, caterpillars transform on the 6 of Wands card, the tiger embodies the 3 of Pentacles, the flapping, flailing heron reflects the 10 of Swords, while distracted dolphins swim on the 7 of Cups.Although the 198-page companion book to the Animals Divine Tarot doesn't mention traditional Rider-Waite-Smith imagery, symbolism, or numerology (except for a brief mention of the elements), the card interpretations are mostly consistent with these meanings. Ms. Hunt offers a rich repository for lore and symbol, but reminds readers that delving into the art on each card--and the realm of each animal--will yield unique, unexpected revelations for those who take the time for contemplation.Ms. Hunt does not discuss reversals in the companion book, and in a refreshing departure from the norm, there is no mention of rituals for \\"cleansing\\" or storing your deck. Three spreads are included in the back of the book, while two of the layouts are illustrated on separate cards.The satiny cards measure approximately 4 2 inches, resulting in easy shuffling. The card backing depicts a bronze mandala in the center of a cream-colored background, rendering the deck fully reversible. In addition to the deck and companion book, the Animals Divine Tarot set includes a black organdy bag and a cardboard box for storage.Unless you're quite attuned to animal energies and world mythologies, you'll likely be unable to use this deck \\"out of the box\\". Therefore, as a Tarot deck, I don't feel it's good for beginners. (However, if you're new to Tarot but have used animal oracle decks with success, you should be just fine.) Ms. Hunt's adept interpretations of her visions for the cards will ably equip readers to use Animals Divine Tarot for oracular and meditative purposes. Her intimate knowledge of wildlife will no doubt add breadth and depth to any reader's repository of associations.I've found this deck to be surprisingly pointed in its guidance, with each reading providing accurate, relevant insight. The artwork is gorgeous, making the Animals Divine Tarot a must for deck collectors, as well as those with an affinity for animal totems, shamanism, and animal-themed mythos.(To see 10 images from the Animals Divine Tarot, visit the Reviews--Decks section at [...])Janet Boyer, author of The Back in Time Tarot Book: Picture the Past, Experience the Cards, Understand the Present (coming Fall 2008 from Hampton Roads Publishing)"},{"Title":"Animals Divine Tarot","review":"I just received my kit and I cannot be more pleased. At first glance, the companion book appears interesting, informative and well written. The cards feel comfortable in my hands and shuffle easily. The card stock is quite sturdy and should last through years of heavy use. The art itself is something to behold and it really speaks to me. I am an animal lover so this deck looks like it will fit my needs perfectly. At this point, I cannot find anything to dislike about this deck.I've been reading tarot for many years and I can safely say that this deck looks like it will soon become my favorite. I give it my highest recommendation. I'll post an update after I've used it for a while, but at this point I want to thank Lisa Hunt for creating something that I feel deep within my heart will become a most cherished possesion and tool for reading.Ps. I just love her representation of Mama Cocha as the Queen of Cups!"},{"Title":"Animals Divine Tarot","review":"This Deck Is A Keeper! I relate to Animals a great deal and the art work draws me into each card. It is very importaint to \\"feel Part Of The Cards\\" and these allow me to do so. I have bought many decks that were bragged about just to be disapointed...The in-Depth descriptions of each card and the multi- symbols on each allow me to go into the pictures and see and feel the energy I need to to get a true feeling for what I am seeking. I am a Cancer and I need to feel my way around the symbols, absorb the energy.. not just look at the art work. These cards were so well thought out that I can do just that! They come with a FULL SIZED book, of nearly 200 pages, not a flimsy little stapled booklet made so it will fit into the deck box. I found my cards FINALLY!"},{"Title":"Animals Divine Tarot","review":"I bought this deck for myself and I adore the illustrations. They are amazingly detailed and display a wide array of animals, gods, and goddesses. The major arcana feature representations from every continent and many cultures. The animals in the minor arcana are gorgeous and I appreciated the color. Great gift for a first deck, yourself, or any animal lover."},{"Title":"Animals Divine Tarot","review":"The art by Lisa Hunt is breathtaking. The book that comes with the cards lists different layouts for readings and examples of readings. The book also gives well written details of interpretation of each card. This deck is also good for self readings as well as for other people."},{"Title":"Animals Divine Tarot","review":"This deck is an evocative combination of Pagan, Native American and Druid themes. It is traditional to the extent that it includes all 78 cards, but does not follow the themes of the Rider Waite images. Instead, it asks us to journey with our divine and animal guides for enlightenment.The major arcana and court cards have a God or Goddess depicted on each card. Its hard to pick one that is stand out...there are so many. Bast is radiant as The High Priestess. Hera makes a lovely Empress. Odin as the Moon and Horus as the Sun are well chosen and well executed. I like the two page descriptions of each card, each God and Goddess.The exception is the Fool. A handsome Coyote graces the Fool card. Hunt writes:\\"In Native American traditions the Coyote is the fool, the teacher, the traveler, the transformer and the trickster. Stories about the Coyote are varied and sometimes complex. But the essence of his character as culture hero can be found throughout Native American cultures.\\"This Companion book is more than just the \\"little white book\\" that comes with so many decks. It is a perfect (soft) bound, 5 1/4 x 8, 216 page book. It's a great resource. This deck would make a wonderful teaching devise for Pagan children! To that end, the book also has a bibliography with over 30 sources.The detail in each card includes symbolism consistent with meaning of the card. Kuan Yin is on the Star. The traditional pool of water and pitcher joins her. The illustration also show the peacock (sun, energy), panda (Yin & Yang) and the serpent that brought her water in the story of Kuan Yin.The suits are wands, swords, cups and pentacles. They are aligned with the Elements. Each one is as carefully crafted as the Major Arcana. The Companion descriptions and guidance for each pip are quite complete, 2 pages each.The cards are good quality, 2 3/4\\" x 4 5/8\\" format - just slightly larger than playing cards. They have a white border, thin gold \\"mat\\" and are in in muted, earthy tones of green, blue and brown. There is very little red in this deck. The God, Goddess or animal is identified on each card. The artwork is very detailed in a dreamy but realistic style. It appears to be watercolor or pencil - it has a translucent look to it.I recommend this deck to the collector that is looking to add an earthy, artistic Pagan deck to their collection. For the reader - it's a personal choice of course, but this is a fantastic, well-documented deck if are looking to add an animal deck to your repertoire."},{"Title":"Animals Divine Tarot","review":"Great set perfect for gift giving or keeping78 full kabalastic deck with corresponding dieties images and numerolgygreat for readings/medtation/pathwork cards are tranquil lovely images making it easier to relax meditate and read for yourself and othersnot sure where some get shamanic not tarot must be newbie or new age stuff but oh well new age not my thing really so not sureI recommend for all readers to learn also numerology/Dieties/color/animal images and kabalistic tree of life which all 78 card tarot is based onI dont keep any of my cards in order unless Im working on a life path meditation type thingor recharging them or myselfI just shuffle and goIve been reading Tarot/Runes /Oracles cards nature Etc most of my life not for money for myself/ family /friends etc kinda a family spritual thing not to be paid probut anyhow heres my 2 cents for what its worth 78 card deck wth kabalstic meanings to me are pretty much same no matter what the imagery animal /shamanistic or whateverstart with that then go into gut intuition of imagerymy advice is try and brush up on meanings of cards then use your intuition inner gifts higher powerto see what the cards powers are telling youI dont go by reversal muchcards get Reversed in shuffling go by cards around it in spread and your intuitionalso may be silly to some but find decks that are to you comfortable imagery that speaks pleasing to youIve been given a few decks I just dont care for the imagery and it affected my readingI use mainly use /Dragon tarotmythical tarot and now these Ryder-Waite some like i occassionally use them for some things dont care for imagery muchmy 86 card Enochian cads are for for special occassionsBut I am attuned to nature and think its a great kit at a good pricebut will use traditional meanings and intuiton to read them and add imagery book for the rest"},{"Title":"Animals Divine Tarot","review":"I added this deck to my collection, because a friend had shared images of the cards with me in the past.

The Arps know their subject well and have done a fine job explaining it to frazzled parents who are desperately seeking help.In fact, we've used this as a text book for some parenting classes and have received enthusiastic responses from the parents who have attended. The material is easy to read and grasp. The suggested solutions and ways to dealing with children in \\"the change\\" are helpful and easy to implement."},{"Title":"Suddenly They're 13","review":"item arrived on time in great condition. The book was in good condition with the binding completely in tact as website had stated. There was no markings in the book either. It was exactly as the web site had stated it would be and was on time."},{"Title":"Suddenly They're 13","review":"This book has a Christian theme, but can be very helpful to any parent of teens. The Arps are well known for their marriage seminars, and this book is another great work of theirs. They discuss rites of passage, giving appropriate gifts and new levels of trust and responsibility as the child goes from preteen to teenager. A great idea from the book is a box for each birthday that has multiple items in it, like a house key or car keys--items that have obvious meanings of maturity attached to them.The book helps you relate to your child and help them, including backing off and staying away when necessary, as they begin preparing to leave the nest. Excellent reference resource to keep on hand to help you as a parent love and nurture your teen through thick and thin, zits and all. Two thumbs up!"},{"Title":"I Lived to Tell about It","review":"For all you non-believers, or people who do not think your life can change. This is definitely the book that you need to read.

If you have ever struggled to be free from the pitfalls of sin this is the book that will set you free. I have been a Christian for many years. Yet much of my Christian life has been in bondage of my past. Once I put into practice the steps Eddie has laid out in this book I was set free. The grip the enemy had on my life for many years was broken. Today I work with men that often have the same struggles I had. When I meet such a man I give him one of Eddie's books. Then set back and watch the Lord work. But man or woman you too can break free from the enemy's grip on your life. Buy this book; you will be glad you did."},{"Title":"Breaking the Enemy's Grip","review":"I was first introduced to the principles of this book when God used Eddie Smith to minister into my life over fourteen years ago. After praying with me one afternoon, he handed me a teaching booklet called \\"10 Steps To Freedom\\" and challenged me to pray and follow through with the steps outlined in the booklet. Little did I know then how it would transform my life or how I would in turn use it to minister into the lives of many people over the following years.This is a powerful, insightful and practical book on leaving behind defeat and beginning to make a difference in God's Kingdom purposes and in the lives of others. God can bring an end to a painful past, peace instead of torment, forgiveness instead of bitterness. Breaking The Enemy's Grip will impact you for sure!Debbie"},{"Title":"Breaking the Enemy's Grip","review":"i highly recommend this book for many reasons. the first is that it clearly engages and fulfills the title. eddie smith confronts issues that many are fearful or unwilling to confront. his tremendous life and ministry experiences comes through loud and clear so that the reader says \\"now i understand\\". as a pastor, i have seen many walk well below the life of victory Christ has for them so this book will be a regular part of our recommended reading list."},{"Title":"Breaking the Enemy's Grip","review":"It is amazing how many strongholds you can allow enter your life without realing it. Thanks to the appendix for enlightening me in areas I was not aware were cultic practices. When I started to make my list, it was getting longer and longer as the Lord revealed to me what needed to be address. This is a thought provoking book that takes you to the next level for spiritual intimacy with out Savior."},{"Title":"Breaking the Enemy's Grip","review":"I liked this book. Also read Pigs In The Parlor by Frank Hammond. It will enlighten you on bondages, strongholds, curses, and subtle satanic opposition that delays answers to prayers and other demonic rubbish that can prohibit God's promises from working in your life."},{"Title":"Breaking the Enemy's Grip","review":"This book addresses the sin issues of life and how to break the spiritual attachments that came through life circumstances.One of the things, I struggle with is how I have been judged by those in the church because of health challenges; when I didn't recover completely, I got dissed.Few Christian books will address the church as a culprit in victimizing. Eddie Smith doesn't shy from that very politically incorrect statement.Here are some great words found on page 56-\\"...Western church the gradual development of a \\"Christian victimization\\" culture. Prior to that, believers largely considered life's ups and downs a reality to be expected while living on a sin-cursed planet. They understood that God even uses trouble as a tool to fashion us into the image of His Son. Have we forgotten Jesus' words?\\"\\"If the people of this world hate you, just remember they hated me first...Whileyou are in the world, you will have to suffer... (John 15:18, 20-21; 16:33 CEV).\\"What's happened to us? The Western church as embraced pop-psychology's implication that the lack of self-love, low self-esteem, difficulty paying attention, or any feelings of rejection are abnormal, they promise that everyone's life can be easily adjusted with enough counseling and medication.\\"Unfortunately, many Christians in recent years have also embraced an unbiblical health-wealth theology built around the supremacy of human needs over divine purposes. Spewing from many of America's pulpits is the concept of a God in \\"our\\" image who exists to meet \\"our\\" needs and who when necessary, will set aside His purposes on a moment's notice to see that we are pain and problem-free.\\"This book will challenge you, he is truthful and direct. He talks about how we can pick up offenses of another and have the sin that comes with it. \\"Even the good parts of our nature, our sense of justice and mercy, when misapplied, can cause us to react in ungodly ways. There is never a right way to do a wrong thing.\\"Get ready to have the spiritual iodine handy because he is going to open those wounds and call them what they are, sin.The book covers far more than what I've mentioned. The book addresses what Christian living is all about, the baggage we carry, the need to forgive, making things right with others and the steps to freedom.Eddie Smith knows it isn't blab it and grab it. It is about using the tools of our warfare to deal with spiritual wickedness in high places.Seldom do we read truth like this.I think this is a book you want to review periodically because it is easy to lapse into a sinful groove. I saw somethings that I didn't really think of as sinful just jump off the page.Good book, well worth the money."},{"Title":"Breaking the Enemy's Grip","review":"I heartily endorse Eddie Smith's book \\"Breaking the Enemy's Grip\\" if you want to be free from sinful habits and thoughts that may plague you. I am a born-again believer and a student of the Bible. But as I read this book, I was forced to confront certain habits and thought patterns I had entertained for years that were simply wrong. God used the information in this book to show me the error of my ways and to instruct me in what I needed to do to get free and stay free from sinful routines. The book is well-written and has a natural flow. You don't have to be a deep thinker or an accomplished theologian to understand the points Eddie brings forth. But you do have to be serious about changing. You have to be determined to be free, and be willing to do what must be done to break the enemy's grip off of your life. This book is not for everyone. Those who want to play at church, pretend to be Christian or life half in the world and half in the Kingdom will find this book troubling and upsetting. But if you are desperate and living in shame, what Eddie teaches in \\"Breaking the Enemy's Grip\\" is the truth of God that will set you free."},{"Title":"Indecent Exposure","review":"This book must be one of the funniest I've ever read. My girlfrind threw me out of bed at four in the morning because I'd apparently been laughing in my sleep after having read the book. The best thing about any of Tom Sharpe's books is that you can read them again and again and still laugh all over again! Superb!"},{"Title":"Indecent Exposure","review":"What more can I say? Go read it! I read it about 12 years ago or more. It was fantastic. I read it at least once every 2-3 yrs after that and it has never failed to make me laugh again and again. Though Apartheid is dead, the humor is still valid worldwide. Read it as satire or just for its humour. Either way, you'll love it. By the way, dont be put off that its British and thus a bit heavy in the reading department. Its not. Its a great read and you could easily finish reading it in one day unless, of course, you fall off your chair or bed and injure yourself laughing. Believe me, I'm not exaggerating."},{"Title":"Indecent Exposure","review":"Tom Sharpe is one of the funniest writers on the planet, and this is his masterpiece. It takes place in the days of southafrican apartheid, and it's weird, wild and wonderful and imposible to explain. For your own good: Read it!"},{"Title":"Indecent Exposure","review":"Today I'm back--rebuying this book in hopes of reliving some of the experience it produced 20+ years ago when I read it on a transatlantic flight. Everyone around me was solemnly absorbed in tearjerker movie while I was convulsed to tears of laughter in their midst.When I realized Indecent Exposure was a sequel to Riotous Assembly I raced from the airport to the bookstore and ordered that one too. It was no disappointment. That came when I voraciously bought nearly every other novel Tom Sharpe wrote and found none of his other works even came close to his 2 South Africa novels.Small wonder that oppressive regime expelled him. I ought to mention that however slapstick funny this has been described to you (and it is!) it is not an appropriate gift for your 12-year-old niece. The uproarious misanthropy is midnight black and as politically incorrect for many Americans as it was subversive for South African censors."},{"Title":"Indecent Exposure","review":"Tom Sharpe's novels, always popular in Britain, are known for being rude spoofs on the political establishment and of the upper echelons of British society. However his earliest works, as in 'Indecent Exposure', the setting is apartheid-era South Africa. His humour is still very baudy, perhaps repetitively so, and his target are the hypocritical, racist white establishment. Some of the language is a bit vulgar, and I imagine some folks might be offended. But Sharpe hits the bulls-eye on his target: the squabbling, pretentious and myoptic white (English/Afrikaan) establishment.As for the story? Well, it somewhat doesn't matter. Some nonsense about a rural town's police force trying to fight (imagined) communist insurgents using some rather ridiculous means. It's all very slapstick, farcical. Enjoy the book for its now dated (historical) view of South Africa, not for its paper thin story.Bottom line: a very curious and funny piece of Sharpe's earlier works. Certainly not his best, but he delivers the laughs."},{"Title":"Indecent Exposure","review":"I first read a Tom Sharpe novel 31 years ago on my way for a job interview to emigrate to South Africa, fellow passengers on the train must have wondered what was so funny that I was reduced at times to tears of laughter, I have since read every book Tom Sharpe has written, almost every one has had the same effect on me, INDECENT EXPOSURE is about South Africa in the dark days of apartheid, the 30 years I have lived here in South Africa have not reduced the hilarity of the book, but added to my appreciation of it, having just finished reading it for the 3rd time, I recommend this book for anyone who needs an escape on a long journey or needs to escape from reality for a while, the best advice I can give you is to read Tom Sharpe's first book on South Africa \\"RIOTOUS ASSEMBLY\\" followed as soon as you have recovered by this book \\"INDECENT EXPOSURE \\" I am certain you will not regret it."},{"Title":"Indecent Exposure","review":"Tom Sharpe is at his funniest in this hilarious classic. You will laugh out loud.Tom was thrown out of South Africa for his cutting commentary on the country, and I would thoroughly recommend his witty and original writing.Follow with Riotous Assembly, Porterhouse Blue and Wilt (pretty close to the bone for prudes).All available in good, used format from Amazon."},{"Title":"Indecent Exposure","review":"Tom Sharpe is possibly the funniest author I have ever read. I've bought many of his books to give away as gifts. There's no point in laughing alone."},{"Title":"Indecent Exposure","review":"I split my sides with laughter from page one to the end. Tom Sharpe deserves a Nobel prize"},{"Title":"Indecent Exposure","review":"Hilarious, extremely funny. This is one of the fiction works that have made me laugh more in my life, including films, comics, or whatever.I read this book after discovering Sharpe trough Wilt' s saga. One tip: read the african novels first! I have read almost all the books from Sharpe, and I think the two south-african satiras are the best, specially Indecent Exposure."},{"Title":"Isamu Noguchi - A Sculptor's World","review":"Although I read the first publishing of this book (1968), i can only assume that the most recent printing lives up to the earlier edition. For a student of art, landscape architecture, furniture design, or sculpture this is a wonderful book to have in your collection. Spanning decades, noguchi explains his motives and reasons behind the pieces he so lovingly created. The text can be thick at times, but that is not necesisarily a bad thing. There is a wealth of information to be had; one only has to find it. There are quite a few photographic plates of noguchis work, however they were all in black in white except for a few. This is not necesisarily a bad thing either, as colorful pictures can be easily found on the web or in other (less auto-biographical) books. All in all, noguchi has much wisdom to offer, as long as you have the patience and interest to match the subject matter."},{"Title":"Isamu Noguchi - A Sculptor's World","review":"I was very happy to find out this book (originally published in '68) had been re-published by another publisher.

This is his autobiography and tells of his illustrious career from start to finish.Just becoming a Texas Ranger tends make one \\"legendary\\" in our great state, but Ramiro Martinez reached the \\"legendary\\" status long before he donned the Ranger's star. Ray tells briefly of his childhood in the opening chapters then moves into his law enforcement career as it began in Austin, then gives explicit detail of the event that shaped his life and shrouded him in notoriety. On August 1, 1966, Officer Ray Martinez shot and killed Charles Whitman, the University of Texas tower sniper. For his actions, Martinez earned the Police Medal of Valor. The story is told in vivid detail. I was impressed of things that stuck in Martinez' mind of that day.The book then chronicles Martinez' move to the DPS, then into the Rangers and the tribulations associated with being a Hispanic in a traditionally Caucasian law enforcement group. In all, Martinez devotes eleven chapters to his life as a Ranger. Here he talks about many of the cases he worked and gives a splendid account of the day to day life of the Ranger.I won't try to convince you that this is the most well written book you will ever read. It's not. Martinez isn't a professional writer, he is a professional lawman. But he does a fine job of depicting the nuts and bolts of law enforcement without all the sugar coating. It's not always \\"keep you on the edge of your seat\\" prose, but it is a story that deserved to be heard of a career that has been an inspiration to many.If you want into the mind of a real lawman, not some dreamed up Hollywood depiction, you will want to read this book. He's a fine man who has left an indelible mark on Texas society. Around here, we call him Ranger Ray.Monty Raineywww.juntosociety.com"},{"Title":"They Call Me Ranger Ray","review":"Thrilling read. I can't honestly say I've heard a story to match this one anywhere else. Ray's account of the U.T. sniper assault will keep you spellbound. I found myself re-reading each paragraph of this part of the book, savoring every phrase before continuing. Ray tells his story with humility, giving due respect to the divine influence which protected him in the advance. His story includes several touches of humor and irony which add balance to the grim reality of the event. Unlike the well known assasinations of John and Bobby Kennedy, and Martin Luther King, this is a story of proof beyond a reasonable doubt in which justice prevails and the guilty pay the price for the crime."},{"Title":"They Call Me Ranger Ray","review":"Ranger Ray's life as a boy reminded me of my younger years growing up.

This is 101 material.2) how processors work3) how OBDII works, including signal processing (useless info for tuners)3) anecdotal info on the Diablo chip, bordering on a sales pitch.4) anecdotal info on Dario Orlando/Steeda.5) lots of useless colorful pictures (PADDING) -- e.g. Dario sitting in his car tuning it (This really helps me tune mine).6) lots of big print.7) lots of margin space.8) narrow columns of text.9) a bunch of blank pages in the back for notes. PADDING.10) a cooking (yes, COOKING) chapter on some stupid favorite recipe of the author.11) OBDII scan codes. PADDING.The author clearly was told to fill [n] pages so they could hardbound the thing and charge $... It reminded me of grade school when I was told to write an [n] page essay on [subject x]: Using the usual tricks, I wrote long winded sentences with no contractions, double spaced lines, and big margins. The only difference between my essays and this book is the price.I was so mad after skimming this book that I threw it away the day I got it. I bought the book because I just purchased an EEC-Tuner and was interested in learning more about the subject.

Even thinking about this book is making me angry."},{"Title":"Ford Tuning Secrets Revealed (Secrets Revealed series)","review":"Since I own a company that manufactures tuning hardware and software, I was curious to what this book was about.After reading it, it does alot to help the reader understand what is involved in tuning the Ford PCM. It is not a &quot;How-To&quot; book but more of an in-depth guide on the process of tuning.The book is full of colorful diagrams and picture that take the reader through each step in the tuning process. How the Ford EEC works, how chips work, how OBD-II scantools work and how the whole process is put together to tune a vehicle.

I haven't ever read a chick lit book where the main character, Georgia, is a hair stylist/colorist. It was a nice change of pace from the usual 'I'm a lawyer/editor/waitress/PR person'. I liked that the main focus of Georgia was just trying to live out her dream to become a hair stylist no matter what her mom thought about it. I liked that the main focus wasn't finding love like many other chick lit books I've read. The book takes us from a prologue chapter of the present then starts us out at the beginning, meaning when she decides 'this is what I want with my life'. There was some humor too. I laughed out loud a few times. All in all a great first novel. I'm really looking forward to another book by this author."},{"Title":"Beyond the Blonde","review":"Hey--enough with the chick lit (or chic--it is about style!) label; color me one guy who enjoyed this very much. Kathleen Flynn-Hui novel is funny, warm, and a page-turning treat. Her best writing observes the socio-economic lifestyle of New York's elite, beginning with her much admired categorization of the five types of clients who have her hair colored by the protagonist (\\"Georgia\\"), to her descriptions of the frivolous activites of the rich and usually famous (e.g., \\"Le Chic Chien,\\" a fashion show with designer clothes on pampered dogs) to the cut throat gossip and competition designed to maintain or improve one's already-elevated social status.The book follows Georgia's ascent from beauty school in her hometwon of Weekeepmie, New Hampshire--with an earlier education from her mom. Doreen, who operates her own \\"low-end\\" salon--to the heights of fame at Jean Luc's salon in Manhattan. Georgia has a \\"tough broad\\" voice, the reader learns how she really feels about her generally spoiled and always demanding clientele who come from the most rarified strata of publishing, TV, movies, publicity, and modeling, as well as spouses-of-wealthy-males. Georgia doesn't particularly like them, but she learns the rules of client-colorist engagement, and she emerges as a likeable, funny, and highly observant lens on the New York/Hamptons social scene.The book relied too much on cliches and some predictable narrative turns: Georgia falls in love with the suave, not gay (as she thought) Italian stylist Massimo; when seemingly crushed by the city she remembers the pithy, homespun sayings of her (sainted) Mom; she develops strong feelings for another Weekeepeemie student(Patrick, who IS gay), and, improbably, they're both hired by the stereotypically imperious and emotional Frenchman, Jean-Luc. Georgia's test of character occurs when the wildly successful Jean Luc plays them, promising she, Patrick, and Massimo their own Jean-Luc franchises, and then reneging bigtime on his offer. Georgia goes on so long about her doubts of starting a new salon with Massimo and Patrick--eventually abandoning them, that the reader just wishes that Flynn-Hui would cut to the inevitable reconciliation. The narrative's delirious, made-for-TV \\"surprise\\" is both disappointing and satisfying, as Flynn-Hui successfully leads us to differentiate between the good, hard-working, usually ethical Georgia and friends, and the self-absorbed, sometimes cruel personalities of clients and Jean-Luc himself.Overall, however, it's a smart and funny take on the habituees of Manhattan, constantly pursueing the trendy, and only rarely showing us some core of integrity. More than chick lit., I'd categorize this as great confection-filled summer reading. It's not too demanding, but it doesn't insult your intelligence either. The author, like Georgia, is a colorist at a top New York salon, lending veracity to the incredibly self-indulgent women seeking physical perfection."},{"Title":"Beyond the Blonde","review":"There's nothing like a refreshingly unique \\"Working Girl Lit\\" book where the character has a job other than in the publishing or movie industry. In Beyond the \\"Blonde\\" by Kathleen Flynn-Hui, our main character Georgia has the job of a stylist.Georgia grew up in a tiny town in New Hamsphire, working with her mother in the town's beauty salon. Georgia always knew she'd move on at some point. After attending school at Wilfred Academy, she gets hired at Jean-Luc, a famous Fifth Avenue New York City salon. Starting from the bottom she manages to work her way up, make new friends, and enjoy her new and exciting life.She even manages to fall in love with a coworker, the handsome Massimo. But as always, good things change or come to an end; when the salon is bought out by another company, Georgia, Massimo and their friend know that it's time to take a huge chance: they want to open their own salon. But Jean-Luc has been known in the past to completely destroy the competition, or anyone who goes against him. Georgia must choose between love, her job, and her future.Will she make the right decision?I absolutely loved this book. It is one of those books that have glamourous settings and characters, but manages to stay down-to-earth. Georgia was an amazing main character. She was at times uncertain, but mainly strong. The story had a lot of details about the goings-on at a famous salon, which was fascinating. The writing was absorbing and kept me engrossed.I couldn't find anything about this book that I didn't like, even given the slight \\"fairy-tale\\" plot, probably because the character had to work hard and nothing was given to her on a platter.I highly recommend this great novel and am confident that others will love it too- especially those who enjoy both glamour and books that revolve around a character's career.

Tutored by her Mom, Doreen, who runs the best there is for hair in Weepeekeemie, New Hampshire, Georgia can't wait to take a bite out of the Big Apple. When she's offered a job, no matter that it's a lowless one, at the toniest salon in the city, Jean-Luc's, she doesn't wait to touch up her roots.She sweeps floors, colors dogs' hair to match their owners, and makes house calls to some of the ritziest digs she's ever seen. With diligence, charm, and luck she works her way up. But, there's not always room at the top and she soon discovers that beauty isn't as beauty does.

Georgia had to cater to the whims and fancies of her rich and powerful clients but despite that, she was satisfied with what she was doing as well as making good money.This was a very interesting novel as the author, being the wife of a popular stylist was able to provide insights into the life of a hairstylist in a popular and demanding salon. What I enjoyed most about the book was that the author really took her time in developing the main character, Georgia. A lot of these novels that centered around the rich and famous did just that, without developing the main characters.

It's an entertaining read."},{"Title":"Beyond the Blonde","review":"I bought this for my daughter who is a hair stylist. She enjoyed it very much"},{"Title":"Beyond the Blonde","review":"Reviewed by Nancy Young for Reader Views (8/06)In \\"Beyond The Blonde\\", author Kathleen Flynn-Hui gives the reader a behind-the-scenes look at the \\"world of beauty\\". The best to come along since The Nanny Diaries and The Devil Wears Prada, \\"Beyond the Blonde\\", points out how ugly the supposed world of beauty can really be. The heroine, Georgia Watkins, is a small town girl who grew up in her mother's beauty shop, without a father around and a little sister. The beauty shop manages to feed her family, but that is all. She moves to the big city after graduating from beauty school, but she refuses to forget where she came from. Growing up in a single parent home, Georgia knows what it is like to barely get by and she is determined not to fail. Her biggest struggle is overcoming her own fears and going for what she really wants in life.A brief glance at the novel might think it is only a shallow glance of the rich and famous, but \\"Beyond the Blonde\\" has much more substance than that. The first couple of pages will encourage the reader to find a comfy reading spot, because she or he will not want to put the book down. While Georgia's challenges are real, her clients can be just plain ridiculous- from the clients who bring in the children to match their hair color to the client who needs her hand held while a small strand of her hair is highlighted. Some clients will bring laughter to the reader, while some will just disgust or annoy. The jealousy, competition and back stabbing are not to surprising to find in a salon, but it is all fascinating just the same.Georgia has to learn many hard lessons as the big city salon is very different than the small town beauty parlor she grew up with. The author even points out how the names are different. Most small town beauty salons have catchy names, such as \\"Mane Event\\" and the like; names you wouldn't find in a city such as New York. Anyone familiar with small towns will be able to support that fact.\\"Beyond The Blonde\\" is purely delightful, a book to give to all your friends, and even your hairstylist. You can't help but not fall in love with Georgia- the small town girl who makes it big but still has a big heart- and you will find yourself cheering Georgia on and hoping for the best.Received book free of charge."},{"Title":"Beyond the Blonde","review":"I actually couldn't bring myself to finish this. The issue wasn't the plot or dislikeable characters, I just found the writing to be redundant. It really made the hair world seem boring. If she was trying to disect the upper class of American society, like Julien Fellowes did in \\"Snobs\\" for Britain, \\"Beyond the Blond\\" lacked depth. I guess that even though the author was trying to convey the ugly side of beauty, its deeper meaning fell short and it remained ambivalent, gossipy and superficial in its tone.Also, I had a hard time with the time line. During \\"Farah Fawcett\\" hair and Studio 54 days, the main character was 16 and about 6 or seven years later, people had cell phones and were getting botox. This really didn't make any sense to me.Overall, if you are looking for a book with a bit of analytical gossip, I would recommend \\"Snobs\\" because this book did not live up to its title."},{"Title":"Beyond the Blonde","review":"I had such a fun time reading this novel that I could NOT put it down. I just had to find out what was going to happen. It's a perfect summer read about salons and hairdressers! If you love \\"Jonathon\\" you'll LOVE this book!"},{"Title":"Algebra","review":"Birkhoff and MacLane collaborated for much of their careers, and their \\"A Survey of Modern Algebra\\", first published in 1941, was an easy-to-read, easy-to-teach-from, easy-to-learn-from early fruit of their collaboration. This jointly written book \\"Algebra\\", first published in 1967 and vastly improved in the 3rd Edition, can be far more difficult to tackle unless one goes at it with understanding of how to approach it. It mostly reflects MacLane's approach, rather than Birkhoff's, and MacLane was not only brilliant, but unusual among pure mathematicians, perhaps even idiosyncratic; he finally died at an advanced age a few months ago, and his passion for his field is reflected in the fact that he continued to advise graduate students well into his 90s, just as he had advised me (and criticized my thinking incessantly) as a graduate student more than 50 years before.MacLane was far less interested in any particular topic in mathematics, although he was a master of many, than he was in how one should think about mathematics to understand it, do it on one's own, extend it, and most important of all, recognize when one had fully though through a problem and solved it, as contrasted to having merely produced a plausible discussion of it.I know of no book on pure mathematics more worth reading than this one, but in contrast to some other reviewers who are probably clearer thinkers than I, I have to tackle it with great patience and care. The secret of grasping it without getting bogged down is to keep constantly in mind that MacLane filled in details without being much interested in them except as necessary completion of exposition. So, when you read it, do not concentrate on details; concentrate on overall structure of thought and exposition and then, later, come back to absorb details. That was how MacLane worked, and that was how he tried to teach his students to work. The key question always in his mind was: what formulation of axioms and structure is fruitful for attacking the topic at hand, and how can we use that formulation to create an inexorable train of thought leading to important results? This book, \\"Algebra\\" is very much a reflection of that way of thinking.So, when you first read this book, skip freely over much of the development of particular topics. Instead, spend a great deal of time thinking about definitions, and about the precise way in which key theorems are stated. Spend time and effort exploring the question of why seemingly trivial variations of these would be less fruitful, or could even lead one into error. Skip from one part of the book to another, without getting bogged down in any one part. Ask yourself also why certain topics and certain cases are excluded. E.g. right at the beginning of the discussion of quadratic forms is a simple definition which begins: \\"If V is a finite dimensional vector space over a field F of characteristic not 2, ...\\" Pause right there and ponder over why fields of characteristic 2 are excluded from this definition; just skim the next ten pages without studying them. If you think hard enough to see why fields of characteristic 2 must be excluded from the discussion, the entire ensuing discussion of quadratic forms becomes crystal clear.Once you have mastered the style in which the material is presented, you can quite easily come back and follow the details. And if you do that, I hope you will find this ook as rewarding as I have."},{"Title":"Algebra","review":"After getting frustated by nearly all the so-called &quot;authoritative&quot; books on abstract algebra (Lang, Hungerford, Jacobson), I really can say that MacLane/Birkhoff is the best die-hard classic on algebra. Now I must stress that this book IS NOT out-of-print: the third edition is actually published by AMS/Chelsea.There's an interesting thing about the evolution of this book: the first edition has become famous among mathematicians, because it brought for the first time an elementary exposition of categories and universal constructions, directly from the horse's mouth (MacLane founded the theory of categories together with S. Eilenberg; Birkhoff was the creator of the theory of lattices), which is used as a basic tool throughout the book; it also contained unusual topics such as multilinear algebra and affine and projective spaces, but no Galois theory. The second edition has gained a chapter on Galois theory, but has lost the part on affine and projective spaces.The third edition is the best! It has recovered the part which was lost in the second edition, and had its exposition considerably polished. While most other books expose abstract algebra as a ugly, prawling monster, MacLane/Birkhoff manage to explain quite esoterical topics (many of them created and/or developed by themselves) in a surprisingly natural and tasty way (compare it with the dry, encyclopaedic style of Hungerford and Lang); although quite big, the book supports several ways of reading and teaching its parts without sacrificing clarity.

Eilenberg; Birkhoff was the creator of the theory of lattices), which is used as a basic tool throughout the book; it also contained unusual topics such as multilinear algebra and affine and projective spaces, but no Galois theory. The second edition has gained a chapter on Galois theory, but has lost the part on affine and projective spaces.The third edition is the best! It has recovered the part which was lost in the second edition, and had its exposition considerably polished.

We are talking about the 3rd edition here -- don't get an earlier edition!"},{"Title":"Algebra","review":"Garrett Birkhoff and S. MacLane's _A Survey of Modern Algebra_ introduced U.S. undergraduates to the (axiomatic) algebra of Emmy Noether and Emil Artin, with elementary topics useful in applications in science and engineering. Birkhoff-MacLane has a place for algebraic number theory, but puts it in its place---Chapter 14! Birkhoff-MacLane features Birkhoff's interests in congruence relations (c.f., universal algebra), partially ordered sets (c.f., lattice theory), and linear algebra and geometry.MacLane-Birkhoff's Algebra strives to teach algebra using the spirit and the ideas of category theory. Thus module theory is central to the text. However, this text is in theory accessible to undergraduate students, because the level of abstraction increases gradually, the examples are elementary, proofs are given in detail, and most problems can be solved easily (in the beginning chapters). These features make MacLane-Birkhoff a complement to Lang's Algebra, which uses category theory.(Also, MacLane-Birkhoff does use ideas from lattice theory and universal algebra more than other texts and has a particularly detailed development of linear and multilinear algebra.)For a more comprehensive graduate textbook, I would recommend Grillet's \\"Algebra\\" (which should replace Lang's book except in isolated populations of algebraic number theory)."},{"Title":"Algebra","review":"This is a fabulous book. I have had basically one year of effectively 'algebra for non-mathematicians' at a graduate level, and have a background in Physics and Engineering. I find this book to be the perfect next step in terms of understanding things a bit more deeply than Dummit&Foote, in particular because they bring in some wider issues and connect them to the basic material of group theory, ring theory, modules vector spaces etc. In other words it covers the same or similar material as Dummit & Foote, but adds in some wider examples (more lattice theory, operator theory) as well as a higher level of sophistication because it brings in a category theory perspective for example. It seems that this book is really oriented toward seeing the big mathematical picture implicit in lots of physics. So in that sense, for me, it's a fantastic mathematical physics book, without explicitly being so."},{"Title":"Algebra","review":"I had the first edition of this book as a student about 30 years ago and found that although the text was for the most part readable, the notion of universal element notion from category theory was introduced in a baffling way very early on and this was the stumbling block.I've been rereading mathematics books out of pleasure of late and wanted to read this one, so I looked up the Amazon reviews. It was written that you should get the third edition. I ordered it and was not disappointed. The stumbling block has been recognized by the authors and pushed to much further in the book. A new chapter on Galois Theory has been added.The contents of this book is more basic in general than say Lang's book and the reader is not left to fill in the missing pieces and it is generally more readable. What's more the exercises are well chosen to consolidate the learning.The book is not encyclopedic, but to my mind constitutes a very solid modern grounding for any mathematical student."},{"Title":"Algebra","review":"Let's start off with the bad: Not having a marker for the end of each proof annoys me. Some of the terminology is a little awkward. (For example, the word \\"homomorphism\\" appears once in the entire text, to note it as an alternative to their usage of the word \\"morphism\\".) There are a few minor typos here and there. And that's it. I have nothing else really negative to say about this book.I make no claims to being a math prodigy; I pursue it simply because I enjoy it. When I read math, it's a struggle. What I found so remarkable about this book is that I was not struggling, despite the complexity of the material. That's not to say I found nothing in here difficult, because it's all difficult to some degree by the very nature of the material, but that the moments of frustration were few and far between. I will admit that I had familiarity with probably about 30% of the material when starting, so it is possible my opinion would be different had I not known what a group was beforehand. I kind of doubt that though, the exposition seemed nearly ideal. Beyond being a smooth read, there was no overstatement. Everything said added to the content.The book covers a lot of territory in only 600 pages, but none of it should be a surprise to see in an algebra text: groups, rings, modules, Galois theory, a little on categories, etc. I think the chapter on matrices should be pointed out in particular. This is a better explanation of how matrices and their entries can and ought to be interpreted than any other I have read, including Axler! Admittedly, Axler does a slightly better job with some of the other linear algebra topics, such as characteristic polynomials.Prerequisites for this book are extremely slim - nave familiarity with the real and complex number systems are the only absolute necessity. However, anyone taking this on with nothing more than the bare minimum is going to be in for quite a challenge. You should already have some comfort with reading texts filled with theorems and proofs.This is possibly the best textbook I have encountered to date. If you want to learn algebra, I can't imagine a better single place to look to get a well-rounded exposure to the subject."},{"Title":"Algebra","review":"I enjoyed Mac Lane's exposition.

It had many useful definitions and theorems in it and its rigorous, but readable approach seemed attractive to me and almost converted me into a rigorous mathematician, but obviously it turned out to be too abstract at the end.However, the main problem was that several years later, because of particle-physics motivations, I tried to learn some things about the Lie groups, Lie algebras (e.g. exceptional Lie algebras), and their representations, and initially I assumed that such a big book had to contain something useful about these topics. It did not, I think.This book is very good if you want to learn most of the rigorous math, partly based on the generalized abstract nonsense (also known as category theory), as it was known decades ago - the definitions and basic theorems about the basic algebraic structures. But you must be ready that many newest subjects - and those that are hot today - are not covered.The book contains many problems - and these problems are solved in another book, which you may find very useful."},{"Title":"Motor Control and Learning: A Behavioral Emphasis","review":"Franklin Henry is acknowledged as the father of motor behavior research. His work on reaction time, the motor program, and development of the Specificity Hypothesis have spurred an unparalleled amount of research in the field. Building off the work of Henry, Schmidt, who is a direct student of Henry developed the Schema Theory of Motor Learning. Over the past 30 years the theory has generated much research, being referenced in over 700 journal articles, and achieving the \`citation classic' award by the Institute for Scientific Information (Lee, 2003).Schmidt has also founded the Journal of Motor behavior. Therefore no one is more qualified to write a book on Motor Behavior. Further, Richard Lee is just as qualified, publishing extensively in motor behavior and psychology journals. He is also on the cutting edge of Motor program research, constructing his Cognitive Effort Theory of motor learning.As a second generation student of Henry, I have been fortunate to have studied under and researched with two first generation students of Henry. Including Dr. Ostarello and Dr. Caplain, as well as studied extensively with one of the nations greatest scientists, and a second generation student of Henry, Dr. Sawyer. I have also instructed in College Motor Control Labs.Through my extreme study of Motor Behavor, including countless journal articles, and an extensive list of Motor Behavior books I can say with assuredy that this is the most proficient, and outstanding book in its class on the market.What I am especially impressed with, is the detail Schmidt and Lee go into when describing a certain motor phenomenon. For example in the Speed Accuracy Trade off Chapter, they take you from the work of Woodworth (1899) in which he first formally studied the phenomenon, to the work of Fitts. In doing so they painstakingly and accurately describe each study used by these Giants. They then take you to the present and discuss if these scientists theories have continued to recieve support. Of particular interest in that Chapter was work presented by Schmidt on the Linear Speed accuracy trade off.Current dominant theory on how movements, namely ballistic movements are controled is Henry's (1958) Motor Program Theory origionally called the Memory Drum Theory. Schmidt has carried this research to the more modern Schema Motor Program Theory. As critical as this concept is to Motor Behavior students, it is a priveledge to be able to read directly from the men who devised these theories. This book provides just that.Whether you are a student, professor, or scientist working in the field, this book should be on your shelf."},{"Title":"Motor Control and Learning: A Behavioral Emphasis","review":"I first had to buy this textbook for an undergraduate course in Motor Control, but I have gone back to it many times in my graduate career.

So it was with Einstien and theoretical physics, and so it is with economics and Thorstein Veblen as described in this book. Mr. Veblen descended from Norwegian immigrants to the US, and lived in the Midwest from the late 1800s to early 1900s. With a keen eye and insightful mind, he took in the huge economic growth of the US and the beginnings of mass consumerism and corporate advertising in the American population. What he saw was the formation of a middle and upper class that had both idle time and money to spare. Together, this created a leisure class that defined respect, social standing, and self-worth in terms of \\"pecuniary emulation\\", i.e. spending money on stuff and entertainment just because one could. Like a zoologist examining wild animals, Veblen picks apart the rituals, clothing, speech, and consumption habits of this newly rich. All of this is recorded and explained in extraordinary and sometimes comical detail in this book. Upon publication, this book became the first great work of economics by an American author, and made Veblen famous. Along with the Great Gatsby, this book provides one of the best description of the American upper class at the beginning of the 20th century."},{"Title":"The theory of the leisure class;: An economic study of institutions,","review":"Excellent.

This product received is exactly as pictured. I am pleased. Will order again from these nice people."},{"Title":"The theory of the leisure class;: An economic study of institutions,","review":"I have no idea whatsoever of how true Veblen's analysis of American social reality was one - hundred years ago, or how true it is today. No doubt he did see ' social phenomenom' that were emerging and succeeded in finding the 'name ' for them. 'Leisure class' and ' conspicuous consumption' are part of the everyday vocabulary of the description and analysis of 'social life'. I know that Veblen was particularly hard upon the nouveau riche, those trying to prove by buying and having more that they were as good or better than ' old money'. However I wonder if in ' work ethic' America there is not also another kind of phenomenom, of people of great wealth feeling a special social obligation, as multibillionaires Gates and whether for good purposes or not, Ted Turner have displayed in recent years. I also have a problem with making the concept of ' leisure' an entirely pejorative one. What about those ' surpluses' at the state of the agricultural age which Lewis Mumford said were so key in creating civilization? Isn't it true that in many societies those who do not have to do productive work were freed for higher work of mind and spirit? I wonder then that is whether Veblen's condemnation of the 'leisure class ' is too ' blanket' a one in many ways. And this without denying the truths that great wealth often corrupts, leads to arrogance, and indolence, folly and waste. For years the conception of the US was of a society in which the middle class element was predominant, a society reflecting an equality of opportunity and the fact that the majority of people had been able to in time and through work raise themselves to a good level of life. The decline of the middle class in the sense of the growing gap between very rich and very poor is a fact of life in America. Perhaps this makes Veblen's analysis of a certain part of American society more pertinent. But again I think that there is a counter- tradition emerging in which many of the very wealthy assume that the way to real respect in the eyes of the public is in doing good for others."},{"Title":"The theory of the leisure class;: An economic study of institutions,","review":"Conspicuous consumption describes the phenomenon of buying a product or service not for its utility or necessity but because of its prestige factor or impressive social value. Mr. Veblen's book is described as a satire, pointing out the hypocrisy and shallowness of the leisure or wealthy class. I am only partly through this book but I am finding it very thought provoking.If Mr. Veblen thought that consumption had a negative conspicuousness, indicative of a hypocritical nature among the wealthy of his day, I can only imagine what he would think of our entire culture today. It seems to me in our present society we have taken conspicuous consumption, beyond the hypocritical and the satirical and into the realm of the obnoxious, the immoral and even the criminal. This really isn't an economics book, nor would I say that it is scientific or academic in nature.It is more the thoughtful extrapolation of an intelligent, thoughtful and educated individual. Thorstein Veblen is more academic than Mark Twain and not quite as humorous. But he is very entertaining and extremely thought provoking. His style is much like Galbraith's - wordy, circular and humor so subtle that if you are not paying attention you could easily miss it. I am enjoying this book.Richard Edward Noble - The Hobo Philosopher - Author of:\\"Hobo-ing America: A Workingman's Tour of the U.S.A..\\""},{"Title":"The theory of the leisure class;: An economic study of institutions,","review":"I have found it quite amusing to read Veblen's book is depicted as a classic by those who like it (you know, considering that he, more than once, states that the appeal of classics is due largely to the leisure class scheme). Perhaps the unique, brilliant, at times repetitive and dull, at times invariably amusing, and always surprising tone and ideas Veblen has made their indelible mark, but I think that perhaps he would have said that those who admire his book solely as a classic cannot properly understand its message.From his anthropological analysis of the rise of the predatory and peaceable instincts to his ridicule of contemporary (ca. 1900) institutions and customs (I think his theories on clothing apparel, sports, and religion stand out) to his very serious critique of waste and exploit, Veblen wrote an incredibly interesting, unconventional theory. Undoubtedly, to my apprehension, direct and vicarious conspicuous waste (the most famous variant being direct conspicuous consumption) is the most interesting concept presented in the book, yet this is exclusively associated with the rich and what they do. No doubt, the rich's excesses must have been what prompted Veblen to write the book in the first place, but I think the more universal message is overlooked. He repeats this over and over: the leisure class scheme of life pervades society.I do not know if those who appreciate the book see that Veblen makes the case that conspicuous waste is EVERYWHERE. Those who command the scheme are those who we might identify to be the rich, sure, but how can we deny we are not all part of it? Veblen says that \\"any consumer who might, Diogenes-like, insist on the elimination of all honorific or wasteful elements from his consumption, would be unable to supply his most trivial wants in the modern market.\\" To him, I am sure, stripes on a shirt would have seemed wasteful, and a regrettable vestige of some eccentric attempt at invidious pecuniary emulation. Veblen's notion of waste is constructed to be universal, but in varying gradations (which is why he identifies waste most prominently with the leisure class).All this being said, Veblen is quite far from being perfect. The book does consider that there are motives and actions that are not guided by the leisure class' predatory instinct, but is at times vague in dealing with such things. Moreover, some of his explanations are on occasion convoluted or simplified so as to make them fit his general framework. Notwithstanding, anyone who has any interest in reading a great theory about how the rich ultimately dictate many of society's customs and institutions by inciting the lesser instincts that make consumerism possible, or in being amused by a sardonic critique of how wasteful our society can be, should turn to this book.A word of caution: To make a point, Veblen uses a language that would be today considered tedious and cumbersome, perhaps needless and excessively verbose at times, so be ready to deal with that. (I think that, unless pointed out, the fact that it is inferable that Veblen does this to make a point might go unnoticed. At the end of the book he states that usage of proper, preferably archaic language is observed precisely because it is useful and not up to date; this language is preferred because they \\"argue waste of time and exemption from the use and the need of direct and forcible speech.\\" The way in which he writes his book is the last, perhaps most subtle, sardonic bit of satire he offers us.)"},{"Title":"The theory of the leisure class;: An economic study of institutions,","review":"Some of the most influential and important studies of America and American life have been authored by visitors from other lands. One such example is this political study of economic man, The Theory of the Leisure Class. Authored by Thorstein Veblen, an immigrant from Scandinavia who settled in the Eastern US, this book examines the behavior of the rich and wanna-be rich in the US at the end of the 19th century.Defining the growing upper class of Americans who owned land, dressed nicely, showered daily and read the latest gossip as the \\"leisure class\\", Veblen proceeds to dissect their behaviors and actions and its causes and effects. The author shows how much of this behavior had no practical economic benefit, but instead served to advertise social success instead. As such, this is one of the first major works to apply Darwinian thought to social evolution and human behavior. Terms such as conspicious consumption and consumerism would spring forth from this book and those that followed in its wake.The book itself is quite easy to read for an economics treatise. Few are the numbers, fewer are the equations. Instead the reader gets wit, sarcasm, and lots of dry humor as the author recounts episodes of rich people acting dumb in the name of showing of their wealth status. The book is good reading, and recommended for those studying history, economics, sociology, or any other social science."},{"Title":"The theory of the leisure class;: An economic study of institutions,","review":"This is a great classic book even if the writing style is a bit dense. This is a must read for anyone who wants to really understand why the 2008 banking meltdown happened. The book was written over 100 years ago and everything he talks about has just happened again. This book will give you the psychological and sociological understanding of why the wealthy act as they do and why the rest of the population suffers from their excesses over and over again. It will also give you good reasons for knowing why their intense desire to control all the resources must be actively managed if the middle class is to survive in any way shape or form in this country."},{"Title":"The theory of the leisure class;: An economic study of institutions,","review":"Just read this after years of thinking I knew what it was, based on college professors years ago telling me what they thought Veblen was about. Turns out the guy was from Wisconsin, not Sweden, and that he was a master satirist, not an economist or sociologist, and that he died in 1929 at the ripe old age of 72. He gets a special award for using the word &quot;honorific&quot; over and over, and another commendation for making breathtakingly sweeping generalizations about human history and social development, and about contemporary (circa early 1900s) industrial relationships with ZERO (!) reference to data, and a dismissal of any need for any empirical verification of his conclusions. The conclusions themselves loop around themselves like a biplane seriously out of control, and in the end this mainly entertains. And in the propwash, we get new terms that have joined the English language: Conspicuous consumption, conspicuous waste, canons of respectability, and even skiing terms like &quot;traverse&quot; which could also, in our &quot;post-predatory&quot; culture, be a legal term from common law pleading. I think Veblen was mainly having fun here, and am surprised that my professors of yore saw this as a serious critique of capitalism. I thought they were smarter than that."},{"Title":"The theory of the leisure class;: An economic study of institutions,","review":"I'd been to led to expect this book was an account of rather silly snobberies by the rich. And that it was exquisite in scholarship, writing style, and detail. Wrong.Thorstein Veblen - 1857-1929 - and I only checked these details after reading this book - was one of many children of Norwegian immigrants into the USA. They were, or may have been, ripped off, though his father seems to have made money afterwards - I'd guess via a gift of land from the US governement, though if so he seems to have been ungrateful. 'The Theory of the Leisure Class', published in 1899 when he was about 42, caused a stir - or at least that's the story. It precedes Ida Tarbell on Standard Oil by a couple of years.Veblen's writing style is agonisingly plodding, repetitive and dull. He includes a few Latin and other tags. This must have been a deliberate attempt to project an educated image. He took time to explain his use of some English terms (e.g. 'invidious'). Part of his effect is achieved by using words in slightly the wrong sense. He used 'evolution' rather than 'change' - it sounded more up to date. His typescript (or MS) must have been the sort publishers' readers dreaded. I can't quote a sample here for space reasons.----His model of human history is very simple indeed. There *WERE* two types of people and societies:[1] The sedentary village, low on force and fraud. He calls this 'quasi-peaceful'. There's a law of status. (pp 215 & 236). 'Savages' (undefined) have this sort of lifestyle.[2] Barbarians, who hate manual work, and prefer 'exploits'. They are ferocious, self-seeking, clannish, disingenuous. They like hunting. A predatory type. Veblen often calls them 'peace-distubing dolicho-blonds'. (He himself had very dark hair - remember Norway and Sweden separated at about this time.)---------However, *NOW* (about 1900) there is industry.[3] Veblen takes progress as given: 'as populations grow denser..', '.. stage of society..', '.. as the community advances in wealth and culture', are typical phrases. These days, the collective interests of modern industry work against the ferocious or selfish aristocrat type (p 227).4] There is a 'hierarchical gradation of reputability. Ownership on a large scale [is]... the most reputable of economic interests. [then] banking .. law.. the lawyer is exclusively occupied with the details of predatory fraud..' (p.231).-----------Veblen means by the 'Leisure Class' property and company owners, financiers, bankers, lawyers. In other words, anyone not concerned with direct manufacturing. Much of his book is concerned with the way they spend or waste money, and the way other people attempt to follow or imitate their behaviour.What is of value in Veblen?I have to say I was struck by the small number of piquant examples of oddities in spending and consumption; I'd expected more. Dogs as useless deferential mouths to feed; clean clothes uncontaimnated by evidence of work; William Morris's Kelmscott Press. Of men - walking stick, and powdered wig (from Alexander Pope?) On women, bodices, bound feet in China, and general feebleness, were signs of wealth in the husband. He has an odd passage about public parks - men keep the grass tidy, and this is an example of conspicuous consumption, because they are more expensive than cows.He doesn't seem to know about Chinese mandarins' fingernails, British sumptuary laws, rose gardens and knot gardens and huge country houses as statements of things which are attractive, but unnecessary. He doesn't know about follies, or for example the Hell Fire Club and the Parthenon, both of which in their ways offered employment. Moreover he doesn't seem to understand the economics: a US department store would not stock very cheap items - there's not enough money in them and will reduce other sales. They will cater preferentially for richer custiomers - and offer, say, sherry, wine, champagne, brandy and other glasses, just to make more money. Veblen's examples are a mostly natural outcome of normal economics. As further evidence, consider that, if Veblen was right, any conspicuous waste might happen: burning of notes, buying of things just to destroy them.As to the 'leisure class', Veblen, surprisingly, barely considers inherited wealth. New England had many sons and daughters waiting to inherit and the 'leisure class' would seem to fit them perfectly. But Veblen concentrates on other targets. Like Marx, he assumes factory owners just sit back and collect loot - he doesn't seem to realise such people *may* work extremely hard. Similarly, many younger sons of British wealthy families went off to die in various white man's grave parts of the world. For that matter, the 'wolfish earls' in 'Shakespeare' weren't exactly leisurely.Veblen comes across as a man who moved directly from a peasant society into a much more technologically advanced one. (This must be common now, with uncontrolled mass third world immigration into some modern societies.) It's not surprising such people gawp, and feel fear, and boost their egos with cautious contempt. But I don't think ultimately this book delivers very much."},{"Title":"The theory of the leisure class;: An economic study of institutions,","review":"Sad to say, the Dover durables of midcentury and beyond are gone (if not forgotten); but when this value-price line was introduced in the mid-'90s, this book in particular was very welcome. Herein (though not exclusively) we find Veblen supplying an alternative to Nietzsche, specifically *Beyond Good and Evil*. This is a book about morals, or the lack of them; but coming from a man who all-but-assaulted his estranged wife with &quot;notions&quot; one ought not to expect a rousing defense of bourgeois morality. Rather an unstinting defense of some other way of life (such as is provided in his impossibly rare *Instinct of Workmanship*) what we have here is a Grand-Guignol treatment of the &quot;life-lie&quot; Veblen calls conspicuous consumption, which just might happen to exclude Symbolist &quot;vitalism&quot; (and as to the provenance of the concept &quot;dolicho-blond&quot;, consult Veblen's essay on the American small town).

On the contrary, &quot;The Theory of the Leisure Class&quot; is stylishly written, endlessly startling (for example, Veblen analyses religion as an outgrowth of the gambling instinct), and very, very funny. Its expose of &quot;conspicuous consumption&quot; (yes, Veblen was the one who invented this famous concept) is as relevant today as it was in 1899, if not more so. Whether or not you agree with all that he says, it's thought-provoking and exciting stuff."},{"Title":"The theory of the leisure class;: An economic study of institutions,","review":"This opus by Veblen exposes the real meaning of the pecuniary advancement of the working and merchant classes, and the formation of elites based mostly upon money and asset valuation. The transfiguration of the traditional social and individual ethical values that this phenomenon produced, is portraited with clarity and sarcastic intelligence by the author in the book, first published in 1899.Now a classic of economic theory, as well as a text book of social science, it describes the tendencies of consumerism, leisure and the &quot;materialization&quot; of the ideals of the aspiring new princes (or noveau rich) of society. Veblen's vibrant satire of the tendency of the modern individual to believe that real accomplishment is all about aquiring a condition of ostentatious wealth and status, and his analisis of the inception of modern class structure in America, still stand, a century after, as recommended reading for historians and economists.If you are a fervent follower of advertisement, fashion, &quot;glamour&quot; and other modern expressions of consumerism , then you will find a surprisingly fresh portrait of yourself in this book. It worries me that the leisure class and its shallow views and values as described by Veblen, may still today represent elites in America and their religion, as analyzed by professor Lash in his last book &quot;The Revolt of the Elites&quot;. I highly recommend Veblen's best book, to scholars and sociologists at large."},{"Title":"The theory of the leisure class;: An economic study of institutions,","review":"Known by his contemporaries as the only social theorist to apply Darwin critically, in 1899 Thorstein Veblen published The Theory of the Leisure Class: A Economic Study of Institutions, which was to become the basis from which all further American leisure history and theory stemmed. In his study, Veblen is primarily concerned with the &quot;new rich,&quot; whom he regards as social parasites that retard the growth of modern life. Thorstein Veblen wrote The Theory of the Leisure Class from a perspective that was largely isolated from his own culture, which either aided in his understanding of the Leisure Class or perhaps negatively influenced his opinions due to his exclusion from it. In The Theory of the Leisure Class, Veblen essentially confines man and woman's existence on the planet as a struggle to change and adapt with the growth of their communities. Through this belief, Veblen develops a theme that amounts to the idea of a certain &quot;dominant&quot; type of individual. This individual develops a social structure through dominance in which social advance is sought by others. She/he will feel the discrepancy between the modern life and traditional life during the process. Though Veblen's rhetoric is sometimes anxious, sometimes negative, he actively pursues a specific account of the origins of the Leisure Class through individuals. The struggle for individual advancement eventually expands to include society, and the more individual struggle for advancement in society leads to the accumulation of surplus goods.Surplus of conspicuous consumption by the Leisure Class gives the class license to indulge shamefully in pure conspicuous consumption, where their occupations eventually become leisure itself. These &quot;professions&quot; of the Leisure Class by nature render it closed, and impenetrable by outsiders.Thorstein Veblen wrote the Leisure Class represented the new phenomena of conspicuous consumption compared to pre-Industrialized wealthy communities as well as contemporary working-class ones. But as intellectual inquiry into the topic of leisure has progressed over the past one hundred years, leisure has come to hold a number of definitions and meanings."},{"Title":"The theory of the leisure class;: An economic study of institutions,","review":"The basic premise of this book is that modern humans have inherited an instinct to compete with each other for material resources. This competition takes place within the context of a small groups that share the spoils of the competition amongst themselves. (Other primates essentially do the same thing). The theory hinges on the question of what happens when a group of people have access to essentially unlimited resources, but still have the competitive urge. Veblen's answer is that they simply compete amongst themselves to see who can afford to be the most wasteful (like the scene in that Woody Allen movie in which two guys start ripping up dollar bills to impress each other). He refers to such waste as \\"conspicuous consumption\\".According to Veblen, the urge to consume conspicuously explains a lot of human behavior, including fashion, sports, and religion. In all cases the consumer wants to demonstrate to his peers that he can't possibly be involved in doing anything useful. A particularly funny consequence of the urge to consume is the notion of \\"vicarious consumption,\\" in which really rich people acquire other people (essentially servants and wives) to do their consuming for them. To emphasize the point they dress up their vicarious consumers in preposterous outfits and require them to perform pointless tasks with high precision (think of a butler in a tuxedo serving a 12-course meal or some such).In this vein, anthropomorphic religions essentially worship the richest guy of all. God is imagined to be so rich that he sits on a throne all day while people in silly clothes (clergy) do nothing but tend to his fabulous mansions (churches). It's an intentionally funny image, although Veblen is careful to say that he's not poking fun at the spiritual aspects of religion, just the form in which modern humans choose to express them.An interesting subtheme is the alliance between the \\"leisure class\\" and the poor, something we see happening today in American politics. In Veblen's theory the alliance occurs because the two classes essentially share the same mindset (obsession with status).Overall the book is fun to read, except for the writing style, which is reminiscent of essays written by high school students who are studying for the SATs."},{"Title":"The theory of the leisure class;: An economic study of institutions,","review":"This may not be a book to read for recreation, unless you like 1890s verbal locutions, but there are other reasons to read it. The emergence of the economic analysis of Western society might intrigue you. You might discover the origins of such still useful terms as 'leisure class' and 'conspicuous consumption,' among others. You might be curious about author Thorstein Veblen's status-conscious, anachronistic world of working men and idle wives, which reflects upper-class society in his day. Published in 1899, this is a classic in sociology and economic literature, although it is a veritable dreadnought of density. It discusses property, ownership, status and leisure in a turn-of-the-last-century American context. Though scholars call it a 'satire,' the book is neither witty nor ironic. Instead, it is a stolid analytical daguerreotype of a world long gone. We suggest that if you tackle Veblen's old-fashioned, slow-flowing prose, you should do it for the background you may glean and the scholarly satisfaction you may feel when you are done. Instead of Alexander Pope's, 'What oft was thought but ne'er so well expressed,' this book presents what oft was said and usually better, but not as early."},{"Title":"The theory of the leisure class;: An economic study of institutions,","review":"This is one of the most thought provoking books I have read in a long time.

Even though Veblen attempts to press the application of his thesis a bit too far, the thesis istself still has merit for the 21st century. His thesis, although not stated as such is biblically rooted in Ecclesiastes 4:4, \\"And I saw that all labor and all achievement springs from man's envy of his neighbor.\\" Interesting perspective on society... worth the read!"},{"Title":"The theory of the leisure class;: An economic study of institutions,","review":"Mr. Veblen is a refined person in the use of the words he uses to address and explain the economic habits of the refined people of the upper-class of the beginning of the last century. He spares no expenses in detailing in a very polite manner the idiossincracies of the noble and very rich when deciding what to buy, what to use and how to behave, going also to all lenghts explainning how these habits mold and form the habits of the not so rich and noble strata of the society. His theory of the leisure class reachs significance when compared to the rationality which some economists, classics and neo-classics, ascribe to the human being as an economic agent. I was quite surprised by the elegant style of Mr.Veblen and the fine irony (which he does not admit) with which he treats the rich and noble of his time. Sure, this is a book which could be also serve well times ahead and before Veblen's time."},{"Title":"The theory of the leisure class;: An economic study of institutions,","review":"I was extremely pleased with this book. It reduces the notion of society to a popularity contest in which fashion becomes the perfect expression of everyone's desire to be praised and noticed. As the American economy shifts from being a breadbasket to being the entertainment capital of a devil in blue jeans world, this book, from a much earlier historical period, shows how America always had the potential to achieve this kind of greatness. More than any other book, this one allows total enjoyment of the thoughts which it expresses.

The author also didn't shy away from the necessary mathematics by providing the needed materials for all the derivations. The most outstanding feature of the book, however, would be the consistency and continuity in the materials covered, the explanations provided, the mathematics employed, and the simbols used.

There are the standard dangers, problems, terrors and tragedies. This is saved from being trite by the stoic and undaunted character of the woman. Gloss also avoids the usual romantic happily-ever-after with the man next door.Gloss has used journals and diaries of women in the West in hopes to draw out some of the nontraditional women's roles in the West, \\"I hope their strong, honest voices can be heard in this book.\\" Showing that gender roles weren't fixed as many choose to believe, we see Lydia doing hard, manual labor, and Tim cooking and doing the wash. Lydia, the heroine of the book, abandons typical women's roles in the very beginning when she picks up and moves West alone to start a new life. \\"I'd rather have my own house, sorry as it is, than the wedding ring of a man who couldn't be roused from sleeping when his own child was slipping out of me unborn.\\"Gloss attempts to break down the Western stereotypes for men. Tim and Blue are like real men we could meet if we were on the frontier, not larger than life heroes that commonly dominate Western myths. Unlike heroes admired for their independence, Tim and Blue are dependant on others and each other on the frontier . They become almost like children in their dependence on others, \\"He turned and looked at her, ducking his chin.\\" Things don't come easily for them and they struggle like any human being would have, \\"Tim put the gun down in the mud and went, shaking, across the bloody wallow on his knees.\\" Even being a cowboy is rejected in this book, \\"He said he'd seen years when a good cowboy couldn't by himself a job, but a good cook could pretty much always find work.\\"Besides narrations from characters, Gloss utilizes Lydia's journal entries to make the story more real, personal, and familiar. This helps us recognize and remember Lydia's real identity, while the central narration builds the events of her daily life in a flowing form. Dreams of easy success are shot down in The Jump Off Creek. Giving a truer picture of the West, The Jump Off Creek is not a romanticized myth of adventure and easy success. Gloss establishes a view that shows the desperation of lives in a West where there is nothing new and glorious to see and experience every day. We see the miserable and wretched hard lives that one might have encountered. Fantasies of ease and comfort in the West are gone in this novel. It isn't a fairy tale like the traditional Western, where the good guy always wins, and the hero can handle any problem successfully. This book doesn't contain a lot of action, but instead it brings out the monotonous daily life of establishing a new home in the West and centers on the domestic side of the West. Gloss tells us of the every day grind and challenges of lives where sometimes people fail and hours of hard work are only the beginning of more hours of hard work."},{"Title":"The Jump-Off Creek","review":"The Jump Off Creek: A Book Review The nineteen nineties feminist movement has been slowly permeating every domain of society. Female empowerment has become an increasingly common protagonist theme among all genres of literature as well. The American western novel has become subjugated to a new hero. In Molly Gloss's novel The Jump Off Creek the feminist literature movement finds a graceful home.Jump Off Creek tells the story of Lydia Sanderson, a widow taking up a claim in the Blue Mountains of Oregon. The text begins with a spring journal entry. This is the beginning of Ms. Sanderson's endeavor. The journal entries are continued throughout the story, not only to keep the reader aware of the time line of the story, but also to provide a unique first person account of Lydia's life story. Lydia says of herself, &quot;I am used to being Alone, in spirit if not in body, and shall not be Lonely, as I never have been inclined that way. I believe what I feel is just a keenness to get to that place and stand under my own roof at last.&quot; Lydia's strong and independent character is a careful mix of gracefulness and ruggedness. Her resourcefulness and amazing endurance makes the Ingalls family look pass&eacute;.Yet the feminist tones of this book manage to make concessions and include some strong male characters to compliment Lydia. On her way to the homestead Lydia meets Tim Whiteaker. Tim is a John Wayne figure minus the capacity for conversation. Early in the text the model for Tim's behavior is clearly etched. One passage describes him as such: &quot; He stood at the edge of the creek, not looking toward (Lydia), while he pushed his hair back up under his hat with the heel of one dirty hand. Then he gave the dog a word, took hold of the bay's reigns and started off afoot...&quot; Gloss managed to soften this granite figure by making him an excellent cook. Tim even ends up taking up cooking at a nearby ranches when funds are running out. But while his bread baking and cattle branding may be time consuming, Mr. Whiteaker still manages to take time out to pay special visits to Ms Sanderson. It is through these visits that a fragile and special friendship blossoms just as Lydia's wildflowers.Tim also serves as an avenue for another friendship to develop for Lydia. This being with Blue Odell. Blue triumphantly beats the so-called Indian side-kick role in this novel. He develops more three dimensionally than Tim. This is in part due to the relationship he has with Lydia. While these two characters have more dialogue, it is their physical interaction that speaks the true message.Of course the standard Western elements are retained in this novel, even though the main characters have been assigned the opposite sex's code of conduct. Man still has to fight nature; the weather and a bear. The conflict of man vs. man is also important. In this case there is only one drunken fight, but the altercations between some unscrupulous wolf hunters and Lydia's male friends nourish the western need for violence.Another important characteristic of a Western novel is the main character's quest for identity. Molly Gloss obviously wrote in the previous characters to aide in this task. But it often takes a character of the same sex on the opposite end of the personality spectrum to clearly define that identity. The definition comes via the means of Evelyn Walker. She is a young, rotund, bubbly, mother of three. Gloss's careful attention to these two women allow Evelyn's brightly smiling face to enhance Lydia's stern beauty, not diminish it any.Lydia's character is also enhanced in the story through a series of social gatherings at the Walker's. The reader admires her quiet, near invertedness among the chatty and whimsical fourth of July celebration. This process of the reader identifying with Lydia is a slow process throughout the story. In fact, the nature of the text never moves the reader to feel very strongly about any of the characters, because indeed, Lydia never demonstrates any strong emotions. Perhaps the only persons the reader may ever develop active feelings towards are Lydia's late husband and her parents, who aren't even active in the story!The simple link that the reader develops with Lydia, and which Lydia in turn shares with the characters, is reflective of the style of prose in which this novel was written. The plain language is honest and appealing. The matter-of-fact narrative is believable. Simply put, the journey the reader embarks on with Ms Sanderson develops into a wonderful meditative exploration of self. I thoroughly enjoyed my journey and strongly suggest that other readers pack their bags for the trip."},{"Title":"The Jump-Off Creek","review":"Molly Gloss' The Jump-Off Creek is a story about a woman's independence in Western society. It follows the lives of the three main characters; Lydia Sanderson, Tim Whiteaker, and Tim's Indian friend, Blue. Throughout the book, Gloss tells her story by using the different perspectives of her characters. These changes in points of view allow the reader to understand the main characters personalities and to watch them develop. Gloss uses the harshness of the West and its winters to strengthen her characters, and she tries to show her reader that life in the West was not as easy as it normally appears to be in typical western stories. The Jump-Off Creek demonstrates life through hardships and trials. But, through them all, the main characters are able to persevere and are made stronger. It is my opinion that her portrayal of the West was well done and will challenge the reader to think differently about how he or she conceives the West. Gloss' book is a western which shows the reader how a woman saw the West. No longer is the western only about cowboys and Indians. Now, the reader is allowed to see how a woman, and an independent one at that, perceived the West and the trials that she had to go through just in order to survive the first winter. Lydia Sanderson's husband had recently died and had left their farm land to her. With a restless soul and the need for transformation, Lydia is driven West to find a new life. However, Lydia does not go West to find a new husband. She does not need any help from a man, and is rather reluctant to accept any help from the opposite sex. She intends to make it on her own, and throughout the book, she does maintain her independence. She does not conform to the lifestyle of the other women in the West. Gloss uses to reflect women's position in today's society. Gloss intends to prove that a woman and survive without a man. And, what better way to prove this for the young women of today than through a story of the harsh West? Gloss keeps the theme of her abnormal depiction of the West in her portrayal of Tim Whiteaker. Mr. Whiteaker was not a typical cowboy. In fact, none of the men in this story are. The men in this book depend on each other a lot more than the men are allowed to in other westerns. Tim and Blue rely on each other so much that, in the end when Blue dies, Tim becomes so lonely that he begins to rely on Lydia's company. These men are also quite squeamish when it comes to blood and injuries. For example, after Blue is injured during a fight with a bear, Tim calls Lydia to stitch up Blue as he cannot stomach the thought of doing it himself. Tim even feels the need to step outside while she is working. Tim shows that he is not a typical cowboy in many other ways. He is a cook, and he even gets a job cooking at a ranch during part of the story. He never finishes a fight, at one time he falls off of his horse, and many times the reader sees that Tim has bad aim while shooting a gun. None of these are characteristics of a cowboy, and may make one wonder how he has been able to survive the harshness of the West. In her journal entries, Lydia constantly refers to Tim in childlike terms, as she often does while she speaks to him. Throughout The Jump-Off Creek, the weather plays a big part in the characters' lives. Especially during the winters, the reader is able to see how hard a settler had to work in able to get through an ice storm. A settler did not only have himself to worry about, but any animals that he might have, as they could not care for themselves during this weather. If the animals were to die, the settler would have a hard year to look forward to as his livelihood would be gone. The toughness of the land, and the weather that came with it, eventually drew the characters closer as they tried to band together in order to survive. I feel that Gloss's portrayal of the sexes in her book are quite beneficial to young women in today's society. So many times, in literature and other areas of life, women are called upon to take the &quot;back seat,&quot; or a supporting role. In The Jump Off Creek, Gloss shows that this secondary role is not necessary. She shows her female readers that they should feel free to take the reigns and strike out on their own adventures. No longer must a woman need a man. Also, Gloss shows her male readers that it is &quot;O.K.&quot; to ask for help. They need not &quot;do it alone&quot; as so many men feel they need to do in today's society. I enjoyed this book, and I believe that while it may challenge a person's traditional view of the West, it does so thoughtfully. Now, the reader is allowed to make their own decisions about &quot;how the West was won,&quot; and to consider the role of the female. Could the West have survived without the woman? Gloss does not think that it would have. And, she challenges her reader to think the same."},{"Title":"The Jump-Off Creek","review":"An incredibly poignant novel that reads and feels as sharp and clear as a freezing cold running stream.The author writes crisply, economically and precisely to reflect the times and circumstances of the lifestyle of Lydia Sanderson. Lydia is widowed and decides to purchase what remains of a forsaken homestead in the Blue Mountains. The challenges that she must face up to are great, being a woman, even greater, still. The work she must do is brutal, the weather a force to break men's souls, the physical labor more demanding than anything she knows. Yet she accepts this completely.In brilliant detail the author portrays how this woman lived alone and prospered. It is a fascinating accounting of her lifestyle; the items she has in her possession, what she eats and how she transports herself and her animals. All of this is told conservatively as her journal recounts the challenges that unfold before her.In contrast to her personal life, the reader is introduced to the folk that live nearest to her. These are strong and beautiful characters, tough and tender, strong and bending. In very difficult times, they came together and helped each other. Their spirit is reflected through the accounting of Lydia's story."},{"Title":"The Jump-Off Creek","review":"The novel Jump-Off Creek, written by author Molly Gloss, is a different kind of western set in Oregon. I really enjoyed this novel but I did not believe it should be classified as a western. Molly Gloss writes a novel in Jump-Off Creek that in many ways in not a western and breaks many norms of the average western. There are a couple reasons why this novel does not really fit the stereo-typical definition of a western at all. The first reason is that it is set in the Blue Mountains of Oregon, which is not the traditional setting for the average western. Most westerns have settings in California or down in Texas where there is nothing but wide open desert with little towns in between. The second reason, one that I enjoyed, is the strong woman in the lead role of this novel. This novel has a female center rather than a male center or theme. The idea of a strong woman presence in the typical western is not usually found. It was something I found interesting in the novel and again enjoyed. This woman, unlike many found in a typical western, is committed to her life of independence. Also, along with the strong woman as one of the lead characters, there was a Native American as the hero of the novel. It you look at most average westerns, either in books or films, you will not find many minority heroes running around. This was a different look at the average western and again one I would like to see more from today's writers. As far as characters go, I felt the author really did not spend to much time developing and making them interesting. I felt the characters in many ways were one-dimensional, and as a reader I did not have a lot of emotion for them or I just did not care about many of the character. The only character I felt any emotion for was the Native American character named Blue. The first reason I found him interesting was because he has a very different name that grabbed my attention toward his character over the others. This can be the key the author needed to get the reader into the novel and start caring. The second reason I found Blue to be interesting was the fact that he was one of the most caring characters in the story and I felt he had a heart. Blue showed emotion though out the novel and was easily the most interesting. He can be described as a rounded character because he is a person with many dimensions while many of the other character are only one-dimensional. In most westerns the fight scenes is one of the reason there is such a huge following and why they are so liked by many. The fight scene is there to show the masculinity of the western. For example, in Hondo the last fight scene is what the reader remembers best and judges the whole novel on. Without the last fight scene many novels are forgotten. The fight scenes are very weak in Jump-Off Creek, which again is not the style of the average western. Lack of action and the boring pace of everyday life furthers this novel from being a western. The masculinity of this novel is never shown through the fight scene and a more femininity is shown with a female as the center character. Something I did really like about this novel which again was a little different from many of the westerns I have seen was the journal throughout the story. About every twenty pages or more there is a short chapter that contains thoughts of the main character about anything. I enjoyed this aspect of the novel and felt it gave originality and creativity. It also stopped the boring pace of the novel and gave the reader something to think about. Overall, I feel this novel is not a western but more of a country tale set in Oregon. It feels more like a country novel because there are no big deserts or little one-stop towns. With the slow pace and weak fight scenes the novel does not set the feeling of a western. Also, with the presences of a strong woman and an Native American hero, many stereo type of westerns are being broken. Although, I really enjoyed the strong woman and Native American as character and overall liked this novel, I still feel this cannot be described as a western."},{"Title":"The Jump-Off Creek","review":"Finally, a Western that does not sugar-coat frontier life or turn it into a non-stop/action-packed gun fight! This novel is a refreshing, well researched, trip back to the frontier days of the Pacific Northwest. Gloss presents us with characters that feel very real and very ordinary, but somehow adds a rare grace to their lives. The flow of her writing is delightful (as always) and I found myself very disappointed to reach the end of this novel--I didn't want to stop reading!I should add, though, that this is not a novel for those who require books to be jam-packed with action--you will not find much adrenalin in this story! On the other hand, if you are looking for a really good historical fiction read, this is a great book for a rainy afternoon."},{"Title":"The Jump-Off Creek","review":"I probably shouldn't be reading Molly Gloss. I'm a guy, after all. But maybe, at 64, some of the nastiness of being a guy has finally worn off. Because I love the way this woman writes. The Hearts of Horses hooked me, Wild Life wowed me, and now, this earlier absolute gem of a novel just blew me away. How does she do this thing where the essence of the story lies in what is not said? Lydia Sanderson, Tim Whiteaker, Blue Odell. None of them say very much of any real significance. All are stoic and uncomplaining of the \\"narrow circumstances\\" life has dealt them. In fact they are nearly inarticulate; yet all these feelings - of yearning and loneliness, of sorrow and regret, they are all somehow laid bare in the pauses. The descriptions, the gestures, the sidelong glances, the facial expressions - all become muted dialogue. Even the one character who seems unabashedly bad, the angry bigoted boy that is Harley Osgood, has an element of humanity in him that doesn't quite let you hate him. There are no simple black-and-white characters in Gloss's fiction. There are, instead, infinite shades of gray, and an attention to descriptive detail that makes you understand implicitly much of what is left unsaid. The years-long friendship between the two cowboys Whiteaker and Odell is perhaps one of the best portrayals of love between men that fiction has to offer. And I'm not talking about any \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" kinda stuff here either. These are just two men who have stuck together through thick and thin, mostly the latter, and a bond has formed that is stronger than most marriages. Enough said. This is simply a superb story. There oughta be a ten-star rating for books of this caliber. And by the way, what a wonderful film for thinking adults this could be. Thanks again, Molly. I'll be watching for the next book, so please, Write on! - Tim Bazzett, author of ReedCityBoy"},{"Title":"The Jump-Off Creek","review":"This story felt like I was living there...feeling, tasting, sweating, right along with the characters. I would have sworn Gloss was taking this word for word from the woman's diary. Being thrilled by such everyday struggles like getting a mule down the hill..now thats what I call virtual reality. I was so enthralled by the &quot;cowboys&quot;...kept thinking I never would have dreamed I'de love a book like this so much...but it was so true and delicious. Thanks for taking me to Oregon in the 1890's. It was a thrilling, amazing adventure. The struggle's the pioneers endured were incredible...so much more so for a woman, and a woman alone at that!"},{"Title":"The Jump-Off Creek","review":"The Jump-Off Creek The American West: a place of fun and excitement, action and adve nture. These stereotypes often come to mind when thinking about the West. However, do these terms ideally describe the real American West? In her novel, The Jump-Off Creek, Molly Gloss offers an opposing perspective of the Western frontier. Instead of focusing on the excitement of the West, she shows the struggles and hardships that may give a more realistic picture of the frontier. The Jump-Off Creek gives the reader a well-rounded portrayal of the West. Contrary to most Western novels, The Jump-Off Creek allows the reader to see the West through the eyes of a woman. Lydia Sanderson travels to the West alone where she makes her homestead. Lydia is not a glamorous woman but a woman of the land. Her life is not simple. It is a daily struggle for her to survive on her own. Unlike most Western novels the hero in the book is not a male. In fact, Lydia is definitely the heroine in The Jump-Off Creek. She represents the strength most women wish they could achieve but are afraid of being alone. Lydia ignores fears of being without a man and follows her dream of traveling West. Her courage is admirable and it is that which kept me turning the pages of the novel. The focus of The Jump-Off Creek is not on action or adventure and its scenes are not glamorous and beautiful. Instead it shows the often overlooked and sometimes ugly side of everyday life of the frontier and the strength it took just to survive. Although the traditional West is not always prevalent, in small passages throughout the text there are some glimpses of the West. A native American and his cowboy friend, Blue and Tim, are involved in two scenarios that are familiar to former Western novels. The two major characters are intertwined in both a bar fight and a struggle with a bear in the wilderness. However, the endings of the two scenes contrasts with the fights of typical Westerns. In both instances, the two &quot;heroes&quot; are defeated. After the quarrel behind the bar, Blue and Tim are left in pain. &quot;Tim lay where he was, drawn up protectively around his genitals. His ears rang. He breathed carefully through his mouth. After a long time he heard a Pianola playing through the wall of the building next to him, and after that Blue said, 'Sh*t,' on a high coughing gasp. Tim made a small sound too, meaning it to be a laugh, but it came out soft, a sigh.&quot; Blue and Tim are not invincible like typical Western heroes. They are mortal. Unlike the heroes of many Westerns they do not escape a brawl without a bruise or scratch. Blue and Tim show the realistic human qualities of pain and suffering. Throughout the novel Gloss thoughtfully includes journal entries written by Lydia to display the dialect of real women of the West. &quot;8 April Lost the way on poor directions but I am here now and glad for it, tho it is bad as I knew it would be, the stove rusted clear through, the roof rotted, the logs poor fitted and mildewed, the yard where the Animals must stand all Mud and stones.&quot; Through Lydia's journal we feel as if we are beside her in her adventures of surviving alone and we realize the harshness of her situation as she is making her own home on the frontier. While Lydia's views are most prominent throughout the text, Gloss uses smooth transitions to also write in the perspective of other characters. For example, Blue's viewpoint emerges in one chapter beginning with the following sentences: &quot;A woman rode out of the trees and stopped at the top of the hill to let down the fence rails. Blue saw her before Tim did.&quot; Although Gloss does not come right out and tell the reader that she is writing from Blue's perspective, it can quickly be inferred. While writing from the perspective of other characters one can get a feel for the distinct personalities of these characters. The use of many perspectives is a very beneficial literary device that Gloss thoughtfully uses to give the reader insight to each main identity. The conclusion of The Jump-Off Creek left me with a sense of disappointment. However, realistically, the ending contained a truth about the West that is often glamorized in most novels to leave the reader with a sense of false belief of the real frontier. Gloss reminds us that in the West not every story ended &quot;happily ever after.&quot; The question remains for the reader of The Jump-Off Creek: what is the real West? Is it the West of John Wayne in Hondo or is it the harsh life of Lydia Sanderson in The Jump-Off Creek? The answer is ambiguous: we cannot define it in simple terms. No doubt, both the excitement of Hondo and the reality of The Jump- Off Creek existed simultaneously. The Jump-Off Creek is a fast reading novel that offers a contrasting perspective of the frontier and leaves the reader with a more troubling, complex, and real picture of the American West."},{"Title":"The Jump-Off Creek","review":"There is an old adage that two are better than one. But not according to Lydia Sanderson, a stiff and awkward pioneer woman of the 1890's, who left Pennsylvania after her husband died to make a stake in northeast Oregon country and the Blue Mountains. Fiercely independent and willing to face the hardships of living alone on a remote mountainside, this story by Molly Gloss is based on original journals of the time and painstakingly accurate in its details of the area.The theme--women can be independent and do it as well or better than men--is a popular one in these modern times, though its spin gives me pause. Was this really so strongly portrayed in those days? To the author's credit, however, she did at times give a hint of Lydia's loneliness. \\"I shall not see Evelyn Walker now nor any other woman until the Spring, and must harden my heart not to be Lonely.\\"Gloss's plain and homespun style of writing wove a pleasing tale. It made me want to unravel her story until the end. She has a rare ability to detail the mundane, while twining together different story lines in a unique way. Her realism made me believe she knew her setting well--albeit often painting it in shades of gray with words like dull and sooty. (I live in these mountains. When it came to her descriptions of the weather and the poverty of the times, she nailed it!)In the end, however, I was left unsatisfied, feeling a certain hopelessness and fatalism. I found myself wishing Lydia Sanderson would indeed find that soul mate, even pathetic Tim Whiteaker, her male suitor, who could at least make her life somewhat easier. Still, The Jump-Off Creek is a worthwhile read for its brilliant descriptions, accurate settings and life as it really was in this part of Oregon. So, go ahead,take the leap and give \\"Jump Off Creek a try."},{"Title":"The Jump-Off Creek","review":"Molly Gloss's The Jump Off Creek is a Western, but not a typical one. The first contrast to a typical Western is that this book is female centered, not male centered. Gloss has used journals and diaries of women in the West in hopes to draw out some of the nontraditional women's roles in the West, &quot;I hope their strong, honest voices can be heard in this book.&quot; Showing that gender roles weren't fixed as many chose to believe, we see Lydia doing hard, manual labor, and Tim cooking and doing the wash. Lydia, the heroine of the book, abandons typical women's roles in the very beginning when she picks up and moves West alone to start a new life. &quot;I'd rather have my own house, sorry as it is, than the wedding ring of a man who couldn't be roused from sleeping when his own child was slipping out of me unborn.&quot; This isn't what we would expect to read had this book been written in the 50's when gender roles were fixed. What we see is the 80's ideology that a woman can make it without a man by her side, &quot;She changed off, sawing through a butt and then splitting it, piling up the shingles on a tarp and dragging the hillock behind her back to the house before she bucked the next one.&quot; Gloss attempts to break down the Western stereotypes for men. Tim and Blue are like real men we could meet if we were on the frontier, not larger than life heros that commonly dominate Western myths. Unlike heroes admired for their independence, Tim and Blue are dependant on others and each other on the frontier . They become almost like children in their dependance on others, &quot;He turned and looked at her, ducking his chin.&quot; Things don't come easily for them and they struggle like any human being would have, &quot;Tim put the gun down in the mud and went, shaking, across the bloody wallow on his knees.&quot; Even being a cowboy is rejected in this book, &quot;He said he'd seen years when a good cowboy couldn't by himself a job, but a good cook could pretty much always find work.&quot; The central narrator is constantly shifting in this book. While this is unexpected for a Western, I enjoy the build up of different stories and thoughts that can emerge from this style of writing. Besides narrations from characters, Gloss utilizes Lydia's journal entries written in her actual voice making the story more real, personal, and familiar. This helps us recognize and remember Lydia's real identity, while the central narration builds the events of her daily life in a flowing form. Dreams of easy success are shot down in The Jump Off Creek. Giving a truer picture of the West, The Jump Off Creek is not a romanticized myth of adventure and easy success. Gloss establishes a view that shows the desperation of lives in a West where there is nothing new and glorious to see and experience every day. We see the miserable and wretched hard lives that one might have encountered. Fantasies of ease and comfort in the West are gone in this novel. It isn't a fairy tale like the traditional Western, where the good guy always wins, and the hero can handle any problem successfully. This book doesn't contain a lot of action, but instead it brings out the monotonous daily life of establishing a new home in the West and centers on the domestic side of the West. Gloss tells us of the every day grind and challenges of lives where sometimes people fail and hours of hard work are only the beginning of more hours of hard work."},{"Title":"The Jump-Off Creek","review":"Mrs. Lydia Sanderson had married and her husband had moved into her room at her father's house so that she could continue to run her father's farm and help nurse her sick father. After both her father and her husband die, she sells all her husband's possessions and buys a relinquishment claim in the Blue Mountains of Oregon, leaving her binding life behind: &quot;The truth is. . . I'd rather have my own house, sorry as it is, than the wedding ring of a dead man who couldn't be roused from sleeping when his own child was slipping out of me unborn&quot; (81).This novel is the story of about the first year and a half of her homestead. She is an incredibly laconic person and the converstations seem to drag on because more is understood or thought than is spoken. She is an incredibly positive woman who faces homesteadings challenges without self-doubt or equivocating whether it is evicting the squatters from her home, chasing a bear that is stalking her goats, or spitting cedar shakes for a new roof. However, she always tries to be proper. A neighbor rides up when she is nailing poles into the chinks of her log cabin, and she comments, &quot;I smiled an presented myself as ladylike as liable to be with a hammer in my hand and nails in my teeth!&quot; (102). Lydia Sanderson's character is awe-inspiringly solid and by the end, she is willing to teach the male hero how to put up hay.Unfortunately, the more traditional male physical conflict story of two ranchers, Blue Odell and Tim Whiteaker take over the narrative. Wolfers begin to shoot cattle to provide meat for their poisoned bait, and they set leg-hold traps that wound a bear so that it begins to prey on domesticated animals. Blue and Tim avenge their losses, but the &quot;evil wolfers&quot; always retaliate with stronger measures. The conflict escalates from words, to loosing a picketed horse, to a fist fight, to a horse getting shot, and finally culminating in a rifle shoot-out.The two plots are entwined because Mrs. Sanderson and Mr. Odell and Mr. Whiteaker are neighbors who help each other in times of need. The men's unthinking impulse to retaliate for injustices is in sharp contrast to Mrs. Sanderson's well-considered, steady progress in building herself a home and good neighbors.It is unfortunate that a woman homesteading alone in order to establish her own freedom wasn't enough."},{"Title":"The Jump-Off Creek","review":"Molly Gloss has written an incredible tale of a pioneer woman who settles in the wilds of the Oregon frontier. To classify this book as a 'western' is to diminish not only the story but the excellent prose that Ms Gloss has given to the reader. Lydia Sanderson,the heroine of this story, is an example of the thousands of women who settled the western United States,surmounting extreme conditions, with or without a man. This story is told from the thoughts and perspectives of human beings in a time when words were important and not just 'bantied about' without thought.The book gives one, in this high tech day and age, a sense of the real and important, in daily living. It puts ones feet back on the ground and gives a new perspective to our lives.

Molly Gloss is a wonderful writer. The images are evocative, the characters ring true, the plot is interesting and engrossing.

There is no plot or moral but it is a good book if you want to find out a little about what it was like to try to settle out west, starting from nothing."},{"Title":"The Jump-Off Creek","review":"The American frontier signifies one of the most commonly stereotyped places. Readers of all ages have a sense of frontier freedom. We picture in our heads rolling plains of green grass and western cowboys atop their black or brown stallion. However, in Molly Gloss's novel The Jump-Off Creek, she uses a different approach by writing in a feminist view. She focuses on the hardships and joys of the West by using a female as a main character. Her feminist approach in the story accounts for the considerable contrast with other western texts. In The Jump-Off Creek, we are introduced to Lydia, a female settler who is a widower, living alone on the western frontier. She is a very independent, stubborn, young lady, not accepting much help from anyone-especially Tim (an obvious admirer of hers). Female readers will relate easily with this character as she tries to defy all odds and make a life for herself on the frontier. Readers will also find that Molly molds many other people besides Lydia into this text. While creating these various characters, Molly Gloss chooses to use many different points of views. Her use of limiting omniscient narrators, gives the reader inside perspective, making the characters and the entire story more interesting. Many of these characters acquire slightly different traits then we would expect. Unlike earlier written western texts where gender traits were fixed, in The Jump-Off Creek readers may be surprised at a cowboy who loves to cook. Gender characteristics definitely defy previous gender stereotypes in this text. However, all of these characters appear to be secure in who they are. This cowboy is not ashamed of his hobby. Because of this, we see little, if any, character transformation. Unlike other westerns where we see the bad guys turn into the good guys to fulfill the complete stereotypical picture, Molly just creates another character to fulfill the description instead. We especially see the use of many personalities at the small gatherings that the characters take part in throughout this novel. However, one drawback about using numerous characters is that it is very difficult to give the reader complete closure. Mysteries lurk behind each character, and sometimes the reader is left with a sense of longing at the end. Will readers beable to determine what happens to each and every person in The Jump-Off Creek? Only those who reach the last page of the novel will beable to answer this! Because Gloss uses such a different approach then most westerns, this book raises the debate of fiction versus reality. After reading The Jump-Off Creek what we thought we knew before becomes a completely different place. That picture in our heads turns from grassy plains to snowy, frozen hillsides. Cowboys' hobbies include domestic activities and socializing with others, instead of drinking whiskey while hunting down Indians. And women have made the transition from useless to useful. The frontier is no longer only a man's territory. This novel The Jump-Off Creek is definitely a page turner that presents a totally different picture of the west. This book opens up discussion on views of how the west really was!"},{"Title":"The Jump-Off Creek","review":"The book Jump Off Creek by Molly Gloss was, in my opinion, very good reading. The author did a very good job combining a lovely writing style to a story that I felt needed to be told. Most western novels focus on the men who settled the west and the things they endured. They tend to portray women of the west as weak and dependent on the cowboy. This story gives the women of the west a whole new image. One that I'm sure was important to western settlement. It is the story of a pioneer woman's journey to the west, the difficulties she faced along the way, the people she grew to know and the struggle to survive in this pioneer country. The writing style the author uses throughout this book combines a third person narrative with numerous first person \\"journal\\" entries from the main character Lydia. This gives the book a sense of realism. It made me feel as though the story I read was taken from the journal of a real pioneer woman. It gave me the feeling that this story actually happened and that the author was transforming Lydia's tale into easier reading. The journal entries contain very rough abbreviations and a writing style that was typical of the pioneer. For example, in the opening journal entry, \\"Bought the black hinny Mule today, $18, also the spavint gray as my money is so short and I have hope he will put on wt, his eyes are clear w a smart look in them and his feet not tender.\\". Most pioneer men and women were not educated to the extent that we are today and the author did a good job of reflecting that in the entries. This also contributes to the realism that is portrayed by the author in this novel. It is obvious to me that the author did a very intricate study of the actual journals of pioneer women and a fine job of writing the journal entries for Lydia. The journal entries also gave me insight into the thoughts of Lydia. They brought me closer to Lydia and helped me sympathize with her. I could begin to sense her loneliness as the novel progressed and I could feel her pain as the tragedies unfolded. The third person narrative the author combines with these journal entries is very easy to read. It tells a wonderful story that is written well. Her descriptions of the places that are encountered in the novel are done in detail which made it easier for me, as the reader, to be there looking from the perspective of the third person. The dialog interested me in this novel because it was different than what I had read before. The characters of Lydia, Tim, and Blue all spoke in a straight forward manner. They read the expressions of the other characters well and they generally only said anything when they had something to say. There were a few instances where there was small talk exchanged but even it was short and to the point. There were many occasions in the novel when Tim and Blue, who were very close friends, did not even have to exchange talk because they already knew what the other was thinking. I'm sure this was typical of the western frontier. The frontier was a cruel place and the struggle to survive had a lot to do with people keeping to themselves. They did not have the time to sit around and gossip like we do today. There was always work to be done in order to survive in this cruel west. The story follows Lydia as she moves to the west to start a new life. Her husband had died and she had sold all of his stuff just to make enough money to finance her journey to the Jump Off Creek where she had bought a small shack and a piece of land. She met Tim on her journey to the Jump Off Creek and he had helped her find her way. She became friends with them and they helped each other out whenever they could. I don't want to give the story away so let me just say that the story follows the three of them through the struggles they faced on the frontier, not only with nature but also with other people and wild animals. The ending of the story lacks closure but I think this was intentional on the part of the author. It is not your typical western where the guy saves the girl from the evil of the west and they fall in love and live happily ever after. It tells a different story. It's a story that is more realistic and it introduces us to a new west. A west where women could make it on their own. A west where the struggle to survive does not simply fall on the shoulders of the typical cowboy. The novel ends leaving the reader wondering what happens next and, in my case, left me finishing the story in my own mind. I think this is a good way to end a story like this because each reader is different and this allows the reader the opportunity to finish the story themselves. It encourages thought among the reader and it brings plenty of controversy to a literatary discussion. Of the novels I have read this semester for my Western Literature course, this one is the best in my opinion, not just because I liked the writing style and the story itself, but also because it tells a story that I think is important for American society. The west was not just settled by the \\"Cowboy\\", and not all of the women of the west were brought out there by men with expansion and gold on their minds. Some women came to the west in search of their own dream. Some moved west to start a new life of their own. They were very courageous, independent, tough women. The west portrayed in the movies that we see is, in my opinion, not the west that actually existed. We as Americans have formed ideas about the west that we have seen portrayed in movies over and over. The west was not just about the cowboy and the helpless woman whom he saved because she was helpless and he was falling in love with her. It was about all of the people who went out there. Men, women, children, and people of other ethnic groups and many different religions. Many of these people gave their lives in order for American expansion to run its course. This novel is a wonderful tale of one woman who had the courage to face the west head on and the strength to overcome its dangers."},{"Title":"The Jump-Off Creek","review":"I ran into this book 4 years ago and have since given probably 20 copies to my friends.

The character is compelling because her mission is, and those around her each have fully-developed personae and thus are fascinating to watch, but at the point where this story is ready to take off, it goes nowhere. Lydia, our strong female lead, rejects male attachment, but the author's point seems to be her soldiering on without needing something to fill that void. However, the other void, that of change or rise in her life, is not addressed, and the book ends up tapering out to a conclusion that reminds me of the null poetry of innumerable urban wordsmith slams I've attended. The point is the no point. But do we need another voice telling us that, when we already have death to stare us down at the end of a full life?

Molly Gloss give her readers plenty of time to enjoy the setting that she has detailed in this book."},{"Title":"The Jump-Off Creek","review":"This book and the setting seemed to have so much potential, yet Gloss failed to give soul to her characters. I never identified with any of the characters or cared about their future. The bad guys were evil, the heroine heroic, the cowboys shallow but no characterization beyond the stereotypes. Page after page of obstacles to overcome, yet no insights to be gained. If this book hadn't been a selection of my book group, I never would have stuck it out to the end."},{"Title":"The Jump-Off Creek","review":"The Jump-Off Creek By Molly Gloss THE REAL WEST The Jump-Off Creek by author Molly Gloss is the story of the &quot;real West,&quot; the hardships of daily life in the Blue Mountains of Oregon. In many ways, the novel is not your typical Western. The book begins with Lydia, a brave, independent woman from the East, homesteading by herself in the 1890's. After her husband died, she &quot;sold his clothes and his dog and horse and everything else that belonged to him, to have the money to come West.&quot; The story, though told in multi-vocal text, is largely made up of Lydia's daily journal entries and accounts of the struggles she faces as a woman alone in the West. I found it interesting to get a woman's perspective of the West for a change. Though there are some similarities, the novel differs in many ways from the common western myth. Although gender is still established in the novel, Gloss also violates gender roles. The male characters are often portrayed as child-like instead of the heroes we are used to reading about in western novels. The reader learns early on, for example, that Tim Whiteaker, Lydia's friend and neighbor, is a cook. Tim claimed to have &quot;spent as many summers cooking as he ever did cowboying.&quot; Just as Tim violated gender roles by cooking, so too did Lydia by pioneering alone. Evelyn, Lydia's only female friend on the frontier, commented once, &quot;I admire you so much Lydia! You are brave as anyone!&quot; In a sense, Lydia takes the place of the male hero in the story. She has some of the qualities men usually bear in the common western myth like bravery and independence. &quot;I have been long getting my independence and am much afraid of losing it through some need or circumstance,&quot; she says. Lydia realizes the limitations, however, that she has as a woman in the West such as her lack of physical strength. Besides gender, another difference between the commonly portrayed West and the West found in The Jump-Off Creek is the lack of action and adventure. Most Westerns are packed with gun slinging and bar fights. Gloss, however, focuses more on the hardships of daily life and the constant struggle for survival. During this time on the Western frontier, times were hard, decent jobs were hard to come by, and death was all around. Animals were killed daily by poisoned bait and the harsh weather of winter. Men, too, were inclined to violence and had to be cautious of making enemies. Those brave and strong enough to fight the elements of nature also had to accept failure. Near the end of the story, following a treacherous ice storm, Gloss describes Lydia. &quot;Crossing the field with the empty kettle, she fell on the ice and sat there crying, dryly, tiredly.' But like all of the other survivors, she had to get up and move on. Despite the differences with the common Western myth, The Jump-Off Creek does share some similarities. For example, Gloss frequently writes about loneliness in the West. In many of the Western novels, loneliness is a common problem faced by settlers. Lydia, however, denies feeling lonely throughout the entire novel. From the very beginning Lydia claims, &quot;I am used to being Alone, in spirit if not in body, and shall not be Lonely, as I have never been inclined that way. I believe what I feel is just a keenness to get to that place and stand under my own roof at last.&quot; Evelyn, however, who is surrounded by family, claims to be &quot;beside herself with loneliness&quot; and is thankful for her new companion, Lydia. Besides loneliness, the characters in The Jump-Off Creek possess another similarity with the settlers found in typical Western novels. When it comes right down to it, they too desired transformation and the fulfillment of the American dream. Lydia confesses to Blue that &quot;I had it in my mind to come West and take up ranching. I suppose that I was seeking the boundless possibilities that are said to live on the frontier.&quot; The only difference is usually it is the male in search of those dreams, not the independent female. Overall, I enjoyed reading Gloss's book. After the characters were fully introduced the story flowed much better and became more interesting. I would definitely recommend The Jump-Off Creek to the reader who is interested in the story of the &quot;real West&quot;. Though gender is not always defined and the struggles of daily life are more prevalent than action, the novel shares some common themes -loneliness and transformation- with the typical Western."},{"Title":"His and Hers Guide to Surviving","review":"My financee and I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book together.

Further, she attempts to wrestle with a previous work by Herbert Grundmann that the teachings of German mystics were formed by the intellectual underpinnings of the mystical and religious experience of medieval women. It is then Hollywood's hope to demonstrate the influences of the beguine mysticism, as exemplified through Porete and Mechtild, on Eckart's work. In addition, Hollywood explores how these three mystics, \\"... subvert medieval discourses on, and practices concerned with, gender and subjectivity.\\"Accordingly, Hollywood brings together Porete, Mechtild, and Eckhart to illustrate several strains found in all of their writings. First, both bodily and spiritual suffering are implicitly and explicitly criticized by Mechtild, Porete, and Eckhart. Scholars, in the past, have tried to define the language of female mystics, and these two are no exception, in terms of erotic and bodily imagery, which historians maintain is the cultural predilection of women towards such imagery. However, Hollywood believes that all of these writers have an apophatic nature to them. It is more explicit in Eckhart, but Hollywood maintains that all three use apophatic means to try to describe God. None of these mystics can properly describe God because of His unknowable nature, so they use terms that were familiar to their intended audience.These mystics also emphasized the suppression of the will to become one with God. Eckhart stressed the importance of surrender of the self [the soul], \\"for the divine being is equal to nothing, and in it there is neither image nor form.\\" While the women, Mechthild and Porete, describe divine experiences, thus emphasizing personal authority due to God's intervention, Eckhart conveys \\"priestly authority\\" available to men during the period, however, his emphasis upon personal detachment allows the concept of the soul's union with God to be available to all. Thus, to Hollywood, women were forced to seek access to the divine and to public voices by inscribing their souls with suffering and with wounds marking the presence of God and the limits of description. Taken together, the three mystics and their attitude towards the body are similar in that they all stressed the importance of minimizing the body to concentrate on the soul. Medieval society emphasizes asceticism as the path to God, but again, the three mystics emphasize what the soul must do to forge a path to God. Of course, Hollywood does make several assumptions to make her thesis work. First, that the two female mystics attempted to explain God in unknowable terms, and that they used terms that their society could understand, and the second, that Eckhart did read these two female mystic writers."},{"Title":"A Special Agent","review":"....

I say conflict because it cannot be considered war. I've read it before in other books and seen it in pictures and movies but Bosnia truly was the \\"Slaughterhouse\\" that Mr. Rieff describes.These were ordinary people; doctors, teachers, parents, etc. that grew up in the bosom of civilization, in Europe. They expected that civilization to shield them from the horrors unleashed by the Bosnian Serbs and were shellshocked when it didn't. Comprehension was beyond them, this simply COULD NOT happen at the end of the 20th century in the heart of Europe, but it did. The worst slaughter in Europe since the Holocaust, 250,000 dead. Why? Mr. Rieff comes to the same conclusion as most; myth and delusion. The Turk/Janissary/Handzar were coming for the Serbs in their beds, only, it was actually the Chetniks murdering and raping instead.\\"Why did they murder a 70 year old Bosniac?Don't you understand they did it because in 1389 the Turks beat Prince Lazar on the Kossovo Polje?\\"GAAAH!Because of when this was written it is a dated history but still very valuable because Mr. Rieff was there, as an American, whose perspective any American (Westerner) will understand. His disbelief and horror echoes your own. A horrible read in that it will make you want to weep but a great way to begin to comprehend what happened."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse: Bosnia and the Failure of the West","review":"On January 8, 1993 a UN convoy was transporting the vice-President of Bosnia, Dr. Hakija Turajlic back to Sarajevo when it was stopped by a Serb convoy. The UN commander, French Colonel Patrice Sartre did not call for help from the UNPROFOR aiport garrison. Instead he sent away three British Warrior fighting vehicles on the scene, saying there wasn't a problem. In order to demonstrate that there were no \\"Mujahedin\\" riding along with Dr. Turajlic, Sartre opened the door to the truck Turajlic was sitting in. Whereupon a Bosnian Serb promptly assasinated him. For this grotesque act of incompetence, Sartre was not court-martialed and shot, but fully exonerated by the United Nations, and on his return to France was given the Legion of Honor. Later he would help the French intervention to save their genocidal allies in Rwanda.One might say that this horrible episode, as recounted in David Rieff's excellent and properly outraged book, was typical of the world's reaction to Bosnia: a false neutrality between the murderer and the victim moving towards active indulgence of the former against the latter; a refusal to accept the blame or responsibility for one's actions; a member country of the United Nations actively betrayed by the UN whose paths to peace amount to its liquidation. One might say this, but that would not be enough. Rieff reminds us of the full horror and obscenity of the Bosnian war, and provides a shocking picture of Western callousness.He reminds us of the obvious. Here is a democratic multicultural republic who has no defenders in either the United Nations or in the European Community. For years the Soviet grip on Eastern Europe was the United States' best argument in the cold war. Yet nothing Husak or Honecker ever did was as foul as the butchery of Srebrenica. 200,000 people were slaughtered in ethnic cleansing and millions made homeless, the worst atrocity in Europe since the death of Stalin. But the ironies of the war are such that the one multicultural community in Bosnia found itself called \\"the Muslims.\\" Meanwhile the irridentists seeking to destroy it were called the \\"Serbs\\" and \\"Croats\\" in the international press, and not Orthodox or Catholic, Chetnik or Ustashe. There is the whole pointlessness of the nationalist enterprise, as Serbs and Croats emphasize their distinct variety of Christianity when most of them are agnostic, while special nationalist intellectuals seeks to dream up new vocabularies or emphasize special alphabets to get around the fact that all three countries speak the same language.Rieff argues, rightly, that only NATO intervention could have stopped ethnic cleansing. He also points out, again rightly as we can see from the case of Kosovo, that had they done so the Bosnian Serbs would have quickly compromised or been quickly defeated. He also notes the strain and pressure that the multicultural and democratic values of Bosnia were put under by the unrelenting strain and viciousness, and he also notes how the thugs of Karadzic and the cowards of the UN and the US leaped on the rising fundamentalism and intolerance as vindication of their own vile stand. We see the United Nations trapped in the worst set of bureaucratic mindset, with corrupt soldiers on the ground. The UN fully accepts George Orwell's ironic dictum that the quickest way to end a war is to lose it, and do everything they can to discourage the Bosnians. Increasingly, it seems that instead of sacrificing its political capital to help Bosnians, Bosnians should sacrifice everything for the UN's convenience. And so we see the Canadian general Lewis Mackenzie and the British General Sir Michael Rose insinuating, never frankly declaring, that the Bosnians shelled their own people. It is amazing that Mackenzie entered federal politics after his return home, and had the voters of an otherwise extremely conservative rural Ontario riding wisely re-elected the liberal incumbent, this most overrated of men could have been viewed as a potential leader of the opposition, even a potential prime minister. Rieff's book is worth reading alone just for pointing out the truth about him."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse: Bosnia and the Failure of the West","review":"Mr. Rieff writes with such a poetic style that the subject becomes alive and fluid! Though the subject is tragic the writing style is magical. Every page drew me in and refused to let me go until I had turned to the next. A very well researched and poignant book."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse: Bosnia and the Failure of the West","review":"This book defininitely opened my eyes to the &quot;Slaughterhouse&quot; of the Balkans. The book was definitely well-researched and well-written, but it definitely dragged on at times. Rieff seemed to be repeating himself throughout the whole book, but his points were obviously well-taken. It also described various detailed, graphic accounts of some of the hardships that many people had to live with. It portrayed all sides of the whole Bosnia/Serbia/Croatia genocide and compared it to the Holocaust. Rieff also berates the rest of the world for not coming to the aid of the thousands of victims of this war. A good overview of the entire Balkan conflict."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse: Bosnia and the Failure of the West","review":"This book is an excellent analysis of the Bosnian war. While the writer at times might ramble on, it is still one of the best books out there by a great journalist. Rieff knows his stuff and I would say that this book is essential for any study on the conflict. His points are quite cogent and he makes an excellent case against the UN's conduct in the war. This is an important piece for the serious Balkan reader."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse: Bosnia and the Failure of the West","review":"David Rieff's book is one of many I have read on the Balkan conflict in the 1990s and I must say I was pretty disappointed with it. The book reads like an extended news report -- dry, factual and extremely boring. There wasn't much personal interpretation of the events, or sadly, anything new to say. The worst thing about Rieff's book I can think of is that it does nothing for one who knows zero about the war. A background of the conflict was not given, and he just went straight into talking about the war itself and the crimes on all sides. Mind-boggling and unfriendly."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse: Bosnia and the Failure of the West","review":"I have been interested in reading about the history of the Bosnian war as my father was in the US army stationed there for a time during my youth and I am now married to a refugee from that war. This book has a very interesting story but I was thrown off from becoming lost in the book due to the writer's aggravating writing. The run-on sentences and rambling made me feel like he was just writing down his thoughts of his experience and its too distracting. In addition the lack of organization of the chapters, topics, the book period makes it even more frustrating. Just not my style"},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse: Bosnia and the Failure of the West","review":"By way of introduction, I would like to state that this book contains virtually every essential element of the Bosnian tragedy. The author reveals the sheer indifference of the United Nations to the slaughter of a great number of innocent Bosnian civilians. As is well-known, one of the worst massacres after the World War 2 took place in Srebrenica before the eyes of the whole world! Admittedly, the United Nations failed to undertake necessary measures to prevent the bloodshed. In spite of the fact that Srebrenica was under UN &quot;protection&quot;, eight thousand innocent Bosnian civilians had been killed!! Even today, no one knows whether or not these people are alive. However, it is most likely that these helpless people were brutally murdered. Indisputably, the war in Bosnia was not considered a priority by the international community; on that acccount many innocent civilians were killed. This book divulges that the international community is highly accountable for the Bosnian tragedy and the fact that approximately 300.000 people were killed!"},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse: Bosnia and the Failure of the West","review":"Slaughterhouse; Bosnia and the failure of the west; in David Rieff's mind and words this means, Slaughterhouse the by Ustashi &amp; Chetniks; Bosnia, not Herzegovina, and the failure of the west to do anything. This book basically has been written by an Alngo-Saxon, Capitalist, who has not been into the depth of the Bosnian conflict. I am a Croatian-Born Australian, but me myslef, i know the full effect of the Croatian war, meeting people who have been hardest effected by it. And now spending my freetime researching the Balkans and wars and conflicts and as to why they errupted. Mr Rieff basically didn't go into the fact that the west didn't do anything to stop or lessen the effect of the Bosnian and Hercegovina war, but all he managed to do was to get the point of view from either Serbs or Moslem Nationalists. Therefor pointing the finger at Serbs and Croats, many times re-phrasing the Ustashi and Chetnik terms. he wrote a whol;e 220 page or so book, rewritting what thew western world had kept saying while Bosnia and Herzegovina, many of u have forgotten it's Bosnia and Herzegovina, that the west have tried to steer clear of the bosnian conflict.ei, the western world, saw the power of the serbs and saw that if the croats and bosnjaks were crushed there would be peace in the balkans because the serbs were chiefs. they didn't step in due to that... why did all of a sudden in 94-95 the USA turn on the side of the croats??? the croats were throwing the serbs out of western BiH. Rieff manages only to say that the western world did what it could to spare lives in BiH. exactly what the west had been wanting to hear all along.Propaganda......Tudman was said to have questioned Jasenovac, he himself went to jasenovac to comemorate the jews and serbs killed there. he was also said to have written a book doubting the holocaust. he wrote a statement saying that the killing of jews and serbs in Croatia duroing WW2 by facsists was exagguratted by the communists.the authour needs to get his facts write before he writes such a book."},{"Title":"The Essence of Mahayana Lojong Practice: An Oral Commentary to Geshe Langri Tangpa's Mind Training in Eight Verses","review":"My favorite book on Tibetan Buddhism.

Isabel and Douglas were great together and I especially enjoyed the interaction between Douglas and Isabel's newborn son, Parker. Douglas's internal dialogue regarding his feelings toward Isabel's departed husband was also interesting and comical at times. By the end of the story my patience with Douglas was wearing thin, but the ending was great and I felt he redeemed himself.One Red RoseThere was mention at the end of For the Roses of Mama Rose bringing a bride home for Adam, but there was a delay and it took Genevieve all this while to finally show up, and even then she brought trouble with her. Genevieve took quiet, reserved Adam and led him on an adventure from the very beginning, though he was unwilling to participate at first, and she didn't much care for him coming along. It was interesting to see more of Adam, who is normally so quiet and kept more in the background.

It's 3 books in one, although I'm not really sure how these stories could have ever been considered complete books of their own. This is my biggest complaint: the fact that they are simply too short. Each story begins with a beautiful idea, but there's not enough there to fully develop each character and explore his/her motivations. I enjoy reading the internal dialogue of a character, and that's missing here. The stories weren't bad at all, just not very satisfying for me. Each one just seemed rushed. This is a shame, as Julie Garwood is extremely talented and could have extended each story to be a fantastic series by itself. On a more positive note, because they are so short, each book can easily be read in a day and is great for escapism. They are light, romantic stories that will hold your interest enough to finish them quickly. My favorite story was the first.

For &quot;One Red Rose&quot;, I would have to say that it was like &quot;One White Rose&quot;, but like I said, overrall, I liked it. &quot;Come the Spring&quot; was what made the series so great."},{"Title":"The Clayborne Brides","review":"Ever since she published Prince Charming, Garwood hasn't been up to snuff. I am a big fan of her other books, The Gift, The Bride, and The Prize to name but a few. Lately, though, it seems and if she is selling out and not putting as much effort into the characters and stories. I felt like I was back in middle school reading a harlequin romance (yuk!) I hope that she will write better in the future."},{"Title":"The Clayborne Brides","review":"I usually really like Garwood but this book which is three stories in one book is very disapointing. The first and the last brothers' stories seemed forced."},{"Title":"The Clayborne Brides","review":"This has to be the best of the Clayborne series. I loved it. It was the first book I read by Julie Garwood and while I liked one red rose and one white rose, one pink rose was the best. I love Travis and Emily's story."},{"Title":"The Clayborne Brides","review":"I love most of ms Garwood's BOOKS THIS WAS A REAL LET DOWN NOT HER USUAL STUFF VERY RUSHED QUITE JUVENILE NO EXPANDING NO SENSUALITY ,MORE OF A SHORT STORY VERSION OF A CHEAP WESTERN WHAT A SHAME!!!!"},{"Title":"The Clayborne Brides","review":"Julie Garwood is my favorite author. Every time I see a new book, I get very excited and want to purchase it immediately. I was extremely disappointed when I read this series. I enjoyed the series of Rebellious Desire, The Bride, etc. and was hoping that this series would be just as good but its not!"},{"Title":"The Clayborne Brides","review":"I have read all of Julie Garwood's books. My favorites are The Gift, The Secret, and The Prize. I was expecting wonders when I heard The Clayborne Brides is going to be a mini series on TV so I bought the book. Oh My God I was disappointed, all three stories were just terrible. I hope Ms. Garwood will write better than this in the future."},{"Title":"The Clayborne Brides","review":"I am a true Julie Garwood fan. The Clayborne family is by far the best I have read out of all of her books, she seems to astound me with every chapter. But, I do believe The Clayborne Brides was her weakest collection of books, but she still impressed me.I was disappointed by the obvious rush with the love stories. They all seemed to fall in love quickly with eachother. And I see the arguements above about how that ruined the book. But, what was she suppose to write about? The brothers were all described in previous novels, and if she continued to have the brothers get into trouble throughout the novels, it would just drag on and on. Plus, there were numerous times where to cleverly stated that a few days or weeks had passed.She did a really great job by making us fall in love with not only Harrison but all of the brothers as well."},{"Title":"The Clayborne Brides","review":"Even though I'd read this book several years ago, I still couldn't put it down. A great story line with very interesting characters. Can't wait to read the sequel stories again, too."},{"Title":"The Clayborne Brides","review":"I got these for an airplane trip, and it was just the thing to help me through! They're very fast reading, and so funny that I kept turning the pages just to get to the jokes. I really like them, and I would definitely read them any time you need a book, but not a really heavy one. Really perfect for trips."},{"Title":"The Clayborne Brides","review":"i've read many books of Ms. Garwood's. i LOVED for the roses and thought i'd like the Clayborne Brides. I DID like them, they were good however i thought they were a bit rushed. :)"},{"Title":"The Clayborne Brides","review":"As soon as I read For The Roses, I wanted to read these novellas. They were masterpeices in their own ways, and I loved them all. Travis and Emily's story was simple but sweet. It seemed Ms. Garwood was just getting her juices flowing with this one. In Douglass and Isabell's story, she seems to pick up speed. The characters become more developed and they plot more intense. Adam and Geneveive's story top it off. They are what save the novellas from becoming washed up. The characters are, again, more developed and three dimensional. The story is also more intruiging. But, they are all extremely well written, and I think much more praise then they have gotten. As usual, the romances are unique and touching. Ms. Garwood makes a genuine attempt to help you get to know the brothers better. In short, if you've read For The Roses, these novellas are for you."},{"Title":"The Clayborne Brides","review":"This book was so good! I loved how funny and romantic it was! Julie made the characters seem so real and romantic! I loved it! Thank you Julie!"},{"Title":"The Clayborne Brides","review":"For the Roses was my favorite Julie Garwood book. It was fun to read these to find out what happened to the other brothers. Great!"},{"Title":"The Clayborne Brides","review":"This was another good book, though I wished that the characters were more fully developed then they were. I would have loved it if there could have been a full novel for each of the brothers. However, this book is great if you can't read it all in one sitting."},{"Title":"The Clayborne Brides","review":"I read the first book, &quot;One Pink Rose&quot;, and I just couldn't stop until I'd finished all three of them! These are the kind of stories that make you feel happy inside and begin to dream about romance. The stories were great, One White Rose was my favorite. The plots are terrific,they truly make me fantasize about what could happen in my own life! Keep up the good work, Julie!"},{"Title":"The Clayborne Brides","review":"I rated all 3 books a 4 stars. It contains several exciting twist &amp; few amusing scenes. All three love stories are romantically well writtened. I didn't think it was rushed... Although, the romance wasn't as detailed as I expected it to be, it's still well balanced and well designed.The only missing part in this 3 books are the rest of the CLAYBORNE family. There was only very few scenes mentioned of them. I was expecting at least a bit more on MAMA ROSE. She was one of the important characters in the book, FOR THE ROSES (the beginning of this series). When this first book ended, I read that she's finally coming home, I thought to read more about her in this second series. I was somewhat disappointed that she was only mentioned passingly. There was no conversation with her children nor any updates of how the reunion went about. I would imagine the initial reunion (after 20 years) would be a heart warming read. Nevertheless, The Claynorne Brides are worth the buy and your time. A relaxing read!"},{"Title":"The Clayborne Brides","review":"My mom suggested Julie Garwood to me and this was the first book I read. The love storys are great and considering the time pierod they are relatable. After finishing the book I ordered the remaining books in the series. Im so excited to see whats next!!"},{"Title":"The Clayborne Brides","review":"I loved the characters and the settings. I've never read any of Ms. Garwood's books before but I will look for more. I love the bigger-than-life characters, the head-strong women, and the hot, but not-pornographic love scenes. I considered giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because: A) It was a bit predictable, though still enjoyable; and B) It was incomplete. What about Cole?!"},{"Title":"The Clayborne Brides","review":"These quick stories show just how much a man loves a woman. Big strong Cowboy brothers each fall in love with a woman and protect them. How wonderful, Travis Clayborne finds Emily irresistible. Douglas Clayborne respects an loves Isabel. Adam Clayborne protects and falls for Genevieve. In 3 hours hear 3 stories by Julie Garwood that make you smile and feel good. Hours of enjoyment!!!"},{"Title":"The Clayborne Brides","review":"I am a huge Garwood fan and this one did not disappoint. There are 3 short stories in this book and it is an easy, fast read. I thoroughly enjoyed it."},{"Title":"The Clayborne Brides","review":"i am a great fan of julie garwoods and so far i have enjoyed every book i have read of hers, and believe me that is quite a few.

The Clayborne brothers were magnificent heros and filled my dreams with images of Montana cowboys."},{"Title":"The Clayborne Brides","review":"This was definately what I was waiting for. Although I was a bit confused with Adam's &quot;lost bride&quot; from For the Roses, (didn't his mother say she was bringing a bride home with her), I loved each new tale of the brothers. Thank you for continuing to be an author who uses wonderful description and imagery Julie Garwood! You truly have a talent for bringing fiction to life."},{"Title":"The Clayborne Brides","review":"The stories are full of adventure and romance.I can't leave the house without it.I can't sleep without reading it.It's the best of Julie Garwood!!"},{"Title":"The Clayborne Brides","review":"Julie's books always thrill me when I read them. She has a way of making everyone come alive. They become my friends and family. I always want to know what happens to the other characters. In this particular saga, I got answers. I did look forward to the movie. When I watched it though, I was disappointed. It was nothing like the book, except a couple of thoughts and the names. They killed off important characters and introduced others that didn't exist. No, I think Julie deserves to have her book portrayed literally. She, after all, wrote it. It was good enough to be a best seller the way it was! Keep going Julie Garwood. I look forward to all your books."},{"Title":"The Clayborne Brides","review":"I saw the movie For the Roses, I read the Book The Clayborne bride. I loved them both and now i can't wait to finish the family story. :)"},{"Title":"The Clayborne Brides","review":"I loved all three books. They were funny and exciting. I enjoyed the Claybornes in &quot;For the Roses&quot; and I was very delighted when Julie Garwood worte about the Clayborne brides. I like the interaction between the brothers, which is why I like Douglas story more. Then Adam's story which is thrilling and exciting. Then Travis' story which is very funny and loving. I would have liked it if Julie Garwood would have really introduce Mama Rose into each story, instead of just talking about her. Julie Garwood has created with the Clayborne family a rich and loving family in the truest sense."},{"Title":"The Clayborne Brides","review":"These three books were just great. They were fun, romantic, exciting... very enjoyable reading. My favorite of the three was One White Rose. It made me laugh and made me smile. But all three of the Clayborne Bride Trilogy were excellent reading. Perfect for a lazy day when you just want to kick back and read."},{"Title":"The Clayborne Brides","review":"To enjoy this series you first have to start with &quot;For the Roses&quot; this book sets the whole scene for the rest of the series. I read One Pink Rose, One White Rose, and One Red Rose all in one day I just could not put them done. Since then I have read them four or five more times. I could not wait to read Come The Spring. This book was the perfect ending to the most fabulous series."},{"Title":"The Clayborne Brides","review":"To truly enjoy One White Rose, One Pink Rose and One Red Rose you should first have read &quot;FOR THE ROSES&quot;. It sets the stage and introduces you to the personalities, desires and dreams of the three men involved, then, as you read each individual book you understand how and why each of these characters falls in love with these incredible women.I am so looking forward to reading the final episode in this series called &quot;COME THE SPRING&quot; to catch up on everything and everyone. THANK YOU JULIE GARWOOD."},{"Title":"The Clayborne Brides","review":"Overall I love Julie Garwood's historical romances - I haven't read her contemporary ones yet... However this historical one just doesn't cut it. The collection of short stories, has thin character development and weak plots. The stories are simply too simplistic and you never develop a connection to the characters."},{"Title":"The Clayborne Brides","review":"Not up to scratch from Julie Garwood. It had potential but too short a story on each couple to fully develop the characters and the same MO too!"},{"Title":"The Clayborne Brides","review":"I should have rated all 3 of these books seperately. One Pink Rose I would have only given 4 stars but One White Rose and One Red Rose would both get 5 stars!I have read all of Julie's books and I don't think these seemed rushed at all, although some people seem to believe they were. I would have enjoyed if they were longer but all the same i enjoyed them. Travis's story 'One Pink Rose' was good but he was never really my favorite brother. Although I did love how Emily brought out the softer side of him. It also expaned on his charcter more than we were able to see in For the Roses. Now Douglas's story &quot;One White Rose' is absolutely one of my favorite Garwood books. The humor in this book is tremendous, i can't even tell you how many times i had to stop reading because i was laughing so hard! The story line was completely different from Travis's story which was a relief. I feared all 3 stories would be too similiar. Ms. Garwood didn't disappoint me. I have read One White Rose several times and the ending is the absolute best! I won't elaborate in fear of giving anything away. :) Adam's story 'One Red Rose' was again refreshingly different from Travis and Douglas' stories. He was always so disciplined, it was nice to see a lady make him lose his control for once. Genevieve was so well written. She was a perfect match for Adam, just ask Mama Rose...she'll tell you just that! :) This story started back at the ranch and the whole family was there, and i truly enjoyed Garwood's thoughtfulness of letting us revisit with all the members of the Clayborne clan. They were lighter reads than her usual, but ravished with Garwood's fascinatingly, unique style all the same. Great reads and I definitely recommend them."},{"Title":"The Clayborne Brides","review":"This book is three short stories in one. It is best to read &quot;For the Roses&quot; before you read these books, so that you understand the Claybourne family better.&quot;ONE PINK ROSE&quot; is the story of Travis Claybourne. Travis is sent by Mama Rose to pick up Emily Finnegan, and deliver her to her groom, O'Toole. Emily is a headstrong girl, who Travis finds difficult to understand, yet intriguing to know more of. While I enjoyed this first book, I did not feel that I really got to know either Travis or Emily. Travis was the one brother in &quot;For the Roses&quot; that I never felt got as much attention as the others. I was hoping for a little more insight into his character, other than his liking of debate and &quot;The Republic,&quot; which was already explored to some extent in &quot;For the Roses.&quot; Overall, this book rates, in my opinion, a 3/5 stars.&quot;ONE WHITE ROSE&quot; is the story of Douglas Claybourne, the quiet brother. Douglas bought an Arabian horse six months prior, and finally has time to go collect the animal. When he arrives at the home of Parker Grant, he finds Isabel Grant, his wife, giving birth. Soon, Douglas discovers that Parker Grant has died, and Isabel is being harassed by the town bully. The ultimate reason for the harassment of the bully is a surprise, and I won't give it away here. By far, Douglas' story was the best of these three. I felt that Isabel and Douglas got to know each other, and truly fell in love. It seems that Julie Garwood took an extra liking to Douglas, and focused more on his story. I give this book a 4/5 stars.Finally, &quot;ONE RED ROSE&quot; the story of Adam Claybourne, the head of the Clayborne family. This story was a complete disappointment. I had expected more from this courageous leader, then a story not worth the effort to read. I knew and respected Adam more when I first met him in &quot;For the Roses.&quot; I hope one day, Julie revisits this tale, and improves it greatly. Just skip reading this one. 0/5 stars.If you are a fan of the Claybournes (as most Julie fans are) this series is a must have. Read tibits of Adams' story. Douglas' story is worth the effort."},{"Title":"The Clayborne Brides","review":"Like other reviewers, I adore the Clayborne family and so I was looking forward to reading about Douglas, Travis, and Adam. I liked the first two stories, and I gave the book 3 stars because of that. However, Adam's story was the worst. In &quot;For the Roses,&quot; one could see that Adam's past as a runaway slave had an impact on his persona as well as current events in his life(i.e., his hesitation to leave the ranch). In &quot;The Clayborne Brides&quot;, there is little mention of this...with only a passing reference to the Gettysburg Adress. I also expected a little more realism in Adam and Genevive's story; there is no mention or hint of any prejudice or bias two African-Americans would have dealt with in that time. Not that those things take precedence in a romantic story but to ignore it is an insult to both characters. Read the &quot;One Pink Rose&quot; and &quot;One White Rose&quot; but don't bother with &quot;One Red Rose.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Clayborne Brides","review":"Three of the Clayborne brothers' unusual courtships are described in this book. The storylines include a woman being escorted to meet her mail-order husband, a pregnant widow in need of protection, and a gospel singer on the run after a thief tries to steal the church money.I can't believe these books were once published on their own. All of the plots were rushed and thinly developed. The characters were barely distinguishable from each other. There was scarcely any romantic interaction between couples, much less passion. The only decent book of the three was One White Rose, which told of the woman who is in labor when her Clayborne man arrives. At least that one is funny. Garwood's signature humor is not present in the other two books, and I didn't feel I had read anything substantial after I completed this trilogy."},{"Title":"The Clayborne Brides","review":"Personally, I like Garwood's Highland novels the best. This American trilogy seemed weak and lacking in basic emotion. On red rose was the best out of the three, it's the only one where the hero has even a chance to love anything about the heroine but her appearance. Unrealistic though...do you expect me to believe that an African American was treated equally in the Wild West? Nice Utopia dream world Garwood has going there, something I'd be proud to have in the history books, but it's just not believable! The Clayborne guys are sweet though, and worth reading about if you have the time."},{"Title":"The Clayborne Brides","review":"It was so nice to get to read about Douglas, Travis, and Adam. I had wondered about Cole until I saw that there was still \\"Come the Spring\\" to tell about Cole and more about Daniel Ryan who was introduced in these. The only thing I could find wrong with this book was that each story was too short :) I know that they had to be shorter to fit all three in one book, but I wish they each had their own novel! :) Other than that I thought these books were all great just as I think every single book Julie Garwood has written was great. I don't think she'll ever write a bad book - she's just not capable of it!"},{"Title":"The Clayborne Brides","review":"Clayborne Brides I Loved the book for the Roses bu this one was dissapointing the first story in the book is good and the second one was okay but by the third story you could tell that all the stories were almost exactly the same so it was hard to finish reading the One Red Rose."},{"Title":"The Clayborne Brides","review":"Her books are awsome! She is one of the top romance writter in my book I have read 17 of Julie Garwood's novels and she astounds me every time I read a new one. I suggest if you want to read this book start with the book &quot;For the Roses&quot; then go onto read &quot;One Pink Rose&quot;, &quot;One white Rose&quot;, and &quot;One Red Rose&quot; and then read &quot;Come the Spring&quot; These books are all about the Claybourne family and how they strived to survive raising an abandoned baby that they found in New York and turning her into a lady. After their little Mary Rose is grown up and Married to a highland Lawyer named Harrison each brother is tempted by women into settling down will the brothers run or face the destiny that MAMA Rose tricks them into."},{"Title":"The Clayborne Brides","review":"These three books were ok, however they weren't as exiting as Garwood's other novels. The stories were fast and there really wasn't that much passion for the charaters. I guess Garwood didn't have the space to write her usaual passion that she devotes to all her novals. I do have one question, isn't there one more brother who didn't get his book?"},{"Title":"The Clayborne Brides","review":"Unfortunately, I borrowed these from the library. There were 3 separate books. But I LOVED everyone of them. I laughed, I cried...What a gifted writer. I love the Clayborne stories. I am now reading Come the Spring...but havent been able to locate The Wedding. I do have one complaint though...I wish the stories would have been a little bit longer."},{"Title":"Sniper/Counter Sniper","review":"I agree with the sniper instructor. This book is excellent. It has many pictures and diagrams to show and explain the topics discussed in this book. Some topics include weapons, concealment, training, and scopes. The book gets down to the point with no BS and is easy to understand. Mark V. Lonsdale in my opinion is a great aurthor and his other books are just as good as this one. I would highly recommend this book to snipers and anyone interested in the art of sniper/counter sniper."},{"Title":"Sniper/Counter Sniper","review":"There are quite a few other books on sniping that you need to buy before this one. I do not know about the background of the other reviewers but to call this a good book on sniping is BS. A very, very light introduction, maybe, but the book does not cover ANYTHING in detail. It is at best useful for a wanna-be sniper and maybe not even so: If you include so little details, but still manage to explain where to shoot a man in the head it is at best missguiding.I am sure that mr. Lonesdale knows his stuff, but this book is lightweight."},{"Title":"Sniper/Counter Sniper","review":"We continue to use Sniper Counter Sniper as a textbook. It is still the most concise training manual on the subject of urban and police long rifle operations. Packed full of great photos and diagrams. Highly recommended"},{"Title":"Sniper/Counter Sniper","review":"Personally I am more interested in military sniping, but still Sniper/Counter Sniper gave a lot of good tips on the subject of long range shooting and especially in how to train yourself in the art of becoming a competent sniper."},{"Title":"Sniper/Counter Sniper","review":"The reason I bought this book was the title: Counter Sniper. As a former rifleman, counter sniper is the most difficult task. This book has zero info about counter sniper. However, the info about sniper operation in this book is very basic; at least nothing new for me. That just total waste my time. Some other sniper experience history books would be better reading material if you are into this subject."},{"Title":"Sniper/Counter Sniper","review":"These comments are based on the first edition.This is an entry-level guide for law enforcement use of snipers. It very briefly mentions some sniper rifles and scopes in common use or available at the time the book was first published (1987), and gives basic advise on how to train and deploy as a SWAT sniper. The author followed this with Sniper II in 1992."},{"Title":"Sniper/Counter Sniper","review":"SNIPER COUNTER-SNIPER is better than ever. This book has been fully revised and up-dated for 2005 with new text, chapters, images and equipment."},{"Title":"Transparence of the World","review":"Fortunate we are that W.S. Merwin commits as much time to translating other poets from other countries and times as he commits to writing his own magnificent works. His gifts as a poet make him far more than a translator: Merwin finds the seed of intention of the poet's works he embraces and manages to lift the thoughts intact into the English language.This very fine compilation of the poetry of Jean Follain has been gleaned from nine books of poems, curating the best of Follain's poems into a single heady volume. The poems are brief, address history and the effects of time passing with an economy of words that distill portions of moments into indelibly whispered thoughts.OCTOBER THOUGHTS'How one lovesthis great winethat one drinks all alonewhen the evening illumines its coppered hillsnot a hunter nowstalks the lowland gamethe sisters of our friendsseem more beautifulat the same time there is a threat of waran insect pausesthen goes on.'Read it several times and the atmosphere of World War II in the tremulous French countryside is palpable. And this is only one of many. Merwin allows us the pleasure of reading the poems in both French and English, a fine concept that Copper Canyon Press continues to pursue. A superb collaboration of poetic sharing. Grady Harp, December 06"},{"Title":"Transparence of the World","review":"I'm not always fond of Merwin's verse translations, but he's done a beautiful job on these. Every poem is solidly lineated. They sound as though they'd been written originally in English. The diction always feels right--neither too high nor too low.If you've never read Follain's verse poems, this is the way to start. His poems manage to be both highly economic and evocative. They are rich and earthly, intellectually precise and \\"metaphysical\\" in the sense used by Eliot."},{"Title":"Transparence of the World","review":"This is a work of words adrift in the materiality of their naming, and that world named, presented, standing somehow ahead of, or just beyond, the somehow bearable weight of its recent history. And it's lit up. So it's poignant, yet it is the poignancy of survival, of French and its speakers, as Merwin more or less puts it, weathering the shocks of encountering analogous languages (like English) and the wars' and technological/cultural changes' effacement of the faith in language's power to name, of a word's acquiring intimacy with things through a speaker's familiarity and love. In this book poems, and the worlds they name, are structured by the presentation of lit and resonant details which are held in imagination's vision and historical understanding the details prompt. If Pierre Reverday can recall DiChirico's inhuman isolation, abandoned space, Follain is the mammalian antidote, who, though no less strictly constructed, lightly inhabits his landscapes with intimacy and fondness. This is an absolutely lovely piece of work. Do yourself a favor and read it."},{"Title":"NIGHTFALL TWO: SCIENCE FICTION STORIES","review":"The collection Nightfall and Other Stories was initially published as 2 volumes due to some inexplicable publishing vagary, then recollected into one, so copies of this book are rare. It contains some fun stories and one of my all-time favorites, It's Such a Beautiful Day, about a society so mechanised people no longer set foot outdoors. This must have been an outlandish idea back in 1954 but it no longer seems so. Strikebreaker and In a Good Cause are powerful and rather bleak stories about the uglier aspects of politics and society, offset by the parodic humor of The Up-to-date Sorcerer and What is This Thing Called Love?. The deep concern for humanity that marks most of Asimov's later stories is evident in this collection. Some stories are slightly dated, but it adds to their charm. The only one that does nothing for me is Flies."},{"Title":"NIGHTFALL TWO: SCIENCE FICTION STORIES","review":"Part of a split up double volume Nightfall collection.

Apparently, they were both very popular back when they were first published, in the late 1890s, but have become mostly forgotten. They're more novellas than anything; Detective isn't even 100 pages long. The illustrations are really good, and I plan on buying the other volumes in the Mark Twain Library, each of which include the original illustrations that were present in the first editions. Both Abroad and Detective are entertaining, but they're not in the mold of the Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. You know how in Huckleberry Finn, Huck goes through all these little misadventures, all the while growing up and gaining all kinds of wisdom, and then in the end, the book takes a harsh turn and goes back to the juvenile exploits of Tom Sawyer, when he and Huck try to free Jim? It's like the end of the book really doesn't have much to do with the rest of it, it's just Huck and Tom doing dumb, yet funny, kid stuff. Well, both Abroad and Detective are like that; only very occasionally do you get any of Huck's unique flashes of insight. Jim himself only appears in Abroad, which is a fantasy tale in which he, Tom, and Huck happen to be kidnapped onto a high-tech balloon (!) and go across the Atlantic to Africa. There's really not much of a plot or resolution, they just float along over the desert, Tom tells them about the Arabian Nights, and Jim gets stranded on the head of the Sphinx for a little while. Abroad picks up not long after the events in the Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, and apparently Detective picks up not long after Abroad, though the events that transpired in Abroad are never mentioned in Tom Sawyer, Detective. Maybe Twain considered Abroad more of a whimsical tale, something that never really happened. Who knows...but I think Detective was the better of the two, even though Jim doesn't even appear in the book, and it's more of a mystery novel than anything. Huck basically plays the role of the reporter in Detective, just relating all of the incidents he witnessed in an unusual murder/crime, and describing Tom Sawyer's scene-stealing exploits in the trial that follows. Many of the characters that appeared in the last half of Adv. of Huck Finn make a return appearance in Detective. But anyway, both books are enjoyable to read, especially considering that both are written in the 1st person, from Huck's perspective, yet don't read them expecting the depth and emotion that are found in the Adv. of Huck Finn. I think these books were written for a younger audience, and that's how they read. But, for a frustrating, yet very interesting look into what might have been, had Twain finished his other two planned sequels to Huckleberry Finn, you should check out the book &quot;Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer Among the Indians,&quot; which contains two unfinished sequels that are both heads and tails better than Abroad and Detective: Among the Indians and Tom Sawyer's Conspiracy. But that's all I have to say about that."},{"Title":"Tom Sawyer Abroad and Tom Sawyer, Detective (Mark Twain Library)","review":"This book picks up right after the hallaballo has died down from Tom and Huck's triumphal return. Tom kinda craves notoriety as he competes for the unofficial title of Hannibal's First Traveler. Kidnapped by a mad inventor Tom, Huck and Jimfind themselves sailing in a hot-air balloon. They eventually realize that they are alone over the Atlantic, but when they sight land, it is not Europe! This first-person story is narrated with youthful zest and slangy vocabulary by an admiring Huck, so that he can praise Tom's leadership skills and power of argument.The three unprepared argonauts finally understand that they are floating over the vast Sahara Desert, where they experience a variety of adventures--interspersed with juvenile deductions and lively debate. Their challenges are right out of the Arabian Nights: no magic lamp or genies, but Twain serves up caravans, lions, mirages, warring Bedouin tribes, and a devastating sand storm. All this action is spiced with his wry humor, as he slips in snide remarks about more serious social issues (spoken through the mouths of babes). Although this tale is Plot Lite, there's plenty of lively dialogue, as the boys argue using kid logic, while indulging in youthful dreams of sudden fortune. A fun read with sly social criticism. But really, Mark Twain--tigers--in Africa?"},{"Title":"Tom Sawyer Abroad and Tom Sawyer, Detective (Mark Twain Library)","review":"Mark Twain's 1876 novel The Adventures of Tom Sawyer and its 1884 follow-up The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn are two of American literature's most famous works and the latter one of its most acclaimed. It may thus seem strange that 1894's Tom Sawyer Abroad and 1896's Tom Sawyer, Detective are now almost obscure. The truth is that this is not entirely undeserved. Huck Finn is a masterpiece of world literature, and anyone expecting them to be anywhere near it will be sorely disappointed. They lack the more famous work's seriousness and ambitiousness, making them inevitably minor. However, like nearly everything else Twain wrote, they are eminently readable, very entertaining, and often funny. Fans of Twain's lighter work, especially Tom Sawyer, will love them, and there is something for all to appreciate it. They are notable for taking the series and its characters in surprising new directions, for example leaving the rural South for distant Egypt in Abroad and adding character development in both. Though not great literary works in other respects, they perform surprisingly well in the latter area. Those eager for more adventures from Tom, Huck, and Jim will certainly warm to them. Like the book that bears his name, they are narrated by Huck with all his delightfully provincial grammar and spelling; \\"prostitution\\" for \\"prosecution\\" in Detective's court scene is my laugh aloud favorite. His navet&eacute; and ignorance also come into play in skillfully unprecedented ways, particularly in Detective.The two novels are now often packaged together, which makes sense in many ways. Both are short - about one hundred pages each - and of course have many of the same characters and numerous other similarities. Those who like one will probably like the other, making an omnibus convenient and, depending on the edition, perhaps cost efficient. Those who want only bare bones can easily find cheaper editions, but this is the one for enthusiasts. Unlike most versions but like other Mark Twain Library Series entries, this includes the original illustrations, which Twain considered important. Perhaps more notably, they have been carefully edited to ensure accuracy, correcting errors perpetuated for a century, including some expurgations.As for the stories themselves, like most of Twain, they can be read and enjoyed on several levels. Most simply and obviously, they are rollicking, picaresque adventures of the sort later classed as Young Adult or Juvenile. Similarities aside, each is a distinct part of genres then immensely popular - travel and detective fiction respectively. They can be read on these terms alone or as burlesques. There are thus some significant differences despite all the similarities. However, both are notably entertaining and quite humorous even in this limited sense, particularly the dialogue. While far from politically correct by current standards, they can easily be enjoyed by the very young as well as those of all ages who will take it on their own terms.The discerning can see significantly more, even if no one can see greatness. Though less savagely biting than later work, they are vintage Twain satire in many ways. Huck Finn's infamous closing section satirizes Romanticism in its various forms, including medieval ideals of chivalry, and Abroad works similarly. The new target is a type of book then immensely popular - travel adventures like Jules Verne's Around the World in 80 Days. Twain mocks such works' implausibility and superficiality but only gently, arguably even good-naturedly, especially compared to his vicious later satire. We get the feeling that Twain appreciates such books even as he mocks - not least because this story itself can legitimately be taken in such a way, and not without enjoyment. He also throws in a few shots at more serious issues. Those familiar with his life and thought will recognize several - his ongoing feud with Sir Walter Scott's work, his near-fatal run-in with patents, etc. - and laugh appreciatively. He treats these subjects more seriously and bitterly elsewhere, but it is notable that he was able to write of them relatively lightly, if effectively, here.It is indeed remarkable how subtle yet piercing Twain's satire can be even in a minor work like this. An example will suffice. In one scene, Tom sends a letter that says it comes from the \\"welkin.\\" Huck and Jim have never heard the word and are mystified. Tom initially acts as if they are ignorant fools but, when pushed, admits he does not know what it means but that every description of a great noise says that the hubbub was so loud it \\"made the welkin ring.\\" Anyone familiar with the word - or who bothers to look it up - will realize that, while ostensibly only poking fun at the ignorance of rural Southern boys, Twain also mocks writers who use conventional phrases without thought. Those who appreciate such points will see that they are well-made.No one should put Abroad with Twain's great work. Befitting its status, it can be read quickly and easily. It is at least as episodic as Tom Sawyer, and the little plot that exists is highly implausible. Yet even within this we can easily sense repetition and strain, as dialogue starts to seem canned and jokes become overly familiar. It almost seems at times that Twain had a simple template and stretched a little too far. Finally, the ending is very abrupt and a sort of deus ex machina. One may at first feel that Twain could have stretched the adventure out rather longer, even that he ends just as he seems to really get started; the characters after all visit but one country. However, he was right to stop when he did; anything more would have stretched the thinness past the proverbial breaking point. It is no great loss, as what we have is quite good for what it is - and, more importantly, Twain's satirical purpose is accomplished.Detective is in multiple ways very much like Tom Sawyer Abroad and, indeed, The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, not least in returning to the latter's rural South. However, it also differs significantly in obvious ways. First and most clearly, as the title shows, it is a detective story of the kind then very popular; this was after all when Sherlock Holmes was a sensation. Those who, like me, love such stories can appreciate it simply on this level. It is set up like a typical one with a murder mystery and has exciting elements such as a false confession, a dramatic courtroom scene, a climactic discovery, etc. - and, of course, eventual justice. Seeing all this play out is exciting, and Twain milks it for all it is worth. Unlike most of his works, this is filled with literary devices conventionally used for entertainment value, especially in modern popular fiction: foreshadowing, suspense, dramatic irony, etc. The revelation and ending are in particular highly wrought. Anyone who likes blazing stories of this sort, particularly detective ones, will enjoy and appreciate this and find Detective well worth reading for it alone.As for the satire, detective fiction itself is the target, but Twain's burlesque is gentle; we feel he lightly pokes fun at something he himself enjoys - not least because his satire could be far more bitter. He has some fun at the expense of the genre's conventions, using them in slightly exaggerated fashion to show how superficial they can sometimes be. What may seem exaggeration if read straight comes into play here: melodrama, implausibility, clich&eacute;s, etc. This is where Huck's navet&eacute; and ignorance are important. Many, perhaps even most, readers will be able to deduce some - or even all - of the ostensibly revelatory events, turning what would normally be suspense into dramatic irony. Those who miss the satire may think of these as defects, but those who see what Twain is doing will know they are intentional knocks at a) provincial Southern ignorance, and b) detective fiction conventions. Even simply moving from popular detective settings - i.e., Victorian England - to Twain's rural South makes the genre seem slightly ridiculous. However, that the story itself can still be enjoyable shows that the genre can as well. Indeed, Twain's satire is so subtle that many, perhaps especially detective fiction fans, will not even notice it - with whatever ambiguous result. As for those who dislike the genre, they may well like the story significantly more - indeed, may think it a riot. Twain at any rate did not cut off his satirical take on the genre here, returning several years later with the novella \\"A Double-Barreled Detective Story,\\" which drops Tom and Huck but actually has Holmes(!) and is significantly more biting.Tom Sawyer, Detective is thus quite a strange book - a light-hearted satire that most will not get and that many will likely enjoy for the very reasons Twain tries to mock. Its canonical status depends on how well one thinks he succeeds here. It will certainly delight fans of the associated stories and characters. The story itself is better than Tom Sawyer Abroad, arguably even better than The Adventures of Tom Sawyer; it has more plot than either, and characterization is strong. Conversely, there is significantly less humor, especially in the dialogue, except for those unusually alive to the satire.All told, the stories are a worthy edition to the series and to Twain generally even if only hard-core fans, especially those who treasure associated works, should read them in the end. He hardly wrote anything not worth reading, but these should be among the last stops. They are pleasant reads even if the fact that they have survived more than a century has more to do with Twain's name and his better works than inherent quality. Even so, they are surprisingly enjoyable proof that he was ever-readable even when far from this best."},{"Title":"Bezae Codex Cantabrigiensis","review":"This book is the size of a city white page phone directory.. huge!

Alter sought to tell the natural history of the elephant as well as its human history on the subcontinent, depicting it in history, mythology, religion, art, and literature. As he notes in the prologue, the somewhat tangential order of the chapters follows a series of journeys the author made in different parts of India in 2001-2002. Roughly chronological, each chapter details his experiences with actual elephants, those who live and work with them, and his viewings of elephant art (as well as many asides about elephants in history, legend, and literature) as he visited various national parks, shrines, museums, and festivals throughout India.I learned many interesting facts about elephant biology; the bull elephant experiences a cyclical period of sexual arousal, known as musth. Similar to the rut of a stag, musth is signaled by excretions from glands on either side of the elephant's forehead (in Indian poetry it is described as being a sweet perfume that attracted bees, though the author found it a \\"sour, oily\\" odor that attracted swarms of flies). Musth can occur any time of the year, though often afflicts elephants in June as monsoon rains begin. Elephants in musth are very temperamental and prone to fits of rage - tame elephants rarely if ever work during musth - and remain this way from a few weeks up to several months.Alter recounted the many differences between African Elephants (_Loxodonta africana_) and Indian Elephants; African Elephants tend to be taller (up to 12 feet at the shoulder versus the Indian being no larger than 10 feet), heavier (African bulls can weigh over 6 tons; Asian bulls closer to 4 tons), have larger ears, rougher hides, more wrinkled trunks, and a differently shaped skull; Africans have a more extended and tapered head while Asians have a flatter face and a more bulging forehead. The tip of the trunk on an African Elephant has two prehensile \\"fingers\\" while the Asian Elephant has but one. In Africa, both male and female elephants posses tusks; in Asia only males have tusks. Even then not all males have them; about 40 percent of all Indian bulls are tuskless and are called makhnas (in fact in some areas, such as Sri Lanka, only 10 percent of all males are tuskers, though this percentage varies a great deal locally). He discounts notions that the Indian elephant is more easily tamed, noting that simply that there is a considerably longer tradition of such training in India than anywhere else in the world.The elephant has a tremendous role in Indian religion. One example is Ganesha or Ganapati, the elephant-headed deity, bearer of joy and good fortune and son of Shiva and Parvati, who is worshipped for ten days every year in temporary shrines called mandals in the state of Maharashrta, at the end of which clay statues of Ganesha are paraded through the streets and immersed in the Arabian Sea. Ganesha is often depicted with a broken tusk and often any elephant that has only one tusk is called a \\"Ganesha.\\"Literature about elephants -whether factual or fanciful - has long dominated India writings. Gajashastra, or \\"elephant science,\\" was studied and recorded in ancient texts, themselves based on much older oral traditions, recorded in such pieces as _Hastyayurveda_, a part of the classic Sanskrit canon, and the _Matangalila_, a piece of Gajashastra composed by the Sanskrit poet Nilakantha. The latter book divided elephants into three castes; the bhadra, or noble tusker (suitable for carrying royalty); the manda (slow and dependable ordinary elephants), and the mriga (relatively lean, long-legged, and fleet-footed elephants). These texts have proven to be quite accurate and insightful, showing a real understanding of elephant physiology and training.The elephant has long been a prized target of the hunt or shikar, both before the age of British imperialism and during the days of the British Raj, though by and large elephants were more likely to be captured than to be shot (or as some of the shikaris of the Raj said, the elephant was \\"something one shot from, not at\\"), nevertheless solitary tuskers were often misrepresented as rogues and were judged to be fair game. More often attempts were made to catch elephants for use by the military, logging, and by royalty; methods varied greatly from digging a deep hole in the ground and covering it with bamboo, dirt, and grass to mela shikar (riding tame elephants into a wild herd and lassoing selected elephants with grass ropes) to khedah (involving driving herds into large wooden stockades by groups of beaters).Alter spent a great deal of time talking to those who handled elephants. Most tame elephants in India have two or three handlers; the mahout is responsible for the elephant's training and daily maintenance while the charrawallas (fodder cutters) assist him, their jobs being to collect fresh leaves and grass, keep the stables clean, and give the elephant its daily bath (often the charrawallas work as apprentices, aspiring to become mahouts themselves).Elephants are still kept in large numbers in captivity, with India possessing 3,500 captive animals (and 28,000 wild ones out of 50,000 wild elephants in Asia and 16,000 total in captivity). They are still used in a limited way in logging; for years they were vital in this capacity owing to their ability to traverse difficult terrain and move huge loads (now they are still found in forests but often used to patrol against elephant, rhino, and tiger poachers). Many temples and private individuals provide elephants for rent essentially, as their mere presence in weddings is considered auspicious. Rides on the back of elephants are important in tourism, not only for foreign tourists but those from other parts of India."},{"Title":"Other Followers of Jesus: Minor Characters As Major Figures in Mark's Gospel (Journal for the Study of the New Testament. Supplement Series, 102)","review":"Joel Williams has done students and teachers of Mark a valuable service with this narrative critical study of the role of minor characters in guiding readers' responses to the story, especially to the disciples. He arranges his discussion around what he sees as the crucial episode of Bartimaeus, the blind beggar, who is called, healed, and follows Jesus \\"on the way,\\" with obvious metaphorical significance in the storyline. After introducing his approach, Williams deals with the minor characters before this episode, then Bartimaeus' own episode, and then those who follow him.He demonstrates persuasively that the depiction of minor characters varies with the progressive characterization of the disciples: at first the reader is led to identify with the disciples, gradually question their worth, see right through them, and dissociate from them, while appreciating the \\"other followers\\" as at first foils to the disciples, often quite exemplary, if imperfect, then as mirroring the disciples' weaknesses, until we come to Bartimaeus, a wholly positive exemplar, after whom minor characters provide the faithful examples of following Jesus, until finally the three women break the pattern and, like the male disciples, drop the baton for the reader to pick up.This is the kind of accessibly written study that helpfully guides both academic and ordinary readers through Mark's narrative. A thought provoking study in the finest narrative critical mold. I would love to see it reworked in a performance critical mode, because some of the features Williams notices might be better explicated in terms of oral-aural performance than silent reading. Nevertheless a thoroughly enjoyable read!"},{"Title":"1001 Surprising Things You Should Know about Christianity","review":"For those interested in a comprehensive introduction to the history of Christianity, 1001 Surprising Things You Should Know About Christianity will prove terribly disappointing.

However, there is lots of valuable information here, presented in a popular style that is easily digestible. The negative aspects of the church throughout the years are certainly not glossed over, and one gets the feeling that for at least half of the years since Christ true Christianity has been in the dumper, as a church rife with corruption, materialism, debauchery, and a lack of Christian charity seems to have been the rule rather than the exception. Let the church of today take note!A couple of surprising things, in the form of inaccuracies, are noted here. For example, one item states that the term \\"Christian\\" was first used by those involved in the First Crusade of 1095. Anyone who knows their Bible would know this is not the case. Acts 11:26 states \\"...now it was in Antioch that the disciples were first called Christians.\\" That was many years before 1095. Also, we are informed that there is a seminary named after Francis Asbury on the \\"east coast\\". I think the students at this seminary which is in Wilmore, KY, would find that it's an awfully long walk to the beach. Am I being picky by pointing out these things? Maybe, but it makes one wonder what other inaccuracies may be contained in this book, making it of questionable trustworthiness.

These pieces are completely unlike her dreamily delicious food-oriented novels, some dipping into human nature's dark and secretive aspects. In her foreword, Harris muses on how delightful it is to find short stories back in vogue. Her anthology should help keep them in style.JIGS & REELS begins with the irresistible \\"Faith and Hope Go Shopping,\\" in which two residents in a nursing home escape into the outside world to seek their hearts' desires. But just as the reader settles comfortably in after that heartwarmingly adventurous yarn, she encounters the polar opposite in \\"The G-SUS Gene,\\" a scathing science fiction yarn about free will and religion, which left me pondering, \\"Did she mean...? Or was it...?\\" In the author's foreword, she confides that short stories stick with her; I can guarantee I'll be pondering \\"The G-SUS Gene\\" for quite some time.Harris specializes in a good twist in the tale; some are more of a surprise than others. In \\"Hello, Goodbye\\" a gossip columnist's disturbing take on an ultrafashionable funeral culminates with an expected but ironic and tragic twist. I could never have predicted the ending of \\"Waiting for Gandalf,\\" in which a group's long-running role-playing game goes awry when cynical newcomers join in. And I adored the surreal kink in the plot of the honeymoon saga \\"Fish.\\"Harris's characters, such as the plump, bald vampire (virgins would never look at this leech twice) in \\"Never Give A Sucker . . .\\" are wonderfully strange and strangely wonderful. A loner receives an amazing gift, one with the potential to keep on giving, from \\"Tea With the Birds\\" enigmatic Mr. Tamaoki. We even get a peek into the other side of the Cinderella tale from \\"The Ugly Sister.\\" The stars of \\"Auto-da-fe\\" and \\"Free Spirit\\" are terrifying characters. And speaking of characters --- what becomes of the ones writers abandon? Harris gives us the answer in the Twilight Zone-ish \\"Last Train to Dogville.\\"I admire Harris for demonstrating her considerable skill in an amazing variety of genres, which include horror stories, fractured fairy tales, a hilarious class reunion of witches, a chilling version of THE LITTLE MERMAID, offbeat love stories, and more. However, a few of the pieces, such as \\"Any Girl Can Be a CandyKiss Girl!\\" and \\"A Place in the Sun,\\" seem to be not quite stories with plots, but more on the order of scathing fictional commentary on our preoccupation with beauty and youth. Reading these is like being served only exotic appetizers when you're expecting a hearty rib-sticking meal --- interesting but not very satisfying.Although a bit more development would have boosted considerably the quality of a handful of pieces, I was enthralled with a majority of the tales.

They're dark, which won't surprise Harris fans, and they're also amusing.Consider \\"Faith and Hope Go Shopping,\\" the story of two determined ladies in an old people's home. It seems that monotony is becoming a bit much for this pair. After all, Monday is always rice pudding, and while concern for their teeth is appreciated, Faith can also think of some things one doesn't have to chew - oysters, creme brulee, foie gras. One day it all is just too predictable, so the friends break out and go to London in search of a copy of Lolita and a pair of Jimmy Choos.Harris's retelling of the Cinderella story from the viewpoint of one of the Ugly Sisters is a treasure. Little could we have imagined what this poor woman has had to endure. Apparently it's even more devastating at Christmas time when she appears in plays and is hissed, booed, and \\"spat at by shrieking, sticky children with ice cream all over their faces.\\" She's had quite enough of that, to say nothing of having to put up with Her Smugness (aka Cinderella who always wore designer rags).Glad to say that there's also a happy ending for those not blessed with movie star features.

This uneven collection remains an exhilarating read, mostly because Harris seems prepared to try anything, to slyly poke fun at expectations and cultural traditions.I wish that Harris had not chosen to preface each story with a short explanation of why she wrote it; it takes the magic out of the illusion.

Walker","review":"The stories in this book cover a wide range of subjects and styles, as others have noted. But all -- both the realistic and the magical stories -- are written with a magic touch. Some are darkly funny, some just plain dark, some are quirky, and some are sweet. All of them speak to the soul in some way.Here are just a few examples: two women from a nursing home help each other bust out to go shopping; the actress who perennially plays an ugly stepsister (and comes to inhabit the role) explains why the stepsisters get a bum rap; a man undergoes a transformation while eating a meal in Naples; a class reunion of witches goes funnily awry, yet does not look that different from any other class reunion; a woman dares to try recipes from an old cookbook.I enjoyed every story immensely, even if the transition from one to another was sometimes jolting. That jolt was actually part of the fun! And I did enjoy Ms. Harris's little quotes at the beginning of each story telling us what inspired her to write it. I'm always interested in how people come up with ideas for stories.If you'd like a really fun collection of stories that will tickle your brain just a little as well as your funny bone, pick this one up!"},{"Title":"Lotus spreadsheet problems to accompany Fundamentals of marketing, ninth edition, by William J. Stanton, Michael J. Etzel, and Bruce J. Walker","review":"Like most short story collections, the individual stories vary in length and quality. It is hard to categorize the stories as they cover a range of topics and human emotions. Some deal with the supernatural and some with people's desires. The author notes that she finds it hard to write short stories. I have personally found that writing short stories is easy, but finding editors to publish them is extremely hard. Perhaps that is why the author has published them as a collection. Some are longer, complete stories; and some seem to be more in the category of short scenes.I particularly liked the man contemplating suicide who decided to indulge himself in things he would have never otherwise have done, e.g., two leather-clad blondes in a parked vehicle. And then their is the story about the ugly sister, and her feelings about Cinderella. There is the woman trying to use an ancient cookbook who obtains some very, very strange results. There is the class reunion, but a class from a rather strange school.Overall, the author is very creative, and has let her mind wander in some strange directions. But that makes for a collection of good stories."},{"Title":"Living by Grace: The Path to Inner Discovery","review":"There is always an alternative to the human condition. Many people go through their individual lives living and laboring under the law of karma (causation). But Joel Goldsmith presents us with the genuine alternative in his mystical teaching, The Infinite Way; this is to live &quot;life by grace&quot; -- the grace of spiritual consciousness.In this title, Joel instructs us how we can live by Spirit's grace. By maintaining a consciousness steeped in Truth in contemplating the letter of Truth and in silent meditation, one is brought into the fourth dimensional realm of the Spirit. When life is lived daily in the consciousness of God's presence, one permits the activity of grace in consciousness.

The first paragraph of the preface begins as such:\\"This pamphlet originates in a criticism of a recent edition of the Timaeus of Plato in the 'Classical Review' for March this year. The editor replied to my review in the April number. My full answer was reserved for a pamphlet because the subject could not be adequately treated in a review: and yet the editor's statements were such that I could not let them remain long unchallenged. Rather therefore than wait for the pamphlet, I wrote a preliminary answer for the same number of the 'Classical Review'. In it was given, among other things, a test instance of the trustworthiness of the editor's allegations. Eventually the editor accepted the test without reserve, in a tone of contempt and with an appearance of great confidence. How completely unfortunate the result was for him, may be seen from an article of mine which followed in the 'Academy' of June 8, 1889, and if mere success in controversy had been my object there would have been no need for me to say anything more.\\"Part 1 is titled \\"Relation of the edition to preceding commentaries\\". The subsections include: Obligations to Stallbaum; Criticisms of Stallbaum; Obligations to Martin and Some Others; Acquaintance with Ancient Authors Quoted (Thucydides and Galen are frequently quoted); and Obligations to Daremberg. Part 2 is \\"Text and Apparatus Critias\\". Part 3 is \\"Interpretation of the Language\\". Part 4 is \\"The editor's note on the Motion of the Planets Venus and Mars, and Some Points in His Reply.Cook's knowledge of the classics is very obvious. I bought this book out of interest for finding any old dialog on Platonic mathematics, so the academic debate means zero to me. Regarding the math, there is limited commentary, and what is present clearly shows a near complete ignorance of the subject and its importance.I should point out that a few pages, since they have been reproduced from the original and are as is, appear blurry, but its only a few. While this book did not suit my needs, people who devote their time to debating the technical translation may find this interesting.

The only redeeming quality that I have discovered after hours of perusing this book is its title, very apt and a caveat to both students and instructors alike: You should have &quot;second thoughts&quot; before learning or teaching with it. Less than a year after its release and the examples are sadly dated. The chapters begin with uncritical reflections on obscure literary sources. The portions of the book dedicated to analogical arguments, the deductive-inductive distinction and the difference between logic and critical thinking are at the least imprecise and at worst clearly wrong. Some explanations of reasoning techniques border on descriptions of folk psychological methods. The list could easily go on, but my time is more valuably spent otherwise; instead I will only say that the audience for this text will, soon after cracking it, beg for an edition with more critical thinking substance and less California glitz."},{"Title":"Second Thoughts: Critical Thinking for a Diverse Society","review":"This textbook suffers from several salient defects: (1) it lacks any treatment of truth tables (even though they are mentioned in the index on a non-existent page, oops to the editor!), (2) it confuses two definition types, associative and connotative, (3) the examples, though infused with pop culture, fail to engage students or to draw out any relevant features of logical reasoning or critical thinking, and (4) although the writer teaches at a Catholic college her examples go too far in the direction of condoning homosexual relations and drug abuse. A warning to the wise, including any logic or critical thinking instructors considering this book as the primary text for their course: avoid this book, use another and be glad that you did."},{"Title":"Ice Station Zebra","review":"The is the first of MacLean's books I can recall reading and it's not bad. Readers accustomed to modern thrillers that bolt out of the gate at 100 miles an hour should bear in mind this was written about 35 years ago when authors were allowed to build up tension. A mysterious British specialist boards a U.S. submarine that has been urgently dispatched to figure out what has happened to Ice Station Zebra, a top secret base drifting on ice near the North Pole. After many travails the specialist reaches the burned out station and quickly figures out that one of the nine survivors deliberately set the fire and murdered some of his colleagues. The survivors all board the submarine, which experiences a string of suspicious accidents, deaths and disasters. The idea is a good one but MacLean's characters are little more than one-dimensional. The superbly talented specialist is carrying a dark secret, the U.S. submariners are all superheroes, and like a previous reviewer, I was pretty sure I knew who the villain was the first time he appeared in print."},{"Title":"Ice Station Zebra","review":"One of Alistair MacLean's finest suspense thrillers. It may be more well known to some readers as a movie with Rock Hudson. Suffice to say, MacLean's novel is much better in terms of plot, suspense and coherence. The scriptwriters were morons, they should have stayed with MacLean's plot. The movie changes the ending and, again, the ending is better in the book. So if you've seen the film, don't think everything in the book is the same. It's not.MacLean seemed to feel at home in the Arctic. Several of his novels take place in the icy area and he always writes about it with skill. If you are reading one of his Arctic novels, even if it's July in Florida, you will feel chilled until you put the book down.The characters are well-drawn, the plot is first-rate, the writing is excellence and the twists will keep the reading guessing. The movie theme was excellent and Patrick McGoohan had a great role as the British agent in the film, but those were the only two items noteworthy in the cinema version.It's a great cold war thriller."},{"Title":"Ice Station Zebra","review":"This thriller novel kicks off with Dr. Carpenter, a British medical doctor, who gets orders to board the USS Dolphin in the UK. The US nuclear submarine Dolphin has a near-impossible mission: it has to cruise underneath the ice pack of the Arctic to find and save the inhabitants of Ice Station Zebra, a scientific meteorological station drifting with the ice pack somewhere north of the Arctic Circle. Ice Station Zebra was destroyed by a fire, but little does anyone know that fire at Ice Station Zebra was due to sabotage, and that one of the survivors is a ruthless killer. Furthermore, Dr. Carpenter is not what he seems to be and it later becomes evident that he has more staked in this cruise than originally suggested.What I liked about the story is how Alistair MacLean demonstrated his writing ability and mastery of the genre to create an atmosphere that gets the reader to feel that he/she is also inside the submarine and can sense, feel, smell and experience the conflict, fear and tension on board the submarine. Definitely not as turbo-paced as Matthew Reilly's more modern thriller novel with a nearly similar name, Ice Station, MacLean's book does not lack in pace, but the pace is controlled to such a degree that the right amount of suspense is created and that the tension builds up as the story progresses. Reilly's Ice Station is more about countless pages of jet-propelled action and relentless mindless violence, whereas MacLean's Ice Station Zebra consists of the finesse of expert handling of suspense, intrigue and tension.Although the dialogue may be more reminiscent of the era that the book was written in, this is truly still a masterpiece of the thriller genre and can almost serve as a template for thriller writers, where you have a plot stripped of all the unnecessary fluff that so many modern thrillers suffer from, which only serves to increase the page count and nothing much else."},{"Title":"Ice Station Zebra","review":"A British meterological station is in danger, and those staffing it will soon be dead without help. An American nuclear sub is sent out to help them, along with a doctor that is an expert in the sort of afflictions they may have developed.However, this American sub also has an underlying spook mission to go along with the rescue. This hidden agenda causes a hell of a lot of problems and casualiies throughout."},{"Title":"Ice Station Zebra","review":"Alistair MacLean's 1963 Cold War thriller \\"Ice Station Zebra\\" opens with a British doctor named Carpenter trying to talk his way aboard the American Navy's nuclear submarine \\"Dolphin\\" in a lonely harbor in Scotland. His announced mission is to organize the rescue of the crew of a British meteorological station on an ice island in the Arctic, victims of a deadly fire. As with many MacLean novels, neither the leading characters nor the mission are quite what they appear to be.\\"Ice Station Zebra\\" traces the Dolphin's exciting run under the polar ice pack to reach the last know location of Ice Station Zebra. There, Dr. Carpenter and a group of volunteers from the crew of Dolphin will dare the weather and the ice pack to find the station and rescue its stricken crew. Carpenter quickly discovers that the fire at Ice Station Zebra was no accident; among the surviving members of the Ice Station is a ruthless killer who will stop at nothing, including holding at risk the Dolphin, to achieve his mysterious purpose. Carpenter himself proves to have a very personal stake in the outcome of the struggle with the killer. MacLean's brisk prose and sardonic dialogue keep the suspense crackling to the very last page.By the time he wrote \\"Ice Station Zebra\\", MacLean had become a highly proficient story-teller. If parts of this novel seem a little contrived, the wise reader will relax and enjoy the ride. This novel is highly recommended to fans of the Cold War spy story and to fans of Alistair MacLean, master storyteller."},{"Title":"Ice Station Zebra","review":"First, Alistair MacLean is not one of my favorite authors. He recycles his plots over and over again. The Golden Rendezvous and Sanatorini are excellent examples of this. However, this book was the second MacLean novel I read, and thus the plot was completely new to me and fortunately, utterly original for MacLean. I was interested in the film version (this is much better) and was trying to find out what the storyline was. I had previously read Where Eagles Dare which I had found to be tasteful. Ice Station Zebra blew me away. I did not know at first what kind of book I was reading. I assumed that it was an action-adventure flick like Where Eagles Dare. It's not. It's much more. There is only one person shot in the entire book, but this is not the conflict. The conflict lies in fighting against the cold, a death of drowning, and an invisible enemy who is stalking you at every step. Like another reviewer said, this book shows that a legitimately good spy novel can be made without gratuitous violence and sex. There is no female element is this novel (sorry ladies) and the violence is realistic, yet not overdone. One of the things I loved about this novel is the way MacLean tells the story in the 1rst person, but still manages to not let us know everything that is going on in the main character's head. Thrilling read. Crisp Dialogue. The Perfect novel. Nothing was lacking. One of those few books that I have read more than once, and it never gets old."},{"Title":"Ice Station Zebra","review":"I got this for my husband, he remembered reading this book as a kid in school.

MacLean, while short on fleshing out characters, is exceptional at action and moving the story along at a brisk pace. Throughout this novel, even though I had an idea of what was going to happen, and even guessed some of the mysteries (don't want to spoil it for others), I enjoyed it immensely. This is not a by the numbers espionage novel, where the big 'reveals' are the only payoffs.The story centers around a station set up in the Arctic, where a meteorological station has been established, but is in trouble and is sending out SOS and so the US sends a nuclear submarine under the ice to rescue them. Along the way, there is sabotage, harrowing fascinating moments of finding a place to break through the ice and pure adventure. I loved this part of the novel, when they were trying to find the drifting station.There are surprises and of course there are people who aren't what they appear, aka spies, which drives the final half of the novel to a very satisfying conclusion. Particularly frightening was a fire on the sub.I studied on a sub so I found it to be very realistic and innovative. MacLean clearly did his homework.Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Ice Station Zebra","review":"The Arctic meteorological base Drift Ice Station Zebra has suffered a catastrophic fire, with several men killed and the remainder desperately clinging to survival in the frozen wasteland. As the US Navy's latest submarine USS Dolphin prepares to make a mercy dash to Ice Station Zebra, they are joined by British doctor Neil Carpenter, an alleged expert in Arctic survival. But Carpenter is not all he seems, and it is clear that Ice Station Zebra is not all it appears to be either. Carpenter suspects that the fire was no accident, and a series of hostile acts aimed at the Dolphin convinces him that something is very far wrong. What was Ice Station Zebra's true purpose, what caused the fire that destroyed the base, and are one or more of the survivors responsible? And who is Dr Carpenter, a man who abilities go well beyond setting broken bones?\`Ice Station Zebra' is one of Maclean's better books, written during the middle of his \\"golden run\\" in the 1950's and 60's. All of the Maclean elements are in place. The dry-witted laconic characters, with protagonist Carpenter clearly knowing more than what he is letting on. The workings of a naval vessel (in this case a submarine instead of a ship) and the men who serve in them. The Whodunnit locked room mystery set in an unusual location. And above all, the realistic and detailed descriptions of the harsh, bleak Arctic environment. Fans of Maclean's other Arctic mysteries like \`Night Without End' and \`Bear Island' will find plenty to love here.There is perhaps a little less action than in some of his other books; \`Ice Station Zebra' is more of a descriptive piece with mystery elements than a straight-out action thriller. But Maclean is able to use the slower pace of the book very cleverly. The mystery behind this Arctic research station, and of Carpenter himself, is revealed only gradually, with Carpenter openly admitting that he is not telling all his secrets. And the increasingly serious \\"accidents\\" which befall the Dolphin help set up a tension that only heightens with each new disaster. The claustrophobic environment of the submarine, along with the knowledge that the crew may be carrying a killer on board, only adds to the foreboding.After this great build-up though, the ending does let the book down just a little. While the final revelation of the purpose of Zebra and the reason for the killings is interesting enough, the revelation of the guilty party is not surprising. Although there are plenty of potential suspects, only a few of the characters from Zebra are well developed, and so you pretty much know that the killer has to be one of them. And that old plot device where the protagonist plays dumb and lures the guilty party into making a boastful confession has been used by Maclean several times before, and is a bit of a cop out really.Still, \`Ice Station Zebra' is definitely one of Maclean's better efforts, and he is back in the environment that he writes about best. Four stars."},{"Title":"Ice Station Zebra","review":"What a classic! Defo one of MacLean's best. Gripping story...you dont have a clue whats really happening until you get right towards the end.

Within a few pages, we know the gritty world of the submarine, the hard-bitten men who serve in her, and the intense preoccupation of Carpenter, the narrator, who has both a professional and personal stake in discovering the fate of the ice station and the secret technology. MacLean is outstanding when he writes about jeopardy, and the men and the sub are in constant danger throughout the book.I found the resolution of the mystery very disappointing and substandard, straight out of an old Columbo in which the rumpled detective assembled the suspects in a room and then talked us through the unlikely scenario that made that person the murderer. It was made even worse by the fact that I guessed who the killer was on the very first page in which the character appeared.For that reason, I couldn't really recommend this particular book, though I am a fan of the author and plan to read more of his thrillers in the future.Reviewer: Liz Clare, co-author of the historical novel \\"To the Ends of the Earth: The Last Journey of Lewis and Clark\\""},{"Title":"Ice Station Zebra","review":"This was the first work of Mr. MacLean's that I read and it left me spellbound up to the last page.

The submarine is carrying, as a guest, an English agent who also has personal reasons of interest. It comes out that the base had been almost totally destroyed by arson. A few survivors in terminal condition from frost are found and revived; the agent solves the riddle, prevents - nay, turns around 180 degrees - the final damage, and exposes the villainous traitor during the return trip(family circumstances of personal relevance are included). This book is in key with all others by the same author: introduce a seemingly desperate situation, masterminded by a super-fiend who is usually controlled by the bad side of the Iron Curtain; enter the afore-said super-duper British Secret Service agent (a past master in 20 different languages and all of their 300 dialects, and in all crafts of his trade.

Doctor Carpenter plays the leading role in this story as a British espioage aggent who acts the role of a ordanary doctor, but is secretly trying to find the man responsible for his brothers death. Doctor Jolly, a heavily accented Brit will be the man Carpenter is looking for. This man is a professional spy who covers his tracks quite well. Captain Swanson is the leading officer on the submarine Dolphin where most of the action including the climax takes place. He seems to be an inteligent man and well respected, but seems easily manipulated by Carpenter. One incident i did not like, it was shortly after Carpenter arrived at Ice Station Zebra in which he found his brothers charred remains, however he seemed to show little or no emotion towards this faceless body. I Would not reccomend this book because of impersonable characters who i could not relate with. The characters in my opinion are truly the backbone of the story and without them there is truly no hope for ICE STATION ZEBRA!"},{"Title":"Ice Station Zebra","review":"I have friends who found this book boring, and I think I see what they mean. &quot;Ice Station Zebra&quot; does not have the non-stop action pace of modern thrillers. What it does have, to an exceptional degree, is vivid characterization, enjoyable writing, and a sustained build-up of tension that enables the reader to miss the occasional hole in the plot. Something I truly love about this book is that there is no fat on its frame: no gratuitous violence, zero sex, no hype. In some ways it strikes me as a model for the successful thriller in its purest form, with everything potentially inessential stripped away, and I re-read it every year or two just for the sheer fun of it."},{"Title":"Ice Station Zebra","review":"This is the way action novels should be written: taut, interesting,and loaded with realistic plot twists. Anyone writing a thriller today would do well to read this novel and realize that true writing does not require heavy amounts of sick, glossy violence and unneccessary sex. Besides a crackling story, the characters are smart and show a good bit of depth. It requires you to figure who the antagonist might be. One of my favorite passages is during the accident in the Engineroom...talk abut cold! But I won't say anymore because I do not wish to ruin anymore of the plot.

But, just as one would suspect from a cold war thriller, all is not as it seems. Ice Station Zebra is a good deal more than just a scientific meteorological station. The scientific team is not just a collection of scientists. One of them is a ruthless killer for which the achievement of his mysterious secret mission against the Americans and the Brits may even require the cold-blooded execution of the entire crew of the Dolphin. Nor is Doctor Carpenter, a British volunteer member of the Dolphin's crew ostensibly along to seek out his brother who was part of Ice Station Zebra's stricken team, precisely what he shows to the world.As thrillers go, \\"Ice Station Zebra\\" is certainly enjoyable but it's a long, long way from what most readers would label a compelling page turner. It's got all the requisite ingredients to be sure - murder, sabotage, hidden identities, spies, accidents, cliff-hangers - but I think it could have been so much more. The parts of the story that took place inside the submarine were interesting and, at times, even exciting. But the action never reached the breathless urgent pace that was more recently achieved in other submarine thrillers such as \\"Hunt for Red October\\" or Larry Bond's \\"Dangerous Ground\\". The Arctic itself as an environment which can be stunning in its breathtaking beauty and is always fraught with danger and the potential for deadly accidents was never truly exploited as a part of the story to anywhere near the extent that it might have been.\\"Ice Station Zebra\\" is an enjoyable change of pace and nice easy brain candy reading that won't tax the little grey cells. It just won't make anyone's top ten list of the best all-time spy vs spy thrillers!Recommended.Paul Weiss"},{"Title":"Ice Station Zebra","review":"The best thing about the writing in this book is the way the author has put in just the perfect amount of detail.As I read this book I felt as if I was there following Carpenter(The main character).I could feel the cold and the atmosphere of the adventure as I read the book and I've read it 7 times by now in the past 5 years."},{"Title":"Ice Station Zebra","review":"This is one of Alistair Maclean's best novels. From the time the American nuclear submarine Dolphin moves under the Arctic ice, you know it's not going to be an easy trip. From the sabotage of the torpedo tube, to the cold war double-crossing action at Ice Station Zebra, this novel is fast-paced, while still making you cold reading it. If you haven't read Maclean before, start with this one. I read it the first time when I was twelve years old and I re-read it every other year."},{"Title":"Ice Station Zebra","review":"MacLean can really write a mystery! In the begining of this book it wasn't very interesting, it seemed like another stupid war book. But seems to be odinary is far, far from. It builds into one of the most suspensful and intriquing mysteries ever! MacLean feeds you little bits of info at a time, not enough to give anything away, but enough to keep you reading. You'll truely be suprised at the ending! The best book I've read in a long time. Tell your freinds."},{"Title":"Ice Station Zebra","review":"An ingenious and clever plot, set aboard a nuclear submarine headed for the polar ice cap. It's a rescue mission, murder mystery, and spy thriller. The hero is shrewd and intelligent and never gives up (regardless of how impossible the situation seems.) The villain is diabolical and just plain evil, and the supporting characters are outstanding and actually memorable. This (and all Maclean's other novels) should be the standard by which all movies are made, and which other novelists should try to measure up to."},{"Title":"Ice Station Zebra","review":"Unlike some of this author's novels, Ice Station Zebra is an easy-to-read, quick moving story that doesn't bore. Forget the movie (except you can visualize some of the actors as you read since casting was well done.) The action aboard the submarine provides some tense reading moments."},{"Title":"Coronado Conspiracy","review":"This page turner comes highly recommended for those who are intrigued and impressed by naval operations. The technical descripion in the story line and the highly developed and intelligent characters could only have been invented and shaped from first hand experience. Captain Galdorisi's expertise makes the Coronado Conspiracy a must read."},{"Title":"Coronado Conspiracy","review":"I enjoyed reading this book. The story details naval involvement in the anti-drug wars, something I was not faliliar with before. Captain Galdorisi's descriptions and unique storyline really make this book a page turner. I highly reccommend this book for anyone looking for a highly detailed military thriller."},{"Title":"Coronado Conspiracy","review":"I bought this book to kill time during a vacation and was pleasantly surprised with the storyline and action. The theme and sub-themes are particularly relevant today and offered more surprises than my latest Clancy read."},{"Title":"Coronado Conspiracy","review":"This book deals with topics I've always been extremely interested in: the inner workings of the military, and the way in which it relates to undisputed civilian authority. If you liked &quot;Seven Days in May&quot;, you'll certainly like this novel. The characters are very well defined, and the issue of the way in which our military is suffering from reduced budgets and narrow-minded policies for its use is very discreetly addressed, but firmly at the same time. There is an unmistakable sense of currency to this book; the events it narrates could very well be happening right now! As a prospective military person, I have to congratulate Captain Galdorisi on a job well done; Thank You, Sir!! If there is only want thing I could say I found lacking was the ending; I would've loved to learn more about the process against Generals Campbell and Walters. Maybe in the next book, right, Captain? :-)"},{"Title":"Coronado Conspiracy","review":"This is a &quot;low-tech&quot; Tom Clancy-type military/political thriller that keeps you turning the pages until you reach the awesome climax. A plot by two top West Point-grad generals goes awry to make a military anti-drug operation fail in order to run out of office the incumbent President who is turning the military into a bunch of civil police. Only the guts and brains of a former Navy Seal, CIA undercover operative derails the plan."},{"Title":"Coronado Conspiracy","review":"Galdorisi brings years of naval experience and a true talent for writing together in this heart-pounding, page-turning novel about the intriuges of the Pentagon, the common sailor, the undercover operative, and gutsy admirals. He effectively mixes warfare action with building suspense as the deep-reaching conspiracy is revealed. The more Navy SEAL Rick Holden discovers, the more danger he finds himself in. The ending is appropriately climactic and draws this thrilling novel to an effective close. A definite reading choice for any guy who likes both hard-core warfare and intelligent suspense. Hit that one-click-buy button!"},{"Title":"Temptation and Torment","review":"This is the first book I've read by Clea Cordell but it will not be the last. Cordell has created in Lord Rakka a fascinating and complex romantic hero who has achieved immortality, though not through the usual means of vampirism. His immortality, however, comes at a great price and he spends centuries seeking companionship before seeming to have found it at last, in the innocent, intelligent and beautiful daughter of a medieval cloth-merchant (or &quot;mercer&quot;), named Garnetta. Commendably, Cordell enhances the medieval ambience of her story by utilizing some medieval terminology rather than the modern equivalents (all quite easy for the modern reader to follow) and frequently endows her characters with views that would also be appropriate to the time period, but not to the extent that a modern reader of light literature such as this would have difficulty identifying with the characters. In certain respects this book reminded me of Tanith Lee's &quot;Vivia&quot;, although the plots were completely different. Fans of hers, as well as those of Anne Rice's and Tom Holland's fiction would probably enjoy this book as well. I gave it 4 stars rather than 5 only because I reserve 5 stars for works of serious literature, to which this novel, though evocative, fun and erotic, doesn't aspire."},{"Title":"Bob","review":"My granddaughter who is 4 1/2 years old really enjoys this book. The story is cute and the pages are lit with color."},{"Title":"Bob","review":"This book is funny. My girls loved it and I love it.

He's now 2 years old and it is still one of his favorite books. Excellent for reading aloud for learning animal sounds. There are also motions for when your little ones get older - learning to \\"woof and wag\\" (tail) for example.

They also love the funny illustrations."},{"Title":"Bob","review":"This is my two year old's favourite books. It's a great book for encouraging participation - my son loves to do all the animal noises. The story is simple and funny! Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Bob","review":"So cute!

He thought it was hilariously funny, and we read it many many times before it was time to go home. He keeps asking about it, and now we may have to get our own copy. And I agree with previous reviewer that it is not one of those books that you dread reading over and over again. It is a cute book with nice illustrations, and with a good message as well."},{"Title":"Bob","review":"Our 7 month old loves this book. She loves hearing us make the animal sounds, especially the owl's \\"whoo, whoo, whoo\\". I suspect this will be a favorite in our house for a long time."},{"Title":"Bob","review":"This one makes my three year old giggle out loud. It's a cute story, with cute pictures.

It's a great story too about try and try again until you get it right - some times it is not easy to find what you are looking for AND of tolerance towards those that are different than yourself! Everyone (every animal...) has something to teach if you take the time to listen! Also...Bob is an interesting rooster who uses his learnings...although a little unusual...to save the day & brighten it in the mean time too!"},{"Title":"Bob","review":"We borrowed this from the library for my 2 yr old because of all the positive reviews. We were extremely disappointed. This book has no depth or educational value.

It works for books as well as televsion shows, it seems.An audiobook on roughly the same topic isHow to Be a Successful Independent Medical Examiner. The material is a bit the same and you can listen to it in the car, thus saving yourself a lot of time.I have not written many IMEs and I have never appeared in court to defend them. However, the advice given applies equally to written IMEs and to testifying in court. The advice given is specific and systematic. The advice certanly includes basic things like what not to put in cover letters and dealing with electronic signatures.There are a fair few books about medical practitiners testifying in court but this is the only book of the type on the AMA website, which is a recommendation, I suppose.I would have preferred if the book gave a definition or explained the meaning of the oft-used magic words \\"a reasonable degree of medical certainty.\\"Below is a rough summary I did for my own benefit.

The image choices and arrangement demonstrate the ever changing womans form. There's not much hope of a book this small being deeply informative on such a broad span of history. But it is always disappointing when another book perpetuates the myth that steel corsets were common practice, and ribs being removed was equally plausible. The text history is anecdotal and amusing, much in the same way that a magazine would cover an entire century of fashion on one page, and make it interesting.

It begins with a brief history of the bra and what went before, right back to the days of Rome and Greece. There is an introduction that discusses the role of the female breast in contemporary Western culture,discusses whether bras or intended to be function or frivolous (answer: both) and goes into a little detail about choosing and fitting bras.The fun part is the history. There's a brief summary of what women did from roughly 3500 BC through 1200 AD, followed by the development of the corset into the 19th Century. Author Pedersen has done her research and the book is profusely illustrated. The design has faults, such as pull-quotes in a weird gray script on a black background that are unreadable. She then moves next the development of the modern bra beginning in 1904 and mixes her history of the garment with the larger social history of the time. It is an interesting approach and she pulls it off well.The influence of Pop Culture on bra design is fascinating with Pedersen recounting he impact of Jane Russell, the Sex Pistols, Madonna and son.All in all, a fun book.Jerry"},{"Title":"Bra: A Thousand Years of Style, Support and Seduction","review":"A book this small obviously isn't going to be a deep historic view of the bra, but as a fun read, coffee table book, or gift book--it is excellent.

It should be noted that while the reading level is that of Jr. High, the information offered in this work will challenge many a High School student and the pictures will fascinate children as young as three. It is also a pretty nifty book for ancient folk like myself...every time I pick this thing up I seem to learn something new. Alas, this work is now out of print and is becoming more and more difficult to find.Now I realize that much work has been done over the past few years since this work was published and there are indeed new facts and new discoveries; it seems like new ones are being published almost on a monthly basis. But this does not make this book less valid. It is still a wonderful starting point for the young aspiring palaeontologist, or a wonderful starting point for kids who just like to look at pictures and read neat stuff about Dinosaurs...and who doesn't?The book consists of 157 pages. There are well over 300 very well done illustrations and the text is done in a very easy to follow question-and-answer format and a wonderful comprehensive index is included. (The pictures are done if full color and in black and white...all are extremely detailed.)If you can find a nice copy of this one it would be a wonderful addition to your child's library. I know that it is one of the more popular books on the shelf at our local school libraries.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks"},{"Title":"Last Citadel","review":"This is an extremely well written work. Like the British historian-novelist David Howarth, David Robbins is able to take an enormous yet isolated incident and wrap it around three separate stories, a Spanish officer in the German Panzer Division trying to recapture his dignity after a near fatal shooting the year before, a young Russian woman trying to find her pilot lover shot down behind enemy lines, and a father and son on both sides of Russian Communism incarcerated in tight, hellish quarters in a Russian T-34 Tank during the Battle of Kursk in July of 1943.All this unfolds in the largest tank battle ever culminating with the American invasion of Sicily on July 11, 1943.You don't have to be a WWII buff to be thoroughly mesmerized by this book, but as in reading an Alan Furst novel, it helps. Professor Robbins deftly paints an accurate view of Hitler's last stand in Russia after the savage defeat of the Germans at Stalingrad, rolling the dice before the Americans enter the war in Europe, thereby turning his near impossible two front war into the resulting three front war.Yet Robbins does this with beautiful writing. At one point he describes a train station where a passenger train lays in wait while tracks are replaced from a bombing 12 hours earlier: \\"It had no roof left, just scored beams, and it's sills were marred with brows of soot.\\" Later Katya, about whom one of the stories revolves, awakens before her night mission as some other aircraft take off. \\"Once they took off [she] listened to the silence return . . . serrated only by crickets and a mechanic hammering at something stubborn.\\"While telling his stories the description of the battle takes on a more vivid meaning as the reader has humans to appreciate as Churchill wrote, 'their blood, sweat and tears.'An excellent novel. Rarely are we so intrigued about historical events that involve no Americans, on a plain in the Ukraine we never heard of, with the names of players for the most part we can't pronounce.Kudos to David Robbins. 5 stars. Easily 6 or 7. Larry Scantlebury"},{"Title":"Last Citadel","review":"This has a flavor similar to that of the author's excellentWar of the Rats. As with Rats, the chapters switch back andforth between Russian protagonists (a T-34 tank driver, hissons who commands the tank, his daughter who is a pilot) andtwo Germans (an intelligence officer and a tank captain--whois actually a Spaniard). As with Rats, or Len Deighton'sBomber, there is a good amount of technical detail--particularlyregarding the T-34 and Tiger tanks--design strengths and flaws,what it's like to be in one, and this adds a lot to the novel.Too many war novels like to employ the device of having an evilantagonist--someone who relishes torturing prisoners, etc, andwho gets his comeuppance in the end. Neither Rats nor thisnovel use this device, thank goodness. Engrossing and well-written!"},{"Title":"Last Citadel","review":"David Robbins' Last Citadel is one of the most compelling, exciting and impressive novels I've read in years. I can't remember the last time I read a book like this, one I literally couldn't put down. The epic backdrop of the battle for Kursk - where Soviet Russia and Nazi Germany engaged in history's largest and bloodiest battle - serves as an unforgettable stage, meticulously researched and panoramically rendered. Amazingly, the intense conflicts of the novel's characters exist larger than the titanic clash playing out behind them. Dimitri Berko, once a Cossack, now drives a Russian tank alongside his Communist son, still trying to teach a young man who no longer thinks he needs the wisdom of his father, hoping for one final chance of communion before the two of them face almost certain death. At the same time, Dimitri's daughter, Katya, guides Russian bombers to German targets, a \\"Night Witch\\" circling overhead. The stakes couldn't be higher for this family at war. Luis De Vega, the Spanish bullfighter commanding Germany's invincible Tiger tank, rolls closer and closer to Dimitri and Valentin, seething from past wounds, more dangerous than the stabbed bulls he once drove to the ground. The complexity of Abram Breit, a Nazi SS officer turned spy for the Russians, is particularly striking - a man who sees his apocalyptic world reflected in the work of the Cubist painters of his time, broken down into key universal elements that transcend both war and politics. The last battle scene is absolutely riveting, in itself worth the price of admission. The Last Citadel is a grand-slam novel, perfect."},{"Title":"Last Citadel","review":"Kursk 1943 -- Time and place of the German summer-offensive, codenamed \\"Citadel\\". And the Berko clan has gone to war according to its Cossack tradition, as a family. Father Dimitri and son Valentin rumble over the steppe in the cramped confines of their new T-34 tank. Meanwhile, daughter Ekaterina prowls the night skies in her antiquated biplane, braving searchlights and flak to bomb Nazi targets. Raiding Partisan bands strike fear in fascist and friend alike, ruthlessly recruiting men from suffering Ukrainian villages that can ill afford their loss. \\"Last Citadel\\" is the third book in Robbins' trilogy of the Eastern Front of World War ll. Like his previous novels, the latest presents the viewpoint from participants of both sides of the conflict, the Soviet and the Reich. Like the earlier novels, this one is impressively researched. The bibliography section looks remarkably like my own Amazon \\"Listmania!\\" pages; this should indicate my excitement upon receiving this book! \\"Last Citadel\\" is a tighter read than its predecessors. The narrative is much more flowing than the stilted, present-tense format of \\"The End of War\\"; and there are none of the distracting sexual vignettes of \\"War of the Rats\\". The characterizations are original and quite good. Dimitri, the Berko patriarch, is a Cossack from Tsarist times, contemptuous of the Bol'sheviks. His son Valya is an ardent young Communist and also his father's superior officer. Katya's martial motivation, whether flying her bomber or riding her Partisan steed, is simply to bring honor to her clan. SS Panzergrenadier Luis de Vega, a Spanish Fascist, is driven by his lust for vengeance against the Reds. And Col. Abram Breit, erstwhile Nazi spy, is secretly aiding the Soviets. The plot builds toward the great tank battle and an emotional climax. A sweeping saga, a rousing and entertaining read -- but marred, for me, by a few flaws. Katya is one of the main protagonists, and her inclusion in the story is a welcome one. But throughout, she is named \\"Witch\\". The historical women's Night Bomber division was dubbed \\"Nacht Hexxen\\" or \\"night witches\\" by the Germans who suffered their predation. But these women pilots never referred to themselves by the insulting epithet, nor did their male comrades ever call them that. This is a minor irritation, to be sure, but a grating one. It and a few other historical inaccuracies regarding Soviet aviation and tank operations cost the book a star, in my opinion. It's still well worth reading, and recommended."},{"Title":"Last Citadel","review":"Last Citadel was my first David L. Robbins book, but certainly not my last. This is one of the best written books I've ever read. Robbins creates wonderfully three-dimensional characters, and uses them to keep the reader hooked from the first paragraph. I recommend this book to people I know all the time, and use it as an example when talking to writers about characterization. I love Robbins' writing!"},{"Title":"Last Citadel","review":"This was the first David Robbins book I read. I was totally captivated by the author's style as well as the story. Robbins creates historical fiction where all events, and most characters are verifiably real.The Battle of Kursk was the largest of all tank battles in the history of warfare. Hitler's forces are poised to strike against the Russians. The Russians lie in wait, while the tension builds to a climax.From the lurching of a tank's steel enclosure with it's smell of oiled machinery mixed with cordite, to the whistling of flack cutting the canvas wings of a biplane bomber, one experiences the intimacy of the character's fears, elation, and courage. You will be thankful for your leather padded helmet as the tank rocks your head in recoil with the firing of its main gun.The protagonists in this novel are a tank commander seargant, his tank driver father, a private, and their sister/daughter who is a biplane bomber pilot who becomes a Partisan fighting against the occupying Nazis in western Russia.David Robbins creates these characters, both real and composite, with such skill and attention to detail that you feel they are \\"family.\\" Robbins is a master in portrayin the humanity of his characters. He does it primarily through action as opposed to narration, giving the reader insight otherwise impossible.Also read other books by David Robbins: The War of the Rats; Liberation Road; The End of War."},{"Title":"Last Citadel","review":"It is the rich characters that drive this novel. Robbins masterfully puts us in the middle of events allowing us to see through the eyes of cast. Well done!"},{"Title":"Last Citadel","review":"The Last Citadel is one of the few (maybe the only) novels that centers around the Battle of Kursk, the last major German offensive in Russia. Many Americans are familiar with Stalingrad, a topic of another Robbins novel but far fewer know about this ghastly, titanic battle. Robbins does an outstanding job of describing the German plans and the Soviet counter-plans, not leaving out the very important and often overlooked role that espionage and treason played in the ultimate outcome of the war. Even though I have read extensively about the Russo-German war I never knew until I read this novel that non-Aryans could serve as Waffen SS officers or that Russian families fought together in the same tank. Robbins is to be commended for educating as well as entertaining his readers.Even though this book is informative it is first and foremost a novel, and here it succeeds brilliantly. Robbins is an excellent creator of interesting and sympathetic characters. On the Russian side there is a Cossack family, father and son fighting together in the same T-34 tank while the daughter flies night bomber mission. On the German side there is Robbins' best creation, the Spanish SS officer along with an SS colonel, an art historian turned intelligence officer with his own agenda. I grew to like all these characters so much I was afraid to read the ending for fear that I would lose one or more.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Last Citadel","review":"The Last Citadel is an incredibly intense and often breathtaking book! The battle scenes from the prospective of the tankers of both sides are of an intensity rarely glimpsed in any form. As a former Army tanker, I found the writer's style to be accurate and so very realistic. His use of words to describe all facets of the conflict, emotional, intellectual as well as physical, from the perspectives of the characters is excellent. This author brings alive a time that we Americans have only heard a little of, and does great justice to the bravery, dedication and suffering of those forgotten masses who participated in that greatest of all conflicts-the Russian Front of World War II. In the same class as &quot;The Cross of Iron&quot; by Willi Heinrich, &quot;The Forgotten Soldier&quot; by Guy Sajer, and &quot;War of the Rats; A Novel&quot; by David Robbins. Don't miss this book!"},{"Title":"Last Citadel","review":"Robbins follows his previous two Eastern Front novels with the final in the trilogy. Here he describes the horrific battle of Kursk. Still, as in all Robbins's novels, the combat scenes, so powerfully drawn and cleanly researched, serve as the backdrop for deep and insightful character studies. The relationship between father and son, trapped inside a tiny T-34 tank while they are trapped in opposing ideologies, crackles with tension and authenticity. The daughter, dauntless, a Night Witch pilot, embarks on a dangerous rescue, and fights her own reluctance to risk both physical danger and love. The villain, Luis, fights for a plausible and powerful reason, redemption. Breit, a German intel officer, decides to become a Soviet spy after reviewing his life through the lens of Cubist art, then embarks on a great and dangerous mission, to make sure the Russians win at Kursk. These are not the themes of any other writer of WWII fiction except Robbins. The rest of the crowd plow through with battle and machines, while only Robbins, time and again, delivers from the heart. Read this book if you like historical fiction, or if you just want a rousing tale of adventure. But especially read it if you admire fabulous and well-paced writing, beautiful language and vocabulary, and most of all, if you respect a writer who uses challenging backgrounds - like the greatest land battle in history - to bring out the best and worst in his characters. In every book, Robbins stretches and grows. Pick this one up, then go get his others if you haven't already. He is poetical and powerful at the same time. He'll become one of your favorite writers, like he is one of mine."},{"Title":"Last Citadel","review":"I've never read any of Robbins other books, but I'd heard good things about The War of the Rats, so I thought I'd give this a go. I knew very little about the Battle of Kursk and my knowledge of the Eastern Front in general is somewhat shaky (although I did read and enjoy Guy Sajer's memoir The Forgotten Soldier). By the end of this book, it struck me that it's very much like a lot of historical and military fiction: decent at getting across the salient facts, decent at putting the reader in the middle of the action, woeful at pacing, characterization, drama, and woodenly written.The story revolves around the pivotal battle in July 1943 for the Soviet city of Kursk. Around two million soldiers were arrayed against each other, along with the largest collection of tanks ever seen. A German offensive, code named \\"Citadel\\", was an attempt by Hitler to create a breakthrough in Russia before he would be forced to reallocate troops and tanks to deal with the impending American invasion of Italy. The protagonists are a Spanish SS Panzer officer and a Russian family, two of whom serve in the same T-34 tank. The Spaniard is the son of a famous Barcelonan bullfighter and is part of the \\"Blue Division\\" sent by Franco to fight with the Germans. A sniper shot outside Leningrad took him out of action for almost a year and turned him into a pale, shriveled shell of what he used to be. Now he's back, escorting a final shipment of Tiger tanks to the front lines, and looking for revenge, honor, and glory to sustain the rest of his years. If this isn't cheesy enough, we have on the opposite side, the Berko family. Of Cossack linage, the cartoonish father is a tank driver for his son, a serious and distant Communist, while the daughter is a fearless member of an all-female night bomber unit. Supporting cardboard-thin characters include a gung-ho SS tank commander, a series of Ukrainian partisans, a noble Russian pilot, and a German intelligence officer spying for the Russians.On the German side, the story mostly consists of Vega safeguarding the transport of a final shipment of Tiger tanks to the front and eventually being assigned to command one of them in the battle. On the Russian side, we have the two Berko men in their latest T-34, dealing with two new recruits and preparing for the battle. Their daughter/sister, meanwhile, is engaged on nightly bombing runs. However, when her male pilot friend gets shot down, she naturally tries to rescue him, resulting in her getting absorbed into a partisan unit with a traitor in its midst. Naturally, by the end, Vega and the Berkos will meet on the field of battle and dance their inevitable dance. Many of the story elements are poorly handled and are utterly lacking in drama or tension, such as the woman's love interest, the subplot about the traitor, and most especially the German officer spy. In contrast, the actual tactical and technical details come across rather well. Robbins does a very clear job of explaining the relative strengths and weaknesses of every tank. Similarly, he does a very good job of recreating the noise, smells, and confusion of simply driving a tank. The battle scenes are very capably handled, and one gets a reasonable impression of what it might have been like. The problem is that none of the characters are compelling or convincing, and therefore it's impossible to care very much about what happens to them.This is military and historical fiction at its most mediocre, it's not awful, just not good. It's the kind of book I might have liked a lot when I was 16 or 17, but seems awfully thin as an adult. To be fair to Robbins, I'm not really sure how you could really make a massive tank battle that compelling to begin with. If one really is really interested in the battle, I'd suggest skipping this and checking out a decent web resource called \\"Battle of Kursk On the Web\\" that has tons of links."},{"Title":"Last Citadel","review":"David Robbins adeptly showed different perspectives of the battle of Kursk that taught and entertained me, especially the descriptions of the daunting Tiger tank versus the Russian T-34. His technical information about war machines and equipment including Russian and German aircraft used in the campaign is educational.A novel written about the largest tank battle in history is a compelling topic, at least for a military history buff like me, and I confess that I expected a clash of armored warfare throughout the story. But tank battles are not what the majority of this book is about.I found the focus of the story too broad. The reader sees the battle from the perspective of the German high command, Russian Partisans, a Russian \\"Night Witch\\" pilot, and tank crews. Perhaps such a wide-ranging overview of the battle could have focused only on frontline combatants; for example, various German tank perspectives besides the Tiger, or German pilot experiences such as Stuka pilots. Seeing the inner workings of Hitler's conferences or how partisans waged war behind the lines were for me a distraction. I gave this book two stars which might be unfair due to my biased expectations, but I wasn't enticed away from those expectations by the story.But based on the comments of a previous reviewer, I would like to read another of his books."},{"Title":"Last Citadel","review":"I applaud the author for this work. It is evocative and exciting. Robbins is writing some of the best WW II fiction in the business. He is a master."},{"Title":"Last Citadel","review":"I would rank &quot;Last Citadel&quot; way behind Robbins' &quot;War of the Rats&quot; and way, way behind &quot;End of War&quot;. Hard to beleive the Russian and German armies had so little to do in the first 100 pages. If you haven't read Robbins before, begin with either one of the other two, and maybe by the time you're done those two, a new fourth book will be available.Wouldn't &quot;End of War&quot; make an excellent Speilberg movie?"},{"Title":"Last Citadel","review":"Great story, but I'm not sure what was going on w/ David Robbins when he wrote this book, it was like he was trying too hard - it seemed like he was making up descriptive words, or using lots of descriptive words that seemed out of place. I did't get that feeling at all when reading War of the Rats.Waited quite a while for the book from the Amazon reseller; it arrived within their 3-week window, but it still took too long in my opinion."},{"Title":"Last Citadel","review":"It is a pity that a narrative of such intrinsic interest as this one is thoroughly ruined by inaccuracies and an extraordinarily poor command of grammar. As readers, especially readers of historical fiction, we must call on authors and publishers to do much, much better.I leave aside the action of &quot;June 31&quot; (is Kursk on some other planet?!?) and a number of missteps Robbins makes (&quot;northwestern,&quot; referring to one of his own maps, not &quot;northeastern&quot;). Some errors will creep through, especially for a book with this much detail, and no doubt a military historian could find more. However, my beef is with the grammar, especially Robbins' use of the comma splice. I am not exaggerating when I state that *each page* of this novel had two or three comma splices on it. I am remarkably forgiving of occasional grammatical lapses, especially in popular fiction. Nor am I a grammatical expert. But this sort of thing is basic to anyone with a high-school education. (That Robbins *teaches* fiction writing at Virginia Commonwealth should give us all pause.) Robbins also has a very wobbly sense of tense (he will use past and present in the same paragraph, *to describe a present-tense action*, and he is lost with the subjunctive).This has the effect of repeatedly wrenching the reader out of an otherwise outstanding story with interesting characters and real narrative drive. I felt as if I were being slammed around the inside of a T-34 trying to evade enemy fire; putting the book down, I felt queasy and shaky.I was very upset by this writer's grammatical incompetence, as it really hurt his work. But what really steamed me was that his publisher apparently did not read the text beforehand to correct it, or decided that the labor involved in cleaning it up (*hundreds* of incorrect sentences) just wasn't worth it. This is a shoddy job all round. Mr. Robbins, I urge and exhort you to hire an assistant--one of your students!--to edit your texts before you publish them. Or learn what a comma splice is and FIX IT. (Also: look into the difference between &quot;all right&quot; and 'alright.') Publisher, remember your cultural and ethical obligations, 'kay?"},{"Title":"Last Citadel","review":"After reading and enjoying the author's earlier novel, &quot;War of the Rats&quot;, I looked forward with much anticipation to this novel. The bottom line - I was sorely dissappointed!For all of the reasons why the &quot;War of the Rats&quot; was a good novel, this lastest effort fell short. Although the historical scope or event of this novel - Citadel (Kursk) Operation - was similar in size to Stalingrad, this story never seemed to find it's proper context against the big picture. Unlike the &quot;War of the Rats&quot;, where the story-telling of 'common' characters caught up in the big event seemed plausible and provided a compelling microcosm, these new characters and their stories failed to suspend disbelief and illuminate. Further, lacking their proper context and integration, the poor development of these character's failed to provide an adequate substitute. This reader could never really begin to care about any of the main characters, hero or villain. Last, the structure of the novel and subsequent writing seemed disjointed, and nowhere close to the tightly woven story of the earlier novel.My best recommendation for interested readers of the genre, time period, or this historical event, would be to wait for the paperback edition. This might soften the potential for a poor return on your investment."},{"Title":"Last Citadel","review":"I read this book as I liked Robbins' \\"War of the Rats\\". I should have left well enough alone. I really don't want to critiqe this book as it would be a waste of my time. Let's just say this: I guess the Germans are made out to be the antagonists. The two main German characters are a joke- one, a Waffen SS intelligence officer, is a traitor. The other isn't even German, but a sickly, Spanish Waffen SS armour officer who for some odd reason is in command of German troops. The third German is a minor character- a fat, loathsome Army officer who warms up to the Spaniard. And where did I see the Russian characters before..? Let's see.. a pretty Russian fighter (this time an aviator, not a sniper), and her heroic boyfriend (again, an aviator, not a sniper). Oh, yeah, they were in \\"The War of the Rats\\". Plus, there is a Russian tank crew consisting of a grizzled old private (the driver) and his communist son (the lieutenant), who just don't see eye to eye. Uggh. It is really hard to care about the narrative when the story basically bounces between these three groups of uninteresting caricatures of real soldiers. Don't waste your time, bypass this book."},{"Title":"Last Citadel","review":"This book, \\"Last Citadel\\" written by David L. Robbins and published by Random House/Bantam Books, who must share responsibility, manages to make the greatest, in size and importance, land battle in history shallow and trivial. I generally don't write negative reviews, but the unwary buyer needs some warning about this piece of trash. Given that I don't think Stalinist communists are morally better then Hitlerite Socialists, I just don't buy the premise that the battle around the Kursk salient was won by simple, but thoughtful peasants led by serious, but thoughtful communists, nor lost by fanatical, physiologically flawed, but ideologically driven National Socialists (aka Nazis).The characters in this novel are two-dimensional cardboard cutouts, what passes for plot is contrived, in the worse sense of the word, and the omniscient narrator, who pops up now and then to tell us what a character might be, or probably is, thinking, is an infernal bore.In addition, the translation of the many German words Robbins tosses in for atmosphere are too often wrong. I can only presume that his Russian isn't any better.As a matter of fact, his English isn't that good; for example, what does it mean to 'cue' an engine? I can guess he means 'start' or 'increase rpm,' but who knows for sure, except it isn't standard English usage.If you have any interest in the fighting around Kursk in 1943, which is one hell of a story, you would do better, saving time and money, learning more, just to read the Wikipedia entry, and just skip the crap about sexy Russian girl bomber pilots and trick riders.But then, how accurate do you expect 'historical' fiction to be?Want good writing about the Russian Front and the German soldier? Try \\"Cross of Iron.\\""},{"Title":"Last Citadel","review":"This book gives a pretty good overview of the battle of Kursk, which was pretty much the point where Germany lost the ability to end World War II in anything but defeat, but the characters are straight out of a soap opera... a Russian father-son duo in a tank, one a diehard communist, the other an old-school cossack; the aforementioned father's daughter, a bomber pilot who goes on an action-movie campaign with partisans behind German lines; a high-level Wehrmacht officer passing information to the USSR in the hopes of saving Germany from itself; and a Spanish Waffen-SS officer who, despite being one the most interesting characters, loses all semblance of subtle character development midway through and becomes a physical manifestation of Nazi evil. Excellent descriptions of tank battles, though, and it gives a very good impression of just how huge Eastern Front battles were, and how many men it took to stop the Nazis."},{"Title":"Last Citadel","review":"This book is well charactered in its historical fiction. The depth of characters makes the reader desire to see the plot unfold. A super WWII novel which I have read before, but descovered I didn't have in my library. A worthy read for any student of WWII, or any person who enjoys adventure."},{"Title":"Last Citadel","review":"Last Ciadel by David L. Robbins......WOW!! After reading Assassins Gallery I thought the word imagery, pace and tone of how Robbins puts a story to paper could not be any better...I was wrong. If the importance of key historical events is important to you and being involved with characters who are very much alive, passionate and just plain down to earth real, then reading a novel by David L. Robbins will grab you, and grab you firmly. His stories, whether in Assassins Gallery, which revolves around a lady who has been trained by a nation to kill FDR toward the end of WWII, or Last Citadel, which involves the central Battle of Kursk in Russia 1943, Hitlers last gasp to retake the offensive in the East and the War, you will be introduced to characters who are richly compelling, direct in their language and thought, human, and never simple. From Dimitri, the tank driver of a T-34 Tank of amazing skill and humanity, to his daughter Katya, strong, smart, sexy and resilient, to Luis, \\"La Daga,\\" the SS Officer of Spanish nationality, you get a richly colored canvas of people to love and hate, despise. Does not get any better than that!! Now, I have picked up The Betrayal Game, the sequel to Assassins Gallery. A sequel in that it revolves around the complex circumstances and world shaking issues of Fidel Castro's Cuba in 1961 and the ongoing attempt(s) to assassinate Castro by those close to him, and those in the CIA, Kennedy, and others who may surprise you. Mikail, the Scottish Scholar of the history of assassinations is once again pulled into the complexities revolving around Cuba at this critical time. I have read just one chapter here and know once again Robbins has captured the realities of the location in Cuba, the events and people with characters who again are vibrant and alive, so very real, and your are drawn in with these people...you are not spectators, you get to participate. Priceless.History and its key events too often get lost in the details transmitted to the public via the Media and Politicians with spin designed to deflect, protect them and blur what happened, blur the truth. Robbins has the unique knack to put YOU THERE to witness what did go on, or most likely did.....again priceless to me as a reader of history, and a reader of our human condition. Read David L. Robbins folks and you will be more enlightened, and obtain a better level of sober and insightful thinking on events that have impacted all of us."},{"Title":"Last Citadel","review":"The Duke of Wellington famously compared writing the history of battle with attempting to write an account of a ball - having seen only a very little part of it personally and being therefore forced to rely on hearsay and rumor. Whether or not David L. Robbins is familiar with the Duke's admonition, he has taken its spirit to heart in this excellent war novel set against the background of the Battle of Kursk, fought in 1943 on the Russian Front where the conflict was known as \\"The Great Patriotic War\\". He surmounts this hurdle by not trying to retell the whole story of the battle but instead recounting how a handful of characters experience this greatest tank battle ever fought and through their eyes successfully conveys the scale and the sense of the battle, its progress, and its outcome.The author's choices for his key characters will, I suspect, be considered rather unorthodox by many readers though they resonated with me for several reasons. His principal Russian characters are the father, son, and daughter of a Don Cossack family in which the wife/mother died in the Ukrainian famine engineered by Stalin for political reasons. They represent two members of the crew of a Soviet T-34 tank and a pilot of the Soviet \\"Night Witches\\" - women pilots flying light biplanes as night bombers who became infamous and famous depending upon whether you were a German or a Soviet soldier. His characters on the German side include a Spanish officer formerly of the Spanish \\"volunteer\\" Blue Division sent to Russia by Franco, and several German officers including one actually spying for the Soviets. I grew up reading about Stenka Razin and the Cossacks, and in more recent years have extensively read about the Civil War in Spain when German aid would later lead to Franco sending his soldiers to fight in Russia in lieu of Spain entering actively into the war as an ally of Nazi Germany. And finally, both the T-34 and the \\"Night Witches\\" are an integral part of the legend of the Soviet war against Nazi Germany.Their respective roles and experiences enable Robbins to roam widely across the theatre of war and present a comprehensive overview of the war in Russia before, during, and in the wake of the Battle of Kursk. The images conjured up by the author's accounts of battles between tanks, aircraft, partisans, and men and women are well rooted in each character's own story as well as in the history of the battle. Collectively, they are woven expertly together to leave the reader with both an emotional and intellectual understanding of the Eastern Front war and its climactic moment at Kursk."},{"Title":"Last Citadel","review":"The Last Citadel is fast-paced military fiction with its soul in the stars. The author gets the details right, but does not obsess over the grade of lead in the bullets, or the chemical composition of the propellants. Instead, he takes the swirling Battle of Kursk, millions of men and thousands of machines, and pulls it into focus as the ancient tale of a single man facing an immortal monster.Leathery old Dimitri is armored with little more than his Kazak honor, and his T-34 seems like cardboard against Hitler's latest superweapon, the massive Tiger tank. This is classic stuff disguised as hot-running fiction. Author David L. Robbins is not out to take Tom Clancy's lunch, he's trying to catch Hemingway and Steinbeck. The Battle of Hill 260.8 will make you stand up and cheer, and the Award of the Order of Buttons is a most perfect recognition of battle honors. These two scenes combine into one of the most powerful passages ever written, in any language."},{"Title":"Last Citadel","review":"Before this book, I had given up on military adventure novels. Granted, they can be exciting when things go &quot;BOOM!&quot;, but to get to that you gotta wades through chapters upon chapters of bland dialogue, blander characters, hackneyed prose and jingoistic posturings.Last Citadel is welcome discovery for me. It features nuanced and interesting characters from both sides, well-written scenes of the tense preludes to battle, followed by visceral and breathless scenes of unimaginable violence.Robbins successfully evoked the epic scope of the Battle of Kursk, while also let the readers experiences the titanic battles in the cramped and smoke-filled interior of tanks. The books is meticulously researched, from the technical specs of tanks to the lives of the soldiers. These details are incorporated in a mostly unobstrusive way that enrich our understanding of what it is like to be Russian/German soldiers shut in the belly of steel beast trying to kill or be killed in a battlefield of millions. This is a book written by a WWII buff for WWII buffs."},{"Title":"Last Citadel","review":"This is David Robbins third World War II novel. He started out good and just gets better. I found myself staying up later than I intended just to find out what was happening next. He does a very good job of giving you an overview of the entire battle while including a personal level with characters on both sides. His characters are realistic, too. They all have some problems while believing in their own causes. Nor can they be simplistically divided into good and bad, each being a mix of both. The result is that they are believable and interesting.If you enjoy WWII or action novels you should like this. If you read the reviewer who complains of David's writing I have to say I disagree. I have the paperback and if there are 'comma splices' they did not bother me (and I have written 3 college textbooks for a major publisher). I even went back to look for a reference to 'June 31' and did not find it. The author uses chronological headers and subheads and in my copy they progress fron June 30 to July 1 (in fact there are several July 1 subheads with different hours of that day), so if June 31 is in the book it is probably a typo rather than a mistake by the author."},{"Title":"Last Citadel","review":"This is a thrilling adventure book, you can feel yourself riding in the Tiger tank at the tip of Hitler's last offensive in Russia, battling hordes of soviet T34s thrown in your way. You can also experience the soviet side in the eyes of the Berko family, a Cossak clan that true to tradition goes to war as a family. Meet Dmitry and Vasily a father and son battling themselves and the germans in the inside of their T 34 tank, growing apart and then coming together in a climactic battle against a behemont tiger tank. Also Nadia, Dmitry's daughter in her improbable air battles with the nightwitch squadron and as a partisan in search of her beloved fighter pilot shot behind german lines. The german characters are interesting starting with Luis, the Spanish matador in command of a Tiger Tank in Hitler's bodyguard (very improbable but a nice literary touch) as a man seraching for redemption and Breit the SS Colonel turned soviet spy in a moral crisis. It was fun and fast reading and I have been expecting for a novel in the subject of the Greatest Battle ever fought as was Kursk. To complement your knowledge in this subject I also recommend Glantz's Battle of Kursk book for the historic background of this novel. For WW II buffs and armchair generals this is going to be a very pleasant experience."},{"Title":"Last Citadel","review":"I loved the book. The writing is captivating and the plot isn't formulaic. A lot of the technical and historic details were not correct however (and I'm allowing for fictional characters of course). The russian tank forces were much more varied than just a horde of t-34's, for example. Half way through the book, the author gets mixed up and starts referring to the t-34's cannon as a 75mm one. Turrets with 2 separate hatches were in production by 1943, and so on. However, unless you're extremely picky or are reading the book just for the technical detail, this is still a great piece of writing."},{"Title":"Last Citadel","review":"In a previous historical novel, THE WAR OF THE RATS, author David Robbins took us to the 1942 siege of Stalingrad on World War Two's Eastern Front, one usually paid scant attention by American readers who perhaps believe that U.S. won the European war single-handed. It didn't, you know. Now, in LAST CITADEL, Robbins returns to the Eastern Front for history's greatest tank battle.It's July 1943, and Hitler throws one last roll of the dice against the USSR with a major armored offensive designed to capture the city of Kursk. America is about to invade Italy, and Germany must knock the Soviets out of the war, or at least stabilize that front, before having to withdraw some of its forces from the East to reinforce the Mediterranean theater.Whereas in THE WAR OF THE RATS, the confrontation in Stalingrad's rubble was between two master snipers, one German and one Russian, the LAST CITADEL evolves into the ultimate confrontation in a field of sunflowers between two tank crews, one German in the awesome Tiger tank and one Russian in the smaller but faster T-34.The Tiger is commanded by SS Captain Luis Ruiz de Vega of the 1st SS Panzergrenadiers, one of three SS armored divisions spearheading the German assault. De Vega originally came to fight for the Nazis with the Spanish Blue Division, lent to Hitler by Franco in 1941. Having lost half his stomach to a Russian sniper during the siege of Leningrad, de Vega was rewarded with a commission in the SS. Now, bitter, constantly hungry, increasingly emaciated, and emotionally dead, Luis dreams only of returning to Spain a war hero.The T-34 is commanded by Sgt. Valentin Berko, but its soul is its driver, Cpl. Dimitri Berko, Valentin's father. Dimitri is an old Cossack who's fought against the Czar, Trotsky's Red Army, and now the Germans. The elder Berko loves his son dearly, but is disgusted with the latter's unquestioning dedication to Communism. But the two together make a formidable fighting team.In THE WAR OF THE RATS, a five-star novel, subplots added to the overall storyline, especially as military sniping involves a lot of waiting for the perfect shot. In contrast, several subplots in LAST CITADEL only serve as unnecessary distractions. Dimitri's daughter, Katya, is a bomber pilot attached to the Night Witches, who fly biplanes so slow and flimsy that they can only operate at night. Her boyfriend, Leonid, also a pilot, but in a modern squadron, is shot down. Attempting a landing behind enemy lines to rescue him, Katya crashes, and subsequently falls in with a group of Russian partisans, which has an unidentified traitor in its midst. In the meantime, SS Colonel Abram Breit, is spying for the Soviet's Lucy network.Had Robbins focused entirely on the tank engagements of the Kursk battle, his book, in my opinion, would have been leaner, meaner, and better. In any case, his description of going to war in the Tiger and T-34 makes for an absorbing and informative read."},{"Title":"Last Citadel","review":"This is great read, a fun way to soak up meticulously researched history and to live with some very compelling characters. Robbins knows his stuff and he delivers the story with style."},{"Title":"Last Citadel","review":"Great book , Can,t put it down . Lots of historical info. Worth the money.Came to me in excellent condition.I plan on reading more of Mr. Robbins books."},{"Title":"Last Citadel","review":"I initially bought this book because my uncle, who is a true Marxist, once lived in Russia for a while near Kursk, and heard all about this famous battle from those whom he lived among. I wanted to read about this battle, and I definitely got my money's worth. Robbins really knows how to write a whiz-bang novel! The characters are very well-developed, and the plot is very exciting, with lots of action and good twists to keep the reader engaged.The one drawback to the novel is that some of the characters seem a bit improbable, such as a Spaniard fighting with the SS in Russia...a father and son both fighting in the same T-34 tank. Still, given the author's excellent job of developing each of these characters, I was willing to overlook these drawbacks with a suspension of belief, and thoroughly enjoyed the novel.I definitely recommend this book to military history buffs, and to those who enjoy good action stories."},{"Title":"Last Citadel","review":"As a WWII buff, I was looking for novels about tanks and tank crews. Most WWII novels and biographies are from infantry soldiers. The few novels or biographies about tankers were either from a commander or general perspective and very little about life in a tank or actual tank combat. Although this novel is historically based fiction, I enjoyed the details about the inner workings of the tanks, how the crew members had to interact and how brutal tank combat was. The fact that the T-34 was so simple and robust contrasts well with the elaborate and complicated monster that was the Pzkw VI, Tiger. It was great how the author blended indivdual crew experiences with the battle tactics and strategies of the different forces. Germany stressed superior skill and technological advanced equipment over Russia's masses and simple designs. The back story about the 'night witches' and the 'lucy' network of spies was a good way to tie in the overall situation facing Germany and Russia at the time. The disctraction of Hitler with the looming American landings in Italy and the Russian partisans impact on the war show just how complex the situation was at the time. In the end, the Kursk battle of small groups of Tiger tanks facing hordes of Russian T-34s that charged suicide like into the line of the 88mm guns so fast that the turrets couldn't traverse fast enough was a real page turner for me."},{"Title":"Last Citadel","review":"I especially enjoyed the detailed tank history and it made seeing them on TV or even on a xbox game more realistic and meaningful."},{"Title":"Last Citadel","review":"I read this book about a year ago now & liked it enough to lend it to a friend to read. Although it hasn't gotBernard Cornwell's skills with a historical narrative or the thrilling pace ofConn Iggulden, I still found it had the ability to surprise with its dramatic action (even if it did seem at times like an instruction manual/ teaching aid for writing historical fiction, rather than an actual novel.)Many have pointed to the wooden charactors & the fact that the German's are all 2 dimensional & evil, whereas the Russians are almost always heroic & good. To be fair, this is very true of the evil SS tank commander (Luis Ruiz de Vega) & generally for the Russians, but most of the other charactors have a little more personality to them & are more believable.(As an example, the tank driver Dimitri Berko is slightly eccentric & there is also a double agent in the form of Colonel Abram Breit, who makes the story a little less Black & White & provides an interesting ending to the book).I'd also chip in that Robbins does have some of Cornwell/ Iggulden's abilities with dramatic battle scenes, such as chapter's 7 & 21 when our heroes take on the German's blitzkrieg thrusts & there are also scenes from the German perspective showing how easily crushed most the Russian efforts were and how regrettably superior German armour was.And last thing to say is about the final battle sequence, which I found one of the most memorable of ALL the ones I've encountered in the Historic novels I've read.Anyone with a passing knowledge of Kursk will know that the German's did actually breakthrough the elaborate Russian defences, only to have an entire tank army thrown at them. This particular scene is depicted in a field of sunflowers &, although you might know what is going to happen, the narrative is a masterpiece of its kind, showing the calm before, the chaos in between & finishing with a suitably dramatic sequence.It was the moment in the novel that it ceased to be a lesson in novel writing (David Robbins lectures on the subject) & became a first-rate novel.Now, as the novel is a little predictable & does have some flaws, I can't say it's a masterpiece. However, as it covers the biggest tank battle in history (which is oddly overlooked in the Western world) and is also fairly well-written, I have no hesitation in recommending it as worthwhile reading.It should always be remembered that, as The World At War shows, the Germans were humbled not just by Britain & the USA, but mostly by the bravery & tenacity of the Russians (Britain & the USA lost less than a million people, while the Russians lost at least 20 million).Though this tribute may not be perfect, it is tribute nonetheless."},{"Title":"Last Citadel","review":"Robbins has an interesting writing style where he keeps up a character's internal dialog even through the well written, riveting and \\"choreographed\\" action sequences. He alternates points of view among four different characters, who are all quite interesting. They range from the extremely sympathetic to the deeply flawed, and change as the novel progresses. I ended up really caring what was going to happen to them. I also enjoyed learning about the battle's strategy, tactics and technologies.As a guy who was in high school in the late 1950s and early 1960s, I find it very interesting to learn about the Eastern Front in WWII. Back in those Cold War days with the US government not wanting to say much about Russia, and the USSR being so secretive and paranoid, we barely learned they were on our side in that conflict.This is my second book by Robbins, and I think I'm going to go for his entire oeuvre."},{"Title":"Last Citadel","review":"I really enjoyed reading Last Citadel. It's pretty fast-paced with really no boring parts. I'm no military-history expert so I cannot say if all details are accurate or not, but it sure seems so when you read it. The story centers around four characters, a Soviet tank driver and his pilot daughter, a Spanish officer serving in the German SS, and a german intelligence officer. The story is cleverly weaved around them, and at the end it all comes together. Although I enjoy reading military history books, this was the first time I've really come across the Kursk battle, and it was a really enjoyable experience (as horrible as the battle was...)."},{"Title":"Last Citadel","review":"It was a little hard to consider reading about Nazis and Communists. Who (if you are an American) do you root for? I recently heard David L. Robbins discuss his newest book, 'Broken Jewel' but he had mentioned this earlier book 'Last Citadel'. His enthusiasm about the relationship between the Cossack father tank driver and Communist son tank commander intrigued me as a unique concept in war fiction.Some earlier reviews of this book claimed historical inaccuracy or boring writing. I believe they missed the point of the book. The strength of the book is in showing people living through a horrific and generally little-known battle (for the West, that is). Robbins weaves the stories of a father, a son, a daughter, a Spanish SS tank commander, a spying SS Colonel, Russian partisans and collaborators in a way that lays out the battle and ingeniously connects all the stories in the end. No one is completely 'good' or 'bad'. The motivations of each character make them interesting.The climaxing confrontation between the two tanks resembles a fight between a bull and a matador or bulldog. This isolated episode within the larger battle is made very vivid thanks to the accurate depiction of the confined world of a battle tank.Read this book with an open mind and you will be rewarded with a new perspective of World War II."},{"Title":"Last Citadel","review":"If you are looking for something with buxom blondes and ridiculous heros, then try something else. This is a novel about the Battle of Kursk - the largest tank battle of the second world war and until the first Gulf War, the largest tank battle ever.Mr. Robbins gives us both perspectives (Red Army and Nazi). How the little T-34s were basically rolling coffins and the massive, cumbersom Tigers that dominated the battlefield. What went through their minds as these two armies clashed? This book gives us a glimpse at what it must have been like.If you like military history, then this is a must read."},{"Title":"Berlitz Basic French: The Unique, Simple, and Successful Approach to Language/Book and 3 Cassettes (Berlitz Basic Language Course)","review":"The book was in excellent condition when it was delivered but the cassettes were damaged; they cannot be used for the listening part of the program."},{"Title":"PAULA PECK'S ART OF GOOD COOKING","review":"my mom always used it for her hungarian goulash, and trust me, that recipe alone is worth the price of the book!"},{"Title":"PAULA PECK'S ART OF GOOD COOKING","review":"This is one of the first (of a great many) cookbooks I ever bought (I have the 1970 paperback printing, bought in the mid-70s) and I still pull it out for favorite recipes and occasionally to try a new one.

I consider that the topics themselves don't follow a &quot;grand plan&quot;, they are more like self contained. This makes it less obvious the roadmap.The reason for the 4 stars is because of the music that tends to be too much of it and loud, more like for a movie than for a serious developmental tape.

When I heard his voice again, it was like I was transported back in time and a shiver went through me. With that said, in listening to \\"Lead the Field\\" during my Sabbatical there are still all the great ideas, but I think they are now packaged a bit archaically. The unspoken and unexamined notion that comes across to me is that a high title or high income is an obvious indicator of success and is what we all should strive for. It is pretty clear in this day and age that title and income may be captured by the successful but too many of these folks striving to be in the top 5% do so without a sufficient counter balance of integrity. With that said, one addition I would make to this work is that no amount of success is worth surrendering your honesty and integrity and the notion that while business needs to be profitable if the only reason you are in business is to make a profit you may be setting yourself up for disappointment even if \\"successful\\". The 2nd notion I would add is the emphasis that one can use all these great ideas to achieve any goal in one's life.

After such entries as &quot;Time Frame&quot;, &quot;The Eighties&quot; and &quot;Companions&quot; this book falls flat. I didn't feel there was alot of information given about the monsters and the pictures chosen were less than tantilizing for me to enjoy it as a whole. Whereas his previous books which were filled with gorgeous pictures and tid bits of obscure information that keeps you interested thoughout the whole book. This one however gives me the feeling, &quot;Ho Hum, that was nice.&quot; after I'm through reading it. It seems like this book was published in a hurry just to get another Doctor Who book on the shelves. It seems like every aspect of Doctor Who has been run dry and now they're just grasping for ideas. I certainly hope that this is not the case because it would be a real shame for someone as insightful as David J. Howe to ends a very successful series of books like this."},{"Title":"Doctor Who: A Book of Monsters (Doctor Who (BBC Hardcover))","review":"I agree with the previous reviewer who states that this is the most inferior of the David J. Howe series of reference books. The selection of photos are less than inspiring and much smaller than the ones in the previous books, and provide less visual enjoyment. It's not as easy a read either because the print is finer too. The breakdown of chapters is as follows: The more popular monsters and ones which overlap the classic series decades, such as the Daleks, Cybermen, Sontarans, and Ice Warriors, get their own chapter, while all the other monsters get categorized into three different chapters titled The Sixties, The Seventies, and The Eighties. Howe describes each monster as to the context of their respective stories, interviews creators and actors, and adds his own two-cents worth, a practice he avoids in his other two books.Due to \\"time and space constraints\\", as he puts it not every monster is featured in the main part of the book. He claims to have omitted from the main chapters \\"humanoid\\" type monsters like the Primords from Inferno, but curiously includes the Draconians, the Voords, etc. However, perhaps the saving grace of this book is an index of every monster in the classic series (even the \\"humanoid\\" ones) and characters you normally would not think of as monsters. The index is why I bumped this up to 4 stars. Without it, the book would be a 3 star effort. It includes a small picture of the monster in question with a brief description of the story in which it appears. Leafing through it, it seems like this index encompasses all the relevant monsters of the series. At least Howe was able to include everyone this way."},{"Title":"The Duties of Parents: \\"Train up a Child in the Way He Should Go\\"","review":"This book not only gives you helpful advice on how to raise your children, but it also helps expose where we may become lazy as parents.

You can get that from a Time Life or Readers Digest 'Home improvement' book on basic carpentry skills. Very general instructions without a lot of detail- for example, window fininshing details, roof details- you have to figure out the details yourself, and everyone knows that is where the devil is! And when the chapter on electrical wiring starts out by reccomending that you shouldn't do it yourself, well... it's just a sign of too many lawyers in the USA.The sections on barns and other strucuture are interesting, with lots of ideas that one can adapt to your specific needs. Most are reworked from USDA Cooperative extension plans- which you can view a huge number for free from Univ of North Dakota at this link-http://www.ag.ndsu.nodak.edu/abeng/plans/index.htmSince I found this website, my opinion of the book has gone down a lot, since so much is not original material.The other challenge I would have is on pole frame constuction- all his plans show huge concerte footings 16-24\\" dia 8-12\\" thick under poles for his buildings. Digging/drilling and pouring these negates the advanage in work/cost saving of pole frame building. In the area where I live, poles are commonly set in our heavy clay with a little cement or just well tamped soil around them. I understand the concern about bearing ability, and I'm not an engineer, but these poles function as pilings- they hold up the load not just from their bottom surface area, but also from the friction of the post in the ground.

Here, Bourdain has the sense to focus almost exclusively on the landscape, the flavors, his hosts and his (extraordinarily wide ranging) reactions and leave the \\"inside\\" commentary to extended postscripts at the end of certain stories. And when Bourdain does mention his \\"shooter\\" or producer in the body of a given chapter, it's woven more appropriately into the narrative than on cable.Bourdain is one interesting fellow, a real scamp; and he can write, too. His love affair with the Vietnamese people and their cuisine jumps off the page at you, his reverence for the French Laundry almost requires you to light votive candles, and his graphic explanation of preparing a farmhouse meal in Portugal may make you turn vegan. He can also elicit a solid series of belly laughs when the situation demands; his description of writhing intestinal misery as he grapples for the remote to nix a televised homage to Jerry Lewis during a return to France had me howling.The best way to savor this one-of-a-kind culinary globetrotter is to watch the show, pick up the rascal's collection of grimaces, smirks, cigarette drags, loping marches down alleyways and \\"I'm almost high\\" style of voiceover, then turn off the set and start reading. Because his books - if \\"A Cook's Tour\\" is any indication - are better than his broadcasts."},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":"Reading this book on my daily commute certainly stirred up an appetite by the time I reached my destination!The colourful speech and frank tone of Kitchen Confidential is also present in this book, and still very entertaining. However, I found the book more like a collection of short stories than one continuous piece, as it jumped from country to country, and sometimes back to a previous country.There's some discussion of the culture that surrounds the food, but it certainly doesn't have the detail that he provided about professional cooking.My favourite aspect to this book is the flair and passion for describing food, done so well with imaginative descriptions that I feel like I can almost taste it. If restaurant menus were all written with such expertise, I'd by hypnotized into always eating out!"},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":"As a fan of Bourdain's current television show (No Reservations), I was already predisposed to enjoy this book. But I am happy to say that I was not disappointed.Bourdain's writing is wonderful- conversational in tone, but still informative, educated but earthy, ribald but still respectful. He eats, drinks, and smokes his way across the globe, TV crew in tow, and lives to tell the tales.If you long to have an international adventure of your own, or already have one or two under your belt, his stories of bliss and terror (often to be found side-by-side) are sure to excite the imagination, and prompt a nod of recognition among those who have shared similar experiences.As other reviewers have noted, this is almost two books- one is a spicy masala of travel experiences, the other a long-form love letter to Vietnam. In an apparent attempt to avoid the impression of having written two-books-in-one, he has broken up his Vietnam experiences into several parts, spread throughout the book.But the result is that Bourdain appears to us as a man obsessed with his new love- no matter where else in the world he has last discussed, whatever horror or pleasure he has just recounted, he can't keep from going back to Vietnam. The food, the people, the overall atmosphere - a stark contrast(and odd union)between a controlled, communist society, and the laissez faire energy of the street. He clearly loves it, and cannot stop talking about it. He has gone to the supposed heart of darkness and has found it much to his liking.But what if it is two books? I find that I like them both. Plus, Bourdain's enthusiasm is infectious - I love Bourdain's Vietnam too. It sounds like a great place. Pho, anyone?Please note that this book does feature the slaughter of many innocent (but delicious) animals, excessive use of drugs and alcohol, and deplorable acts of gluttony. But if you are a fan of Mr. Bourdain, you already knew that. It's not for the faint of heart- but for the rest of us, this is an enjoyable read. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":"Anthony Bourdain is best known for his groundbreaking book \\"Kitchen Confidential,\\" which details his career as a chef and disclosed that the people creating our fine dining experiences in the world's best restaurants are often \\"wacked-out moral degenerates, dope fiends, refugees, a thuggish assortment of drunks, sneak thieves, sluts, and psychopaths.\\" He often ridicules Food Network personalities, yet in the end, his success and notoriety led to his very own show on the same network. \\"A Cook's Tour\\" launched his television career and gave birth to his book \\"A Cook's Tour: Global Adventures in Extreme Cuisines.\\"In A Cook's Tour, Bourdain sets out to find the \\"perfect meal\\" (or more realistically, a series of really great meals), not based on opulence and cutting-edge, fashionable restaurants, but rather an ideal balance of great food, atmosphere and people. His search leads him to the Moroccan desert for \\"crispy, Veiny\\" lamb testicles; saunas and smoked fish in Russia; kaiseki rituals in Japan; French Laundry in California's Napa Valley, and a lengthy series of adventures in Vietnam.In much of his work, Bourdain make a point of explaining how other cultures have learned to make use of every part of the animal, once because of limited resources, but now because they've perfected the art, and made ears, feet and entrails into truly great meals.Bourdain's humor is irreverent and he pulls no punches, telling us exactly what he thinks about where he is, what he's doing, and what he's eating, even if it's not very flattering. Unlike other travel personalities, he doesn't sugar-coat his reviews for the sake of political correctness.The Food network series aired 35 episodes, 10 of which were filmed in Asia (Vietnam, Japan, Cambodia, Singapore and Thailand). His book however, narrows down the focus and gives us a look at where his heart truly abides. Five of the book's 17 chapters (including the intro) are set in Vietnam. A Cook's Tour essentially details Anthony's love affair with Vietnam, mingled with other adventures around the globe (other chapters cover Portugal, France, Spain, Russia, Morocco, England, Scotland, Mexico, California, Cambodia and Japan) while filming his show for the Food Network. \\"I'm in love\\" he writes about Vietnam. \\"I am absolutely over-the top gonzo for this country and everything in it. I want to stay forever.\\"In Saigon, Anthony explores the food offerings of Ben Thanh Market (including hot vin lon, or hard-boiled duck embryos) in-between vivid nightmares induced by anti-malaria medication. In Can Tho on the MeKong Tony drinks rice wine with decorated war vets who would have once considered him the enemy. Later he recounts with heart-pounding fervor, the experience of riding down Highway 1, known for its frequent bloody accidents. Then there is island hopping and fresh seafood dinner in Nha Trang, only to be followed by a revolting meal of bird's nest soup on an already bloated stomach. Of all of Anthony's culinary experiences in Vietnam, his most talked about (and most replayed on YouTube), is drinking the beating heart of a cobra in rice wine.As interesting as Anthony's food adventures are, the characters in his book are equally memorable. Madame Dai was a lawyer and senator under South Vietnam's former government, who managed to thrive under the new regime by running a small, unadvertised restaurant in the library of her home, called \\"Bibliotheque.\\" She is a colorful character who keeps Anthony and his government-appointed guide, Linh, on their toes with her sharp-witted humor and kind-hearted jabs.Madame Ngoc is the owner of Com Nieu Saigon, a restaurant famous for its crispy rice cooked in a clay pot, which is smashed in the dining room, and then the rice is thrown across to the waiters at each table, creating a lively spectacle for the guests. Madame Ngoc is a powerful women, commanding respect and obedience from her staff (and even many of her patrons), but her tender-hearted kindness and persistent mothering endear her immediately to Bourdain and his entourage.Anthony fell hard for Vietnam. Writing about Saigon, he states \\"I think I've gone bamboo...I've gone goofy on Vietnam, fallen hopelessly, hopelessly in love with the place.\\" Despite his love for Vietnam, Bourdain apparently hasn't gone through with his plans yet, which may be due to not only his new marriage and baby, but also the success of his show \\"No Reservations,\\" for the Travel Channel. Later episodes (including features on Malaysia, Indonesia, Korea, Japan and once again, Vietnam) and subsequent interviews reveal his more broadened appreciation of the region and less obsession over Vietnam alone.A Cook's Tour is Bourdain's most appropriate entry-level volume for fans of his travel shows, although a book based on his current Travel Channel series, \\"No Reservations\\" will be available October 30, 2007. He has authored numerous other books, including The Nasty Bits, Gone Bamboo, Typhoid Mary: An Urban Historical, The Bobby Gold Stories, and Bone in the Throat. Many are novels and all contain culinary themes."},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":"Fun, fast, light interesting book about a man on a quest, the quest for the perfect meal. The author struggles to give his definition of the perfect meal, a combination of food, company, and atmosphere, all the circumstances that end up creating a memorable meal that can be remembered for years to come. The author feels the perfect meal must be made from the local surroundings, the culture has adopted this food for a reason. Anthony Bourdon (the cook in this case) does not stick with the mundane 4 star restaurants in each locale, but often frequents the markets where the common people are obtaining their food. The book takes the reader from a Portuguese pig roast, a Bedouin lamb roast, a Scottish grouse hunt/meal, to an Asian feast on the banks of the Mekong. The meals all featured exotic foods and drinks, one case being a shot of alcohol with a still pulsating heart of king cobra. A little education is provided about the history and culture of each locale along with the sacrifices made to bring along a TV camera crew, and of course the meal along with some real amusing anecdotes. Incredibly entertaining. I read this book on a whim, I believe this author's writing syle applied to other subjects would enliven any book."},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":"Anthony Bourdain's tour of meals around the world is an homage to food, to meals, and to &quot;the good guys&quot; who prepare those meals. I read the book before I saw the companion series on FoodTV, and they're different enough that I wanted to read the book while I was watching it unfold on TV. His chapter on England is great, particularly his praise of Fergus Henderson, the king of blood and guts cooking, and his takedown of a vegetarian dinner party is worth the price of the book. Given the choice between Kitchen Confidential and A Cook's Tour, I'll take the former, but I'd rather have, and re-read, both."},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":"Listen to this CD in your car and you'll forget all about the traffic you're stuck in. It'll transport you from one exotic locale to another, each accompanied by an even more exotic meal. Bourdain reading his own book is brillant... his accent, his sense of humor, and attitude are the perfect seasonings to this delicious audio book. Buy it, listen to it, and you'll be hooked on all things Bourdain... his fiction, non-fiction, his TV shows..."},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":"This book disappointed me. I'd already read and enjoyed Kitchen Confidential and The Nasty Bits. I thought I would find A Cook's Tour to be a similarly spirited and opinionated trip through Bourdain's brain, this time in the framework of amazing meals from all over the world. It let me down. Don't get me wrong: there are some great moments in this book, but as a whole it didn't work, and actually irritated me.Bourdain wrote this book as the Food Network sent him around the world in search of the \\"perfect meal,\\" or more realistically, to try unusual and sometimes scary (to Western tastes) cuisine. The book felt disjointed and mostly flat, as though Bourdain's heart wasn't in it. And it probably wasn't: he seemed unhappy about being paraded around by a television network, expected to cooperate with the camera crew, and to pursue places and dishes not necessarily on his own \\"to do\\" list.So, while some passages are vivid and enticing, others slog along, a decent but not exciting mixture of food and travel writing. And I really didn't warm up to his hypocritical bashing of other celebrity chefs and complaints about filming, when I knew that he was increasing his own fame and fortune in the process.For the first time, I started to lose patience with and respect for Bourdain. After three books, his grouchy, tough-but-soft persona starts to wear a little thin. Just how real is it? And his biases -- he hates vegetarians, The Grateful Dead, Jamie Oliver, etc., etc. -- start to become grating, since he wastes no opportunity to remind us of them in his every book.It's odd, because as a vegetarian myself, I was never offended before at his rants against herbivores. Whatever. I understand that veg-heads miss out on all this great food and won't eat the cuisine he takes such pride in preparing and enjoying. I get that some vegans are self-righteous and dogmatic and try to impose their dietary practices on others. What went over the top in this book, though, was that Bourdain had a vegan meal -- but the venue he chose was clearly intended to bolster his hatred for all things vegan. He went looking for a disappointing meal and got what he was looking for. He made some nasty insinuations about the psychological problems of people who won't eat meat. And he never mentioned -- and interestingly, never visited -- cultures where vegetarianism is the norm.Somehow, over the course of this book, I went from admiring Bourdain to being irritated by him. I still recommend Kitchen Confidential for sure... it's great stuff... but once you've gone there, and had a taste of The Nasty Bits as well, this one is a big step backwards."},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":"for a number of reasons: not only had I read Kitchen Confidential, but I have several friends among the wait staff at Les Halles in NY, eat there often, and I'm married to a chef.At more than a few junctures in this book, I wished that Tony would stop writing about his genitals. Or genitals in general (although I've had lamb balls prepared Moroccan-style and I agree with him wholeheartedly - they're great!). The juxtaposition of the state of the author's equipment and meal descriptions proved disturbing at best.I agree with one of the other reviewers that the Vietnam experiences should have been placed together rather than spaced throughout the book. There was such an emphasis on the Asian parts of the world tour that other chapters were given shorter shrift. Also, too, Tony's self-described lack of preparation before traveling to a country grated on my nerves - at the very least the TV production company could have loaded him with up with minimal basic background information prior to a trip. I also didn't think his immature reactions to filming were clever inclusions to the book at all - if TV sent him all over the world to basically eat whatever he wanted, I felt it churlish on his part to insist upon biting the hand that was feeding him.Tony's hasty, seat-of-the-pants writing style did not lend itself to each of the meal experiences he wrote about, and at times was distracting. His ability to describe awful food was much more vivid than the descriptions of the truly sublime dishes.As a plus, he has incredible enthusiasm and appreciation for so many different meals and manages (most of the time) to convey his wild admiration to the reader."},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":"First caveat: this is not a search for the perfect meal. Tony admits that such a concept is ludicrous (p. 272). Actually, a delightful search for the elements of such a meal is the subject of WHO IS KILLING THE GREAT CHEFS OF EUROPE? (1978), with George Segal, Jacqueline Bisset, and the great Robert Morley, a tale that is structured far more effectively than A COOK'S TOUR.This tour is reminiscent (beyond homage) of one of Michael Palin's, in which the world's garden spots are bypassed in favor of treks up foetid rivers in uncertain vehicles. Tony gushes over Vietnam, drags us to Cambodia, and skips Italy. He expresses his love of haggis and manages to stomach a still-beating cobra heart, but then joins the throng of obeisant admirers of the French Laundry in Yountville. He blisters his body in an overheated Russian sauna, then jumps into frozen waters. Sorry, Tony; include me out.Of course, none of this matters. The book is not about food; it is about the ethos of food and Tony's reaction to that ethos. That reaction is always interesting. How many people can write a book this uneven and yet consistently sustain the reader's attention? Tony's take on food and the people who create and enjoy it has not changed substantially from KITCHEN CONFIDENTIAL, though A COOK'S TOUR pays more attention to the diner's perspective than that of the cook. For a cinematic representation of the New York kitchen of KITCHEN CONFIDENTIAL, see the excellent film, DINNER RUSH. (And when you make your pilgrimage to the notoriously noisy Les Halles, simply skip lunch, eat an early, quiet dinner, and enjoy. Yes, the wait staff all love Tony and yes, the frites are fabulous.)In short, this is a book for those who can't get enough of Tony and his take on things. Their number is large and growing. That take is more or less libertarian, the point (as was often said in the 60's) where the far right and the far left meet. The result is a point of view that is politically incorrect, gonzo, but also commonsensical. It is a welcome voice in many ways, but Tony--forget the haggis and the still-beating cobra hearts. Take us to Vina del Mar for some pisco sours or to any of the restaurants in Cortona. Let Michael Palin get eaten by bugs. Take us to the Dordogne."},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":"I always love food and the story behind it. Different country different way of preparing food. IT's interesting to find out those stories. Great book to bring while you're traveling."},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":"I am a huge fan of Anthony Bourdain!!! I read this book in about 2 days. Bourdain's down-to-earth description of his life and experiences. His gritty language make it a Bourdain original. Would highly suggest the book to foodies out there."},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":"I love anything Bourdain does and this book does not disappoint! Loved it!!!He has a way with words and he inspires me to travel more and try more things with an open mind."},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":"Anthony Bourdain is a man who knows food. He could certainly out-cook you and me, and quite probably our moms as well. While Bourdain's first book described his coming-up in the restaurant industry (the paying of his dues, so to speak), his second examines what ones DOES once one has \\"made it\\" as a food celebrity.The answer, apparently, is EAT.One of Bourdain's admitted concessions to fame is a show on the Travel Channel called No Reservations. In short, he goes to different countries and lets himself be filmed finding, preparing, and/or eating the local cuisine. As you might imagine, said local cuisine is often on the far side of weird.\\"Oh, Heather,\\" I hear you laugh. \\"I too have eaten some pretty crazy stuff. I once had escargots, ha ha!\\"Um, yeah. Bourdain ate cobra heart. While it was STILL BEATING. He wins.Anyway, the book is partially tales of Filming the Show, including the frustrations inherent in balancing \\"getting good shots\\" with \\"enjoying the damn experience.\\" (Hint: they're pretty much mutually exclusive. I shudder to think what would happen if I weren't allowed to start eating until the producer was satisfied with the footage of entering the restaurant, ordering, etc. It's all I can do some meals to hold out long enough to take a picture for my Facebook.) The book is also partially Bourdain's quest for the perfect meal. I'm not talking the most expensive meal, or even the one with freshest ingredients. In Bourdain's own words, sometimes a dirty water hot dog on the streets of New York is exactly what's needed to soothe the soul.While the betcha-didn't-think-people-ate-THAT-part-of-the-animal sections of the book made me more squeamish than I would have preferred, I really enjoyed the chapters involving trips to restaurants I'll never get to visit. Restaurants in places like Napa, Italy, etc. There's no way this Midwestern girl will ever willingly pay triple digits for a meal, thanks. I'll stick to reading about it. In a book I borrowed from the library. (C'mon: if I won't shell out $20 for the book, you can be sure I'm not going to pay $200 for dinner, no matter how much cobra's on the plate.)The first chapter is about a Portuguese pig-slaying event. If you can make it through and/or enjoy THAT, please read the rest of the book. Even if only so you can reward yourself with Bourdain's next work, The Nasty Bits."},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":"If you like the show you will like the book. His writing is similar to the things he says in the show. If you've seen some episodes of the first few seasons you will even recognize some of the chapters like Vietnam and San Francisco. Great read if you like foodtravel."},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":"So been a new(er) fan of the great Mr. Bourdain I have to say this book that I just found out is baised on his travels while doing his travel show i beleave for the food network. I love all his books he is so true to the travel the country and the food, so far of most that I have read this is my favorite book makes me want to go grab my passport and fly away (with my wife ofcourse)"},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":"Bourdain is funny, caustic, and yet very articulate in this entertaining book that takes travelers around the world. The quality and honesty of his writing is admirable. Although COOK'S TOUR is focused on food experiences, it has loads of cultural and personal insights. I like the show, but this book is actually better. I wish he would do another book like this that covers the whole experience of travel and the unusual experiences with interesting people he meets."},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":"I really enjoyed this book. I like Anthony Bourdain's travel show very much and this book was an excellent continuation of the same theme. I like that he's flawed and witty. I find him to be a very interesting character. I felt like I was traveling in the seat next to him. He gives wonderful descriptions of the places he visits. Loved it, loved it."},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":"Very enjoyable read for any foodie or fan of Anthony Bourdain. You can really see his continuing growth as a writer. What a great voice on the page, easy to recommend!"},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":"Bourdain combines a zest for the outrageous, total honesty and an enormous curiousity about places and their foods.The result is a book that keeps you chuckling (sometimes while shaking your head in disbelief) and simultaneously totally informed about the countries he visits and the culinary adventures he experiences in them."},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":"It's never quite clear whether Bourdain is really after the 'perfect meal' or just expanding his repertoir of local libations. Either way, he sounds like he's having a heck of time eating, drinking, and razing the Food Network crew trailing him. Not every chapter is stellar, nor is there a particularly coherent thread, but the good chapters are bitingly hilarious and will make you want to eat things you didn't know were edible!Two dictums attributed to the father of gonzo fit best: \\"Never let the facts get in the way of reporting the truth;\\" and \\"when the going turns weird, the weird turn pro.\\" Bourdain embodies both as the delinquent chef-turned-author who manages to capture a piece of the soul of eating (and drinking) around the world."},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":"I read this book after watching the show on the Food Channel. I must admit that I greatly enjoyed it. Others have voiced their disgust for his irreverent behavior, but then I ask u, if he doesn't have that kind of attitude, how would he get the guts to eat all that stuff (from lizards to bull testicles to cobra heart). However, he also had plenty of fine dining experience and everything in between. I love the show and the book because he will try anything once. Very exciting!!!"},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":"I enjoyed the book which I bought after reading his better known book KITCHEN CONFIDENTIAL. He certainly can write and knows his subject. He is trying way too hard to always be cool rather than give us insight into his reactions to the various locales and cuisines."},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":"Anthony Bourdain goes on a world tour in search of the \\"perfect meal\\". He goes from the culinary delights of the French Laundry in Napa Valley, California to eating iguana in Mexico (not good).He has a very good self-effacing writing style, even when he is at the French Laundry, having the best restaurant meal of his life he finds it a bitter sweet experience as being a chef himself he could never reach the creativity of the meal in front of him.The experience in Portugal is interesting as he watches the slaughter of a pig and he loves Vietnam.All in all an excellent and entertaining read for food and travel lovers."},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":"Mr. Bourdain takes a tour through different parts of the world, mostly Asia, and lives on food most Westerners wouldn't want to look at. Yet many of the dishes and condiments he describes in loving and precise detail do make sense. Others he swallowed, I am sure, more or less on a dare. He gives us excellent chapters on the places he visits. But mainly it is the food, the hero of this book, that you can almost smell and taste. Some of the well-reasoned asides hit hard on vegetarians, on all the places where you can no longer smoke, and today's pasteurized, sanitized and emasculated mass food production.If you are curious about unusual food, then this low-calory, high-intensity book is for you. Bon appetit."},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":"The subtitle is innacurate, Bourdain says so himself.He's just happliy traveling the globe on someone elses dime, following his taste buds. And we get to quietly tag along.Instead of a food book with travel, this is a travel book with food.

The product came in as expected based on the description. What more can I ask for? Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":"Poor Anthony Bourdain ... the world at his feet and he still isn't happy!!! Though \\"A Cook's Tour\\" does has it's riveting descriptive moments, it frequently lapses into the whining reflections of a guy who (ashamedly) uses the Food Network's dollar in a failed attempt to find personal happiness. Food Network gave Bourdain the opportunity to do things the rest of us only dream of - and he complains about a lot of it. He's so depressed! He wasn't happy at Les Halles, people drive him crazy, his return to his childhood home was a disappointment ... it goes on and on. He drowns himself in alcohol, stupefies himself with hashish, travels to the far corners of the world ... and just can't find the happiness he seeks.I did enjoy reading the sarcastic, witty descriptions of places I'll never see in person. However, Bourdain's disdain for regular folks permeates the book and makes the reading experience almost masochistic. Bourdain is just so darn \\"cool\\" and his contempt for all things ordinary pervades every page. In the end, I think I'd rather travel the world with someone a little less disdainful and depressed."},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":"Given how many review there are of this book, I'll just pipe in to add this is the best travel book I've read. If you're looking for another great read try Bill Bryson's \\"In a Sunburned country\\"."},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":"I'm left feeling jet-lagged, hungover and somewhat as if I got eaten myself after reading this fantastic book. Accompanied by the Food Network series, where more of Anthony's personality comes across, this book delivers what foodies and travel buffs want. Anthony, you are the Steve McQueen of food/travel gurus. For those who don't get it, that's a huge accolade."},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":"A humorous, dark and entertaining read. After becoming obsessed with his travel channel show \\"No Reservations\\" I was drawn to delve deeper into the depths of Mr. Bourdain's twisted brain. I would say that the subtitle of my 2001 edition, \\"in search of the perfect meal\\" is slightly inaccurate. I see that the 2002 edition was renamed \\"Global adventures in extreme cuisines.\\" While that may be more accurate, I would say that the book is more of a personal journey for Tony. The food descriptions are delicious, the stories are shocking and funny (sometimes in a dark way) and the book is terribly hard to put down. I loved it will probably tear through a few more Bourdain books."},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book and Anthony Bourdain's irresistible writing style. Friendly--not flowery or snobby. I guess I'm one of very few who found it much more entertaining than Kitchen Confidential. I liked reading about what went on on the other side of the camera and that some of the feasts and locations were not his choices. I was surprised that a star of a television show was flying coach class to Asia. Could that be true? I do know that the average tourist or even a very wealthy one would never be able to duplicate some of the special attention and exquisite meals he was served--especially in Japan."},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":"This was a great, relaxing read.

But the book is rich in detail, this is my first Bourdain book, and it was a good one to start with."},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":"This guy is a very good writer and a quirky and interesting character. I'm not sure I would like him as a friend, but he is a great read.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":"I can honestly say that this is one of my favorite books that I have read in the past year. Anthony Bourdain is a great writer, and he really takes you on a journey with him as he travels the world searching for \\"the perfect meal\\", and if there even is such a thing. Yes, other reviews have said that Bourdain is \\"a whiner\\" and \\"snarky\\", but that is the beauty of Bourdain's writing style. He tells it as he sees it, if he doesn't like something, he will let you know. There's no sugar coating in his writing, and of all of Bourdain's books, I have to say that this is my absolute favorite. The chapter on Morocco is one of my favorites, as well as the multiple chapters on Vietnam, a place that Bourdain came to adore during his world travels. I would say that I am a discerning book critic, and I love this book. I've read it at least 5 times just to absorb everything, and I think anyone, foodie or not, would love this."},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":"For those that don't have the means or foolhardiness to sample the cuisines of the trouble spots and high expense parts of the world, Anthony's book is a way to go.Anthony is an honest opportunist in the kitchen and on the written page."},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":"I'm grateful to Anthony Bourdain for visiting places I will never go and tasting things I wouldn't dare to try. His descriptions of BAD food experiences are particularly entertaining. Bourdain immerses himself in surroundings ranging from tranquil to horrifying, but the constants are the empathy and respect he has for the host cultures. The exotic, and at times dangerous, locales are not places most of us will ever see, so I'm glad someone is writing great accounts of his adventures there!"},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":"I loved this book. Whenever I travel I like to eat the local food, good or bad. Honestly most everything is great. I loved the fact that the only thing he hated was the hygienic vegan food he ate at some constipated fancy dinner party. I feel the same way.The book was an engaging read and I like the way he didn't shy away from the slaughter that precedes most of his meals. That is what is takes and I'm glad to see somebody is happy to describe it and then readily consume whatever animal has so recently been unceremoniously killed. It is a great book, not for the weak stomached, but great nonetheless.I'd recommend it to almost anybody. As a person who has eaten camels, snakes, porcupines, jellyfish, insect larvae, and virtually every organ found in vertebrates I feel like Mr. Bourdain is a kindred spirit.

The man is the perfect snarky tour guide to various exotic locales all around the world, as fans of his show \\"No Reservations\\" will already know. But in this book, from his precursor show on the Food Network, is just as illuminating, intoxicating, and hilarious as his work on the Travel Channel.\\"A Cook's Tour\\" follows Tony from the coast of France to Cambodia and all points inbetween, with stops in Portugal, Vietnam, and northern California, to name a few. Throughout his adventures, Tony is followed around by a camera crew, whose presence and desire for TV-worthy moments prompts him to make some questionable dining decisions (such as eating a still-beating cobra heart in Vietnam, or consuming the potentially leathal fish that is a delicacy in Japan, though as he points out all prospects of death are eliminated by the chef's dedicated preperation). Bourdain is not your average travel guide, straying off the beaten path to find things your average tourist might never experience (such as a steam bath in the deepest, coldest part of Moscow).Along the way, Tony introduces us to a wide range of people (I believe this might be the first appearence in print of Zamir, Tony's \\"trusted\\" Russian friend who is something of a cult figure with \\"No Reservations\\" fans), always careful to point out that courtesy dictates he try to enjoy the meals, even if they're far from perfect. Entertaining and informative, Bourdain may fall short of his goal of the perfect meal, but he delivers a beautiful and funny book."},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":"I'm not a fan of travel literature, but Anthony Bourdain brings such a different style to travel literature.He knows when to add detail and when to work in personal information.

I had heard about his \\"not as good\\" show on the Food network and I wanted to know everything I could.

It was like reading someone's story about falling in love but this was with a country.

Plan to get hungry!"},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":"I'm a huge Bourdain fan. Kitchen Confidential is one of my favorite books of all time. His initial foray into TV on the Food Network was ok at best. This book reveals some of why that was the case, giving insights into the tv production process here and there.However, what I love about this book is that it has a soul and is revealing and emotional in ways that Food Network probably wasn't interested in. This book is much more akin to what No Reservations has become - a show about exploring food and foreign cultures and being open to learning and experiencing new things in the world.This book is at times moving (the chapter in France - if you've lost a parent, you'll feel the same way) funny and always interesting. A great read, which I've returned to many times over the years."},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":"tony bourdain's stories of extreme cuisine are alternately harrowing and transcendent, visceral and poetic. he travels the world in search of the \\"perfect\\" meal - way, WAY off the beaten path.

This travel/food short story collection - 22 in all - will unlikely change anyone's opinions, but on its own, it provides a fascinating glimpse into a variety of cultures and the attitudes of natives to their food. It also makes the ideal companion to the series he did for the Food Network. The concept is simple: he travels the world searching for the perfect meal and discovers more to the countries than just the food. Each chapter is devoted to a particular country or trip.When he sticks to his topic, the book is a fun, interesting read, for example, when he talks about Japan, he recognizes that much of their food preparation reflects the cultural obsession with quality. He manages to get us into a family home in St. Petersburg and captures the spirit within the darkness of that country. In Mexico, he paints a vivid tableau of a small town feast and how their sense of community informs all their cooking. My favorite chapter is on Vietnam where he shows a real intimacy with the people there and a certain audacity in trying soft-boiled duck embryos and live cobra hearts. Having taken cooking lessons in a number of the countries he visited, I can appreciate his sense of wonder and surprise when he tries something most of the rest of us wouldn't dare touch. Bourdain is most successful when he positions himself as a curious traveler but less so when he feels a need to exhibit how cool he is, offering self-congratulatory quips rather than real insights. Regardless, whether it's deep-fried Mars bars in Glasgow, roasted lamb testicles in Morocco, or a four-star meal at Thomas Keller's French Laundry restaurant in Yountville, California, this book offers Bourdain's adventurous palette in easy, bite-size pieces."},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":"As bad a book as Kitchen Confidential is good. It reads - and to some extent he confesses this in the text - as though it was written in a hurry as a bolt-on to the television series and has been rushed out for Christmas.What made Kitchen Confidential so great a read was that it was clearly written from a position of expertise and contained a lot of truth. A Cook's Tour seems to have been written because he was looking for another project after finishing the endless publicity rounds for his great success. This new book has no depth of information, frequently resorts to cliche and the obvious (eating deep fried Mars Bars in Glasgow, scoffing haggis which has been introduced into the room by a bagpiper) and certainly does little to convey a love of food.Personally I find his expletive scattered writing style a little grating out of the kitchen...this book has a lot more Fu**s than any of his previous works and with far fewer reasons to include them.Altogether, a huge disappointment."},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":"I am in the middle of this and am loving it. Bourdain is crude, audacious, and sometimes lewd, but never fails to entertain and make me laugh when writing about his gustatory travels. Some of his meals are less than appetizing, and this is definitely not a book for the die-hard vegetarian (the slaughter descriptions, cooking, and eating of some animals is a little hard to read). Nonetheless, I am enjoying every culinary adventure.(...)"},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":"The colossal irony of the Food Network series on which this book is based is the heart felt statements in the author's previous book \`Kitchen Confidential' that he will never get his own Food Network series. He goes on in that book to say some rather unflattering things about Emeril Lagasse that seem to be a guarantee that his prediction will come true.Well, Anthony Bourdain got his own Food Network show, and it is, to my lights, the most enjoyable travelogue style show they have ever done. I will warrant the prediction that it will also be the most enjoyable travelogue show they will ever do. I think the original 16 to 18 episodes are even better than the \`second season' episodes he did which were not in this book. In the follow-up episodes, Bourdain (or his handlers) tend to start parodying themselves and make more coy, self-referential statements such as the cute business when Tony is in New Orleans and he gets slugged by matronly women for dissing their favorite son, Emeril.In case you are not familiar with the Bourdain persona, I can quote a local paper's comparison to Emeril as the Food Network's star student, Alton Brown as the class nerd, and Tony Bourdain as the perennial juvenile delinquent. That is not to say Bourdain's view of things is juvenile. It is, in fact, as insightful as any other culinary commentary. The difference between Bourdain and other culinary travelers is that Bourdain is telling us about things from the inside, from the point of view of palate, tongue, nose, ears, and tummy. He is also talking from the inside in that he has been a working cook and chef for his whole life, who has seen just about everything the other culinary journalists have seen and more, including a stint at a childhood in France. The sardonic twist which gives Bourdain's reporting an outlaw flavor just adds to the entertainment value.One of the more successful realizations of this book is the author's interpretation of \`Extreme Cuisines' in the subtitle. This includes all the expected venues such as a boatride up the Southeast Asian River to Cambodia, with more than a few references to \`Apocalypse Now' and trips to Spain, Morocco, Russia, Mexico, Japan, and Scotland. How can you expect an exotic foods show not include haggis. But Bourdain also includes the very tame and very safe venue in Napa Valley called the French Laundry. While this site may be free of iguana meat or eels or lamb testicles, it is not safe for Bourdain's psyche and self-respect. This is the home ground of Thomas Keller, arguably the most distinguished chef in the country.To insulate himself from facing the Olympian cuisine of Keller alone, and to insure that he gets his invite for himself and his camera crew, Bourdain sits down to the meal with three very well-connected colleagues. These three musketeers are Scott Byron, the chef at the New York City restaurant Veritas, Michael Ruhlman, a journalist / chef and co-author of Keller's cookbook, and Eric Rippert, one of the most highly regarded chefs in New York City. As predicted, Bourdain is humbled by the French Laundry tasting menu. As an at best journeyman chef in a somewhat better than average New York bistro, Bourdain ponders his wasted talents when he sees what Keller has done with food. I'm sure Bourdain is crying all the way to the bank with proceeds from his journalistic products.One of Tony's colleagues has said Bourdain is a better writer than he was a chef. I believe it, because his writing is as entertaining as the professional writer Ruhlman, and even a touch more insightful due to his true insider's point of view.Not quite as good as \`Kitchen Confidential' but it does have all the stuff the Food Network could not show on television. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":"or Mr. Bourdain would write faster. Bourdain is not afraid to try anything in the way of victuals; sometimes it's as gross to read about what he's eating as it may have been for him to consume some of these items. And his writing is extremely vivid; I've been to some of the places mentioned in this book and he's captured many details.I've read some recent criticism of Bourdain, but I've enjoyed all of his books. He doesn't pretend to be anyone other than who he is, glorying in all of his faults, addictions (past and present), and making this reader guffaw out loud on many occasions.So when is the TV show scheduled on The Food Network??"},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":"Anthony Bourdain has fallen pray to the same trap as Bobbie Flay and Emeril Lagasse (as he will remind readers of the book throughout in small segments describing the pains he went through to help the TV series), but at least he is honest about it.The premise of this book, and the TV series that it is a companion to, is for Bourdain to travel around the world looking for the perfect meal. His travels take him throughout asia, into Europe, Africa and even parts of the US, as he looks for culinary delight. He describes with admirable detail the food, people, and culture of the places he visits, often with vary favorable comparisons to our own culinary culture. He regrets the US' \\"refridgerator culture\\" and how we have lost track of where our food comes from. Mixed in with the food talk is some other random rantings and ravings, as can be expected from him. The paragraphs on Henry Kissinger, and the comparison of Cambodia to Vietnam are probably the most off topic in the book, but you can tell that he wrote them which a lot of personal feeling.Bourdain is a pretty engaging fellow, and his writing, while not some stellar example of perfect prose, has a very personable feel to it that makes the book quite the pleasant read. What comes out more in the book than the TV series, was that this was his plan to exploit his fame from \\"Kitchen Confidential\\". He knows full well that he has become that which he has professed to despise, but his open and honest acknowledgement of it deserves some respect. It's hard to fault the guy for taking this opportunity when he could, for it's plain that he truly enjoyed touring the world, and most of the food that he found."},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":"Anthony Bourdain admits cheerfully to selling his soul to the devil [television] in order to carry out his childhood James Bond world adventure fantasies. Along the way he experiences joy, fear, awe, and nausea. Those looking for recipes will be disappointed: those looking for hilarious and insightful descriptions of how food is cooked and served around the world will be thrilled. Bourdain never forgets the importance of food culturally; he packs the book with interesting tidbits on how a cuisine is shaped by necessity [what kind of livestock can you raise in an enclosed town?] Many of his experiences, particularly in Mexico and Vietnam, leave the reader with a feeling of loss. Food in the United States frequently consists of a fast food hamburger eaten alone in front of a television set. The &quot;third world&quot; may be poor but they haven't lost the ability to make food a source of shared joy."},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":"I purchased Kitchen Confidential and A Cook's Tour at an airport based on the recommendation of a chef who was cooking in our ski chalet. I read the two books by the time we'd returned home.As I read the reviews here, I'm amazed by some of the negative comments. Bourdain's offensiveness, the \\"shock value\\" of the cuisine and the fact that there are no recipes in the books seem to be common points of issue. One reviewer even recommended the purchasing of Jamie Oliver's books because they have cooking information in them.Bourdain likes to smoke, drink and use some occasional drugs. That is part of the adventure. I was laughing every time he recounted one of these stories. He's offensive, that's why he's funny and the writing is so entertaining. He also made an extraordinary number of friends in these countries (many are thanked in the notes at the end of the book) so he was hardly just trashing every foreigner he came across.As to the \\"shock value\\", sure he ate Cobras heart and other gruesome items that clearly would \\"shock\\". But in most cases he did it because these items were regional delicacies/specialties e.g. beating cobra heart. By and large he discusses \\"normal\\" food and I found this balance extremely interesting. Tales of the seafood, soups and other dishes that he eats in Vietnam comprise the majority of those chapters, not the cobra. Get past the occasional shocking item.I own all of Jamie Oliver's cookbooks and when I want to cook, I use those. When I want to have a bit of a laugh, Jamie Oliver's recipe for home made pasta isn't going to provide the entertainment I'm looking for. Bourdain will.Kitchen Confidential and A Cook's Tour are obviously not designed to be recipe books. If you've bought them for this reason then that's your mistake and not the fault of the writer. What they have done for me, is piqued my interest in cuisine from different regions of the world that I have struggled to appreciate in the past. Now if I want to practice cooking these items I'll get a suitable recipe book.I think the two stories are thoroughly entertaining. I laughed myself all the way back home.I can't wait for the next book."},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":"One of the things that sets Tony Bourdain apart from the (other?) celeb chefs on the food-themed cable networks is that he's about the only one who will come right out and tell us when something doesn't taste good. All the others grin and rave about whatever gets placed in front of them. But Tony isn't afraid to tell us, \\"that's the most disgusting thing I've eaten in my entire life.\\" That's why we love him.Of course, unlike most of the TV chefs, Tony puts himself in positions where he has to eat disgusting things. That's the basic theme of this book, and he carries it off really well. Well beyond the \\"don't eat fish on Mondays\\" and \\"watch out for the hollandaise\\" revelations of \\"Kitchen Confidential,\\" \\"A Cook's Tour\\" isn't just a good book-about-food, it's a very good book in its own right. Tony might not value (or appreciate) the comparison to P.J. O'Rourke's \\"Holidays in Hell,\\" but as writers who can take awful places and experiences and make them downright funny to read about, these two have a lot in common.I noted in my review of \\"Kitchen Confidential\\" that Tony's life was probably a lot more fun to read about than to have lived through (he might not agree with that), and that goes double for this title. Some of what Tony describes here is a little -- or more than a little -- squirm-inducing, while his travelogue of the road to Pailin was downright harrowing. Sensitive readers (as Miss Manners might say) should be aware that there are at least two graphic descriptions of the death of an animal intended for the cookpot -- though as he notes in his excellent section on his dinner with a bunch of vegans, not all killing is \\"murder,\\" and vegetarianism is a luxury of rich societies. People on the edge of survival literally can't afford to pass on the chicken strutting around their yard in order to await the arrival of expensive and out-of-season veggies.Some critics have accused Tony of hypocrisy (or selling out) for having a TV show on the Food Network tied into this book when in the past he's said some fairly nasty things about celebrity TV chefs. But the filming of the TV program actually plays an interesting role in his book -- with Tony somewhat undermining his own program by revealing how often what's shown on screen differs substantially from his actual experience in a given location.The chapter on \\"The Road to Pailin\\" -- a section in which food itself barely plays a role -- especially reveals Tony's chops as a writer. But other chapters, especially those on Southeast Asia, are quite well done too. I really enjoyed reading this, and if Tony chooses to put himself in harm's way again, you can be sure I'll be there to read about it."},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":"I take it all back. Everything I said about Kitchen Confidential I take back. The scrappy edit, the attitude, the skipping over of history, the half-told tales. I take it all back. If the success of that book meant that Anthony Bourdain was allowed to write this book - well, I take it all back.This time around, Tony (he's Tony, like Tony Soprano) is travelling the world looking for the perfect meal. What that entails (or rather, what that entrails) is eating delicacies indigenous to specific locales: he eats a still-beating cobra's heart and drinks snake bile in Vietnam, he devours the intestines of a pig (and the everything else of a pig) in Portugal, he sucks up fish eyes, he eats a whole roasted lamb with the Tuareg (a nomadic desert community) in the Sahara, he dines with Russian gangsters, he even eats vegetarian food (and you know how much Tony hates vegetarians!). But it's more than that: he eats powdered dried king prawns, chopped toro and fresh chives, he eats tiny coronets of salmon tartare, shallot soup with English cucumber sorbet and dill-weed tuile. Your mouth aches. He eats muc huap (which is steamed squid and ginger), ca thut xot ca chu (tuna braised in tomato and cilantro) and mi canh ca (a sweet-and-sour soup of fish, noodles, tomato, onion, cilantro, pineapple and scallion, together with green crabs overstuffed with roe). You are narcotic with hunger.But there is still more. You warm to Tony more this time around. It feels like the pressure is off. He is no longer performing (or at least not in the same way). We're old friends now, almost. What problems there are (he still skips - the book is wildly episodic and anecdotal - one chapter he is here, one chapter he is there - you get no real sense of WHY he goes to the places he does, what decisions are made concerning the passage from A to B) don't seem to matter quite so much because the episodes themselves are just so damn good."},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":"Parts of this book are very funny; some of Bourdain's adventures make you wish you were on the road with him (but using an assumed name to protect yourself afterwards).Unfortunately, the tale of the tour is awkwardly constructed. There are several chapters about his experience in Viet Nam throughout the book. He should have kept them together and made a more coherent view of his point of view. If Bourdain had wanted to use it as a touchstone against which to measure other places, he should have done that more clearly. Instead, his approach comes off as clumsy.Certain portions of the tour are really well described; notably Morocco and the Basque country. Sadly, the discussions of his trip to Cambodia and Mexico are rather ..., even though it's apparent that these were two really exciting places. Too bad he didn't have Hunter Thompson as his editor.While dining on exotic and sometimes disgusting things is the theme of the book, Bourdain tells us only that some meal is \\"the best [insert type of food here.. sushi, taco etc.] ever,\\" or that it was really awful. The descriptions of the bad meals are more skillful than the good ones. Bourdain is never able to tell you why something is good, even though he's a master at letting you what a bad meal tastes like.Bottom line... quite a few laughs; no real point; wait for the paperback."},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":"To enjoy this book, you have to (A) really like food, and (B) accept that the whole exercise of Bourdain tramping around the world in a psuedo-quest for the ultimate food experience is rather artificial (which he admits right up front). So, bearing in mind that he's being trailed by Food Network cameramen, and has producers to prearrange a lot of stuff for him, Bourdain's global hopscotch of culinary exploration is a very readable and fun journey. He's not really looking for the \\"perfect meal\\" so much as looking for the experience that comes with food-from refined dining (there's a chapter on The French Laundry in Napa Valley), to home cooking (massive home-cooked meals in Portugal and Mexico, complete with barnyard slaughter), to street food (several chapters on Cambodia and Vietnam), to ritualized meals (in Japan and Morocco).If you like your travel narratives to have classy guides, this definitely won't be your cup of tea. Bourdain's \\"bad boy\\" chef image is no doubt somewhat calculated and contrived, but he certainly manages to get good and drunk in virtually every chapter, and he's a chain-smoker to boot. Mix in a large number of sketchy gross-out foods (deep-fried Mars Bar, sheep testicles, beating cobra heart, etc.), and you've got a pretty fun little book. As evidenced in his fiction work (Bone in the Throat, Gone Bamboo, The Bobby Gold Stories), he's got excellent timing and can be very, very funny. He can also be very human and poignant, as in the chapter where he and his brother revisit their childhood summer vacation spot in France, and when he talks about his Mexican chefs. Some people have complained that he doesn't describe the food well enough, which I disagree with. Writing about taste is like writing about music, you can only hope to convey a vague impression, and he's really more concerned with the overall experience anyway. I defy anyone's mouth not to water while reading the Vietnam chapters.Which is not to say to the book is perfect. I actually found his veering into the recent political histories of Vietnam and Cambodia to be rather clumsy but worthwhile. On the other hand, his anti-vegetarian screeching is just plain annoying and off-putting (I am not a vegetarian by the way). He treats all vegetarians as proselytizing, animal-lovers who want to ban any animal death-a portrayal wholly inaccurate of the many vegetarians I've known over the years. First of all, I've never met a proselytizing vegetarian, and second of all, most people I know are vegetarian, are that way for health reasons, not political ones. It's an even more irksome perspective in that he makes a big fuss over how upsetting it is to actual witness a pig/lamb/turkey getting killed for your dinner. It's as if he felt he had to put something feisty or controversial or nasty in there, just to keep his persona going, and it does nothing for the book.The vegetarian thing aside, I would wholeheartedly recommend this book to anyone interested in food (and who isn't?) or other cultures. The chapters work pretty well on their own, and are the perfect length for devouring one a night before bed, although they'll likely drive you to the kitchen for a midnight snack!"},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":"I can't figure what holds me back about his book. I love Anthony Bourdain's attitude about food and his philosophy about what makes a great meal. I love his desire for absolutely fresh food, right off the bleeding stick or never touching a refrigerator, and I admire the distinctions he makes about how food looks and how it tastes--my wife is one who cannot get over the appearance of food and lets it affect her enjoyment of it, while I don't care how food looks, but simply want good-tasting stuff. I love Bourdain's sense of experimentalism, his willingness to try live cobra heart, and his sense of adventure, how he searches out a fugu chef (who knows how to properly prepare poisonous blowfish), and my wife is now relieved that I take Bourdain at his word that the stuff doesn't really have much flavor and wasn't quite worth all the excitement.The concept of this book is fantastic--Anthony Bourdain travels to Vietnam, Japan, Cambodia, Portugal, Russia and other fine spots for the adventure of eating. And we're not just talking about the food itself--Bourdain wants the whole experience of food, from the killing of the livestock to the last shot of vodka before heading out into the night. He understands that food comes from a place and people, and he wants to know both as intimately as he can to get a true sense of what the food is about. It is a brilliant gesture in a category of writing that I find all too sterile, a style of writing often taken over by self-professed food gurus sitting in palaces removed from the real cooks and snubbing their noses at true cuisine while only praising what is served in delicate portions in a fine atmosphere. That Bourdain continually bashes Food Network stars is wonderfully brilliant and it makes me trust the man implicitely--were he to serve me brains wrapped in pig cheek and smothered with mayonnaise, I would gladly eat it if he told me it would be some good stuff.But for whatever reason, I found this book as a whole not so engaging to read, and I can only attribute that to the writing itself. I don't know if this books suffers from Bourdain's inexperience at writing, or if this simply has been edited to death to remove a lot of life from the prose. I would love to praise this book as one of the best that has ever crossed my path, for the content itself is comforting in that it expresses the heart of a true food lover, one I will probably emulate for years to come, but as a book itself, I must say that I skipped over passages that I found highly tedious to read."},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":"this was a fun, enteraining read. if you enjoy Tony's show on Food TV, then this is added excitement.

(I won't be having any of this on my next vacation overseas.)"},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":"Anthony Bourdain's writing is steeped with the street-smart coolness that can only come from a lifetime New Yorker. In A Cook's Tour he manages to combine the travelogue with food writing without it being completely fruity.Bourdain travels around the world sampling local cuisine and meeting interesting characters. You can tell how passionate he is about food and life and it's wonderful to read an author who really loves his subject. He's also side-splittingly sardonic about the different situations he finds himself in.This book is also much more personal than I expected. His manic-depression shines through: one moment is a blissful celebration of life and the next is full of self-loathing. A trip to his boyhood haunts in France and a scary side trip to Cambodia are especially poignant. Bourdain gets four stars in my Michelin Guide."},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":"This is a great book for anyone who's ever chosen a vacation spot based on the cuisine, or driven 100 miles out of the way for a special meal. Bourdain is willing to try anything, and I liked living vicariously through his food lust. (Though a lover of food, there are definately things I would never eat)The only chapter I had fault with was his chapter on French Laundry. Having fantasized about that restaurant for years, I was hungering for a more detailed description of the 20 courses that he sampled- what exactly were those 20 courses? And the courses of the other guests.My one hope is that Bourdain decides to keep searching for great food!!"},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":"I'm stunned. Gob-smacked, really. It's been a very, very long time since I read a book so engaging, so funny, so thoughtful and thought-provoking, AND on a subject that just sends me. Bourdain swoops from utterly enraptured adoration of incredible food experiences, right down into the often unapologetically brutal reality of their origins, and right back up into reveries on the heart-fulness of the friends he makes along the way, and their amazing other worlds. I'm chomping at the bit for more Bourdain! BRAVO!!!!"},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":"Anthony Bourdain had written a couple of novels to little acclaim, but it was his memoir, Kitchen Confidential, that made him a famous chef and author. A Cook's Tour is a book about Mr. Bourdain's search for the perfect meal. He sets out to travel to globe hitting points everywhere from San Francisco to Moscow to Cambodia to Mexico to France to Scotland to his hometown of New York City. No food is too scary or repulsive to try and no alcoholic beverage is ever denied. Along his journey, Mr. Bourdain eats food as varied as haggis, sushi, cobra's heart, iguana, stinky cheeses, oysters, doughnuts, hot dogs and sheep testicles. In Kitchen Confidential, Mr. Bourdain ridicules celebrity chefs that appear on the Food Network, but he gives into the television business as the entire is being filmed by the network for a series. Mr. Bourdain has a sharp and sarcastic writing voice and a very sardonic sense of humor. The antidotes from each stop along his journey offer a keen insight into both the country or city's cultural and its day to day eating habits. Mr. Bourdain's details are vivid and one feels as if you are riding shotgun with him on his trip."},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":"Its a bit like reading the script for the show. I like the way Anthony Bourdain writes. Is it just me but doesn't all that smoking affect your tastebuds? The only thing that I didn't like was that pretty much everything is \\"fantastic\\". Everything can't be the greatest thing in the world. But he's funny and this is the first book I've paid full price for since my school days! I give this book three stars because when I was reading the chapters about his time in Vietnam, I am convinced that he kept misspelling some of the words! Horror! Horror! (not to mention the pig slaughter)"},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":"This guy is funny, outrageous and politically incorrect. Even if you're not a \\"foodie,\\" his take on life is hilarious. Sometimes mixing pathos though with bittersweet reminisces of searching for his father and encountering a scarred man in Vietnam.I would give it SIX stars if I could.It will taste good a leave you hungering for more...."},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":"A Cook's Tour centers on a search for a \\"perfect meal\\" This perfect meal stuff is a little dopey... after all, nothing is perfect... but it is fun to think about. Meals range from primitive to haute cuisine in locations around the world. The best bits are about Vietnam and Mexico.Bourdain has softened since his preceding book, Kitchen Confidential. He is kinder to TV chefs (a good idea considering he is one now), and seems to feel less need to shock the reader. His crankiness has nearly decreased to the level of Bill Bryson, which is,in general, an improvement."},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":"While commuting I was listening to the Tape of this book. The description of the Russian Sauna and his dip in the cold lake made me laugh so hard I almost drove off the road! I liked Kitchen Confidential, I loved this book! Bourdain is funny, not PC, thoughtful, raunchy, wistful and very articulate. From his first book I understand he's been married to his wife for years. She's got to be a hearty, tolerant soul!"},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":"After loving &quot;Kitchen Confidential&quot; I was so disappointed in this! The descriptions are shallow and tossed off -- even of the food (we're told again and again &quot;this was great,&quot; but never WHAT IT TASTES LIKE!!) and the adventures all sound the same (all variations on &quot;I wanted the childhood adventure story dream but this wasn't it&quot; OR &quot;and this was it but it really scared me and wasn't fun like I expected&quot;). Bourdain is trading on his admittedly abundant personality, but he should have taken a little time to let us in on the jokes/joy/adventure."},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":"A CULINARY TRIP AROUND THE WORLD WITHOUT HAVING TO GET ROT GUT YOURSELF, OR ANY OTHER DYSENTERIC ILLNESS.

I was very disappointed because there was little information on the food he ate. Instead, the pages are filled with cliches and stereotypes (many of these have nothing to do with food), but little insight is presented because he only sees things through his pre-conceived notions. This book is highly recommended if you want to learn how to feel good by making fun of other cultures and peoples, but for those who want to learn a bit about different culinary traditions, reading this book is a waste of time. The book can be cut down to 50 pages if these cliches are removed. I am more interested in what he ate or observed (descriptions!) rather than his explanations on why these people came up with these customs and dishes (sort of cultural determinism). Many people should have helped him in these countries he visited, but I wonder whether he has the nerve to translate the content of this book into their native languages. The author should be able to criticize if he wishes, but it is not fair to make fun of the people who helped him in a book which, he knew, they would not read."},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":"Not only can our buddy tony here NOT cook, he's also a real ass. He has a terrible attitude, his recipes are a disaster and the sad part is, he thinks he's the greatest thing out there right now.

Delicious food, basic, natural herbs and ingredients, every recipe is a smash hit. Jamie Oliver's book's are by far superior, check them out if you want to actualy learn somehting from someone with talent. Unlike Tony."},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":"Many readers complained of the Vietnam trip being added throughout the book. Having just finished the book, it's clear that the eats in Vietnam, and the people, stood out for him. There's really something special about his writing of Japan too. This book is a riot and I am pleased that he doesn't \\"dumb down\\" his biting humor for the reader. Questions to him would be, 1/ Why no pictures? 2/ Why not India? Lastly, very refreshing to hear a chef give the respect to the Hispanic folks that have been cooking beautifully for years."},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":"This book didn't only make me want to eat, it made me want to learn more about Henry Kissenger.Bourdain weaves the historical and political into his narrative to explain the whys and hows of the food (and, importantly, its quality and lack thereof) in the countries he visits. Compare and contrast his visits to Vietnam and Cambodia, both countries devastated by American geopolitical interests, whose histories have had definite impacts on their cuisine.He's a funny, scathing, moving writer - his love of food and travel enfuse his writing with a power rarely found in either cookbooks or travelogues."},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":"I really enjoyed this book. Anthony's personality comes through in his writing and I will be looking for more of his books."},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":"The typical anti-hero, Bourdain reminds me of House, deeply flawed but possessing a precious talent which justifies his behavior. His writing seems very real, he mouths off Inappropriately with those who can take it, but reluctantly gives credit to other chefs as they deserve. He also has these personal gods, Vietnam and the Hispanic chefs, and in every book you can see how important they are to him.I can't imagine sitting through a 20 course tasting menu, but it was fun and interesting to read about the inner workings of various famous restaurants."},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":"excellent. i just love tony bourdain and i love every word he writes! he is funny and incredibly smart, and laid back, and doesnt care what people think, and he knows a lot about life, and has a good heart and a beautiful soul. i see all this when i see him. he came to norfolk, virginia in 2011 and i was there! i got to see him in person. i was ecstatic. my dad had died a few days before that so it really made me feel better to see tony in person. i wish i could have really talked to him, but to just be in the room with him is enough to last me forever :)"},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":"Makes you want to travel... and eat...Great introduction and behind the scenes insight to the television series. Leaves an empty once done reading."},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":"A good read, but essentially documents many of the locations he traveled to during the first season of No Reservations. If you've seen the TV shows already, you'll already know much of the story and not much additional content has been included. All in all, a good read, but would have liked to have seen more details that weren't shown on the TV show."},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":"A Cook's Tour is likely my favorite book of Tony's. It does a great job showing the genesis of not only No Reservations, but of Bourdain's transition from downtrodden chef to cable TV sensation (how else can you describe him?). Frankly, I wish Tony would dedicate a book w/ a similar theme to his No Reservations trips."},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":"I already had two of his previous books and could not hold back on this one. This guy just tells it like it is. Doesn't lie. That is the main reason I like Anthony."},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":"This is a closer, behind the scenes look at Tony's experiences getting the series going and illuminating his perceptions. I read his first book and have enjoyed the episodes in the TV series. This book filled in some of the pieces for me in a personal way as Tony wrote about why he did some things, shared his reactions to people, places, food and explained the sometimes complex realities of hosting a food/travel program. As a foodie, I enjoyed the read and even more, appreciated the multi layered personality that emerged from these pages. I have not only recommended the book, but I bought it as a gift so someone else could enjoy it."},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":"This is one of those few books which actually made me burst out laughing while riding the EL to work in the mornings. Mr. Bourdain pulls no punches, speaks his mind, and drops f-bombs as often as other people say &quot;the&quot;. I would get along quite well with him, I think. If you love good food and you love to travel, this is a great book to feed both of those needs. Granted, you're just reading about those subjects, but Mr. Bourdain is quite gifted with the English language (which makes the f-bombs even funnier), and he makes you feel like you're right there with him. You are eating fresh fish, cobra hearts, or a birds nest (no kidding). Great read."},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":"In some ways, I don't even know why I'm writing a \\"review\\" of this book. I loved it. I was destined to love it. This makes my opinions even more biased than usual. I'll try to impart some advice though, that will help you decide whether or not you should read this wonderful piece of travel narrative-cum-food worship.The television show that coincided with this book, also called A Cook's Tour, aired on Food Network somewhere around the time that I started getting hooked into this station on a regular basis. I had no idea what the premise was; I was just witnessing this cynical guy eating strange food in strange places. As I kept watching it, I came to realize that it was more than a tv series. In fact it wasn't a series at all. It was a project or journey: find the best meal in the world. Of course, I'm sure the pitch to Food Network executives was a bit more detailed, but if you asked Tony Bourdain that's probably how he'd sum it up.On each episode of this show, Tony would visit a different place, usually a different country, and find the best food, the most local food, the stuff deeply rooted in the community itself. He was always hosted by locals; a Russian grandmother, a Brazilian beach bum, Vietnamese veterans. He usually assists in the procuring of the ingredients too. He visits fish markets or barters for lamb. More than a food show, this is truly an observation of food culture in other parts of the world. Tony is, or at least tries to be, as unobtrusive as possible, to blend in. Frequently, this is ruined by overinquisitive children or wary old folks, but the effort shows. It views as much like a documentary as a food show.All this love for the show made me fearful of the book. I resisted reading it a bit, because of how much I loved the show. I read Kitchen Confidential first. I was afraid that the book would simply be a transcript of the show or, at best, first person perspective of all the events I had seen during the show. Not so in the least!After reading the book, I discovered that it manages to be the perfect compliment to the show. Not only is it not just first person accounting, it's new stuff, not even alluded to on the show. Sure we see the meals, but they're almost glossed over in favor of recounting the introduction to the location or the absolute disgust Tony has over what he might be forced to eat at the time.The opposite side of this coin of course, is that I'm not sure how it reads for someone who hasn't seen the show. I could see how the visuals in the book could not be as effective if you didn't have actual images to pair them with. Don't let this discourage you though, it's a great read in and of itself. It's obvious the writing talent that Bourdain has developed over five books. It serves as a plenty good travel narrative also, if that's how you come to it. Either way, it's a worthwhile read for just about anyone who finds some interest in some facet of the subject matter. To get the full experience though, pair it with the show."},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":"I really like Anthony Bourdain, though I suspect he'd have sneering contempt for me. I say this because, even though I've been in the same business as him for over 30 years, I lack his extreme sense of gastro-adventure. But, he writes with such skill, humor, and openness to new experiences in this book that going along for the ride is irresistable. Speaking of contempt, here, he famously and unapologetically expressees HIS for the likes of Emeril and Burt Wolf, and what he perceives to be their faux theatrics, as in Emeril's case, or lack of real ability, as with Mr. Wolf. He also has something of a love/hate relationship with \\"The Food Network\\", that mixed blessing largely responsible for both his fame and his dreaded occasional need to be \\"sociable.\\" He abhors pretension of any kind, and is ready, anxious, and able to squat down in the rice paddies or the mud-hut to fest with the locals. He has a huge respect for not only the inhabitants of wherever he's visiting, but for their traditions and foods. He is well aware of what every good chef/cook should know, that, you never stop learning, sometimes in the most unlikely places, by the most unlikely people. He is definately more \\"blood & guts\\" commando, more resembling a burned out rock star, than haughty chef. It is ,however, obvious that he is not only a talented chef (though he refers to himself as a \\"utility cook\\"), but a very talented, intelligent writer, who wastes neither food nor words. As for myself, I am someone who has gained a local reputation as something of a very creative short-order wizard where cooking is concerned, so I can really appreciate his referring to himself as \\"cook\\", not \\"chef.\\" (We cooks have been maligned for too long!) Unfortunately, I am definately someone whom Mr. Bourdain would call a \\"wuss.\\" Though I am not exactly a vegetarian, I like my meat to resemble anything but a formerly \\"living\\" thing. And though his skillful descriptions here of the preparation and partaking of numerous meals often had my mouth watering, Mr. Bourdain also recounts in this book numerous incidences of not only witnessing the slaughter of their very imminent meal, but of often eating the fresh kill as it's barely had its last breath. Though he swears that the jumbo lambs testical or sliced calfs face he savored was something that all would enjoy, I can assure you that I'd skip those, thanks...just pass the curried cous-cous with raisins and pita bread. This is a very entertaining book, which is just as much a travel adventure as a gastronomic one. Whether exploring the dangerous underbelly of Russia, or sensually describing the search for the perfect oyster of his past, he makes it all thrilling, and this book would interest those who have never stepped foot in a kitchen. I really enjoyed this book, as I did his \\"Kitchen Confidential\\", which exposed the entrails of the restaurant world, to much humor amongst those, like myself, who have long lived it, and to the horror, I'm sure, of many restaurant goers. To Mr. Bourdain, who finally got his aging and over-used legs (I hear THAT...ache!) out of the kitchen, I say, \\"You go Boy!\\""},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":"Bouncing around the world with a camera crew in tow, Bourdain hits as many culinary adventures as you can imagine. Morocco, Cambodia, Vietnam, are all on his travel schedule as he pursues the perfect meal. Cobra heart, haggis, fugu are all on the agenda, but it's the little wonders that are truly memorable. The Tokyo fish market, the trip to the hometown of his sous chef, a wonderful look at true Mexican cooking,and Bourdain's regret and acceptance over a pig being slaughtered for his benefit in Portugal are all wonderful examples of how well Bourdain can tell a story. Bourdain constantly entertains and intrigues with his willingness to describe the food, the people, and most comically, the TV Food Network's attempts to \\"spice\\" (sorry) things up. Much more thoughtful than the \\"in your face\\" approach of KITCHEN CONFIDENTIAL, A COOK'S TOUR succeeds as a culinary adventure, with an intelligent and thoughful guide, who realizes that \\"Perfect, like happy, sneaks up on you.\\""},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":"A Fun Read With Some Minor FlawsTony Bourdain's \\"A Cook's Tour\\" is a fun book to read. I plowed through it voraciously in a matter of days. I watched the companion series on the Food Network and enjoyed it thoroughly. I was concerned that the book would be a mere rehashing of the series and was relieved and pleased to find this was not the case.Tony's adventures are well written and his humor comes through loud and clear. I particularly liked the chapters on Vietnam and Russia, probably because he enjoyed those countries so much. His return with his brother to his ancestral village in France is also a well-written and intriguing episode in the book.The book suffers somewhat from a lack of cohesion. The book has a number of chapters on Vietnam, but it breaks them up with chapters about other countries. For me, this was rather jarring. It was exacerbated by the lack of any kind of introduction or segue between the chapters. At times, it felt like I was reading a series of magazine articles that had been compiled, rather than a book which was conceived as a whole.At times, he also lets his preconceptions of a country get in the way of his gaining a better understanding of its cuisine - Morocco and Cambodia being cases in point.The other complaint I have about the book is his repeated tirades against vegetarians (full disclosure: I am a longtime lacto-ovo vegetarian). He is certainly entitled to his opinion, but I think that three or four separate tirades on the subject in a slime volume is rather much. I find his primary complaint, that vegetarians are ruining cuisine, to be absurd. At the end of one of his invectives, he concludes the enemy of real cuisine is fast food and overly processed food, which is probably closer to the mark.All in all, it is a fascinating book even with its flaws. As Tony notes, simple food, honestly prepared, is often the most pleasurable, whether it is a spring roll wrapped in lettuce with basil or a dumpling followed by a shot of vodka. I really enjoyed most of \\"A Cook's Tour\\", and I do owe Tony a debt for improving my cooking with his recommendations from his book \\"Kitchen Confidential\\" - using shallots and finishing dishes off with butter. And if he would like a wonderful food experience which happens to be vegetarian, all he has to do is stroll down to Hangawi on East 32nd Street for an amazing dining experience, honestly and simply prepared."},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":"It took 186 pages, but the real Anthony Bourdain finally showed up.That's an unfair comment, but based on reading a few of Mr. Bourdain's other works I feel qualified to pontificate on his strengths. The first nine chapters of 'Cook's Tour' betray none of the glorious culinary abandon from 'Kitchen Confidential' or his latest cookbook (cross-promoted with his current employer, Les Halles restaurant in New York City). When he finally arrives in England and tears into a rip-snorting endorsement of chef Fergus Henderson--and a passionate defense of \\"real British cooking\\"--I actually breathed a sigh of relief. If only the whole book had this unique energy.But, alas, it doesn't. Bourdain perhaps senses this from the start; the introduction is almost apologetic about the book's purpose (\\"traveling around the world searching for the perfect meal\\") and though he humorously warns us in advance about the whole adventure being filmed for a food-oriented TV network (guess which one) this angle clearly impinges on the book's narrative. With this muddy purpose we get 185 pages of \\"I went here and this happened\\" stories--from Portugal to France to Russia and beyond--without any clue where we're going and worse: virtually none of the author's blood-curdling culinary opinions. Bourdain munches and sips from various things in these locales, but without any dramatic or even comedic culinary context. He apparently wishes us inspiration from reading about his childhood flashbacks (France) or politically-inspired guilt (Vietnam). Sorry Tony -- I'm just not that interested.Fortunately when we get to England Bourdain wakes up. I found the remainder of the book as delightful, funny, and viscously honest as the beginning was navel-gazing and confused. His paeans to local cuisine in Mexico and Vietnam are breathtaking; the Mexican connection is especially poignant since he visits the home of a few of his fellow Les Halles cooks and finds himself staggered by their culinary culture. This essay ('Where Cooks Come From') is alone worth the price of the book.Like more than a few tomes, 'A Cook's Tour' would earn top marks from me if only the author had stuck to his obvious strengths (extolling passionate cooks and funky-but-delicious food, skewering hypocritical and pretentious culinary trends) throughout. Slogging through the aimless essays where none of this is in evidence was disappointing and frustrating. I can only hope Mr. Bourdain--clearly one of our best current food writers--learns his lesson and finds (another) good subject into which to sink his razor-sharp teeth."},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":"Imagine that you were meeting Anthony Bourdain for dinner. He's a world-famous chef, known for his obsession and creativity with food as his attitude and rudeness -- in other words, he's a universe of stories and jokes onto himself. He's just traveled around the world, looking for the perfect meal in France, England, Mexico, Vietnam, Cambodia, Russia, Morocco, Japan, and other countries. He's been to some of the most famous restaurants in the world, hobnobbed with each culture's best chefs, and tasted the most exotic dishes.You are expecting a perfect meal and wonderful companionship, right?Well, what happens is that Bourdain complains throughout the meal about flying tourist-class to these exotic locales, and being hamstrung by a television crew following him throughout (a television crew that does all the prep work for him, by the way). Very soon, Bourdain's prima donna whining starts making even the food taste bad.This is a book that seemed rush, meant to capitalize on Bourdain's new-found fame and the reading public's growing interest in food. But be aware: this book can only leave a bitter aftertaste in your mouth."},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":"For many Baby Boomers, Julia Child and James Beard reigned supreme as kitchen royalty. Most males of our parents generation were too embarassed to tune in to these how-to master the culinary television shows.A new generation of cable chefs and food gurus has ascended, and Anthony Bourdain beams onto our flat screen as a more telegenic, sarcastic and earthy messenger.\\"Kitchen Confidential\\" took us behind the counter and gave a glimpse of life running a restaurant. Candid, often hilarious and baring many messages of life and work, it was a riveting read.In this entree, Bourdain takes to the road, and talks of his experiences sampling exotic cultures, and delicacies that the western world must work hard to get their imaginations around.The pace and humor fall short of that of \\"Kitchen Confidential\\", but Bourdain proves he is the equal of his Travel Channel associates, gross out masters Andrew Zimmern and Adam Richman.Bourdain, however, knows how to spin a story, and deliver a lesson. In speaking about his peer, \\"Hell's Kitchen's\\" Gordon Ramsay, who berates, harasses and terrifies his employees, Bourdain pushes aside the criticisms, and explains that Ramsay rarely loses an associate. He goes on to say that people would much rather come to work every day for someone who sets the highest standards, and how horrible it would be to work for someone who doesn't care. Right on the money, there.This book doesn't quite hit the high notes of Kitchen Confidential, but it is still a highly entertaining read. Bourdain has become one of my favorite television personalities, and his turn of a phrase is well worth perusing."},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":"\\"A Cook's Tour\\" by the wonderfully worldly and well-traveled Anthony Bourdain, is a book about food like no other, and it is simultaneously entertaining, exciting, and revolting. Tony travels the world in search of the perfect meal; it's an exciting quest for any chef to ponder, but along the way he comes across numerous local delicacies that can be best described as only for the strong of heart.Although he encounters several problems with dishes from around the world (the Mexican saut&eacute;ed ant eggs and Scottish deep-fried haggis with curry sauce and deep fried egg stand out), the most stunning for my money are the things he eats in Asia, and especially Vietnam. I for one would not be able to eat the traditional Vietnamese breakfast of soft-boiled duck embryo complete with feathers, followed by a steaming bowl of \\"chao muk\\", a hearty soup made from ginger, sprouts, cilantro, shrimp, squid, chives, pork-blood cake, and croutons; later Tony enjoyed some braised bat (\\"imagine braised inner tube, sauced with engine coolant\\"). Even worse than that, though, is the concept of eating a still-beating cobra heart, after a very special snake disemboweling ceremony.While Vietnam takes the proverbial cake, the book features other gastronomic nightmares from around the globe, with Japan coming in second in the contest for unusual and disturbing foodstuffs. The foodie tour of Japan started out benignly enough, with an appetizer of \\"amuse-gueule of hoshigaka goma-an\\" (dried persimmon and fried soy curd with sesame paste), but quickly progressed to things like \\"suppon-dofu\\" (a soft-shell turtle in egg pudding with green onion and turtle broth), and culminated in the classic and beloved Japanese delicacy, \\"natto\\", which Bourdain describes as \\"an unbelievably foul, rank, slimy, glutinous, and stringy goop of fermented soybeans\\". After the natto, Bourdain finished with a dish described as \\"mountain potato\\": of this he said, \\"I could only handle a single taste. To this day, I have no idea what it really was.... The small, dark, chewy nugget can only be described as tasting like salt-cured, sun-dried goat rectum\\".Throughout the book, Bourdain maintains his wry, sarcastic sense of humor, possibly as a survival tool to get him through his next meal. He mocks a vegan potluck dinner as the \\"real heart of darkness\\", discusses fabled and exotic foods such as the unbelievably rank durian fruit, and always manages to do it while being respectful of local traditions and cultures very different from his existence in New York City. This is a great book for anyone interested in foods and cultures of the world, and I recommend it highly!"},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":"This was good, but I didn't enjoy it as much as Kitchen Confidential. I've been trying to decide why & I think it's because ultimately this isn't so much a food book as it is a travel book. That's okay, but the notion of hunting down the perfect meal has an appeal to me & led me to expect something different.Having said all of that, I enjoyed the book. It's hard not to love someone who hits the jackpot with a best seller & says to themselves, \\"Hmmm ... I think I'll see if I can get someone to pay for me to travel around the world eating cool stuff & looking at cool & interesting places.\\" That someone actually did agree to pay for this & that it was the Food Network makes it all the more amusing since he spends much of Kitchen Confidential slagging the Food Netwok & many of its chefs.If you've seen No Reservations you know the schtick - Tony visits exotic locale, meets interesting people, talks a lot, & eats cool food. Often there is is drunkenness & there is the occasional oblilgatory inspired by the producers moment of Eat-This-Weird-Thing-While-We-Film-You-It'll-Be-Great-Remember-We're-Paying.I like that Bourdain gets that great food doesn't all happen at 5-star restaurants. It can, but it doesn't happen only there. Great food also happens at people's houses, from street vendors, down at the local. It was fun to read about his meal at The French Laundry, but I'm not dropping $400-$500 on a meal anytime soon & I much more enjoyed his writing about his adventures in Mexico with the families of some of his cooks from his New York restaurant.All in all I think that this kind of thing works better as a TV series. Ultimately with travel I want to actually see the place, the food, the people. What works as voiceover makes for okay reading, but just okay."},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":"Tony Bourdain capitalized on the tremendous success of \\"Kitchen Confidential\\", an insider's look into the restaurant industry, with a devilishly interesting follow-up. The proposal to his publisher was simple enough. Tony would travel around the world in search of the \\"perfect\\" meal. A great excuse for him to leave the hot and sweaty world of his kitchens for a year. His search would lead him to exotic locales around the world and allow him to taste the simple (e.g. food of Puebla, Mexico birthplace of many in his kitchen staff), extreme (e.g. boiled fetal duck egg and pulsating Cobra heart), and over-the-top (e.g. 20 course meal at the French Laundry). In the process, he admits he sold his soul to the devil to get this project done as he traveled with two cameramen who would capture his adventures for the TV Food Network.The book is an excellent companion to the television series offering behind-the-scene looks at adventures that obviously got left on the cutting room floor. Since Tony is quite a scamp, there are many anecdotes too violent or too disturbing for the average viewer of Emeril Live. He is also better able to articulate what he was observing and more importantly thinking at the time of his adventure. This is something that is difficult to do on video even with voiceover."},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":"The thing about Portugal--the fattening and killing of the pig to using its bladder as a soccer ball--was wonderfully described. It's almost as if he brought us with him on the trip. But after that nothing really stood out for me, except his bashing (rightfully so, in my opinion) of Jamie Oliver and his memorable iguana eating experience, a hotel mascot no less, in Mexico. One can say, practically, these could have been found as chapters he discarded when he wrote Kitchen Confidential.Do read the book; it's still a good read."},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":"&quot;A Cook's Tour&quot; isn't as well written and engaging as &quot;Kitchen Confidential&quot; so don't pick that up thinking that it would be a repeat of the first act. Although it is still the same chef Tony, his celebrity has made him lose focus in his writing and some parts A Cook's Tour show sloppy editing (for example, his agent didn't pick up the wrong spelling of Calista &quot;Flockheart&quot;, and some Asian food ingredients were wrongly named, etc.)Although he is constantly pointing out that he has sold out big time in this book, he doesn't need to spell it out for us because the writing quality shows. The chapters are not connected at all and jump around thoughts, countries, themes. If he had spent more time polishing the idea of the book, this would have been a very successful work like the first, but obviously people will print anything that he writes now and you can tell that not as much thought went into this one. It is a real pity because he has been paid to go to some truly amazing places and undergo experiences that none of us can on a whim.The most unforgivable parts are the one or two places where he slips into cliched but truly meant sentiments (as in when he says it is understandable that the peasants revolted in Russia when they saw Catherine the Great's palace - yeah, like he understands!)...there is no need to rub the point in in such a maudlin way.Stick to being funny and cynical, Chef Tony! I am only being harsh reviewer to encourage (a) Bourdain to write a better next book and (b) agents/editors to do the job they are paid to do!"},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":"I loved this book. Initially I thought it would be about food only and obviously food of different cultures. But the book turned out to e much much more than this. You have food, you have cultures, you have analysis, wit, humour, and much much more. It is such an enlightening book about food and all the factors related to food, such as sociology of the country etc. It was indeed one of the most enjoyable books I have read in recent years. I congratulate the author. Please give us more of this kind of stuff. And don't wait too long for your next book."},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":"Vegans should know that a chef touring the world looking for food from different places trees will not be the only items on his plate. This is not for the faint of heart(literally!). As someone who only eats fish, this book had me wincing and groaning many times! I have better understanding of the hows and why people of other cultures eat the foods that they do. And Tony did try some vegetarian fare in California, so the book is balanced.A lively, well written, amusing read!"},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":"Tony confesses at the beginning he sold out, but then takes us along for a great ride. I was interested because I had seen the show, I could tell he wasn't that serious, but was enjoying the opportunity. He has the New York blunt, rye attitude, yet allows us to see the human side of his mistakes and highlights them with his humor.His style may well offend if you are too sensitive sensibilities. Though he reminds me of many career cooks I have known.If you loved the show, it will make you look at it in a whole new light. If you enjoy food and traveling to different cultures it's a book for you. If you enjoy a good read, buy it and watch Tony's quest for the Perfect 'Free' Meal."},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":"I was first attracted to Mr. Bourdain, when i recieved &quot;Kitchen Confidential&quot; for Christmas a few years back. However I didn't read it for at least a year. When i read it I read it through three times in a row. When I found out that he had written a book about his TV show, and that he was coming to my town to promote his book, I jumped on the chance to meet him, and get my books autographed. Let me tell you, what you read in the books is the way he is in real life. There was a dinner in his celebration, and he went into the kitchen after every course was out, and proceeded to get drunk with all of the cooks. I loved &quot;A Cook's Tour&quot; it really motivated me to try different food items, throwing caution to the wind about the results of eating it later, and boy have I felt some of that pain. I completely recommend this book for someone who would love to be able to eat across the world, but eat the real food that people eat everyday. And to be in the search for the perfect meal."},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":"Loved it, loved it, loved it! I am addicted to Tony! The book is funny with just the right amount of seriousness. I have him, and every one of his experiences, pictured in my head and can't want to his other books! Keep 'em coming, Mr. Bourdain!"},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":"I enjoyed this book so much, it was very refreshing to read a no-b.s. first-person account of an interesting journey. Bordain offers up the best kind of combination in a person/author: experience mixed with freshness and honesty. He gives you his thoughts uncensored, and he's as sensitive as he is tough. He's also very funny. His tour takes us on a walk through different cultures, with food being the glue that binds us. We all eat, but wow, how differently in some cases. It's true, this book is not about &quot;a perfect meal&quot; in the simplistic sense (entree-starch-veg, anyone?). He explains this concept from the get-go. A perfect meal always depends on a variety of external factors that are often surprising and usually out of our control. The memorable moments of life, which happen to be experienced at table. His thoughtful account of his trips to Japan, Morocco, Portugal, and other, more far-flug places, tell us about the people, their traditions, and their values glimpsed through their eating habits. I thought his choice of trips was perfect, and loved all the details he shares. His trip back to France with his brother was touching. Bordain's observations are often funny, sometimes sad, always forthright. For me, another 1/2 Euro/1/2 Yank, it is facsinating to compare life around the world to life in America, with mixed results. Here, on the downside, we may have nearly lost our connections to our food, our families, and our communities, but on the upside, you're not likely to find a killing farm retreat, or kids working all night, shuttling drunks, for three bucks. I learned a lot from this book, it was really entertaining and interesting. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":"Having read &quot;Kitchen Confidential&quot;, it is evident that Bourdain has a unique approach to being a chef. In &quot;A Cook's Tour&quot;, he travels the world in search of the &quot;perfect meal&quot;, or to be exact, his perfect meal. He is quick to recognize that the concept of a perfect meal is very subjective, and is different for each personHe travels through Europe and Asia, searching out some of the most unusual and incredible dishes, and he has a camera crew along for the ride. Even if this was not to become a Food Network series, it would still be a great book. Bourdain considers this whole thing to be his way of selling out, which he points out early on, with some humility. Anyone who has read &quot;Kitchen Confidential&quot; would know that Bourdain hates celebrity chefs, Bobby Flay and Emeril being the cheif offenders in his books. For him to do something like this is, in his own worlds, selling himself out. Is it a healthy disrespect for success, or daftness? Perhaps both. But it is a fascinating journey, and exposes different and unusual culinary practices that are interesting, and sometimes hard to stomach.As someone who aspires to be a chef, this book has presented a neat learning curve to me. The importance of embracing new techniques, and different cuisine of different cultures, is half the battle for being a good chef. The idea for this book was excellent, and it is something that most people would want to do given the oppertunity. Though not all aspects of this book are pleasant. Bourdain visits some places that most of us would rather not. In Asia, he visits a dirty, stagnat swamp hotel just so he can try the fire-roasted duck. He talks about episodes of food poisoning, bacteria, and animal slaughtering. Not all pleasant, but it only adds to the book's intrigue.Even if you are not a foodie, this is a great read. Bourdain has a fresh and hip writing style that never meanders and keeps the reader hooked. Though I enjoyed &quot;Kitchen Confidential&quot; more, I think &quot;A Cooks Tour&quot; is a excellent book in it's own right."},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":"I love to cook and I love to &quot;globe trot&quot;, so the fact that love this book is no surprise. What make this book so good is that even if you don't love those things, the story telling alone makes it worth reading. Bourdain's outlook on life is refreshing as it is entertaining. He holds nothing back and doesn't care. If you want to take a great tour without leaving the comfort of home, this is the road best traveled!"},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":"Oh please - this doesn't even compare to &quot;Kitchen Confidential&quot;. Sorry Tony, but you were trying too hard. The only time I even glimpsed the Tony of &quot;Kitchen Confidential&quot; was when you were skewering the Food Network. I know you sold out - but jeesh, were you writing a travel book, a cook book, or a political statement? You lost your focus! Gimme the underbelly! Come and cook in my kitchen and then we'll talk."},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":"anthony bourdain is a daredevil of a chef and this book proves it. like he said on his food network tv show A COOK'S TOUR, \\"i'll try anything, i'll risk everything!\\" he eats food in countries enough to make him very very very ill! cobra's heart? ugh! his trip to cambodia on tv was grotesque when he ate quail's head soup and the poor bird's head was at the bottom of the bowl. later we see him in bed groaning in pain under all that heat and humidity and mosquitoes. for the book version this is a wonderful read as well as his classic KITCHEN CONFIDENTIAL. bourdain is the iggy pop of chefs! can't wait to eat steak frite at his place, les halles, in manhattan. i hope there would be a dvd of his tv show."},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":"The book arrived in a timely fashion and was in pristine condition. Great price, too. Thanks."},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":"Oh please - this doesn't even compare to &quot;Kitchen Confidential&quot;. Sorry Tony, but you were trying too hard.

Come and cook in my kitchen and then we'll talk."},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":"Any deal Tony had to make with the devil (A.K.A the Food Network) to get this book made was totally worth it. And I did enjoy the show version of the book too. There, I said it!Being from New York is Tony's principle advantage in undertaking a world tour of food. Firstly, being from NYC he has probably already encountered most if not all the indigenous peoples of the countries he travels, so really no surprises there. Plus, as we all know from \\"Kitchen Confidential\\", Tony will eat ANYTHING! Which he proves in fine style from a beating Cobra Heart to a snot-like breakfast in Japan.Finally, how could anyone not like Tony Bourdain? He is the aptheosis of cool! He moved the U.S. up several notches on the diplomatic scale just going out and letting people bask in his coolness.Way to go, Tony! Thanks for taking one for the team."},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":"The best way for me to describe Chef Bourdain's antics is unreal and incredible. I must admit to an overwhelming twinge of jealousy that a feat like this was accomplished and recorded first hand, and that I wasn't there to behold its magnitude and non stop insanity.His writing style, unpolished, vivid and direct, at times moved me from tears of hysterical laughter to deep contemplation, like an out of control pendulum.A published record of adventure beyond imagination in this day of globalism and CNN; that delves below the layer of politics and shows us the people living under said layer is rare indeed.But to eat your way around the world, what a gluttonous pleasure to indulge in.Thank you Chef Bourdain for sharing this adventure with us, even if you did sell your soul to the devil. It was, after all, for a good cause."},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":"I almost gave the book two stars but the one or two good belly laughs I got from some of Tony's adventures came to mind, causing me to have mercy on the guy. For the most part, however, I found the book a disappointment. I didn't read Bourdain's first work so I didn't know what to expect. The title is misleading. \\"A Cook's Tour\\" comes across more as an excuse for the author to travel to exotic places on someone else's dime. Contrary to the premise of finding the perfect meal, it seems that Tony took the Food Network up on the opportunity to play around in far-flung locales he's always wanted to visit. The chapter on dining in France at a beach resort he remembered from childhood was only interesting in the context that he described in his introduction. What makes a perfect meal? It's not only ingredients and preparation. It's atmosphere, nostalgia, expectation, memory, etc. His first stop, Portugal, lived up to the book's stated mission. He quickly lost focus, however. What does a potentially dangerous trip up a Cambodian river to the gangster-run town of Pailin have to do with \\"the perfect meal?\\" Predictably he found nothing there but second rate Thai food. A Russian mafia club? A Mexican hotel's iguana mascot? The much talked about beating cobra's heart? It's a travelogue of the outrageous and atrocious. Searching for the perfect meal would entail research, attention to detail, seriousness and lengthy tours through New Orleans, in my humble opinion. Profanity, descriptions of illegal drug use, in countries where you could do some serious Third World hard time, and drunken stumbles through foreign capitals don't cut it in my book. Sorry. Some chapters I skimmed through after tiring of the incessant ranting."},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":"This book doesn't evoke hunger, or foodie delight. It's a semi-abashed (because he's traveling with a camera crew, and has to cooperate) account of him going around the world seeking food without often finding it.This is not a terrible book. It just doesn't measure up to the standards set by any other foodie book I've ever encountered.Pick another at random and you'll have a more enjoyable and more educational read. If you already have this book, read it once and then (you will anyway) give it away and move on to a different author."},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":"Tony Bourdain as a culinary writer who delves out books deserving of at least four stars ratings. He serves his adventures seasoned with humor and honesty, only to make the reader craving for more. If you're curious as to who in the world would ever eat that? Anthony Bourdain, the man with a steel stomach will! He makes you laugh with tears streaming out of your eyes as if you were dicing onions.[...]"},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":"The book if fun to read. Buy it. All right, borrow it from your library. This travel-food-olog mixes wild & interesting places and wild & interesting foods in about equal amounts. Yes, Mr. Bourdain does write like a chef, but what the heck? In his words, that's \\"pretty neat.\\"At all these wild places he goes -- Russia, North Africa, Vietnam, Japan -- one wonders how he survives both the places and the meals. The answer is, he threw himself into both with a gusto and with good expectations. This unintended lesson on life would be hard to improve on. Readers will be pleased to note how Mr. Bourdain leaves all his hosts delighted with his visit. This makes him the perfect guest. Very likely the aged Vietnamese army veteran was especially so, ever after being able to boast that he drank an American under the table.His hosts liked him because he liked them, without prejudice. What a wonderfully entertaining book this is. If this man can find the value, and the fun, in all that he ran into, you can't help but put the book down a bit more inspired."},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":"What a rollicking good adventure, and I appreciated his upfront admission that this trip was possible due to the wild success of Kitchen Confidential which he calls 'obnoxious' (in the best possible way, say I) and the fact that the Food Network was footing the bills and greasing the wheels. Wow, whose lamp do you have to rub to get that kind of sweet deal? He's such an endearing personna on the page that I can't begrudge him landing my dream ... I just wish it came with a tasting sampler.I loved this book, even when he's busting on my vegetarian kind - I appreciated his description of the Portugese pig slaughter too - honest and complex and I knew that the tofu alternative I'd be stuck eating wouldn't taste nearly as good as the rustic whole hog feast he partakes of a few pages later.Write us another one, Tony!"},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":"Bourdain's book A Cook's Tour is an exceptional tour of strange and interesting cuisine spanning the globe from Mexico to Portugal to France to Vietnam. He tells of a pig feast in Portugal, from the slaughter to the table. Of a full, entire sheep in Morocco. Of a bar-cum-shooting gallery in Cambodia with live grenades and AK-47's for sampling. And, of course, of the infamous cobra feast in Vietnam.Bourdain's style makes the book a quick and enjoyable read; his descriptions leap off the page (for better or worse--I could almost have done without a vivid characterization of eating natto or of the questionable French food Tete de veaux) and bring to life the exotic foods, locations, and people he meets. His gritty, no-nonsense approach makes everything seem all the more real and alive.Television fans may have seen Bourdain's show on Food Network and thus already be familiar with his culinary adventure, but the book is so much more and reveals every facet that failed to make it to the screen. If you enjoy travel or food writing, A Cook's Tour is a must-read."},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":"Tony has a few little twitches, doesn't he? He (quite rightly) disdains vegetarianism and the PETA folks, but he's not all that comfortable actually watching a pig or cobra or something get whacked. And it's a bit ironic that having (apparently) gotten over or at least past hard drugs, he's still a smoker. Oh, well. He still writes like Hunter Thomson without (most of) the mind altering rubbish, and ah, does he know food and cooks. Whatever you think of Chef Bourdain, you can't call yourself a cook or a gourmand unless you've read him."},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":"My husband spent 13 years in the kitchens, so we both fell in love with Bourdain's previous book Kitchen Confidential, which was right on the money. But in Cook's Tour, Bourdain really shows his talent. With stylish prose, intelligent humor, and a surprising element of humanity, Bourdain travels the world looking for good food, but it's his perspective on cultures and climates that really resonates. He takes us places we may never go and, lucky for us, gets the dysentery on our behalf. Picture Hunter S. Thompson and Michael Herr (Dispatches) writing a Lonely Planet guide. More geared for the traveler than the chef, this book is grittier than Paul Theroux and a heck of a lot more fun than any Frommer's Guide."},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":"Anthony Bourdain does it again with &quot;A Cook's Tour&quot;. In this book Anthony recounts his travels all over the world in search of the perfect meal. Beware...this book is at points rather graphic...and if you really don't want to know where your meat comes from, well..... From the dark depths of the Cambodian jungle to Thomas Keller's French Laundry, Bourdain leads the reader on an amazing journey of the palate. He stops at nothing in his quest, eating virtually anything and everything that is placed in front of him, all in the name of culinary journalism. The reader will likely be amazed at what many people eat throughout the world, but will certainly come away with a new respect for food, and an ambition to try things new and bizarre before passing judgment on what many other people would consider &quot;good eating&quot;."},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":"I found this book totally fun... totally unique. I read a bit of this book in a book store before i purchased it and was laughing so hard at someof his discriptions of food, i was crying. On one hand he is recording cultures thru their food on the other searching for what he feels is missing in more modern cultures. How some cultures continue to honor the *throw-away* type food (pigs ears... organs... feet of any kind... strange creatures of all kinds... fruits that smell so bad you cant imagine eating them until you do...)while others dont eat anything more exotic than dark meat chicken (as opposed to white meat chicken)he cant stand bobby flay or emeral (which is enough for me to feel a kindred spirit to him) yet clearly feels some of his choices are sending him on a similar path... ie...he took his tour looking for these hidden foods but had to take them accompanied by cameras and sometimes had to re-take scenes where he thanked the host several times... it seems to have made him feel less genuine, but he is resigned to it and really funny about it... his style of writing is converstaional. its not hard to read this book fairly quickly. i wish it were longer. his humor runs the gamut between very dry to wildly slapstick slapstick...its hard to know what is coming next... he found what was wrong and missing from alot of cook books....the humanity. with all its laughs... great dishes....dreadful misses.... and of course, palpating cobra hearts!"},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":"Bad boy chef Bourdain has produced a true gem here.The man who chopped and dished up a delicious Kitchen Confidential goes one better with this collection of tales of eating and cooking in an amazing array of international locales. It's not just food that makes this book so engaging. It's the travel tales, the glimpses of humanity, the quite perfect humor writing. Bourdain's account of riding shotgun in a Vietnamese sedan manages to top P. J. O'Rourke's side-splitting rules of third world driving. I think I laughed out loud during A Cook's Tour more than any other book, ever!Only downside is Bourdain's overly elaborated love of hashish &amp; tobacco, but the main thrust of this book is the author's world tour of eating for a cable food channel; he manages to infuse more humor into these chapters than there are calories in a Baked Alaska.It's a truly hilarious read. Great gift for either a foodie, an inveterate traveler, or anyone who appreciates good humor."},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":"I loved every word of this book; I am new to his writing having not read this work Kitchen Confidential so his approah to his craft was surprising and refreshing.I was particularly impressed with his total love for the craft/art of food preparation and his total enjoyment of the products in their many guises of that craft/art. I must use these terms together because, as he so clearly shows in his book, preparing sheeps head soup in the back garden of a colleague in Mexico is one thing but eating the other-worldly creations of Thomas Keller at the French Laundry in the Napa valley is decidedly something else.I took Bourdain at face value: when he said after entering a pub in Edinburgh, \\"I'm never leaving\\" or in Nha Trang, Vietnam after many good experiences says, \\"I love it here\\" or in Russia drinking vodka with black bread and sausage that it was \\"in many ways a perfect meal\\" you're left with a profound respect for a person who can love his surroundings and the food of those surroundings so much.I was impressed with his obvious love for the people, the places and the culinary glue that held it all together: as food lovers we can appreciate these feelings but to find them duplicated and articulated so well by a professional chef makes for a very good and heartwarming read.If you like food and travel you could not find a better book in which to indulge yourself."},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":"How does one top the success of Kitchen Confidential? Take the act on tour of course. Climb aboard the Bourdain express for a culinary road show that would have Bing, Bob and Dorothy scratching their heads in disbelief. The places that this man is willing to go and the things that he is willing to eat go above and beyond culinary passion. It's extreme eating. Durian fruit, live heart of a cobra (still beating), embryonic birds, assorted bugs. . . and these are just the appetizer! All these experiences and more are described in a style that will be familiar to Kitchen Confidential readers. Bourdain manages to come across as funny, honest, prickly and even sweetly sentimental (for a smart-[aleck]). It was fun to go on the journey with him. Too bad I can't take him along on my next trip, almost anything I do is going to feel dull in comparison."},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":"This book is a journal of Anthony Bourdain's travels across to try new foods. He travels a varied and sizable portion of the world, with each chapter describing a new location and new foods to eat. It is worth noting that this book was written during, and is the perfect complement to the show \\"Cook's Tour\\" on Food Network.This book is quick, fluid, and enjoyable. He delves into details that are fascinating, such as the history of a certain city, the rise of Mexican chefs, his French summer home, the dangers of Cambodia, and so much more.All in all, it's a great little read that mixes a little bit of history, cooking, multi-culturalism, and Bordain's opinionated sayings. Nothing spectacular, but a good fun book."},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":"The colossal irony of the Food Network series on which this book is based is the heart felt statements in the author's previous book \`Kitchen Confidential' that he will never get his own Food Network series. He goes on in that book to say some rather unflattering things about Emeril Lagasse that seem to be a guarantee that his prediction will come true.Well, Anthony Bourdain got his own Food Network show, and it is, to my lights, the most enjoyable travelogue style show they have ever done. I will warrant the prediction that it will also be the most enjoyable travelogue show they will ever do. I think the original 16 to 18 episodes are even better than the \`second season' episodes he did which were not in this book. In the follow-up episodes, Bourdain (or his handlers) tend to start parodying themselves and make more coy, self-referential statements such as the cute business when Tony is in New Orleans and he gets slugged by matronly women for dissing their favorite son, Emeril.In case you are not familiar with the Bourdain persona, I can quote a local paper's comparison to Emeril as the Food Network's star student, Alton Brown as the class nerd, and Tony Bourdain as the perennial juvenile delinquent. That is not to say Bourdain's view of things is juvenile. It is, in fact, as insightful as any other culinary commentary. The difference between Bourdain and other culinary travelers is that Bourdain is telling us about things from the inside, from the point of view of palate, tongue, nose, ears, and tummy. He is also talking from the inside in that he has been a working cook and chef for his whole life, who has seen just about everything the other culinary journalists have seen and more, including a stint at a childhood in France. The sardonic twist which gives Bourdain's reporting an outlaw flavor just adds to the entertainment value.One of the more successful realizations of this book is the author's interpretation of \`Extreme Cuisines' in the subtitle. This includes all the expected venues such as a boatride up the Southeast Asian River to Cambodia, with more than a few references to \`Apocalypse Now' and trips to Spain, Morocco, Russia, Mexico, Japan, and Scotland. How can you expect an exotic foods show not include haggis. But Bourdain also includes the very tame and very safe venue in Napa Valley called the French Laundry. While this site may be free of iguana meat or eels or lamb testicles, it is not safe for Bourdain's psyche and self-respect. This is the home ground of Thomas Keller, arguably the most distinguished chef in the country.To insulate himself from facing the Olympian cuisine of Keller alone, and to insure that he gets his invite for himself and his camera crew, Bourdain sits down to the meal with three very well-connected colleagues. These three musketeers are Scott Byron, the chef at the New York City restaurant Veritas, Michael Ruhlman, a journalist / chef and co-author of Keller's cookbook, and Eric Rippert, one of the most highly regarded chefs in New York City. As predicted, Bourdain is humbled by the French Laundry tasting menu. As an at best journeyman chef in a somewhat better than average New York bistro, Bourdain ponders his wasted talents when he sees what Keller has done with food. I'm sure Bourdain is crying all the way to the bank with proceeds from his journalistic products.One of Tony's colleagues has said Bourdain is a better writer than he was a chef. I believe it, because his writing is as entertaining as the professional writer Ruhlman, and even a touch more insightful due to his true insider's point of view.Not quite as good as \`Kitchen Confidential' but it does have all the stuff the Food Network could not show on television. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":"I must admit that I really like Bourdain. I'm a strict vegetarian, and he really knocks them in this book. But, simply put, he is a passionate writer. While I might not have liked to eat most of the things he describes, he describes them so well that I feel like I didn't miss out on anything--in the same way that I like war stories but have no desire to actually be in the fray. However, he is compassionate and honest. He witnesses a pig slaughter and describes it as an unpleasent experience, but he believes that since they use every part of it, and make it taste so good, that it makes sense. He sticks to his guns as far as his sense of what is good. If something tastes good or bad--he lets you know and why: especially vegetarians who overcook their vegetables, which could be the worst sin of all."},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":"Anthony Bourdain has a sweet job. Traveling the world, sampling its culinary delights...its the kind of job that one would never even imagine exists until someone creates it. And it is a bit odd that he should have this job. Anthony Bourdain is not a great writer, although he manages to turn a decent phrase. I have no idea if he is a great cook or not, but by his own admission he is not one of the greats. He is a great traveler, and has enough courage and sense of adventure to give it all a try, even though things don't always go well.Which is pretty much the same with \\"A Cook's Tour\\". I have never seen TV program that the book is based on, but I am a big fan of \\"No Reservations\\" so I suspected something along the same lines. This book follows much the same format of \\"No Reservations\\", with Bourdain hitting various culinary spots across the world and trying what they have to offer, no matter what that might be. A whole pig in Portugal. Haggis in Scotland. All the goodness Mexico has to offer. And of course the infamous cobra's heart in Vietnam. He doesn't like everything he tries, but he tries everything that is offered.Its good. Its interesting. One of the great things about Bourdain's style of travel-eating is that we could do it too. He doesn't hit the high-priced, pretty and polished restaurants that most readers of the books could never afford. He hits the street stalls, the home cooking, and wonders at the delights of the common meals that make everyone happy. I have been to a few of the places showcased on \\"A Cook's Tour\\", and it makes for a nice walk down memory lane to think of breakfast vodka in Russia, or deep-fried pizza in Glasgow.Strangely enough, I think the one place he didn't get it right was in Japan, which is where I happen to live. I was looking forward to see what he would have to say about the place, and what delights he tried and what he thought. Instead, he had a traditional kaiseki dinner at a ryokan in Atami, accompanied by no less than two geisha. We are talking probably a multi-thousand dollar event here, something experienced only by the very super-rich of the Japanese populace. Not exactly \\"eating local\\", and a bit of a disappointment."},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":"I am a total foodie- love the food network. Love Bourdain and almost anything he writes.... I especially turn to his books as an antidote to the nauseatingly perky, over exposed food network eye candy (ie: Rachael Ray).... On a serious note- the writing is great, the human commentary is right on track and he does know food."},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":"Who else but Tony Bourdain could get away with starting off a piece on food in Cambodia with a bitter rant against Henry Kissinger? Much less regale the reader with his various temper tantrums, drunken escapades and intestinal woes for more than 300 pages and still come out smelling like a rose. Bourdain only gets better in \\"A Cook's Tour,\\" a book whose limp title hardly reflects the bacchanalian revels within. The highlights in this book are often Bourdain's lowlights, his frequent bouts of melancholy and fits of pique against the indignities imposed by the TV crew trailing him around the word. And no one writing today has captured the sleazy half-life of expats in third-world Asia better than Bourdain in a few brilliant paragraphs on Phnom Penh. Travelers, food fans, fans of great writing, you'll treasure this book."},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":"I thought Kitchen Confidential was a good read but this book is even better.The details he gives you on the food he tries all over the world either make you salivate or want to vomit depending on what he is tasting.Half the fun of the book, however, is anthony's take on the countries, people, culture and adventures he has while in the countries. Some were so frightening it was like a suspense book. Others were endearing.At times I wished I were there with him and at others so glad I was not.Definately a fun read but also deeper than that. His chapter on going to France with his brother is more about the loss of their father and not being able to &quot;go back home&quot; again than about food. There are lots of chapters with similar hidden themes about life and human nature.Pick this one up!"},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":"I enjoyed this much better than Kitchen Confidential, because this book is about more the food, and less about Bourdain. And when the author writes about himself, he really touches more upon the human experience that everyone can relate to rather than the &quot;kitchen locker room&quot; stories that started getting tiresome in Kitchen Confidential. As the author searches for &quot;the perfect meal&quot; and goes to great lengths to find it, we begin to understand how food relates to people live not only in the places he travels to, but all over the world. A major sub-plot is Bourdain's self-parady as a culinary celebrity as the Food Network films him on his travels which became the Cook's Tour series still shown on the Food Network.The book starts with Tony and his brother returning to France, and the memories they had growing up, many involving food. Rarely are the words &quot;touching&quot; and &quot;Tony Bourdain&quot; used in the same sentence, but the passage where Tony Bourdain talks about his deceased father is indeed touching.From here, we learn of Bourdain's love of Vietnam, harrowing adventures in Cambodia, a trip to St. Petersberg, Russia through a haze of vodka, eating deadly fish in Japan, and other journeys. There seems to be no place on earth the author won't go, and nothing too bizarre to ingest at least once.The chapter on San Francisco was a riot, with a long rant against vegetarians that was entertaining because of its great energy and because it held a few nuggets of truth beneath the bluster. Anyone who watches the Cook's Tour episodes on the Food Network will appreciate the &quot;behind the scenes&quot; commentary, which usually involve Bourdain confessing he was drunk or stoned when various segments were shot.Of course, the quest for the perfect meal is pointless, as Bourdain concedes at the end of the book. We also find out that trying exotic dishes isn't necessarily what it's cracked to be. Cobra bile tastes exactly as appetizing as it sounds.Books like this are about the quest and the truths found along the way, not the final destination itself. This is a great ride."},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":"I'm new to reading travel books. I read \\"Blue Highways\\" in college and Bill Bryson's book about the Appalachian Trail recently. I guess I've been lucky so far...this is a good read in that vein. Neither of my last two finds are Earth shattering, but that's what makes them inspirational and sort of a bit-more-than-commonplace. What I mean is, it inspires you to try new things that you really can do on a realistic scale.I've seen the Food Network show that the book builds upon. You'll read about what your not seeing. That's the beauty. On the TV show you may see Tony grimace through eating igauna for a moment, but in the book you get a great description of just how horrible it was. Or how he had to re-shoot his entrance to a restaurant---after a full course meal with waitress-induced drinks.It's all about taking the cooking show out of the kitchen and getting adventurous. Can you see Emiril(sp?) sleeping in a floor-to-ceiling tiled dive hotel and then helping kill what he eats? Or haggling to buy a whole goat, riding camels over sand dunes all day (i can't see either Emeril or Mario doing that...unless it's on a Supercamel), and finally drinking beer, smoking hash, and eating the goat? Me either. And it's done with a great description of getting the goat and even the mud covered oven it's cooked in. The night sky. The campfire jokes.In a nutshell, if you like cooking shows, like cooking, and like travelling, then give this book a whirl. This would be a great book to take traveling as it will inspire you to dig beyond the well-travelled main streets in search of the authentic experience wherever you are. Sights, sounds, smells, and tastes. Tony's NY city-boy point of view only accentuates the more rural experiences in the book.A good read on it's own, it's really fun to watch the episodes after reading about them---or vice versa. The writing style is easily read and satisfying. A taste of what it's like to be in Vietnam or Russia in search of good food. I'd like to go on a trip like this---and with a knowledgable street-wise chef like Tony. I can't afford to yet (maybe never). Reading the book is OK for now. NOTE: Tony's experiences that involve animal slaughter are not handled lightly. Tony takes it very seriously and explains coming to terms with the realization that all meat comes via a death. Slaughters in the book, and there are only two or three, are done not in large slaughter-houses but by every-day people in various countries getting their freshest food the best way they can---live at a market or in their yard. They then have Tony eat in their homes, around their tables."},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":"In some ways, I don't even know why I'm writing a \\"review\\" of this book. I loved it. I was destined to love it. This makes my opinions even more biased than usual. I'll try to impart some advice though, that will help you decide whether or not you should read this wonderful piece of travel narrative-cum-food worship.The television show that coincided with this book, also called A Cook's Tour, aired on Food Network somewhere around the time that I started getting hooked into this station on a regular basis. I had no idea what the premise was; I was just witnessing this cynical guy eating strange food in strange places. As I kept watching it, I came to realize that it was more than a tv series. In fact it wasn't a series at all. It was a project or journey: find the best meal in the world. Of course, I'm sure the pitch to Food Network executives was a bit more detailed, but if you asked Tony Bourdain that's probably how he'd sum it up.On each episode of this show, Tony would visit a different place, usually a different country, and find the best food, the most local food, the stuff deeply rooted in the community itself. He was always hosted by locals; a Russian grandmother, a Brazilian beach bum, Vietnamese veterans. He usually assists in the procuring of the ingredients too. He visits fish markets or barters for lamb. More than a food show, this is truly an observation of food culture in other parts of the world. Tony is, or at least tries to be, as unobtrusive as possible, to blend in. Frequently, this is ruined by overinquisitive children or wary old folks, but the effort shows. It views as much like a documentary as a food show.All this love for the show made me fearful of the book. I resisted reading it a bit, because of how much I loved the show. I read Kitchen Confidential first. I was afraid that the book would simply be a transcript of the show or, at best, first person perspective of all the events I had seen during the show. Not so in the least!After reading the book, I discovered that it manages to be the perfect compliment to the show. Not only is it not just first person accounting, it's new stuff, not even alluded to on the show. Sure we see the meals, but they're almost glossed over in favor of recounting the introduction to the location or the absolute disgust Tony has over what he might be forced to eat at the time.The opposite side of this coin of course, is that I'm not sure how it reads for someone who hasn't seen the show. I could see how the visuals in the book could not be as effective if you didn't have actual images to pair them with. Don't let this discourage you though, it's a great read in and of itself. It's obvious the writing talent that Bourdain has developed over five books. It serves as a plenty good travel narrative also, if that's how you come to it. Either way, it's a worthwhile read for just about anyone who finds some interest in some facet of the subject matter. To get the full experience though, pair it with the show."},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":"Although not as engaging as &quot;Kitchen Confidential&quot; &quot;A Cook's Tour&quot; is a fun jaunt around the gourmet globe. Traveling near (San Francisco) and Far (Cambodia) Bourdain chrinicles his tasting of local food and sipping of local drink.If you are a &quot;foodie&quot; or restaurant junkie, you may be put off by this book as it will not tell you the best restuarants to visit or the best chefs to look up. This book is all about the FOOD.And, although I would not eat half the things Mr. Bourdain put in his mouth, reading about it something I savor."},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":".... While yes the \\"Naked Chef\\" guy's recipes are delicious, where is he cooking for a living? Besides on TV? Being a chef myself I appreciate and respect the hours Chef Bourdain has ACTUALLY put \\"on-line\\" cooking his [butt] off. And his love AND respect for the food he prepares comes through not only on the plates at Les Halles but also in his words. This guy has truly represented the chef, not as some untouchable man-god genius but as we really are, smart-... hardworking, hard-drinking can-do-anything-because-we-say-we-can people. We are not \\"artists\\" we're con men, we sell illusion. And as such, I couldn't think of a better, more honest spokesman the Mr. Bourdain. The Naked Chef? Emril? All I can say is thanks for making my paycheck bigger now that the average person knows what foie gras is. I'll just add some garlic and \\"BAM\\" boost the price......."},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":"It's subtitled, 'In Search of the Perfect Meal', but really, it should be, 'What's the Grossest Thing You Ever Ate?' The point here is not perfection, nor even exotica. The author does explain later...way later...in the book that a perfect meal is in attitude and not the ingredients, which is reasonable, but that still seems unfair to book-buyers who may be expecting it to actually be about food as opposed to raw snake innards. Just so we understand that the author is a manly sort of chef... his idea of a perfect meal seems to be something freshly slaughtered, something that was someone else's pet, or better still, both. Indeed, his attitude towards food is odd; like an anorexic, he seems to have both a fascination and a revulsion for it.Once you get past expecting him to be a foodie and let him be a story-teller, he's rather entertaining, in the manner of a drunken uncle telling tales of his travels... His disappointment at not getting fugu poisoning struck me as droll and I laughed long and hard over that, but that's probably just me."},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":"Well, Bourdain has admittedly decided to succumb to the television siren, as documented in this entertaining journal of his recent travels. While I was not a great fan of \\"Kitchen Confidential\\", having been prepared for his overpowering self confidence by that book, I found this an interesting and more enjoyable read.Bourdain desperately wants to portray himself as the bad boy of chefs; sort of a chef's Mick Jagger, compared with a Paul McCartney, or perhaps a Peter Pan goes bad. He seems to define badness by the extent to which he is willing to engage in self destructive behavior: excessive consumption of alcohol (actually the anecdotes are nauseating just to read about), chain smoking, and blithely consuming food prepared in conditions of questionable hygiene. And that is before you consider what he eats.Bourdain also definitely wants you to know he is macho; he may be a chef, but absolutely nothing effete about him; he goes to great lengths to demonstrate this; in fact it almost seems his life quest. He proves this by what he is willing to eat, e.g.: the still beating heart of a cobra, potentially toxic blowfish, and by distain for vegetarian cuisine, which he here again not only defines as inferior, but by implication effeminine. Hmmm. And, he goes into the dark heart of Khmer Rouge controlled Cambodia, getting off on firing semi-automatic weapons, in uncomfortable, sleazy, and decidedly hazardous circumstances. I didn't quite get how this related to his quest for new culinary experiences, but damn he's bad!The descriptions of Vietnam and its cuisine were perhaps the best part of this work. It was interesting to have his descriptions of eating in France refute the suggestion that the French are the world gold standard in cuisine, and his journal of his experiences in Mexico were warm and enticing.I settled on this in the airport when seeking an appropriate diversion during long flights. In this book Bourdain has mellowed a bit in his intense distain for opinions contrary to his; however, be prepared for a self congratulatory celebration of excessive consumption and self destructive habits as an art form."},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":"Enjoyed hearing a taped version of A COOK'S TOUR by Anthony Bourdain, the chef who left his job to discover the perfect meal . . . his journey took him to Japan, Cambodia, Saigon, France, and many other locales . . . that part was interesting; what was even more so was the author's description of the many foods he sampled (many of them reminding me of stuff that folks devour on FEAR ACTOR), such as blowfish, the live heart of a cobra and a bird's nest . . . my only regret that I've never gotten to see the TV show that came about as a result of Bourdain's travels."},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":"I first read Kitchen Confidental, which I found wasa wonderful book, sooo I was looking forward to a CooksTour. I found it wonderful as well. He tried foodthat I would not touch if it was living, much lessdead. The fact that he tried blow fish, which in hisbook mentions that fact you could die if not cookedright. It was very brave on his part. I have to saythat at times I was reading this book while I waseating lunch and at times had to put it down. The snakewine, no thank you. If you want to read a book aboutfood and how many food there is out there, you willbe amazed. Some places over seas, the do not waste onepart of the meat, example was pig.

I am learning about my ethnic history too!"},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":"I am a big Anthony Bourdain fan. I couldn't wait to get this book. I thoroughly enjoyed the first half of it, although some of the slaughter descriptions were a bit disturbing (I love animals). There were some truly moving chapters in there and some very interesting stuff. However, it really started to slow down after a while. Each chapter seemed pretty much like the chapter before. I guess that is to be expected, but it really got less interesting. And the descriptions of animals being slaughtered started to get to me after a while. I have maybe 1/4 of the book left and I'm not inclinded to pick it up anymore. Felt like he was just trying to fill pages for some of the chapters."},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":"I have the feeling that Mr. Bourdain would hate the title that I have given to this review. I have the feeling that he is trying for something harder-edged and more gritty than \\"a fun culinary romp\\". All the same, this is how I would characterize it.A Cook's Tour has obviously had heavier editing and more attention to structure thanKitchen Confidential. It serves the book well, because while in Kitchen Confidential I struggled over Bourdan's attempt to create Fear and Loathing in the Kitchen, I had no such problem with A Cook's Tour. His skill and tone are best suited to these small chapters-- little moments of eating spread out across the world.The reflexive nature of his observations about the creation of his own television show work well. It is easy to imagine him wondering what he has let himself in for, and the uneasy relationship between his self-image and his new role as the charmingly bad boy chef of American television. I particularly enjoyed the writing about Vietnam and the chapter on the French Laundry. I enjoyed less his political opinions, even when I agreed with them (surprisingly often). It didn't seem to fit with the book and felt like a desire to add a justificatory footnote to the television program.Recommended for foodies looking for a light, entertaining read."},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":"I loved eating vicariously through Bourdain and will recommend this book to anyone who's into food/cooking/travelling. The pursuit of the perfect meal sounds rather silly and impossible, which the author also acknowledges, but is fraught with lots of fun! I like Bourdain's candid writing style and found myself snickering/laughing/giggling while reading the book. There are also moments that I think anyone can identify with him, specifically, when he was reminiscing about foods he ate in his childhood.As a cooking/baking/food enthusiast, I thought it's really cool to have a glimpse of the world from a chef's viewpoint. Before reading this book, I didn't like Anthony Bourdain because I thought he was intentionally abrasive and rude. However, after reading this book, I can't get enough of reading him. I wish I could watch the TV series of the same name somehow but there are no DVDs of it. Anyway, this is a totally worthy, fun read from start to finish!"},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":"This is a travelogue about eating. Bourdain decides he wants to sample the best of what's out there, and he travels far and wide to find what he's looking for. He doesn't exactly find THE perfect meal, but he does get to eat a lot of perfect meals and taste some darn good cooking. On the other hand, he also sampled some truly vile stuff, like raw cobra bile, that wiser souls would not allow past their lips. Bourdain's style is rather wild- -if profanity offends you, this book is not for you.Bourdain is an evangelical meat eater. Indeed, a central theme of the book is his relationship to the animals that are slaughtered for his consumption. In the beginning of the book, he attends his first pig slaughter, describing to us such details as pulling the excrement out of the dead pig's anus. Similar stories are told of slaughtering a lamb in Morocco and a turkey in Mexico, culminating in his swallowing a still-beating cobra heart in Vietnam. At several points, he dissolves into a rant about the evils of vegetarianism, and he declares that the worst meal that he ate in the tour was a vegan meal in California. On the issue of to eat or not to eat meat, I am open-minded- -I will eat steaks or vegetarian lasagna with equal gusto. The question for me boils down to whether the cook knew what he or she was doing, has chosen fresh items, and is capable of preparing them appropriately. Everyone needs to make their own choices about what they put into their bodies, and nobody (with the possible exception of your own parents) should have the presumption to tell you what you should or shouldn't eat. Bourdain might have saved his anti-vegetarian rants for a specifically political tome. After all, I'm sure he enjoyed a number of completely vegetarian dishes in Asia, but considered them acceptable because their ethnicity was Asian and not vegan.For a world tour to find the perfect meal, Bourdain picked an odd itinerary. Yes, France, Portugal, Mexico, and Vietnam were all musts. He only had one year, so he couldn't fit in Italy, Thailand, or Argentina. But somehow he found time for Russia, England and...Scotland? He must have had ulterior motives for choosing these locations besides looking for good food. Let's see- -in Russia, every good meal was accompanied by enough vodka to drown a sailor, so it's hard to believe he could remember the meals afterwards accurately enough to write about them. And in Scotland, I'm sure even the deep-fried Mars bars that he tried tasted good with enough beer. And in the end, it's hard to take this guy seriously as food connoisseur because he's a smoker. Face it, Tony, your taste buds are dead. If you want to really taste good food, you've got to give up the smokes."},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":"After reading Kitchen Confidential and not being overly impressed, but somewhat entertained, I thought I'd give Bourdain another chance. Well, that was the last one. Sure, he can write, and vividly too, but that's not enough. The bitching, the drugs and the booze get tiring after the tenth \\"adventure\\". He spends way too much energy cultivating his renegade and rebellious stance, trying to convince the reader, it seems, that he's different, he's unconventional, he's not your average chef, and people who wear Lands' End clothes are morons. This wears thin and, ultimately, it's not about the food anymore, but about Anthony and his attitude. Grow up Anthony (or go back to the kitchen and forget about the Food Network)."},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":"Is it just me or did anyone else out there feel that Anthony Bourdain, while mildly amusing at times, isn't the world's greatest writer and should rather stick to what he's doing best - cooking? I dunno but I find the man patronizing and opinionated, and hence irritating. I am lucky enough to have traveled to most of the countries he describes in the book, from Cambodia to Scotland, from Portugal to Japan, from Morocco to Russia, from France to England, and I have stayed and eaten with locals. I have tried whatever local delicacies they served me there.... live crab and hundred-year-eggs to name but a couple. Some I appreciated, others I didn't like so much. So I understand where he's coming from. And I can also see his self-deprecating sense of humor which is refreshing. But all those &quot;let's get senselessly drunk&quot; stories become repetitive and boring after a while. Oh, and if you read this, Tony - why the heck do you keep having such a go at Germans? Not that I am one but I find your petty prejudices - from &quot;thick-ankled German women&quot; to &quot;disturbing German porn&quot; pretty darn unfair."},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":"I read Kitchen Confidential with an unexpected glee. I loved it, loved Anthony Bourdain, from soup to nuts. Not only was Bourdain personally appealing to me with his sense of humor, his blatant honesty and deep complexities; his writing was from the gut, proud, dirty and utterly truthful. But this piece of tripe (one of Bourdain's admitted food dislikes)was somewhat like watching Silence of the Lambs on an unending cycle. It does nothing for your appetite.Bourdain is a vivid and descriptive writer, but in this book, he is sloppy, clumsy, cliched and digging in hard for shock value. He commits travesties against animals (that are committed somewhere in the world everyday, but without perhaps so penitent an observer) by either watching them be tortured and slaughtered for his own dining pleasure (a pig in Portugal and a lamb in Morocco) or participating in the execution himself (toward the end of the book he kills a turkey for dinner in Mexico and shoots rabbits for stew). The cruelty seems excessive and the gross-out is in the definite extreme. I don't believe for one minute that the man loves food; I believe he needs fodder for his inebriated story-telling to impress the cheffies back home. He is all swagger here, no substance.The brutality is enough to make a meat lover reconsider, which seems to go entirely against the point Bourdain is trying to make. Wait - what is that point? That if we are going to eat meat we should participate in the slaughter? Or that we shouldn't eat meat unless we respect that we've killed a living thing? Or that we should use every single bit of a pig that is slaughtered and that makes up for it? What the hell was his point?Here's what it did to me - made my eyes well up for the poor freaking pig and decide that perhaps I might be happier with overcooked vegetables with the... Vegans.For all his bravado, I sensed there were many things Bourdain didn't really feel comfortable with, and wondered why he didn't just say, uh...no thanks. But then I guess when you sell your soul to Food Network you've got to eat a few still beating cobra hearts.Bourdain thinks he covers the whole sell-out thing, by saying, yeah, I sold out - what of it - but it ruins his first book in the process. In that book he poised himself as the anti-Emeril, but the truth is, now he's playing on the same team, just hiding behind his cool factor, playing the overaged rebel who is still smoking hash, drinking like a frat boy and hoping everybody out there in tvland thinks he's quite the maverick.The love is gone, man. It's been replaced with epic disappointment in a writer/chef I admired.Note: I did actually become a Vegan!

I don't care if we lose the war--we're professionals, man\\" (217) are just two occasions for the cooking as Vietnam War metaphor that pervades the book. In _A Cook's Tour_, Bourdain actually goes to Vietnam and to Cambodia in search of food. I'm uncomfortable from the very start. The first sentence refers to \\"those not-so-adorable scamps, the Khmer Rouge\\"--\\"scamps\\"!? Are we also going to talk about those \\"rascals, the Nazis\\"? Authors of one of the terrific holocausts of the last century...Bourdain's cultural deafness is ever striking; he goes so far as to suggest that the US involvement in Vietnam was part of a lovers' quarrel (he thinks Vietnamese women are beautiful). Bourdain's tone is, of course, ironic, but I, for one, don't think he can get away with irony in such cases. His books are worth reading, but with caution. The metaphors can kill you."},{"Title":"Cooks Tour","review":"It's certainly an interesting idea - send a chef out to sample various exotic cuisines in search of the perfect combination of food, place, setting. But they picked the wrong guy.I cannot believe this man can taste food, much less be a professional chef. He is destroying his taste buds, through the abuse of alcohol and nicotine, not to mention myriad forms of cannabis and the occasional cocaine amuse-nez. His idea of a good time is to get so drunk he can't remember what he did, swear a lot, and in general behave like the kind of jerk you wouldn't want at the table next to you. I think he suffers from testosterone-poisoning."},{"Title":"No Limits (Star Trek New Frontier)","review":"I have read &quot;New Frontier&quot; since the beginning, and I was a bit reticent to pick up this anthology, wondering what these new voices would bring to the universe Peter David built. Indeed, I was curious as to what, exactly, the stories would be; as David says in the introduction, it was a tough decision to decide where the stories should take place, and ultimately they are all in the various characters' pasts, which makes for an interesting read.The results of &quot;No Limits&quot; are wonderful, illuminating the established characters with new details, explanations, and purpose. Every story adds something new to the characters, whether it is Calhoun's loyalty to Picard (the opener, &quot;Loose Ends&quot;), Kebron's love for fish (the aptly titled &quot;Waiting for G'Doh&quot;), Morgan's quest to end her existence (&quot;Alice, on the Edge of Night&quot;), or Burgoyne's life-altering experience with &quot;visions&quot; (&quot;Through the Looking Glass&quot;).The standouts in the anthology are David Mack's Kebron tale, which offers great insight into his psyche and gives new meaning to &quot;stoicism;&quot; both of the Soleta stories, one which shows us of her fateful first meeting with Rajari, the second which gives us Spock; Josepha Sherman's &quot;Turning Point&quot; which finds Si Cwan as an adolescent coming to the realization that the Royal Court of Thallon does not sit well with his conflicting opinions of high and low castes; and, of course, Peter David's tale of Shelby and Calhoun's ill-fated honeymoon. Oh, and we finally get to meet Morgan Korsmo and see that oft-referred to incident, Wolf-359, and the battle waged on the &quot;Excalibur.&quot;This is a great addition to any &quot;New Frontier&quot; fan's library, or any Trek fan's for that matter. This also works as an adequate introduction into the hearts and minds of the characters that have been changing since 1997. Pick it up. It's one of the best Trek anthologies out there, and it's great to see some new voices add their talents to the ever-expanding crews of the &quot;Excalibur&quot; and the &quot;Trident.&quot;"},{"Title":"No Limits (Star Trek New Frontier)","review":"After reading Ilsa J.

She has a deft command of language and phrasing that left me gasping. Other people have griped about her writing, but I find it refreshing and captivating. I hope to see more by her in the Trek universe. Several reviewers at the Well of Souls website mentioned having her do a series. That's a good idea.Other terrific stories: David Mack's Kebron story, Sherman's story about an adolescent Si Cwan, and, of course, Peter David's tale of Calhoun's and Shelby's honeymoon.Please, someone -- do this again.

Please."},{"Title":"No Limits (Star Trek New Frontier)","review":"I tend to avoid short story collections, as short story collections tend to vary in quality; but this is a collection of short stories set in the Star Trek: New Frontier series that was crafted by Peter David, and since he was the editor, I gave it a shot. Lately, as another reviewer has mentioned, I have been frustrated with where the series is going (too heavy handed, too humerous in a blunt way), but these stories were a complete change of pace, and in a very good way. They are reminiscent of the DS9 relaunch, where various authors have obviously been given an outline to follow, but granted creative expression.The stories take turns with the various characters of the New Frontier cast, and as such, I found some of them quite interesting (Shelby switching from engineering to command track, a diary-entry story featuring Lefler, a really solid bit of character study for McHenry), but others, based on characters I couldn't really care all that much for (Kebron, Si Cwan), just didn't do much for me.However, a few of the stories blew me away. Most notably, the one about Morgan Primus (Robin Lefler's immortal mother), was done with such a deft touch of emotionality that I actually got choked up, which is rare enough with Star Trek in general, but very rare in short story Trek fiction. I honestly place it on a level with the TNG episode \\"The Inner Light.\\" Yes, that good. I, too, will be seeking more stories from Ilsa J. Bick.Which brings me around to the good part about short story collections - that you often meet a new author worthy of more research and reading. All in all this was quite good, and if you're an anal collector of Trek such as myself, you'll want it.'Nathan"},{"Title":"No Limits (Star Trek New Frontier)","review":"In his introduction to NO LIMITS, an anthology of eighteen short stories involving the New Frontier characters, Peter David notes that when this volume was first announced some fans expressed reservations at the idea of having authors other than David himself dabbling in the New Frontier sandbox. If you've got doubts, you can put them to rest. This is an excellent collection of rewarding stories by authors who amply demonstrate that they know the characters they are writing about.One of the pleasures of reading a large collection such as this is that the order you read the stories in doesn't matter, every time you pick the volume up there is something new and different to look forward to. Some stories will capture your imagination more than others but within the pages of NO LIMITS the reader gets to experience a little bit of everything--comedy, drama, action and adventure. The various authors effectively use their individual storytelling styles to explore key moments in the characters lives, and every story to some degree just adds to the overall tapestry of New Frontier. And while my own personal favorites of the collection, \\"Waiting for G'Doh\\", \\"Q'uandary\\", \\"Lefler's Logs\\", &quot;Performance Appraisal\\", \\"Making a Difference\\", &quot;The Road to Edos&quot;, \\"A Little Getaway\\" and &quot;Out of the Frying Pan&quot;, may not be your own, I have no doubts that anyone reading NO LIMITS should find plenty to satisfy."},{"Title":"No Limits (Star Trek New Frontier)","review":"I understand there was some trepidation over 'giving' Peter David's New Frontier characters to others to write, but after reading the stories contained in this anthology, I believe there was no need to worry. That these were stories written *prior* to the characters' becoming a team on Excalibur did, I suppose, lessen the pressure, but still, it was a task that couldn't have been done without minding the 'future' David's already written. Each author picked a character and wrote a story - and each did so with flair, not some little humor, plenty of continuity, and an obvious love of the New Frontier universe in the first place.I noticed one or two errors that smacked of haste in putting this book together, but those in no way diminished the overall enjoyment of it. Go ahead and buy this book - and then test your mettle at next year's Shore Leave convention by getting as many authors as you can to autograph the thing!"},{"Title":"No Limits (Star Trek New Frontier)","review":"I obviously disagree with the other reviewers about the quality of this collection. It is a series of short stories covering an episode in the past of the main characters in the New Frontiers series. A few of the stories are entertaining, some of them are just annoying.The book starts off with an adventure of Mac when he worked as a lone operative. I thought the logic and motivations of the story were so poorly thought out that the unbelievability of them ruined the story for me.Shelby's story was just purely boring. The author thought they could take a tale of data analysis and make something fascinating out of it. The author failed. Not only was it boring, but the detail of the supposed data analysis just sounded trite and ignorant of the intended subject. Zack Kebron's story was an extended joke. It had its humorous side, but was far to long for the mediocre punch lines. Dr. Selar' story was, I thought, one of the more interesting, and was a worthy read. Si Cwan's story was OK, but nothing extra special.I think that all the writers involved are capable of much better work than was evidenced in this collection. A few of the stories look like they had some real work and thought put into them. Most of them appear to have been quickly dashed off to get a cut of the book, and no more.Since these stories don't really impact the continuing series of novels, it can safely be skipped without missing anything. If you are a completest, read it. Its not a complete waste of time, but it is not nearly as entertaining as Peter David's novels in this series are."},{"Title":"No Limits (Star Trek New Frontier)","review":"This anthology is excellent, although with my tastes, it was a mixed bag. A couple of the stories were a bit more simplistic than I would have hoped for, and some had pretty jarring inconsistencies (the ones that got to me most were in the story about Soleta's first encounter with Rajari). However, that aside, as a general thing, the book is definitely worth getting, especially for a New Frontier fan. Most of the stories offer quite a bit of insight into the character of focus, and none of the plots dragged (although I have to admit, I was in a hurry and skipped &quot;Redemption&quot; the first time through; I am planning on reading it, but can't review it at this time). My personal favorites were &quot;Alice, on the Edge of Night,&quot; about Morgan Primus (it was fantastic), and although I can't think of a positive thing to say about D'ndai's character, &quot;A Lady of Xenex&quot; was my other favorite. None of the stories except his own had Peter David's sense of whatever it is that governs NF (I chose to believe it's irony), which I missed, but even for that, the book doesn't come up wanting."},{"Title":"No Limits (Star Trek New Frontier)","review":"I haven't been keeping up on my New Frontier reading, the series of Star Trek books by Peter David about Captain Mackenzie Calhoun and his crew of the starship Excalibur (which has recently been split up into two ships, I understand). Nevertheless, I decided to ask my library to get a copy of the New Frontier short story anthology, No Limits. The series is exclusively written by Peter David, so it was interesting to see how these characters would be handled by other writers (though edited by David).Perhaps I expected to be able to catch up before it came in to the library, I don't know. But it didn't, and I realize after finishing the book that it may have been a mistake to read this book first. It doesn't contain many spoilers for the book series (except for the New Frontier timeline at the back of the book), but it tells some of the back story of a lot of the New Frontier characters, some of whom I haven't met yet. These stories also give us history to some of the conflicts that are currently taking place in the series, such as that between Kat Mueller and Cray, the Andorian. Of course, I haven't encountered either one of these characters before, so the story (\\"Performance Appraisal,\\" by Allyn Gibson) lost a lot of its impact. It's still a well-told story, and I did enjoy it, but the nuances were completely missed.That being said, the anthology was a hit and miss affair, but most of the stories were at least entertaining. In the aforementioned \\"Performance Appraisal,\\" we get the story of Kat Mueller when she was still an assistant chief engineer on the Grissom as she vies for the position of \\"nightside\\" commander. She has developed a new method of detecting cloaked Romulan warships that they are testing near the Neutral Zone. Unfortunately, they come upon a Romulan ship that claims they have crossed the border and threatens to blow them to pieces. It will take quick thinking from Mueller to save the ship and prevent the Romulans from figuring out exactly why they were there in the first place. Even without knowing the characters, the story is still extremely well-written and fun (especially seeing the Romulan commander, Tomalok, again). Cray's malevolence is palpable, especially in the final scene which obviously leads up to what's happening in the book series now.Another good story is the first one, \\"Loose Ends,\\" by Dayton Ward. This tells the story of an intelligence mission when Calhoun was working for Starfleet Intelligence, involving the aftermath to the \\"Next Generation\\" episode, \\"The Pegasus.\\" Picard has agreed to turn over the illegal Federation cloaking device that as on the Pegasus. Calhoun has been tasked with infiltrating the Romulan ship and destroying it. The way he does so is quite ingenious, and Ward's story is definitely a great way to kick of the anthology. The story has an energy and a wit that is very much in the vein of Peter David, though it doesn't sink into silliness as David's work sometimes can. I did think that Calhoun succeeded a little too easily in his task, but that would be the only fault I can think of. The writing is crisp, the story moves quickly, and Ward packs a lot into a few pages, showcasing Calhouns sense of loyalty (to Picard, who sponsored him for Starfleet).The best story in the anthology, though, is David Mack's \\"Waiting for G'Doh,\\" or \\"How I Learned to Stop Moving and Hate People.\\" This is an early story in Zak Kebron's life. Zak is a Brikar, huge and rock-like, with a wicked sense of humour (though it's not really in evidence in this story). He's assigned a mission of staking out a park on the planet Iban, where a Federation bureaucrat named G'Doh is meeting some Cardassian agents to pass on some secrets. Zak, being rather conspicuous, is going to be beamed inside a statue in the park, where he will have to remain motionless until the meeting takes place. His only point of contact with the outside world is Sotak, the Intelligence agent who communicates with him about the constant delays in the meeting. Poor Zak suffers all the indignities, including having a bird do its business on him, all of which he has to suffer silently. This leaves nothing but his thoughts, and those are hilarious as told by Mack. This is one of the few stories in the book that really seems to capture the Peter David humour. From the title of the story to all of the jokes inside, to the seemingly never-ending wait for the arrival of the G'Doh, this story doesn't miss a beat. Even more surprising, since nothing actually happens in the story until the end (which, I guess is probably more than happens in the original play). I couldn't stop laughing while reading this story.The rest of the stories in No Limits are range from fairly good to pretty good. Some of the stories seem quite inconsequential while others obviously set up parts of the book series. For me, the least interesting stories were \\"Redemption,\\" about the origins of the god of the Redeemers, Xant, and Terri Osborne's \\"Q'uandry,\\" where Dr. Selar meets the female Q entity from the Voyager television series. Osborne's writing was fine, and tried to salvage the story, but it used one of my least favourite episodes from the series (the Q civil war) and was based on the in-joke that Selar and the female Q were played by the same person. It just didn't grab me. Xant's story might have if I were more familiar with the Redeemers.Ultimately, I am glad that I read No Limits. I may have to reread it once I have caught up on the books, to see if it resonates a little more with me. On the other hand, I was gifted with being able to read some good stories by a lot of the current crop of Trek writers, in addition to a few I had never known before. If you're a New Frontier fan, you definitely have to pick this up.David Roy"},{"Title":"No Limits (Star Trek New Frontier)","review":"i used to like new frontier, but i thought that Peter David's writing was getting too obvious. his jokes are all really heavy handed and not very funny. but i was curious to see what other writers did with the characters, so i bought no limits.this was a great idea. since Peter edited the book, maybe he'll see how to write more subtle. David Mack's Zak Kebron story is funnier than anything Peter has written in years. i thought that Terri Osborne's Selar story was going to be a stupid joke story when i realized that it had two of Suzie Plakson's characters in it, but Terri's a really good writer, and made the joke work. Peg Robinson made calhoun's brother into a much more interesting character, and most of the other stories were pretty cool too. some werre only okay, like Kieth deCandido's Soleta story and Loren Coleman's Shebly story, but pretty much all of them were good.the best is Ilsa Bick's Morgan story, which is the best story in the book and was worth buying the book all by itself. i wasn't going to read Isla's well of souls novel because i don't care about captain garrett, but now i'm going to because her Morgan primus story was so great."},{"Title":"No Limits (Star Trek New Frontier)","review":"And this book is a testimony to that earned &quot;greatness&quot; and was sheer pleasure to read, not to mention own.

Being an avid fan of sci-fi in general, however, it would be an injustice on my part not to mention the many other old and new sci-fi works that both led me to Star Trek and which have forever forged my love for all sci-fi works: &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot;, &quot;Puppet Masters&quot;, &quot;Foundation&quot;, &quot;2001&quot;, &quot;2010&quot;, &quot;Rendezvous with Rama&quot;, &quot;Ringworld&quot;, all the &quot;Star Trek&quot; and &quot;Star Wars&quot; books, as well as books as new to the genre as &quot;Advent of the Corps&quot; and others."},{"Title":"Bocas del Tiempo (Spanish Edition)","review":"Eduardo Galeano, once again, gives us a clear notion of world history through small little stories.

Hersey interviewed survivors of the American nuclear attack against Hiroshima, Japan shortly after the end of the Second World War. The interviews took place literally before the ashes were cool. Their story is one of tremendous suffering; the power of the weapon is amazing. Stories of people immediately vaporized, leaving behind only a shadow on a wall, eyeballs melted out of their sockets, flesh turned to liquid and people dying painful deaths days after the explosion.There are some that think a nuclear war is survivable, if that is your opinion, you should read this book. It is the most moving and disturbing description of what a nuclear war would really be like. Furthermore, it must be understood that the atomic bomb exploded over Hiroshima was a mere firecracker compared to the power of a hydrogen bomb."},{"Title":"Paideia: The Ideals of Greek Culture, Vol. 3: The Conflict of Cultural Ideals in the Age of Plato","review":"The book shows how the greek people were the first to concentrate their attention on the perfection of MAN and his place in society. Jaeger traces this fact from Homeric times through Plato and explains it through many outstanding writers such as Hesiod, Solon, Sophocles, and many more. He shows the powerful Ideals of the greeks in all their beauty which continue to live on in the world today. He reveals how Poetry, Philosophy, Rhetoric, Politics, Medicine, etc. have their basis in the quest to reach the highest standard imaginable for man and society. The space contributed to Plato is subtantial and the first volume is really only an intro to Plato by the authors own admission. That's a four hundred page intro! But it all leads to the greatest of inventions...Philosphy. I enjoyed the whole book, but the second volume &quot;the search for the divine center&quot; was the best part explaining many things about Plato. To understand in greater depth the influence of these ideals on the western world I recommend reading a book (which I read first) called &quot;The Classical Tradition&quot; by Gilbert Highet whom is also the translator of this book. That book reveals how most of the surviving great works throughout western history were written by authors who were well aware of the greek world and their ideals including many writers in the Christian tradition. Jaeger wrote a short book called &quot;Greek Paideia and Early Christianity&quot; which shows that connection very well. He has convinced me beyond doubt of his statement that the ancient greeks are the educators of the western world."},{"Title":"Paideia: The Ideals of Greek Culture, Vol. 3: The Conflict of Cultural Ideals in the Age of Plato","review":"That is the question that burned in the hearts of those Greeks, who by their own excellence, or ARETE, made lasting contributions to humanity's imagination about being fully human. Just to add a few words to those reviews below:This is one of those books that simply cannot go out of print as all who have read it and learned from will not let that happen. It's that important! No study of anything Greek would be complete without reading this book. The mesmerizing power that the ancient Greeks continue exert on all intelligent persons everywhere is summed up in their formulation of PAIDEIA, and the manner of their ASKESIS (discipline involved in forging one's true self) in embodying it. Read it well and this book will cleanse you of the muck of modern education, especially of the public kind, and help you think more nobly. That is to say, clearly."},{"Title":"Paideia: The Ideals of Greek Culture, Vol. 3: The Conflict of Cultural Ideals in the Age of Plato","review":"Chalk me up as another mesmerized reader. Paideia will take you back to the beginnings of Western Civilization to examine how the Greeks conceived of excellence or arete and the disputes that arose as the new definition ran into the old definitions. Plato is the anchor of the three volumes, and Jaeger treats him with a sense of awe, while I found his ideas as listed in \\"The Republic\\" unnerving.The find of the books for me was Isocrates, the master of rhetoric and a hypochondriac who almost lived to 100. The stories of Isocrates and Demonsthenes renewed by interest in the study of rhetoric. Homer, Hesiod, Pindar, Socrates, they are all here. Overall a fantastic trilogy."},{"Title":"Paideia: The Ideals of Greek Culture, Vol. 3: The Conflict of Cultural Ideals in the Age of Plato","review":"I really like the way Jaeger presents the philosophy of especially Socrates and Plato along with Aristotal and other notable Greek philosophers in context of their times and culture. Jaeger does an excellent job of analyzing the main points of Socrates and Plato including his own insights as well as the thoughts of and influence on other historical philosophers. I especially liked how Jaeger brought Plato's works into focus as a whole with common philosophial questions being developed by the works as a whole. The book is fasinating if you are interested in questions like, \\"How should men be governed?\\" and \\"What part does virtue have in politics and education?\\" It is amazying to see how much careful thought went into questions like these in ancient times and how they are still being debaited today. You can sence an historic split between the spiritual and material views of life.The concepts presented are well explained for those casually interested in philosophy but done so with a large vocabulary, lots of Greek words and assumes that you read the first book (which I did not). I found that a good dictionary and a bit of research online (for Greek words)was sufficent to allow a rewarding understanding of the material presented."},{"Title":"Paideia: The Ideals of Greek Culture, Vol. 3: The Conflict of Cultural Ideals in the Age of Plato","review":"A history of early Greek culture prior to the fall of Athens is the main focus of Jaeger&#8217;s first volume. As Jaeger states in the preface &#8220;literature is the chief concern of this book, which is intended to describe the paideia (culture) of the Greeks, and, at the same time, the Greeks themselves as the paideia of mankind.&#8221; Jaegers intention in this three volume work is skillfully carried out.Jaeger covers the early Greek development of their concepts of the ideal pattern of behavior as well as the basic accepted mores of Greek society; not only of the nobility, but the peasantry as well. The source for the day to day life of the peasant is mostly derived from Hesoid&#8217;s account - Works and Days. He introduces the term arte, which he explains initially had more to do with the concept of valor - but he follows the changing understanding of arte as it came to reflect a different ideal over time. The concept of justice is likewise developed in the same manner. Jaeger seems to immolate the path of Hegel&#8217;s historical method as a revealing of a progressive evolutionary path, as such the developmental nature of the evolution of the Greek culture is developed in a historical context.Not only is Athens dealt with in detail from a cultural perspective but the contrast with Sparta&#8217;s diverse cultural norms is also. Included is coverage of the effects of the sophistic movement on education, as well as the significance of Euripides and other tragic poets on the Greek society. There is not much that escapes Jaeger&#8217;s vision in terms of impact on the expression of culture in ancient Greece.Highly recommend to any having an interest in the history of Greece and its enduring impact on Western culture."},{"Title":"Paideia: The Ideals of Greek Culture, Vol. 3: The Conflict of Cultural Ideals in the Age of Plato","review":"Try as I might, I can only find the final volume of this masterwork available for Kindle.Where are the other two volumes?Back to the paperback for me..."},{"Title":"Paideia: The Ideals of Greek Culture, Vol. 3: The Conflict of Cultural Ideals in the Age of Plato","review":"I have read the Paideia in paper back and found it to be an incredible window on the ancient greek mind and spirit.

A casual acquantaince I know bought this book thinking she'd get revenge on a guy that hurt her. I was really interested in her. But she's obsessed with this stupid book. I finally realized how bitter and idiotic she was when I picked up the book and read the moronic tripe in it. This author is an evil fool, playing on the hurt and vulnerable of the world, giving them a false sense of power, and worst yet keeping them down by prolonging whatever sense of injuring they have been dealt or think they have endured. The last draw came when she wanted to implement me in her scheme for revenge. I wish her well, but she's in this deep now and quite frankly not worth it. I still subscribe that the best revenge is living well! Why make the insult you might have had the center of your life by making revenge such a goal? Seriously, what the hell does that do? Usually stupid, indiffernt, hurtful people fall flat on their faces sooner or later. Where do you want to be when you see that? In a better place or finding out you've become them in character as well? Robert Adams has only contributed to the all too hight level of stupidity in this world. Go read some Vincent Peale for positive thinking instead. You'll be much more emotionally happier. I'm a firm believer in Karma. It definitely goes around and comes around eventually! Remember, sometimes unfortunately bad things happen to good people. Just don't become a bad person because of it! But bad revisits evil orders of magnitude higher. Evil only attracts itself. Peace be with you always!"},{"Title":"How To Get Revenge and Love It","review":"Has someone ever taken advantage of you? Has someone used you without so much as a backward glance? Are you tired of this treatment? Robert D. Adams presents a satirical look at extracting revenge on those who spitefully misuse you in HOW TO GET REVENGE AND LOVE IT. Although the book carries a warning that it is for adult entertainment only, the humorous look at getting revenge hits pretty close to home in many instances. The reader is presented with twenty-two chapters, some of which are comically named such as chapter ten, \\"How To Drive A Selfish Woman Crazy, And Make her Love Your Last Year's Dirty Drawers.\\" Each chapter covers a different scenario in which revenge should be sought and the step-by-step instructions on how to go about doing it.Although very funny and entertaining, Adams's message is clear: do not let people use you. There is no reason for you to accept it. Get yours and feel good doing it. His revenge schemes were often things we think about doing, but may fail to put into action. One such plot was his advice in \\"How To Break It Off When The Love Smells Stinky,\\" which calls for failing to attend to domestic issues in order to get the object of the revenge to leave. I actually found myself laughing out loud at some of the schemes, while a few others took me down memory lane. As entertaining as I found the book, it could have benefited from some additional editing and I found that some of the language could be construed as offensive. Despite that, for an enlightening and humorous ride, pick up a copy of this book, but pay careful attention to the warning on the front cover. (3.5 Rating)Reviewed by Brenda M.

Unlike some of Dame Agatha's other works, here I genuinely was kept in suspense till the end as to the identity of the criminal. But even more interesting was the characters who make their second appearance after &quot;The Secret of Chimneys&quot; which was also entertaining, but less suspenseful. I loved reading about the adventures of Lord Caterham and Bundle again, both of whom are as funny and sharp as ever. I would definitely recommend the book to even those Christie fans who only prefer Poirot and Miss Marple mysteries - it's good enough to stand on its own."},{"Title":"Seven Dials Mystery, The","review":"The Seven Dials Mystery takes a few characters from the thriller/comedy Secret of Chimneys and finishes up their romantic storylines, as it were. The mystery itself is a bit silly and a bit fun. It takes Agatha Christie's usual secret society silliness and tweaks it a little while she, for a change, pooks fun at the genre of which she has been such a part in the twenties. The action bounces between three country homes and a club in London so that it never veers too far from territory the author is comfortable in. The character are, therefore, a little more stock than usual but she does get a chance to give Bundle (Lady Eileen Brent) a chance to shine that the character never quite got in the previous book. A slight, nice slice of summer reading."},{"Title":"Seven Dials Mystery, The","review":"THE SEVEN DIALS MYSTERY is set 4 years after THE SECRET OF CHIMNEYS (1929&amp;1925) and also takes place in that 'Stately Home' Chimneys.Lord Caterham has taken his family, including oldest daughter 'Bundle' AKA Lady Eileen, abroad in search of peace and quiet after all the excitement that had occured in THE SECRET OF CHIMNEYS. He has leased Chimneys to Sir Oswald and Lady Coote who have decided to have one last weekend party before their lease ended. The house is filled with 'bright young things' but one of the party, Gerry Wade has been a difficult guest in that he was consistently late to breakfast. That was bad enough but then he was found dead one morning.After the Cootes moved out and the Caterhams returned, Bundle found herself bored with country life and decided to return to London. On the way she ran into (literally)a young man, his dying words to her &quot;Seven Dials...tell....Jimmy Thesiger&quot; set Bundle and her friends on the trail of a mystery.Bundle and Bill Eversleigh (also in THE SECRET OF CHIMNEYS) are reunited as they try to solve the murders and the secret of the Seven Dials. False identities, red herrings and secret societies abound until Bundle and Bill, with the aid of Superintendent Battle resolve the mysteries.This, like THE SECRET OF CHIMNEYS, is Agatha Christie a la P. G Wodehouse. Far from the serious mystery that Christie is famous for, this is a comedy with mystery overtones. If you like Wodehouse you'll like this book, but if you are looking for a serious puzzler look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Seven Dials Mystery, The","review":"\\"The Seven Dials Mystery\\" by Agatha Christie is definitely a dated piece of work. It features several characters that readers met in \\"The Secret of Chimneys\\" like Bundle Brent, George Lomax, and Bill Eversleigh. While it is not Christie's best work, it still features her trademark twists that will keep readers in the dark about who the guilty party is.An innocent house party turns to horror when young Gerry Wade is found dead. His death is made worse by the fact that his friends had planned to play a practical joke on him; since he was a notorious oversleeper, they ranged eight alarm clocks around his bed set to go off at intervals. When his dead body is found, however; only seven of those clocks remain, aligned in a row along the mantelpiece. George's friend, Ronny Devereux, ia convinced that his death is foul play, and his suspicions seem confirmed when Bundle finds him shot to death. She soon finds herself enlisting the help of another guest, Jimmy Thesiger and the stepsister of Gerald Wade, to find out what Ronny meant by his last words of \\"Seven Dials\\". Bundle's adventures lead her into what looks like an international spy ring intent upon recovering a secret formula that would revolutionize the steel industry. Yet along the way, she quickly learns that she may not be able to trust the people she thought she could confide in, including the Scotland Yard inspector on the case.\\"The Seven Dials Mystery\\" is a delightful, fast-paced lark through the English countryside, but its languge and time period definitely shine through. There is an awful lot of action followed by an almost too quick summary of guilt at the end. However, for fans of Christie's works, it is always enjoyable to revisit familiar characters and to see them in a different light."},{"Title":"Seven Dials Mystery, The","review":"In many respects THE SEVEN DIALS MYSTERY is typical of both Christie's \\"master criminal\\" novels of the 1920s and popular thriller fiction of the same decade--which is to say extremely improbable from start to finish. But Christie has a distinct tendency to approach such material in a very tongue-in-cheek manner, and with this novel she is clearly less interested in weaving one of her celebrated mysteries than she is in tossing off some frothy fun.DIALS revisits characters first met in THE CHIMNEYS, a novel set at the country estate of Lord Caterham and his sprightly daughter \\"Bundle.\\" On this occasion, however, Lord Caterham has leased the estate to a captain of industry, and when an unexpected death occurs during a weekend house party Bundle finds herself drawn into an adventure that involves two murders, a plot to steal an important invention, and a mysterious association known as \\"The Seven Dials.\\"While THE SEVEN DIALS MYSTERY is amusing to read, Christie doesn't quite manage to capture the madcap mood that makes such similar works as THE SECRET ADVERSARY so much fun to read--and with the exceptions of Bundle and Lord Caterham none of the characters here are greatly memorable. Fans will enjoy it as an ultra-light and ultra-fast read, but this isn't a work that will remain in mind very long after the book has been finished and set aside."},{"Title":"Seven Dials Mystery, The","review":"Something of a pseudo-sequel toThe Secret of Chimneys, only in the sense that it is set in the same location and features a few of the same characters, \\"The Seven Dials Mystery\\" is less of a mystery than it is an espionage thriller, reminiscent of Christie'sTommy & Tuppence books. And yet despite containing all the ingredients of a typical 1920s thriller (including secret societies and international documents) \\"The Seven Dials Mystery\\" ends up being more of a parody of the genre, with plenty of pokes and winks at the use of its various clich&eacute;s. There's also fun to be had at the expense of the aristocracy, such as the egocentric Lord Caterham and the foolish George Lomax, and the nouveau riche, in the form of the woebegone Lady Coote, whose husband has risen up in the world, but who is bullied by the servants and secretly longs for the old bicycle shop that she shared with her husband when they first married. When contemplating Agatha Christie, many can forget just how wickedly satirical she could be, and that aspect of her writing is in fine form throughout \\"The Seven Dials Mystery.\\"At a gathering at the historical mansion of Chimneys, a group of young men and women decide to play a joke on their friend who is prone to oversleeping. Buying eight alarm clocks in the village, they wait until he's asleep and carefully arrange them in his room, timed to go off simultaneously in the morning. But when he still manages to sleep through the cacophony, the friends go to wake him they find that he's died in the night.It's a terrible tragedy, presumably brought on by an accidental overdose of sleeping powder, but there is something strange in the layout of the room. One of the alarm clocks has been thrown out of the window, and the remaining seven lined up on the mantelpiece: seven dials. To some, this presumably needless act suggests a darker meaning behind their friend's death.Lady Eileen Brent (called \\"Bundle\\" for short) joins forces with Jimmy Thesiger in order to investigate further, both led by various clues to a night club known as the Seven Dials and a house party at Wyvern Abbey. There's plenty of excitement to be had in both locations, and Bundle in particular is a treat as she wrangles her way into situations of varying danger. Also on the scene is Christie's reoccurring detective Superintendent Battle, an implacable figure of authority who is much more intelligent than some give him credit for.Although it's a fun read, it's certainly not one of Christie's best. Bundle is a delightful character, but the story itself is rather convoluted and difficult to keep track of. Perhaps I was just a little slow on the uptake, but even after a second read, some of the situations and characters (not helped by giving most of them obscure nicknames) are a little unclear, and the action can jump sporadically from place to place in a rather haphazard manner. But the misdirection on display here is Christie at her most mischievous, and it all makes for a quick, humorous read."},{"Title":"Seven Dials Mystery, The","review":"As far as location goes, Agatha Christie appeared to be drawn to Chimneys like PG Wodehouse to Blandings Castle. The similarities between certain key characters are striking, both are supposed to be idyllic rural havens with very laid back lords of the manors, both suffered plagues of chaos determined to put its stamp on them, and both also suffered from energetic young girls pining for action. There is also a bit of courtship and marriage proposals prevalent in Wodehouse novels. And not forgetting the insufferably competent secretaries.There however, the similarity ended. Whereas Wodehouse was anything but seriously humourous, Christie was humourously serious.A party of young men and women, idle rich, who were guesting at Chimneys, embarked on a practical joke to launch 8 alarm clocks on their Rip-van-Winkle friend Jerry Wade. The joke turned sour when Jerry was discovered dead in bed the next morning, and only seven clocks were found, arranged neatly from their original locations.Bundle, daughter of the manor's lord, found an unfinished letter written by Jerry which suggested sinister forces at work in relation to his death. The significance of the reference in the letter to the \\"Seven Dials\\" was confirmed later when she came across Ronny, (one of the guests engaged in the practical joke,) dying of gunshot wound. His last words referred to the Seven Dials and to Jimmy, yet another party to the alarm clock prank.To a girl yearning for adventure, it seemed to her her desire was practically forced upon her. Bundle proved herself resourceful, investigating staff in her own household, throwing in together with Jimmy and Lorraine Wade (Jerry's sister) to investigate the mysterious deaths.Reprising his role as the chief representative of the law was Superintendent Battle. Bundle was acquaintted with him in an earlier Agatha Christie's novel \\"Secret of Chimneys\\". Through him, she found the lead to the Seven Dials Club via Bill Eversleigh, also a repeat character from Secret of Chimneys.Soon, Bundle found herself in the middle of an international conspiracy, from eavesdropping on a secret society while hidden in a cupboard, to rubbing shoulders with foreign dignitaries in a diplomat party hosted by George Lomax, the insufferable bore from the Foreign Office (also from Secret of Chimneys). She discovered that an innovative technological breakthrough was the target among local business enterprises and commercial espionage.Here, we saw Agatha Christie being naive in understanding of science and technology. Her description reflects those of children's stories were important discoveries could be recorded in several sheets of \\"secret papers\\", of which only one copy in the world existed, handled carelessly in the studies of private residence. This happened not only in Seven Dials but also in several other of her mysteries.Overlooking that, Seven Dials was a great romantic adventure thriller set in the romantic era of the 20s where young women were gaining confidence in the area of action."},{"Title":"Seven Dials Mystery, The","review":"Christie reverses everything here so no one by the end is who you thought they were. And Bundle is one of her best characters. The usually wooden Battles has some of the story's best dialogue. A really enjoyable ride from the first page. Note the use of the many clocks at the beginning, sort of a long foreshadow to Christie's later work of the same title (The Clocks, that is)."},{"Title":"Seven Dials Mystery, The","review":"Once again Agatha Christie returns us to the stately home of Chimneys from her previous novel. We are reintroduced to Bundle, George Lomax, Superintendent Battle, and others from that earlier work. Lord Caterham has leased his estate to a wealthy businessman for the hunting season, but becomes distraught when murder once again strikes his ill-fated home. The plot centers on the theft of a valuable scientific formula and a crime-fighting society known as the Seven Dials. Comic elements coupled with brilliant but improbable plotting make this a satifying Christie read, though not one of her best."},{"Title":"Seven Dials Mystery, The","review":"After reading of the adventures of Tommy and Tuppence I was slightly disappointed with this book.

Wodehouse type lark were Bertie Wooster & Jeeves. Val McDermid contributed an impassioned introduction on the proper appreciation of Dame Agatha's myriad talents. In my case, Ms. McDermid was preaching to the choir.Idle rich young folk are houseguests at country house Chimneys (revisited-see: \\"The Secret of Chimneys\\") that is being rented by noveau riche Lord Cootes for the summer. The young men at the party, though uniformly dense, have reasonable names. The young ladies, dashing and beautiful, are called \\"Bundles\\" and \\"Socks\\" for no particularly good reason except perhaps to annoy the reader. These madcaps play a joke involving multitudes of alarm clocks on one of their sleepy headed fellows, and the joke turns sour when the young man is found dead in his bed.Superintendent Battles is the voice of calm and reason here, but the sleuths are the young people. They roar around in roadsters, take fearful risks and generally have a fine time. The plot is intricate, the red herrings clever and misleading. As usual, Ms. Christie offers up a total surprise at the end.I agree with Ms. McDermid that AC has a particularly sly sense of humor. The larger-than-life trivial and shallow aspects of the characters are meant to amuse, but sometimes grate. However, in honor of splendid plotting and excellent misdirection, \\"The Seven Dials Mystery\\" certainly deserves a B.-sweetmolly- Amazon Reviewer"},{"Title":"Seven Dials Mystery, The","review":"~ * * * * ~~ I liked this book very much, because the style and pacing are just different enough!

Superintendent Battle seems as inscrutable and impassive as ever. Lady &quot;Bundle&quot; is very endearing, as is her friend Bill, especially, as his feelings for her become more apparent.When a member of their party is killed, and seven alarm clocks left inexplicably on the mantle, the young people grasp for clues: going to the Unsavory &quot;Seven Dials&quot; neighborhood.~ - * * * * - ~Unlike Poirot, who sits and lets his gray cells work, or Miss Marple, who finds similarities between any current case and remarkable incidents from her life in her small village: these bright dashing young heroes follow the trail head first, putting themselves in awkward positions!~ - * * * * - ~This is a nice, enjoyable, satisfying and entertaining mystery- in a style just different enough to be interesting!

Starting out in Chimneys, which featured in The Secret of Chimneys, a harmless prank turns into murder, setting off a few young adventurers on the trail of international intrigue. Perhaps it can better be described as a spoof of a thriller. Sure, the suspense will keep you turning page after page at 4 AM. But things are not what they seems. Everyone and everything are built up only to be destroyed. What really tickled me are the lines of witty conversation, with characters taking jabs at each other. Especially prepare yourself for loud laughter when Lord Catterham is around.

This book, in a surprisingly readable manner, covers the real life story of one Max Green, a Jewish lawyer who was found murdered at the fanciest hotel in Cambodia while on a one-night stopover, in 1998. Within days, it came out that he had, just before leaving to go there, cleaned out his law/investment firm's bank accounts, to the tune of some 40-something million dollars. Only then did his associates and customers learn of how he had been scamming them both, moving monies from one account to another, and using monies invested by later investors to pay off former investors who want to draw off some of their (now nonexistent) account monies.What shows from such a character is clearly someone who had an ambition to become disgustingly rich, a power broker, a \\"player,\\" through the massive amounts of money he controls. It was his ego trip. Much of the book is devoted to the money trail in which he used his ill-gotten gains to invest in such things as a slave-labor-run sapphire mine in Laos (which would culminate, once the free ride was over and the money couldn't be found, in some unfortunate stuckee family being forced to endure \\"10 months\\" in a Laotian prison of such miserable conditions on par with those at what Vietnamese War veterans call the \\"Hanoi Hilton,\\" and hence the title of the book), Prostitution rings in Thailand, Sea Cucumber farms (what would anyone have done with one of those?), fictitious corporations in all different parts of the world, secret Australian bank accounts (into which Max funneled all his monies) and a large and complicated tax write-off scam that involved Laotian government purchase contracts for various construction equipment.It was apparently this last scam that blew up in his face. One at a time, the book introduces the reader to the progressively more and more shady characters with whom Max had been doing his business. Part of this construction equipment scam required that he have a great deal of cash on hand with which to negotiate, and which he hoped to double or triple by the time all was said and done. However, one or more of these shady characters (we never find out which one, and there the whole situation lays) instead killed him and took the money while he stayed overnight in the Cambodian hotel. Perhaps about ten millions of the dollars were eventually located in a firm in the Isle of Man (British Isles) but the rest no one knows where it went. And through it all I kept asking myself, \\"How does one find riches in a country which has no riches?\\" But herein one learns how. Foreign investors discover how to get rich through slave labor and the like.For me, one thing about all this is the way that such nations, darkened by an almost total lack of Christianity, end up dirt poor and full of people who are willing to sell out their morality and their fellow citizens for foreign money. Throughout Southeast Asia, almost anything can be had for money. Want to see a prostitute do a dance with a string of razorblades, or sleep with a \\"Ka-toey\\" (boy prostitute surgically altered to be like a girl)? It's all there to be had, for enough money (which might be less than a hundred dollars). Wealthy westerners (and some others, such as Japanese) go there, spend their money, and lose their souls. With greedy contempt, their money is taken and \\"services\\" rendered. In one of these countries, such foreigners are actually called \\"Ferengi,\\" from which the one-time putative Next Generation Star Trek \\"Baddies\\" derive their name. Unlike the Star Trek Ferengi who ended up as rather silly and comical fellows, the \\"Ferengi\\" visiting Southeast Asia bring great evil: debased and debauched and perverse dreams, and the money to make them happen. The contempt and disgust felt towards these \\"Ferengi\\" by the natives is palpable, but nevertheless their money always remains good.As for Max Green and those involved with his mad schemes, the book proves to be something of a morality lesson in the things that can go wrong in the egotistical goal of trying to become one of the big \\"players,\\" the power brokers, the forces \\"behind the throne\\" who make history happen. All in all, a most thought-provoking and interesting read."},{"Title":"10 MONTHS IN LAOS - A vast web of intrigue, missing millions and murder","review":"It's disappointing to read Griff Ruby's review of this book because the reviewer simply uses the review as a platform to display bigotry. Before I jump into my review, I would like to counter at least one of Ruby's lies. Griff Ruby states:\\"For me, one thing about all this [the events in the book] is the way that such nations, darkened by an almost total lack of Christianity, end up dirt poor and full of people who are willing to sell out their morality and their fellow citizens for foreign money.\\"Here Ruby suggests a direct relationship between the prevalence of Christianity and both moral and material wealth. Huh? Is that why the godless Communist China is today financing the US deficit? Is that why good Catholic countries like Mexico and Guatemala are so wealthy? Not to mention the Philippines, where Ruby first found this book. Of course we know the Philippines has completely wiped out decedance, don't we.But enough said about Ruby. Conroy's book covers an extremely fascinating tale, that of Max Green, an Aussie lawyer who was involved in fleecing investors out of tens of millions of dollars. Much of this money went into Bangkok's gem market, where it was laundered by a cast of less-than-savory characters. Some was invested in the Huay Xai sapphire mine in Laos, which later became famous with the imprisonment of Aussies Kay and Kerry Danes, who got caught up in a power play between the foreign mine owner and the Lao government.Conroy's book is particularly strong in uncovering the labryinth of Max Green's money laundering operation. It offers insight on dark corners of human activity which ordinary people rarely come in contact with.I do not speak off the top of my head on this, as I have written myself on the Max Green case. Conroy does an excellent job of capturing just what went down.

Upon hearing that the publishers Dodd, Mead, and Company were holding a contest for the best North American novel she decided to return to Winnipeg Manitoba and devote herself to winning the prize. From her rented room, she completed the draft of Wild Geese in a mere six weeks. Her submission beat out 1,389 competitors to win, and became her first of many published novels.Wild Geese is the story of the Gares, a very secluded rural family that is presided over by the tyrrannical father/husband Caleb Gare. He subjects them to what can only be described as daily slavery... fiercely suppressing anything that does not contribute to his maniacal tilling of the land. Because of Caleb's selfish need for constant control and domination of others, freedom of expression is not allowed in the Gare household. But this does not set well at all for his fiery tigress of a daughter (Judith) and their live-in schoolteacher Lind Archer. Together, these two women represent the hope of passion, the power of beauty, and the occasional whiff of perfume amidst the manure of Caleb's machinations. Will he be able to ultimately thwart his daughter's freedom? Will Caleb be able to destroy Lind's lover with the terrible secret that only he and his wife know about? Not until the VERY last pages do we really know the answers to those questions, and Ostenso does a great job of keeping the reader interested up to that point and beyond.She is very much in the style of Willa Cather who also wrote of the windswept plains of the early 1900's.

I am a real London fan...the London that isn't there any longer.The type is very small and I keep a magnifying glass nearby because after a while, the type does tire the eyes. I also keep my map close at hand too.Each of the 26 wards of the old city are examined for boundaries, ancient buildings...churches and monuments to those buried there and the local guild halls...and then other streets and less imposing buildings are described along with an explanation of events which happened there.It is the same pattern for all 26 wards. There is a list of all the mayors who served in the past and other supplimental information.This book certainly doesn't have a wide appeal, but I found it rewarding to read and sometimes when I would be interrupted by my partner while reading, I had the feeling that I was coming back in time and it startled me a bit.If you are a \\"London geek\\" like me, I would recommend this book.

Therefore, I count him as a 'true' prophet. He also passes all 5 classic tests for a prophet.

(Although this book is properly by Rev. Roland H. Buck, of the famous Buck Knife family, it was as told to Mr. And Mrs. Hunter, who published the book before Whitaker House got copyrights and published it later on.)I mention this because their affiliation with Rev. Buck lends credibility to their claims: Rev. Buck made a couple of predictions (see my other book review of his book for details) which, incredibly, came true! Therefore, I count him as a 'true' prophet. He also passes all 5 classic tests for a prophet. (See my book review of Michaelson's book for those five tests.)You have the standard fare, tales of angel encounters, but, like Roland Buck's book, which they wrote from their interviews of him, the Hunters' book here also does not ever contradict scripture. I would know, as I have read all of the Bible from cover to cover. To put things in perspective, two of the books I've reviewed on Amazon here do not completely line up with the Bible, and you will have to read my reviews to see which two -for details.In addition, however, the Hunters have included some accounts from other people as well. Furthermore, the Hunters are accomplished authors -and still going even though they are well advanced in years. In conclusion, I rate their book with the highest rating, not something I do for all books I rate. Yes, this book is one that is hard to put down, and rightly so./s/Gordon Wayne Watts in Lakeland, Florida (USA)"},{"Title":"Nowhere Else on Earth","review":"\\"Under the swamps and barrens of Robeson County there is no bedrock, and in Drowning Creek no stones.\\" Yet every few years the earth brings forth seemingly from nowhere a strange stone large enough to be prized as a grave marker. So Josephine Humphreys tells us in the voice of the narrator of Nowhere Else on Earth. The earth gives birth to stones, and history brings forth legends. One with considerable basis in fact is that of Henry Berry Lowrie, the hero of the novel. Lowrie was a latter-day Robin Hood, a man who did much to rebalance the scales of justice in favor of the marginalized in the lawless aftermath of the Civil War. Humphreys tells his story and in the process sheds light on a period, place, and people neglected in mainstream historical accounts, overlooked perhaps because the people involved are too solidly centered in themselves to make much of a fuss. But adding Henry Berry Lowrie to the list of heroes school children know as well as they know Daniel Boone would do much to enrich the story of America."},{"Title":"Nowhere Else on Earth","review":"In somewhat of an anomaly for Humphreys, this work of historical fiction is set in North Carolina in 1864, where the Lumbee Indians (descendants perhaps of Raleigh's \\"Lost Colony\\") are being harassed by Southerners to help build Fort Fisher. A local band known as the Lowrie Gang rebels; in addition, there's a love interest between Lowrie and Rhoda Strong, an Indian, who foresakes Lowrie for her people. I felt Humphreys's strenghths as a writer, especially her strong characterizations, were weakly displayed here; historical fiction does not seem to be her forte. Much better are her contemporary novels."},{"Title":"Nowhere Else on Earth","review":"Humphreys' book is an evocative and moving portrayal of a time period and people that have stayed hidden for too long. While most of us know a lot about the Civil War, we know nothing of the role that Indians played in it or the realities of wartime for the civilian. Even better, the characters in the book are real, not fiction--their descendents are still living and remembering this story. The whole work is a testament to how human beings can not only survive but thrive with optimism through horrendous circumstances."},{"Title":"Nowhere Else on Earth","review":"Josephine Humphries does the nearly impossible by fully delivering to the reader a remarkable story of the Lumbee Indians and their struggle for a dignified life in the midst of the Civil War. But this novel doesn't read like an historical novel; it is immediate and vital, and the reader will not soon forget these characters."},{"Title":"Nowhere Else on Earth","review":"That's what he is known as to the storytellers in Robeson and surrounding Counties. All my life I've heard the stories of Henry Bear and the Lumbee. Sunday afternoons were spent listening to my great-grandma tell of Henry and his adventures. She never told it quite this way. My grandma is a descendant of Allen Lowerie and she had enough stories of the Lowerie gang that you rarely heard the same one twice. Ms. Humphreys apparently researched her topic well and did a fabulous job in the retelling of a childhood favorite."},{"Title":"Nowhere Else on Earth","review":"Josephine Humphreys has given us an invaluable insight into the horrific personal price of the Civil War. By telling the story of the Lumbee community, she has opened our eyes to the breadth of destruction wrought by the hatred and fear that this conflict supported. Of course, the story is all the more effective because it is carefully researched and supported by historical fact. This book truly gives life to people and events that should not be forgotten."},{"Title":"Nowhere Else on Earth","review":"Really enjoyed this peek at a unique time and place in American history. A colorful account of what it was like during the Civil War in North Carolina (now Pembroke, NC).

I read in the Atlanta paper that she waited decades to write this book; it was worth the wait."},{"Title":"Nowhere Else on Earth","review":"Praises to Josephine Humphreys for her authentic portrayal of not only the heart and soul of the people and times, but the beautiful cadence of their self expression in speech and thought.

So while visiting Charleston recently and looking for something to read, I picked up Nowhere Else on Earth. This book is totally different from Rich in Love, but every bit as good.Nowhere Else on Earth takes place near Lumberton, NC during the Civil War. Lumbee Indians have inhabited the swamps surrounding the Lumbee River since before the Revolutionary War. \\"Scuffletown as a place was anchored but driftable, and as an idea it had the floating nature of a dream. In either form, it was hard for strangers to reach. My guess was, God had decided to let in only those who needed to come.\\" Through time and intermarriage, the residents of Scuffletown lost their Indian culture and language. Most didn't even look like Indians. However, the local white population still considered them second-rate citizens. When more men are needed to work on the Confederate Fort Fisher, the Home Guard start kidnapping young Lumbee boys and forcing them to work at the Wilmington fort. Nineteen year old Henry Berry Lowrie takes to the swamps with a band of followers to avoid being captured. In the process, they become local Robin Hoods in Scuffletown.But Nowhere Else on Earth belongs to Rhoda Strong, a teenager who only wants to read, write, marry and have children. Rhoda spends hours contemplating the act of falling in love. \\"I thought it not only within my reach but likely to be easier to come by then shoes or books. I thought it was something everybody could get, no matter who or where they were as long as they weren't stranded on a desert isle.\\" But Rhoda's simple plans are disrupted by war and \\"a leisurely dream of husbands is a peacetime thing, and mine was urgent and desperate.\\" She asks God to give her love \\"the kind fierce as fire.\\" She gets her wish, and falls for the most handsome but dangerous man in Scuffletown.This is an extraordinary story and an exceptional book. When I finished and discovered that Nowhere Else on Earth is based on a true story, I hit the internet to find out more about Henry Berry Lowrie, Rhoda Strong, and the Lumbee Indians. Lowrie is still immortalized today by many locals, although some consider him an outlaw. But what makes Nowhere Else come to life is the beautiful writing of Humphreys and especially, the convincing way she writes in the voice of Rhoda. It is one of those books that I won't long forget."},{"Title":"Nowhere Else on Earth","review":"Excellent work of historical fiction. A very enjoyable book to read. I grew up in Pembroke and really enjoyed reading about Henry Lowrie during the civil war period. I heard the story as a young boy from my father and was very happy to read a more detailed and accurate account. Everyone with any interest in the history of Eastern North Carolina should read this book to better understand the Pembroke area.."},{"Title":"Nowhere Else on Earth","review":"Because I am a descendant of the people about whom this book is written, and some of the main characters are my relatives, I probably found it more interesting than others would. However, it is an extremely well-written historical novel, based on factual events and could easily be enjoyed if it were pure fiction. It is a great story of endurance, love, loyalty and family among a people about whom the world knows very little and is poorer because of it. The Lumbee are a people who have not only survived genocide, racism, hatred, economic hardship, theft of their land, loss of their Native American heritage and nonrecognition by the White Man of that heritage, they have flourished and become a well-educated, thriving community of over fifty thousand mixed race people who have managed to retain their dignity throughout all the strife. Josephine Humphreys has done a wonderful job of recording our history - better, in fact, than much of the &#34;history&#34; which has been written about us - and the strengths and characteristics of our people."},{"Title":"Nowhere Else on Earth","review":"Based on the true story of Henry Berry Lowrie, outlaw or Robin Hood (those opinions still vary) in Robeson County during and immediately after the Civil War, this story is told from the point of view of Rhoda Strong, the strong-willed girl who loved him and grew to marry him. Humphreys' meticulous research and engaging story-telling skills combine to make this a story you will recall years after you close the covers. Her reportage of the way war has crumbled an already fragile culture and her account of how neighbor turns against neighbor will remind you of Cold Mountain, as will her gifts at using language precisely and often poetically.Sally Buckner"},{"Title":"Nowhere Else on Earth","review":"I read this book from first page to last, never able to quite put my finger on its pulse. In 1864 the Civil War raged in its 4th year and the &quot;macks&quot; were separatists with zero tolerance for their neighbors in Scuffletown, who hid their eligible young men in the swamp. The macks (Mac this and Mc That), the Scots planters who were original settlers of the North Carolina land, were in constant opposition with the indiginous people of the land. The landscape of Scuffletown changes like shape-shifters, as these proud Indian descendants move from place to place.Rhoda Strong, daughter of Cee, tells this rambling tale of good vs. evil. We follow as she makes life-choices and committments that seem irreversible. Basing her decisions on the attitudes of this poverty-riddled family, she seems proud of two questionable virtues: stubborness and ignorance."},{"Title":"Nowhere Else on Earth","review":"I adored &quot;Dreams of Sleep&quot; and was, frankly, indignant when I read Gail Caldwell's review in the Boston Globe that called this &quot;paint-by-numbers fiction.&quot; Having read the book, however, I'm inclined to think Caldwell got it right-- a 10 for historical research; for imagination, fictional accomplishment, a 5, at best."},{"Title":"Nowhere Else on Earth","review":"Josephine Humphreys, a shrewd observer of the contemporary psyche, apparently wanted to push her talents in a new direction with this historical novel. While it is admirable she ventured into new territory, the result of her risk-taking is disappointing -- and nearly non-literary. At times &quot;Nowhere Else on Earth&quot; reads like a romance novel. You've met all these characters before, from the Plucky-Independent-Heroine-Who-Is-Ahead-Of-Her-Time to the Handsome-But-Dangerous-Antihero. The historical details are interesting and the book is rich in atmosphere and emotion, but the characters are straight out of Creative Writing 101. Too much of this will destroy brain cells. My advice: Read &quot;Fireman's Fair&quot; or one of Humphreys earlier, better works and wait for her next book. And cross your fingers she's gotten this period novel thing out of her system."},{"Title":"Nowhere Else on Earth","review":"Set in the swampy, piney backwoods of North Carolina at the close of the Civil War in 1864, Josephine Humphreys' passionate, beautifully written novel evokes a time of struggle and helplessness in a proud insular community whose members trace their ancestry back to the Indians. Derisively dubbed Scuffletown by its &quot;mack&quot; neighbors (Scottish farmers mostly), known as &quot;the settlement&quot; to its inhabitants, the area subsists on turpentine manufacture, which has come to a halt with the war.Narrator Rhoda Strong recalls those days of upheaval, tragedy and love from the vantagepoint of her middle years. She was 16, daughter of a stalwart Scuffletown woman and an outsider, a Scot, weaned from drinking by his wife and subject to bouts of depression.As the story opens, Rhoda's mother, Cee, keeps the family inside their one-room, windowless (&quot;because Cee said we're only inside at night and what good is a window then? Just one more thing to lock up.&quot;) cabin in the heat of summer to protect them, especially Rhoda's two brothers, from the Home Guard. The Home Guard is made up of &quot;mack&quot; neighbors, determined to spare their own boys by conscripting Scuffletown youth for forced labor at the Confederate forts and salt works.It's a lawless time in the backcountry and the sadistic head of the Home Guard rules with impunity. After he kills two boys who escaped from the work gangs, Scuffletown's young men take to the woods, under the leadership of Henry Berry Lowrie, a charismatic, focused young man admired by the whole community, secretly loved by Rhoda.But Cee is adamantly against the match, though she believes Henry &quot;could turn out to be the best we've got. The best we've ever seen.&quot; This naturally confuses Rhoda, but her mother explains: &quot;You want an ordinary man with a little flaw. A hurt, a weakness somewhere. Then you can be a helpmeet, and you'll have a bond. That's a man who'll give you some security, in return for what you give him. But what could you do for a man like Henry? What does he need that only you could provide? Nothing.&quot;Cee also worries that Henry's leadership, a boon when times are good, could tear apart the community if he meets the violence they suffer with violence of his own. But since when does a girl ever take her mother's advice on a husband?Scuffletown doesn't much care who wins the war. They take in deserting or wounded soldiers from both sides, hoping for peace to let them get back to farming, resurrect the turpentine business and maybe build a school.But eventually Sherman's March brushes Scuffletown, incidentally disrupting the Home Guard's final murdering rampage. But the rampage's aftermath makes Henry a permanent outlaw with a price on his head, leaving Rhoda waiting.&quot;The first part of my life was over, and the second had not begun. I was drifting and waiting, and even though I had kept myself busy, inside the carcass of a chicken or rolling dough or running out a line of stitches so tiny I couldn't even see them, I felt deeply idle, stopped cold in the middle of my life.&quot; Her life resumes but its momentum is largely out of her hands, as her mother had warned.This is a novel of human forces grown beyond human control - violence breeding violence, feeding on pride, duplicity and vengeance. Though events are tragic, told in Rhoda's voice, it's not tragedy. Humphreys' characters come alive in Rhoda's telling. Their eccentricities, strengths and best moments, even their foibles and weaknesses, call upon her deep affections. Each is an individual; together they form a vital force.Humphreys' (&quot;Dreams of Sleep,&quot; &quot;Rich in Love&quot;) writing is rich, earthy and eloquent, permeated with the rhythms of the Deep South. She delivers a clear, compelling story and Rhoda Strong is a winning, vibrant heroine. A wise and romantic novel."},{"Title":"Nowhere Else on Earth","review":"I know that anybody who liked Cold Mountain will love Nowhere Else On Earth. The details here are even more finely written and complex. The wrenching plot builds on the history of a fascinating, underexplored corner of the East Coast--a mostly Lumbee Indian community in North Carolina--and a perspective on the Civil War I had never even pondered before. Surprising and very eye-opening. I just love Josephine Humphrey's knack for beautiful speech, especially the way it reflects the colors and metaphors of Southern talk. At the same time the characters she creates (esp. Rhoda Strong) are so astute about human nature, and so wise, I'm always wishing I could meet them. THose of you who enjoyed Dreams of Sleep and Fireman's Fair will go crazy over this one. I think the historical novel really shows off her strengths as a writer."},{"Title":"Nowhere Else on Earth","review":"Review by Jillian AbbottNowhere Else On Earth by Josephine Humphreys is an historical novel with equal emphasis on history and fiction.In terms of history, the book stays close to known facts. But Humphreys doesn't stop there. In inventing a first person memoir, she creates a subjective, indeed, feminine, history. \\"Mine is only a single and limited testimony, one woman's version. . .\\"There is mischief in her narrator, the curious Rhoda Strong. She is game even to examine and question the true nature of history, racial prejudice and scapegoating, all described in such a way as to render today's incidences of ethnic violence comprehensible: \\". . . it wasn't an English that sliced him . . . [it was] his own neighbor! . . . We were neighbor against neighbor.\\"In fictional terms the characters and events are portrayed with grace, subtly, and depth. Gaps in the story are filled by citing period newspapers. Yet there is an irony here as when, after drawing considerably from the press, Rhoda points out the divergence between the life she actually leads and the one portrayed by the media.But in creating this personal history, Humphreys is again playing with us. What is the line between the personal and the political?In the Prologue, supposedly written on November 3, 1890, the feisty and wise Rhoda sets out her intentions and hopes for her narrative and outlines her view on the nature of history, stating that nobody will ever be able to render the story of Scuffletown complete and objective, \\"just as a soldier can never describe a whole battle - only his piece of it . . .\\"In choosing the words, \\"us and our times\\" to refer to her story, Humphreys is telling us this is a political work, as much about the society that denied the Scuffletown Indians justice, as it is about one particular Indian woman.Rhoda is a Lowrie by blood and marriage, and \\"the Lowries are Indians. The whole place is Indian. And that's the answer to who we are.\\"But is it? Dr. McCabe, a member of the Scottish Confederate overclass, isn't so sure. He studies Rhoda and her people, measures their heads, and invasively probes their origins. By the second half of the book McCabe is sure there is more to the Lowries than anyone suspects.As the true origin of the Scuffletown Indians dawns on McCabe, the Civil War is almost over. It is a desperate lawless time. To the Scottish Confederates, the source of their defeat, and all that has gone wrong in their lives, is clear. Their demise is not the result of Union soldiers or their own bad ideas; rather, it is the Lowries and Scuffletown who are responsible.Again Humphreys uses subjective truth to make her point. McTeer, the brutal Deputy Sheriff and a leader of lynch mobs, spells out why the Lowries are guilty, and even how they differ from respectable white folks: \\"The noble morals is bred out. Your makeup is what they call bestial . . .\\"Using simple prose Humphreys evokes the times in hauntingly powerful images. As the Civil War drags towards its end, and as the defensive gang formed by Rhoda's husband, Henry, nearly matches the Confederate whites in brutality, Scuffletown can't even manage to fill its belly. The inhabitants have neither food nor money, which hardly matters because the stores have no food to sell. Desperation pervades: \\"There was gunfire every night, everywhere, and just about every farmer's watch dog was shot. Some were eaten.\\"Yet despite the harsh times, Rhoda is a woman with a great capacity for love, and it is her love for Scuffletown and its people that motivates her. After all, for Rhoda, there is, Nowhere Else On Earth."},{"Title":"Nowhere Else on Earth","review":"In 1864 Scuffletown, many mixed-breed descendants of the native Lumbee Indian Tribe laboriously toil at the turpentine business. The group is extremely poor but work hard to help their families survive. Living nearby are wealthy and powerful Scottish plantation owners who still own black slaves. As the Civil War winds down, the residents of Scuffletown struggle with the Home Guard that conscripts their young males into building for the Confederacy. The Union soldiers are as ugly to town residents. The townsfolk want the war to go away so they can move on with their lives.For defying the Confederacy, local citizen Henry Lowrie and some other men hide in the nearby swamps to escape his fellow Carolinians wrath. Eventually, Henry turns to robbery to survive and ultimately is accused of murder. As Henry makes love with teenager Rhoda Strong, his gentle father is hung as retribution for Henry's actions. He seeks revenge, but finds time to marry his beloved Rhoda before fleeing from the area during Reconstruction.NOWHERE ELSE ON EARTH is an incredible accomplishment that showcases the talent of Josephine Humphreys. Rhoda narrates the story line as she looks back over the years to the havoc caused by the Civil War and the Reconstruction on her indigent people. The characters are fully developed especially the interrelationships in which race rules even amidst the Northern Army. The insightful plot provides a unique look at the Civil War that allows readers to grasp the torment yet valor of a small group under siege from all sides. Ms. Humphreys uses historical facts to bring to life a People during an era when the rights of a small minority are trampled.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Nowhere Else on Earth","review":"The grace and style of Nowhere Else on Earth strike you immediately. It is the power that takes your breath away. Early on Josephine Humphreys makes one of her tiny beautiful descriptions; this one of a cypress tree which slowly builds up an island around it by catching dirt from the passing stream. Nowhere Else on Earth is such an island. It is built on layer after layer of evocative descriptions and scenes of such beauty and terror that your heart will ache.From the first page, Josephine Humphreys' main character, Rhoda Strong, is a sharp, engaging narrator who writes with such a deep yearning that you begin to feel sucked in to the history--swept up in the close society of the Lumbee Indians and the rich tangled land along Drowning Creek. This is a historical novel (and Humphreys nails every detail of the history), but Humphreys wields all of her historical research with a light hand.

The Lumbee, a closed subject to the world for countless generations, now are transformed and explained to us: from preferably non-existent in society to real people with real life experiences of happiness, pain, trauma, hardship, and monotony--just like everyone else.

Despite this, the same farms, with the better soil, and climate consistently produce the better wines when compared with the type of wine. If you enjoy wine you must have this book, and keep it where you can read it when needed.

Accordingly, he has written a comprehensive, true &quot;encyclopedia&quot; of wine that has something for everyone.If you are like me, you keep a book like this, and periodically pick it up after buying a few bottles at your local shop to read his tasting notes, or some information about the winery. The book is perfect for that, he included small profiles and/or tasting notes for thousands of wineries in virtually all major wine-producing countries. The list of California wineries alone, and Johnson's personal observations about their varietals, is staggering.

Not snobbish about slotsplayers, (who can blame someone who plays these machines which arethe first thing one sees when entering the casino floor....andare usually SO numberous, they are totally impossible for the novice to ignore?) -- but the machines themselves. Obviously, there are SO many of them because they make a LOT of money forcasinos. And I once saw a gambling expert on the Joan RiversShow, who, (after explaining some strategies for casino tablegames), was asked by Ms. Rivers if there was any way to approachthe slots, answered: \\"Yes. I approach the slots -- then walk inthe opposite direction!\\"However, the slot machines ARE there in just about every casino.And this being so, they are always intriguing. Curiousity gotthe better (bettor?) of me, and so I decided to buy THIS bookon the slots, because it was VERY highly recommended on Amazon,and also because it was, (refreshingly!), written by a femalegambler, such as I am.This booklet is clearly written, and gives many very good tipson playing slots. Some of these are 1) Try to take a seat ata slot machine on the END of a row. These machines usually payoff better than even the very next machine in -- because whena slot machine pays off, it makes NOISE. This winning noise,(bing....bing....bing....bing!), will hopefully attract moreplayers.! 2) If a slot machine doesn't pay off SOME money in7 tries, leave that machine, because it probably pays off verylittle in the long run. 3) Try to get a machine in a \\"carosel\\"area, away from the lines and lines of machines. Because eachseat on a carosel area in unencumbered by another one blockingany winning noise, (they are all in a single-row circle, yousee), so these machines -- like those on the ENDS of rows, will,when winning, make noise UNBLOCKED by nearby machines...becausethere ARE no nearby machines in this round circle of SINGLEMACHINES. 4) Try to find machines which take 2 coins, not 3,for their largest bet. 5) Try to find machines which have theLEAST number of symbols.It's been a while since I read my copy of this book....but IDID read it, and I guess I memorized most of the tips I foundthere, which I now give in this review. I'm sure there aremany others I don't remember, as well. Ms. Mitchell also givesreviews of individual slot machines-- but I think this makesthe book a bit dated, as I'm sure the slot machines she hasreviewed have either been replaced by, or added to, by others.However, it IS good to read her reviews, because you just mightfind very similar machines on your next casino trip!All in all, a VERY good book to have. I found this book farbetter than the succeeding books in the series. However, theprice has gone up SO much, one might consider the buying ofthis book to be a small gamble in itself. So -- if you can'tafford the present very high price yourself, my advice is tobuy it with funds from yourself and a number of friends. Thenyou can each keep the book for a month or so. (\\"The SisterhoodOf The Travelling Slots Book\\"????)

To include both, however, provides the reader with a complete description of just about every single aspect of the ships and aircraft in service in the US Navy at the time each edition of this book is published. What surprised me was the detailed descriptions of some items of sensitive equipment which much surely have been \\"classified.\\" For example, whilst it may be fair to say that a picture of a particular type of antennae does not reveal exactly how it works, a photograph showing the \\"Reverse side of a SPY-1A antennae during assembly\\" might appear to show too much...How strange that in most (if not all) countries, the perimeter fences of their military airfields proclaim \\"The taking of Photographs is prohibited\\" as though secret equipment might be frequently on display. When it comes to Naval ships and Aircraft and the equipment they display, however, it's as though the sign reads \\"Hey Buddy, go get your camera and see what I've got!\\"Those comments, however, are not a reflection of the author's work, on the contrary, they simply reinforce the simple fact that this is a most thorough review of the subject in hand.NM"},{"Title":"Shadow of the Vampuss","review":"This is the perfect gift for the cat-obsessed, whether that's you or someone else. Guaranteed, your gift won't be run-of-the-mill, no matter what your favorite cat lover has already collected!SHADOW OF THE VAMPUSS follows, with wit and truly unique artwork, the classic tale of Count Dracula... rewritten to substitute cats for the humans of the original work. As an example, here's an early excerpt: \\"But Jonathan's ears lowered slightly as he added, \`Unfortunately I must leave for Transylvania tomorrow morning.' He took a letter from his jacket. \`Mr. Slaughter has asked me to renegotiate a contract on the old Whiskers Manor, right here in Kitby.'\\"Some of the artwork is uncanny; for instance, the shrewd expression of Count Scratchula on page 84 is spot-on, and that goes for both human and felines. On page 74, the pose of Van Helsing is just so, from the point of his toe on the stair to the calculated curve of his tail... and page 26 captures perfectly the tilt of a feline head in every wrinkle. This may sound bizarre until you take a look at the artwork yourself--you'll see what I mean.The publisher didn't stint on quality. Although the cover is a bit glossy, fine details abound: a scored spine prevents cracking, and there's a thick cover stock, a paper bookplate adhered to the inside of the front cover, smooth and substantial interior paper stock, full bleeds, and vivid color throughout.If you're looking for a gift for your family member or friend who has everything and he/she loves cats, collecting unusual books, or a certain sly sense of humor, you're golden! It would also work marvelously as a book for older children. (And if you're a fan of both cats and the metaphysical, judging from a sample card included with the book, this publisher also produces some exquisitely detailed tarot cards--you guessed it, also featuring cats.)I feel very confident giving this book five stars for creativity and a high-quality execution. I know my mother-in-law is going to love her gift--and since she's an elementary school schoolteacher, I'm pretty sure her students each year are going to enjoy it as well!"},{"Title":"Shadow of the Vampuss","review":"\\"So this is the infamous Pit Bull Pass, Jonathan thought even as he felt his tail fluffing out in alarm.

Out of the blackness appeared a dark carriage drawn by two pale chickens and driven by a rat.\\" - From the bookIf you're familiar with the work of Karen Mahony and Alex Ukolov--the creative force behind Prague's baba studio--you know how expertly these geniuses combine wicked wit, arresting images, and incisive observations (about either cats or humans).In the macabre but oh so engrossing 92-page book Shadow of the Vampuss, Karen and Alex take us on a wild ride brimming with brooding atmosphere, vampiric sensuality, and gothic madness.Beautiful costumes, shadowed corridors, gorgeous scenery, lavish illustrations, and anthropomorphic feline expressions make Shadow of the Vampuss a truly special book. Masterfully re-crafting the classic horror tale, Karen's Count Scratchula both intrigues and horrifies. I simply could NOT put this book down!I'm not one to have nightmares (in fact, I can't think of the last time I had one), but after reading Shadow of the Vampuss--I had a nightmarish dream inhabited by vampiric cats! Ack!Bloodlust, melodrama, and bizarre goings on--as the book cover says, this tale is not for under-age kittens!However, fans of baba studio, cats, graphic novels, vampires, or classic horror, Shadow of the Vampuss does not disappoint, providing anxious amusement, a bit of dread, and an utterly fulfilling scary story.And the story's ending? Purrrfect!

He is not an \\"art for art'ssake\\" temporizer or relativist. He not only knows whatHE believes...but he believes he knows what YOU shouldbelieve too. If that makes you uncomfortable or makesyou feel hampered, you might want to pass him by untilyou feel you can accommodate the \\"insult\\" and \\"restrictions\\"on your \\"free will choices.\\" Otherwise, there is much ofbeauty, wonder, and insight to be gained in these pages.Ruskin's point of view is that of a classical Platonistmixed with the moralizing tenor of an exhorting (but notshrilly so) prophet toward beauty, Truth, and clarity ofvision...and moral purpose in Art. He also has a wondrousprose style which is both clear, compelling, and entrancing.This edition published by Dover as a reprint is of thesecond edition of the work from 1880. It also includes14 plates of drawings which Ruskin did to illustrate thepoints which he makes in the text.Along the way, Ruskin includes shortened Aphorismsin the margin which restate the bold face print pointswhich he is making in the text. In Chapter 2, titled\\"The Lamp of Truth,\\" Ruskin stands forth most forcefullyand dynamically (and perhaps to the \\"modern,\\" mosttendentiously) as the classical Platonic moralizerand aesthetic apostle/prophet/priest. Though raiseda strict Protestant, Ruskin rebelled and left Christianityfor a classical Paganism based on beauty, Truth, and clarity.Needless to say, this more than tended to alienate himand isolate him from the mercenary, industrializedVictorian world which was chugging along outside hishermetically sealed temple dedicated to Truth, Beauty,Goodness, and Clarity. Mercantilism and \\"practicalprogress\\" don't exactly exalt those four princples asthe means or the goals whereby to make money and becomesuccessful in the eyes of the world or popular opinion.But if you want to read about Truth and Beauty andread it through the eyes and soul of a lover of thosequalities -- and read it expressed in most beautifulprose and style (which is both poetic and powerful),then Ruskin and this work are clearly the choices youshould make.This excerpt from Ruskin tied to Aphorism 29 {\\"Theearth is an entail, not a possession.\\") clearly showsthat Ruskin's vision and prophetic power extend beyondthe merely practical realm of architecture into anall-encompassing total vision of responsibility andreverence: \\"The idea of self-denial for the sake ofposterity, of practising present economy for the sake ofdebtors yet unborn, of planting forests that ourdescendants may live under their shade, or of raisingcities for future nations to inhabit, never, I suppose,efficiently takes place among publicly recognized motivesof exertion. Yet these are not the less our duties; noris our part fitly sustained upon the earth, unless therange of our intended and deliberate usefulness include,not only the companions, but the successors, of ourpilgrimage. God has lent us the earth for our life; itis a great entail. It belongs as much to those who areto come after us, and whose names are already written inthe book of creation, as to us, and we have no right, byany thing that we do or neglect, to involve them inunnecessary penalties., or deprive them of benefits whichit was in our power to bequeath.\\"Read...enjoy...benefit..."},{"Title":"The seven lamps of architecture","review":"This book is the origin of virtually every theory held throughout the history of architecture.

Wikipedia has an excellent review of his role in the England of that time. \\"The Seven Lamps of Architecture,\\" by this non-architect still commands deep respect, which I do not share.The slim 222 page (Dover edition) book addresses architecture in the light of seven conceptual lamps: The Lamp of Sacrifice, The Lamp of Truth, The Lamp of Power, The Lamp of Beauty, the Lamp of Life, the Lamp of Memory, and the Lamp of Obedience. The seven lamps are presented in the context of Ruskin's deep religiosity at the time of writing. The book came out in 1849. His architectural views in this book were deeply conservative, although he was more complicated in his social outlook. Gothic is king, and to be regarded as the near-ultimate expression of architectural form. Ornament was valued highly and the subject of deep discussion and elaboration. Any machine-made ornament was \\"deceitful.\\"Isolated bits of the book remain persuasive: \\"Know what you have to do, and do it.\\" His view of architecture as a political act still resonates, the more so as one dictator after another imposes state-oriented architecture.What Ruskin found objectionable, I sometimes found admirable, as in \\"There is no law, no principle, based on past practice, which may not be overthrown in a moment, by the arising of a new condition, or the invention of a new material...\\"As a believer in rules, Ruskin lays down so many, so persnickety in nature, and sometimes so absolute that it is not surprising to find little admiration expressed for his contemporaries. Had his views maintained power, Great Britain today might look very much as it did during his lifetime. Cast iron and, by extension, today's steel products would be disallowed except in the narrow function of connecting certain parts.I found the \\"seven lamps\\" largely unpersuasive and wondered if he strongly believed them to fairly describe the field of architecture. However, his assertion that \\"Architecture is the art which so disposes and adorns the edifices raised by man...that the sight of them may contribute to his mental health, power, and pleasure.\\" remains a plausible definition. Few modern architects, however, would agree that \\"Architecture concerns itself only with those characters of an edifice which are above and beyond its common use.\\" And music lovers will disagree that \\"there are only two fine arts possible to the human race, sculpture and painting,\\"Ruskin learned later in life to write simply and directly. But in this book, one finds too many ornate sentences, dragged on long past their natural life until all vitality has been strangled. The longest may be the 234 word, plus or minus, ornate confection of a sentence on page 180.Ruskin is not a happy warrior. He has complaints about England, about modern (for his day) architects, about building quality; even about attempts to restore old masterpieces, which act he considers desecration.In the 1880 edition I read, he becomes his own critic and discovers frequent faults in his original text. In the footnote on page 152 he laments \\"I am glad to see I had so much sense, thus early;--if only I had had just a little more, and stopped talking, how much life--of the vividest--I might have saved from expending itself in useless sputter, and kept for careful pencil work!\\""},{"Title":"The seven lamps of architecture","review":"am so Disappointed of this book !! the copying is not readable at ALL the words are missing ,, its just like printing a book with a printer that has low ink ,, there is no single page that is copied properly."},{"Title":"The seven lamps of architecture","review":"I love the ideas and motivations of \\"The Seven Lamps of Architecture\\" and found a free download in many different formats, including Kindle, on the Internet Archive.

Dear Lord please show us The Way."},{"Title":"The seven lamps of architecture","review":"Ruskin is a master in morality and architecture. This combination, which is very nineteenth-century-like, mixes Ruskin with a wonderful mastery of the English language. The Seven Lamps is a must-read for all you folks who have not yet studied architecture in all its facets."},{"Title":"The seven lamps of architecture","review":"Bought this book for the famous quote of \\"when we build let us think that we build forever.\\" Have not had a chance to read through all of it yet..."},{"Title":"Savarona","review":"There has been a lot of talk about this book -- mostly its perspective on mental illness and vivid portrayal of exotic Istanbul. But what interested me most was the way \\"Savarona\\" casually peeled back the skin of the U.S. Foreign Service for an unflinching, inside look. This is as much an expose' as it is a literary thriller. Although J. Patrick Hart (the pseudonym of a real diplomat who obviously wants to stay anonymous) insists it's all fiction, somehow I have my doubts -- every word and mannerism just rings too true. I would have given \\"Savarona\\" the full five stars if not for the somewhat confusing first few chapters. Hart's use of multiple narrative perspectives is a challenge at first, but once you figure it out the book really hums. I realize this novel has already found a wider audience, but for those searching specifically for the Great Foreign Service Novel, search no more."},{"Title":"Savarona","review":"The CIA justifiably provides most of the heroes (and villains!) for the international thriller genre, but who says America's diplomats can't join in the fun? In this lively, engaging, and highly plausible novel, Mr. Hart shows that life is not just one endless cocktail party for the men and women who staff U.S. embassies around the world. Protagonist George McCall already has more than enough personal and professional problems to deal with when he is unwillingly drawn into a web of intrigue involving Kurdish terrorists, the CIA (yes, they're here, too!), powerful U.S. congressmen, and his all-too-human Turkish and American colleagues from the U.S. Consulate in Istanbul, Turkey. Like any good Hitchcock hero, McCall is utterly overwhelmed at first, but slowly discovers hidden reserves of courage and cunning to rise to the challenge. Mr. Hart employs several unusual narrative perspectives to spin a story that could have been plucked from yesterday's (or tomorrow's) headlines. Finally, Hart draws on his own experiences as a U.S. Foreign Service Officer to paint a vivid, &quot;warts and all&quot; portrait of America's diplomats at work overseas, one instantly recognizable to anyone who has ever worked in an embassy or consulate."},{"Title":"Savarona","review":"In a negative review of one Foreign Service-themed novel a few years back, I wrote that the search for the great Foreign Service novel goes on. Well, I agree with Morris - if SAVARONA isn't the great Foreign Service novel, it comes very close.J. Patrick Hart is a fellow FSO and a compelling writer -- and his novel gets things right. His character Winston Craine is the classic dead-end loser, passed from one unlucky post to another. At the other end of the spectrum, the Consul General and the Ambassador -- like the best senior career FSOs and the best political appointees -- are capable, tough, and not ones to suffer fools gladly. In the middle: our man George, his peers, and his non-uncommon angst - unsure why he has chosen this life, but unable to give it up. The visa process (described accurately, at least for the 1990s), the troubles American travelers get into overseas, the relationship between transient FSOs and permanent local employees (FSNs), the situation of being dropped into an alien culture, saddled with responsibility and having to work with peers one knows only superficially - it's all true. I recognized a lot in these pages from my years with the State Department.This is also a great story about Turkey, without clich&eacute;s - indeed, on the first page, Hart sets up a pseudo-profound clich&eacute;, then mocks it. Whether it's Ataturk, Turkey's public image, the multiple levels in Turkish society, the grandeur of Aya Sofia, the good, the nasty, or the burden of \\"too much history,\\" Hart creates a deep and complex portrait of the country. He captures the rhythm of Istanbul, that greatest of cities, and gives it to the reader bit by bit, integrated into the story. I did find the multiple narratives a little confusing, initially, but soon got used to them.I actually know \\"J. Patrick Hart\\" slightly. SAVARONA is fiction, but he's real. He deserves our thanks not just for this compelling novel but for the work he does every day for America."},{"Title":"Savarona","review":"The enthusiastic reviews have got it right about \\"Savarona\\". But there is this to be said for the lone dissenter. \\"Savarona\\" may not be every reader's cup of chi. Devotees of, in particular, drugstore thrillers and Harlequin Romances may well find the prose style, characterizations and plotline of this novel \\"mediocre\\" in comparison with their customary fare.On the other hand, readers whose comfort level embraces Graham Green and John le Carr&eacute; as readily as Tom Clancy and Nora Roberts are quite likely to find \\"Savarona\\" a stylistically enjoyable -and profitable - experience.The author's cold-eyed, insider's depiction of diplomatic life, Turkey's turbulence, and the non-glamorous conduct of foreign affairs in the age of terrorism is the genuine picture rarely available to non- practitioners. But though the richness of unsentimental knowledge he shares is undistorted by his obvious affection for the country, its people and language, there is clearly a wealth of tenderness beneath his honesty. He has obviously made it his business to get to know all three very well indeed.Well-drawn characters and the decidedly un-Hollywood plausibility of its exploration of domestic terrorism drive the story. So the reader painlessly absorbs rich insights into the contemporary turmoil swirling around Kurdish separatism and radical Islamism, against the conflicted backdrop of the bloody legacy of the Ottoman Empire and the secularist legacy of modern Turkey's foundation.That said, however, its emphasis on the inner self differentiates the novel from the typical international thriller and inclines the author toward the orbit of the genre's heavy-hitters. For \\"Savarona\\" deftly surveys the interior landscapes familiar to fans of Green and le Carr&eacute; characters similarly engaged in the vagaries of overseas government service. Meanwhile, the author's disturbingly vivid depiction of psychotic episodes evokes such younger established writers as Bret Easton Ellis and Alex Garland, as well as - unexpectedly -Martin Scorcese's account of his taxi driver's descent into madness, especially the film's ironic denouement.Altogether a mighty impressive piece of work - the more so for a first time at bat!PS: A final heads-up. Readers who have a tough time following \\"Savarona's\\" time and perspective shifts will most assuredly find, say, le Carr&eacute;'s \\"A Perfect Spy\\" a merry little hell to navigate. But no less well worth the effort."},{"Title":"Savarona","review":"Working at the State Department, I'd heard about \\"Savarona\\" and decided to give it a read, wondering if the policy wonks I work with everyday could actually come up with a book I'd find entertaining. I was pleasantly surprised to find out they could. Vividly written, \\"Savarona\\" makes you feel like you're racing around Istanbul with its cast of off-kilter characters. It is intricately structured, witty and creative and had me on the edge of my seat multiple times, anxious to know what would happen next. Entertaining plot and characters aside, it educates with frank, sometimes critical, commentary on the Foreign Service and gives the reader a glimpse into the challenges these men and women face overseas every day. I'd recommend it to any one, and particularly to those interested in pursuing the Foreign Service. Let's hope Mr. Hart's future assignments allow him some time to write again!"},{"Title":"Savarona","review":"Reading the other reviews, one would think this was one of the greatest novels ever written. It was based on these reviews, along with an interest in the the Foreign Service, that I chose to purchase and read this book. The writing is mediocre at best, and could have used a good editor to point out some of the problem areas, one of which is the annoying switch from third-person to first-person occasionally within the story which is difficult for a seasoned author to pull off and which this author is unable to make these transitions successfully.I believe the concept is good, international thrillers can be fun when well thought out, but it takes over half the book just to introduce the numerous characters. Bear in mind that the book is not that long to begin with! I'll grant that there are some interesting character descriptions, and Istanbul does come alive in this book which is why it gets 3 instead of 2 stars. However, the long build up to any kind of interesting plot developments and the 3rd to 1st person transitions (within the same chapter) makes it a chore to complete.If you are interested in the inner workings of consular offices of the Foreign Service, this might interest you. If you are looking for a good international thriller, pass on this one or you will regret the $19.99 spent on this very mediocre paperback."},{"Title":"Savarona","review":"I'm a junior officer in the U.S. Foreign Service and I loved this book. I've been passing my paperback copy around the embassy I work in and there's currently a waiting-list among my colleagues to borrow it.Even if you're not associated with the Foreign Service, I think you'll enjoy Savarona -- especially if you like other novels about diplomat (mis)adventures such as William Boyd's A Good Man in Africa.But there are three audiences I think would particularly enjoy this book. First off: Foreign Service Officers. All of us have done consular work, so all of us can relate to the visa interviews, American Citizen Services crises, and other elements of Foreign Service life sprinkled throughout the book. It's a kick to read a well-written fictional account of the tasks you do every day.Second audience: Those thinking of joining the Foreign Service. Savarona, especially the first half of the novel, gives accurate and hilarious glimpses of what embassy/consulate life is really like (before the novel's events start spinning out of control in the second half - thankfully, things usually don't get that crazy!).Third audience: Family members and friends of Foreign Service Officers. I plan on getting copies for my family and friends this Christmas: I want them to get an idea of what embassy/consulate work is like (again, by this I mean the normal consular section scenes which take place in the first half of the book, before the more dramatic events take place).My only caveat is that there is some Foreign Service jargon in the novel, such as \\"Cee-Gee\\"/\\"CG\\" for Consul General (the head of a consulate). Some outside readers might not know what these words and phrases mean at first."},{"Title":"Savarona","review":"Foreign service. Profound mental illness. Political extremism. In \\"Savarona\\", J. Patrick Hart weaves experiences of unique, complex, yet very human, individuals into a rich and lovely Turkish tapestry, knotting each strand of the tale so we do not have to contend with frayed or dangling threads at the end. Particularly compelling is Hart's treatment of the psychotic mind as it careens on a runaway roller coaster from lucidity to delusion, blurring what we can only wish were comfortable and distinct lines between sanity and insanity in the process. Often, as I read the increasingly ranting insights of the character Bill, I had to put the book down and remind myself this is a work of fiction.\\"Savarona\\" gave me a genuine appreciation of the sticky issues confronted by dedicated consular officers around the world as they determine who may and may not legally enter the United States. Under intense pressure, these men and women make decisions that strike a careful balance between our nation's desire to welcome visitors into our borders and our need to protect our national interests. If I ever thought I could do their job, this book taught me that I do not have the constitution for the occupation. This page-turner will be a treat for adventurers; current or prospective Foreign Service officers; and travelers wishing a glimpse of Turkey's geography, history, culture and the thorny political issues that remain in this country on the Europe-Asia fault line."},{"Title":"Savarona","review":"Okay, this book has a few flaws, but on balance I think it's a great novel. The setting of Istanbul is incredible -- so vivid that the city itself becomes the main character. Where the novel falls short, just a little, is in its structure -- the changing narratives are initially confusing, but work themselves out after a while. If you're looking for fast-paced pulp, you may want to keep looking. This isn't Tom Clancy (thank God). It's more like Graham Greene, with spies and diplomats that come from the real world. Also, it's got a subtle black humor that won't let go. Very unusual, worth reading."},{"Title":"Savarona","review":"I agree with this guys ex-wife. He can't do anything right.Hope he wasn't as bad a diplomat as he is an author. Maybe he should go back to bartending. The old adage that \\"If you don't know a subject teach a course about, if you still don't know write a book about it\\" totally failed here! It was a total waste of time and money."},{"Title":"Middle School Math Course 2 (Scott Foresman-Addison Wesley)","review":"I purchase text books so that my children don't develop back problems carrying their books in their backpack this one was in good condition and have been great"},{"Title":"Middle School Math Course 2 (Scott Foresman-Addison Wesley)","review":"i liked it because it is simple for ESL student. i understood well. i can not recommend but i think, it works"},{"Title":"Middle School Math Course 2 (Scott Foresman-Addison Wesley)","review":"Daughter has this book as part of a state approved curricula. This is probably the worst math textbook I have ever had the misfortune to read. Page after page of poorly explained math theory and ludicrous problem solving excercises. Daughter asked me a question about estimates. The authors had asked the students to estimate the answer to a simple addition problem. In this case the problem was 305 +275. In my world the answer to this problem is 580. I guess I could come up with an estimate, but why? The answer is obvious. Trying to explain estimation to my daughter, I was unpleasantly surprised to find that the first mention of estimation in this textbook was on page 85. The aforementioned problem was on page 64, 2 full lessons before estimation was even mentioned in the book! Come on people. Does anybody even proofread this stuff before it is foisted on our children? My curiosity piqued because of the obvious deficiencies in this tome, I decided to look through it a bit further. Imagine my surprise to find that what it lacks in value as a math teaching tool, it more than makes up for as a piece of social science horse crap. I just want the kid to get out of school with a functional knowledge of math. Not what some hair brained NEA idiot thinks is a perfect world. If your child is assigned this text for middle school math, be prepared to do a lot of tutoring in you spare time."},{"Title":"If You Only Knew","review":"The story was very touching. The writing style kept me intrested from page to page. I had a hard time putting the book down. Wonderful story."},{"Title":"If You Only Knew","review":"I have long been a fan of Helen's poems and essays, but when I read this book I was even more appreciative of her writing ability.

DD,"},{"Title":"Christopher Columbus, Mariner","review":"This is one of several books I have been reading to answer the currently raging debate over Christopher Columbus, explorer or Indian slaughterer? Written in the late 1940's, the author Morison spends the first pages of this book hailing Columbus as the &quot;Discoverer of the New World&quot;, which we know is not true. Page 1 also states that &quot;This was the most spectacular and most far-reaching geographical discovery ever recorded in human history.&quot; This and other terms of unbridled honor almost turned me off, but I later found that Morison balances his opinions well with candid observations of what Columbus did poorly. He clearly points out that Columbus was a terrible scientist and mathemetician, poor governer over people, a self defeating negotiator, and an absolute failure as a colony planner. Although Columbus was generally very compassionate toward the natives, his short comings eventually lead to absolute bedlam in the &quot;Indies&quot; and when faced with this strife, Columbus and his two brothers responded by killing both natives and Spaniards, which further lead to the expulsion of the Columbus brothers from the region. I found the book to be extremely informative and it gave me a clear picture of how Columbus came to be a hero, victim and tyrant at the same time. Morison makes the conclusion that Columbus was an extroardinary seaman and mariner, and he would have been best served if he had stuck with only that. Every other enterprise Columbus tried only lead to failure and shame. I highly recommend the book despite its antiquated writing style. Buy it."},{"Title":"Christopher Columbus, Mariner","review":"Morison's book has been roundly decried for any number of baseless reasons. The work is certainly not an apology for Columbus, but it doesn't start off with the currently in vogue premise that the European discovery of America was the work of the devil. Morison's book remains the foundation of any approach to the life of the great explorer. Over-flowing with data and acute observations, it is world's - and oceans - away from the finicky over-intellectualized stuff that passes as 'serious' biography today. Morison clearly appreciates just those features of Colombus that would be anathema in person to most modern published biographers, generally academics, and not men of action.Morison set out to trace the actual voyages by duplicating the voyages himself. The result remains fascinating, insightful and engaging. The book's greatest value, apart from this investigation, is the authorial voice - commanding and not afraid to speak out. I found it the right voice for a discussion of Columbus, but many today don't like this, finding it presumptious. Given Morison's scope and knowledge perhaps they are the ones who are presumptious.For another fine book by Morison see His History of the U.S. Navy in World War II.A newer edition of this work is avaiable in paperback."},{"Title":"Christopher Columbus, Mariner","review":"Christopher Colubus, Mariner, is a very enlightening novel concerning Christopher columbus and his travels that made him immortal. By reading this book, I discovered many interesting facts about Columbus. Columbus, known by many different names, was not the Mr. Perfect that some people make him out to be. In fact,his life was far from perfection. As Morison's epic story unfolds , the reader becomes more and more connected with the hero. He was a normal person,seeking a place in the world.The readers also get the chance to balance on the edge of their seats as Columbus deals with mutiny,battles with cannibals, befriends natives, and rescues beautiful girls. He faces diseases, mosquitoes, storms, and quicksand. This wonderful, interesting work of art certainly does old Chris justice. Unfortunately, Columbus is'nt here to read it, nor did he receive the respect or the recognition he deserved at the time that he lived.But, like many renowned people- Mozart, Beethoven, and Van Go to name a few- he received his due credit after death."},{"Title":"Christopher Columbus, Mariner","review":"The author made both his academic and his popular reputation in the early 20th century by sailing around the Caribbean himself, retracing the several voyages of Columbus. This book is much much smaller than the many weighty tomes the author published on the subject. Great for those of us with some interest but not much time. Considering when this book was written, it is of course politically incorrect. Its picture of the man rings true for me. He had a genuine desire to benefit the natives according to his lights (i.e. to Christianize them) but when that collided with his ambition, the results were genocidal."},{"Title":"Christopher Columbus, Mariner","review":"While Morison does admit to the genocide of the Indians lead by Columbus and his henchmen, it idolizes him for the duration of the book. A brief admittance of guilt, for Morison, is a surefire way of allowing a much more bias, idealistic portrayal of a man with \\"questionable\\" character traits. Howard Zinn's book \\"A People's History of the United States : 1492-Present\\" gives a much more truthful account of the Spanish invasion of the Americas. While Columbus did achieve many things for Europe, should he be villianized, idolized, or both? Joseph Stalin did a great many things for the Soviet Union. He industrialized Russia, improved the economy, unified the nation-states of Eastern Europe, and mobilized & strengthened the Soviet Army. He also slaughtered 3 million civilians. You be the judge..."},{"Title":"The Heart of Wisdom Teaching Approach: Bible Based Homeschooling","review":"I downloaded this ebook over the holidays and am in the process of implementing Robin's ideas. The review is lengthy, but I feel it is such a foundational and worthwhile book. The book is divided into five sections, so I'll explain my take on each section.The first section details their departure from public school and the different roads they traveled in homeschooling. Based on her success and failures she describes what led to the Heart of Wisdom teaching approach. One big issue for moms that she addresses is fear. Many wonder are they doing enough? Teaching the right thing? Are their children where they need to be? She does a wonderful job throughout the book of taking us to Scripture to find the answer. (Like Philippians 4:6-7 here.) \\"God knows what your children will face in the future, and He will give you what you need to educate them in the way they need to be educated.\\" These were powerful words that forced me to realize that I need to abide in God's word so that he can guide me and I can guide my children. In this, you will find peace not fear. My job is to run the race and keep my eyes on Jesus! (Hebrews 12:1-2)In Section Two she guides you in researching the biblical methods of education. You will also learn about the history of our modern and traditional forms of education. She ends with an appeal to return to a biblical Hebraic model. This section was an eye-opener for me. I learned the Bible's definition of true education and true wisdom. This section is a must for Christians. I now feel totally comfortable that education in my home doesn't look like education at the public school down the street.A description of the different methods used in her approach is outlined in Section Three. First is always the Bible, then you will recognize a little Charlotte Mason, unit study, delight-directed, and classical methods. However, you will always see the Bible first and most importantly interwoven into everything. She also discusses different learning styles and how to teach to them all using four steps. Doing something with what is learned is one of the four steps. This step usually involves some form of writing. A step that I struggle with, a struggle that's not uncommon for most homeschool moms.The fourth section gives you the how-to with instructions on just how to work out her plan. She tells you how to go about setting up your unit studies based on a four year study of history. I love how she splits your teaching day into two main areas: God's Word and God's World. She spends most of the morning on God's Word, reading the Bible and using Bible study tools. The afternoon is spent studying God's World using unit studies and living books. God's World studies include science, HIStory, and the arts all filtered through God's Word. She incorporates writing and language skills in everything they do. You will also find more information about making notebooks and timelines in this section. And probably the most important chapter in this section is \\"Scheduling by Faith.\\" We are all given 24 hours each day, how does God want you to spend yours? This is another chapter that I will need to reread over and over...any time that I'm feeling defeated in my homeschooling journey.Section three and four have a lot of information. I have read and reread, just trying to soak it all in. I was a product of the public schools and was never taught like this. It is a big paradigm shift for many of us and it will take time to make a complete change. But I believe she does a great job explaining her research and reasoning and then the methods and the how of fleshing out this approach.And finally, in Section Five, she lists the resources that you can use to teach your children using the Heart of Wisdom Teaching Approach. Hundreds of books and resources are listed by her four-year plan for ages K to 12. In addition to this chapter she lists resources for deeper study at the end of almost all of her 24 chapters. The resource lists alone make the book worth the cost.I will recommend this book to every parent that I can...hence the reason I'm posting it here on my blog! I am even considering buying another copy so that I'll have one to lend out! I do think this book will give you a fresh vision for what God has called us to do. I have always liked the book \\"Educating the Wholehearted Child,\\" by Sally Clarkson. I felt like it gave me a vision but left me hanging in exactly how to do it. Robin has said many of the things Sally Clarkson has said in her book, but she explains better how to implement it in my home. I can't decide to try her book on Wisdom or her unit study on Adam to the Messiah next, knowing me I'll get them both!"},{"Title":"The Heart of Wisdom Teaching Approach: Bible Based Homeschooling","review":"This book is a magnificent Bible centered approach that is much needed in today's academic minded homeschool community. It will provide you with the methods, program, and resources for a course of study where students focus half the school day studying God's Word and the other half studying God's world (academics). Easy, entertaining and actually fun!Students study history chronologically and science in the order of the days of creation. This book will instruct you, step by step, how to give your child a Bible focused, comprehensive education from preschool through high school; one that will train him or her to read, to study, to understand, to LOVE TO LEARN and most importantly to desire and seek true wisdom. This approach can be used for all grade levels.Sampson gives an excellent Bible focused alternative to classical education by encouraging students to study snippets of the classics from a Biblical worldview without immersing them in the pagan writings.The \\"Rethinking Education\\" section explains the historical and cultural background of my recipes. Here you will learn how it is necessary to look at education through history. This section includes the origins and development of our traditional educational methods, from ancient times until today, with an appeal to return to biblical methods.The Heart of Wisdom Methods include the most popular homeschool teaching philosophies: Bible First, Delight Directed, Discipleship, approaches outlined by Charlotte Mason and Ruth Beechick, Hebrew methods, learning styles, and more!You will learn about the Heart of Wisdom four-year plan and philosophies for teaching each subject, as well as how to create your own unit studies (or use the lessons from Heart of Wisdom)The Resources section includes book lists included in the Heart of Wisdom four-year plan. This section explains books that should be in every homeschool library and provides hundreds of books by grade level to teach the unit studies.Sample pages are available from the author's site."},{"Title":"The Heart of Wisdom Teaching Approach: Bible Based Homeschooling","review":"Let me first say that I absolutely agree with the other reviews in regards to the premise of this book. The premise is that we are to teach our children the Word of God in everything we do. I wholeheartedly agree and for that, I give Mrs. Sampson five stars on that! The other reviews do a fine job explaining that part of the book, so I don't feel the need to elaborate.However, where I disagree with Mrs. Sampson, is that she clearly considers her brothers and sisters in Christ who adhere to the Covenant Theology doctrine, as heretical, and I dare to say she blames them for the atrocity committed by Hitler and his soldiers in the holocaust.I am slow to consider someone heretical, unless I have a firm grounding in scripture to do so. She fails to do such, but gives her opinion on the matter, which is hardly an explanation as to why she would make such an extreme claim. Without quoting her book, you are welcome to go to her blog and find her same opinion written there on this matter. Type in, \\"Replacement theology\\", and you will find what is found in this book. You can decide from there if you agree or disagree with her stand.Replacement theology is what it is commonly known among those who disagree with the belief, but the proper term is Covenant Theology. The reason for this distinction is clear; a misunderstanding of what Covenant Theology is. Those against CT call it Replacement Theology, because they wrongly understand what CT is, accusing it as saying Christ has replaced Israel and God has broken His covenant with Abraham. However, the right understanding is not that Christ replaced it, but fulfilled it (I have not come to abolish the Law, but to fulfill it -Matthew 5:17). CT says that Christ fulfilled the covenant, He did not replace it. The Covenant was fulfilled in Christ and continues today through God's people, the body of Christ.She goes on to say those within the RT camp (though, remember, it is properly called CT) are anti-semetic (and are the reason for the holocaust). This couldn't be further from the truth. I have great compassion for my Jewish friends and I love them dearly. However, Jesus said He is the Way, the Truth, and the Life, NO ONE comes to the Father but through Him. Jews do not believe in Christ, but deny their Messiah has come. Salvation is of the Jews, because Jesus was a Jew first, because He had not died yet, so He came to obey the Law in EVERY way, so that He could be the fulfillment of the Law. He is our Jewish Messiah. He is our High Priest! There isn't any more shedding of blood for the forgiveness of sins, because Jesus has fulfilled that requirement. Now we take communion, because we remember that very fulfillment in Christ through the breaking of his body and blood shed he paid upon the Cross through His death, burial, and resurrection. Again, Jesus said only He is the Way, the Truth, and the Life, no one comes to the Father, except through Him. If a Jew today is saved, but denies the deity of Christ and is still awaiting a future Messiah, is Jesus a liar? Paul was saved, because He believed and repented of his sins through Christ. In Acts, they called themselves, Christians; however, they were previously Jews. The Pharisees, teachers of the Law, who refused to bow to their Messiah, will receive their reward...and Jesus didn't make that sound like it was Heaven.Covenant theology agrees that there is one way to God and that is through Jesus Christ alone. Anyone who refuses to believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and repent of their sins, will not be saved. It's clear in the scriptures. I will witness to my Jewish friends, just as I witness to anyone else of whatever belief they have. If you don't have Christ, you don't have eternal life. It isn't anti-semitism at all. (If you claim to be a Christian and are anti-semitic, you need to examine your heart before God and repent. You are commanded to lovingly reach out to them with the saving faith of Christ, just as you would anyone else!) CT believers reach out to Jews, just as they reach out to an atheist. Both are lost without Christ.And that is the breaking point with this book. If you disagree with that, you will love this book wholeheartedly. However, if you are like me, and agree that Jesus is absolutely the ONLY way to God, you will absolutely gleen wisdom from this book in the sense that we are to teach the scriptures in everything we do with our children, but you may be put off by the strong use of the word \\"heretical\\" for those of us who believe Christ fulfilled the covenant with Abraham.I would rather recommend teachings from Voddie Baucham Jr. on this matter. Family Driven Faith is an excellent resource on how to live out the principle of Deut. 6. Answers in Genesis has a great resource from Diana Waring on teaching the history of the church, so that your children can see God in every aspect of history. I know there are other resources, but those come to mind.And one more thing to note, the whole OT is filled with stories that point us to Christ. All fuzzy pictures of something to come...Jesus Christ, the coming Messiah! Abraham and his son on the altar, the Passover, Jonah in the belly of a fish for three days and nights, David...the King, et cetera. It is all riddled with Christ in it. I thought I would mention that, as it is hard to \\"replace\\" something that was already there. :) Jesus has always been and will always be. He is the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end. He is the author of the covenant and He is the finisher. Everything, absolutely everything, wraps around Jesus. And for that, I am not ashamed to say that Jesus is the Way, the Truth, and the Life, no one comes to Him, except by His mercy and grace alone to grant you repentance and faith in Him.Be good bereans and search the scriptures to see if these things are true. May the Lord bless you! :)"},{"Title":"The Heart of Wisdom Teaching Approach: Bible Based Homeschooling","review":"Thank you, Robin, for a book that clearly articulates where, how and why a \\"Classical\\" education is not necessarily a \\"Christian\\" one! As a home schooler, I have been shocked at how most Christian curriculum not only embraces, but also endorses Greco-Roman mythology, philosophy and world views. At times, I thought I was the only one who felt this way, until I opened this book and read how articulately Robin had put my thoughts, feelings and ponderings into not just words, but a simple to follow outline approach that left me plenty of room to personalize! This is our third year of \\"life learning at home,\\" and my girls LOVE to learn now! THANK YOU for a great book!"},{"Title":"The Heart of Wisdom Teaching Approach: Bible Based Homeschooling","review":"This book is an amazing book! Robin Sampson will show you the different learning styles. She will take you through history to show how we have adapted the Greek system of learning. (Very Interesting!) She will guide and show how to incorporate God into daily \\"school\\" routine to make God the most important part of the day. Robin Sampson has done an excellent job of putting so much useful information into one book!!! I would recommend to anyone homeschooling or considering homeschool."},{"Title":"The Heart of Wisdom Teaching Approach: Bible Based Homeschooling","review":"If I had to choose only one homeschooling book, HOWTA would be the one! Amazing, stupendous work by Robin Sampson! I can't believe I'm so blessed to have found what I will use for the rest of my homeschool years this early on! I was homeschooled growing up, and worked in a homeschool bookstore. I've seen it all, and THIS is what it's all about. The resource section alone is worth its weight in gold. I can't possibly recommend it highly enough!!!"},{"Title":"The Heart of Wisdom Teaching Approach: Bible Based Homeschooling","review":"I found this book to be refreshing, challenging, and full of insight. It encouraged me to teach our children the way that God intended for them to be taught. Robin kept taking us back to the Bible the only source of TRUTH and WISDOM. I have told many people about this book. It is one of my three favorite books from the past year (the number 2 book is by Robin also, What your child needs to know when)."},{"Title":"The Heart of Wisdom Teaching Approach: Bible Based Homeschooling","review":"Through much prayer and research, I was lead to this book. After reading it I understand the four step approach and can use it in all my educational experiences for my children. I felt so much more comfortable homeschooling my children. I felt I had really been taught how to homeschool! It is not only informative, but interesting.a rare combination in how to books!"},{"Title":"The Heart of Wisdom Teaching Approach: Bible Based Homeschooling","review":"As a Christian home schooling mom, I always felt that there was something more that I could be doing for my children. I just couldn't put my finger on what that was. Of course, this was because I was still blinded by the world's educational system, and by their standards I was doing above and beyond. I taught them reading, math, spelling, history, science, and more but I never felt peace about the whole process. That is until I read The Heart of Wisdom Teaching Approach by Robin Sampson. It was only then that everything began to make sense. Not only did this book open my eyes but it opened my spirit to receive a wealth of wisdom based on God's Word.This book contains over 500 pages of solid biblical principles to apply to your vision for your child's education. Robin spent more than twenty years researching and seeking God to find our biblical history and she put it into this book. It will teach you so that you can teach them. It will give you revelation and insight to what truly matters and what doesn't. You will be relieved of all the traditions and learned behaviors you have been accustomed to and you will begin to see just how easy it is to breathe life into your children. You will see them come alive with a desire to learn more. That in itself is priceless.In the first section, Lessons from Exodus, Robin shares her personal struggles with home schooling. I found it to be very similar to my own battles. She addresses issues like: Why am I so frustrated? Why don't the kids enjoy learning? Am I doing the right thing? Is this enough? I felt right at home reading about these burdens most of us face on a daily basis. In fact, once I started reading I could hardly put it down. I was learning how to let God lead me on this journey. I was retraining my mind to think His way. It was so freeing.In section two Robin will take you back to your roots and reveal the inner thoughts of God and the purpose of man. She exposes where the fruit turned sour and weeds began to grow. This history lesson made me wish I had been one of her children seated at the kitchen table and soaking up knowledge from her diligent studies. I now understand my history. I know more about who Jesus is and that is helpful if I am to aspire to be just like him. If you want the truth go to the source. Robin will take you there.In section three of this book she discusses the Heart of Wisdom methods. They are a collection of time proven techniques that actually work. They embrace and teach to every part of the child's being. Some of those that are discussed include the Charlotte Mason method, the Delight Directed Approach, Writing to Learn, Critical Thinking and Logic, and Unit Studies. There is also an in depth chapter on learning styles and the Four Step HOW Process: Excite, Examine, Expand, and Excel.Sections four and five give you instructions and ideas to implement and create a perfect God centered learning process for your children. You will read the detailed HOW plan overview and the meaty guide for bible study. She will teach you to develop your own unit studies, create notebooks, and how to schedule by faith. After all it is all in God's timing, right? There is also an exhaustive list of resources that will leave you with need for nothing else but the presence of God.The best part about the whole approach is that I can incorporate the materials I currently have and use, make my own, or purchase Robin's Unit Studies from the Heart of Wisdom website. In addition to that I need a bible, a pencil, and paper. How awesome is that?This book is bible based, intelligently written, captivating to read, and abundant in life changing truth. This book is a definite must-have for any home library. I recommend it even if you don't home school. Every Christian should learn about their heritage. Every Christian should have a Heart of Wisdom.Teach us to number our days aright, that we may gain a heart of wisdom.--Psalm 90:12"},{"Title":"The Heart of Wisdom Teaching Approach: Bible Based Homeschooling","review":"I read this book a year ago and it was great! But it was a new approach for me and it was very helpful. I've been actually using the different approaches she mentions in her book and have adapted them to our family's needs. I decided to reread the book, and boy am I glad I did! I understood more about where she was coming. If you are new to the Charlot Mason, this is a great beginning! Plus, you will LOVE Robin's 4Mat System!!! I have no doubt, this Homeschooling book is a MUST READ! and a MUST READ AGAIN:)"},{"Title":"The Heart of Wisdom Teaching Approach: Bible Based Homeschooling","review":"I love the author's approach to homeschooling, I will use a lot of her ideas. I would give this book 5 stars if every other page didn't have typos on it. I had a very hard time reading it with so many mistakes. I wondered how I could really trust something that was so poorly edited. Most of the problems were misspellings and wrong words used, but some parts were actually historically inaccurate."},{"Title":"The Heart of Wisdom Teaching Approach: Bible Based Homeschooling","review":"I have only read two chapters of this book and know it's for me. I will definitely be ordering her homeschoolcirriculum."},{"Title":"The Heart of Wisdom Teaching Approach: Bible Based Homeschooling","review":"This is a wonderful book on education. The history of how our education system came about versus the Biblical model of education is highly insightful! The author also provides a model of teaching using the Bible as its foundation. The Heart of Wisdom teaching method applies to all four learning styles. It can be used with various teaching philosophies - Charlotte Mason method, unit studies, delight directed learning. It has more recommended reading at the end of each chapter for further information. It also has many recommendations for books in different subject areas and grade levels. Very useful book and very insightful!"},{"Title":"The Heart of Wisdom Teaching Approach: Bible Based Homeschooling","review":"I've changed my views on this approach. I don't wish to \\"bash\\" the product, but I no longer agree with this approach."},{"Title":"The Heart of Wisdom Teaching Approach: Bible Based Homeschooling","review":"Very informative and helpful. It gives you lots of options and ideas in homeschooling the Biblical way.Neat historical information included. A few thing I wasn't impressed with but very minor. Still a good book."},{"Title":"The Heart of Wisdom Teaching Approach: Bible Based Homeschooling","review":"This book is a must-read for Christian homeschool teachers. With dedicated prayer and insight, Robin Sampson has created a new approach to teaching that filters every subject through the Bible. The framework she provides at first seems complex, but after immersing yourself in it for a few days it becomes very clear and logical. I am so excited about this new school year and I am certain I will learn as much as my kids. That's one of the best things about this approach. It is applicable to you as well as to your students. It allows lots of room for creativity with options for scrapbooking, drawing, writing and anything else that can be documented for a portfolio. Even instituting a portion of the suggestions made in this book will revitalize your Christian homeschool and alleviate burnout for you, the teacher."},{"Title":"The Heart of Wisdom Teaching Approach: Bible Based Homeschooling","review":"Robin Sampson does an excellent job of presenting and authenticating her point of view that a child's education, to be most pleasing to God, should be biblically based; meaning that is should be based on the type of education that God guided the Hebrew people to give to their childre. This education, then and now, should be based on the study of God's Word and God's World. Robin points out the fallacies of classical educaiton from it's inception and also gives us an exellent choice of other books to refer to and read to substantiate her research.The book is well thought out, well-documented and well-written.Sampson not only makes an excellent case for Bible based unit studies, but gives us concrete plans to help get started, which is what many other method books leave out. I spent nearly 18 months researching classical education in the homeschool before I began to decipher exactly how it might look in practice.As a former homeschool mom, I wish Robin's book had been around 10 yrs ago. My goal now, with a Master's Degree in Christian Education, is to form a type of co-op school using the best methods available. After 2-3 yrs of research, what I was developing was very close to what Robin has. After finding her website and ordering this book I am now devoting my time to her reading list so I can better understand the underlying presumptions of her philosophy instead of reinventing the wheel."},{"Title":"The Heart of Wisdom Teaching Approach: Bible Based Homeschooling","review":"I feel blessed to have stumbled across this book because for me it has been a prayer answered. I found it while looking for information on how to apply the Charlotte Mason teaching method.I withdrew my son from school and started home-schooling him with little warning and no planning. Although I knew this was the right decision it left me in a difficult possition. I either had time to reaserch how and what to teach him or to teach him but not both at the same time.The HOWTA has given me a frame on which to mount the canvas of our home-schooling. There are many great points about this method but there are two in particular which I love. The first is that is has such a sound biblical base - which is something which is so important to both myself and my son. This really shows through in all subjects. The other really wonderful thing is that I am inclined to go for a delight driven approach but sometimes lack confidence in this as it has no structure and is very difficult to plan round or collect resources for in advance. The HOWTA has given me the confidence that I lacked because it shows how to follow the delight driven path while being within a structure. And because it is a biblical structure I feel comfortable and secure using it. I have since purchased other items by Robin Sampson and was not disappointed and I plan to buy more as our home-school journey progresses."},{"Title":"The Heart of Wisdom Teaching Approach: Bible Based Homeschooling","review":"Robin Sampson hits really strong on Bible first-and-all-day-in-every-subject.Sampson also is a big promoter of the 4mat method which in a nutshell is: get them excited about the subject, study it, and show what you learned. You show what you learned best by lapbooking (scrapfolder) or notebooking or some other project- maybe a diorama or something.Well, I am a strong believer in lots of Bible, but I did not teach it all school day. So, in that area, I was really challenged. I have committed to do this now.If you have not read her book... I cannot recommend it highly enough. No other homeschool book has been more valuable. Worth every penny."},{"Title":"The Heart of Wisdom Teaching Approach: Bible Based Homeschooling","review":"While reading this book I kept telling myself, \\"This is what I wanted/hoped for when I started Homeschooling!\\". I am so glad I have found it now. I love the 4 Mat system and Robin's use of it in her unit studies. She goes into detail of how you can use her unit studies, make your own, or implement somone else's. It fits everyones needs who wants a biblical based education for their children. Even if you don't want a biblical based education it goes in depth of how to create a unit study of an area where your child shows delight (good example of a horse study). If you are new to homeschooling it helps support your decision and gives resources for you to use that have taken veteran homeschoolers years to discover. It gives you the best of the best!"},{"Title":"The Heart of Wisdom Teaching Approach: Bible Based Homeschooling","review":"I am so relieved to have found this book. The most important key to a childs growth and success in this world is how to obtain and walk in wisdom. This book clearly defines what true wisdom is and where to find it as well as how to teach it.

I really like the format of this program, its easy to use. What I like best is the Internet Linked books. There are so many resources out there for free, that I would have never found on my own. I also love the heart of wisdom website, it also has all the links in the books and more."},{"Title":"The Heart of Wisdom Teaching Approach: Bible Based Homeschooling","review":"I can say that I am very impressed by this book for several reasons. First it is very detail oriented and goes to great lengths to explain things to you in a way that leaves you knowing that homeschooling is the best possible thing for you and your family. It also covers so many different subjects, like teaching styles, Jewish roots (the importance of a biblical foundation in the law and the prohpets)and endless more. It lists all available resources and just walks you through the different ways to teach and the importance of teaching your child(ren) in the best way, for their personality and learning style. I could go on and on, but to close, I have recommended this book and curriculum to two other friends who have also decided to use the HOW teaching approach this year. That speaks volumes!"},{"Title":"The Heart of Wisdom Teaching Approach: Bible Based Homeschooling","review":"I am really enjoying this book. It gives basic pricipals, but also offers encouragement. As I have started homeschooling this year for the first time, I have been afraid and uncertain of my abilities. HEART OF WISDOM teaching approach has encourged me to look up to our only real source of strength and wisdom. It will be a continous resource throughout my time as a homeschooler."},{"Title":"The Heart of Wisdom Teaching Approach: Bible Based Homeschooling","review":"I have looked at HOW approach now online for about 2 years - but I was not truly clear on how to implement it. I understood the concept of doing unit studies with a bible base - but exactly how. So I decided to order the book The Heart of Wisdom Teaching Approach and it clarified every question for me. I found the book to be clear about what I needed to do from how many notebooks to use right down to specific resources. But the book doesn't just do that - I have gone back to it when I need spritual encouragement as well - especially, scheduling by faith. If this method appeals to you, I would encourage you to purchase this book and see for yourself. I know our family has been blessed!"},{"Title":"The Heart of Wisdom Teaching Approach: Bible Based Homeschooling","review":"This book was truly a God-send. I used to sit with my kids at a table finishing endless workbook pages. It was as frustrating for me as it was for them. Now we sit in the living room reading, discussing, and truly learning.Robin Sampson made me really think about education today. The way Robin walked through the history of school from ancient times to present day public schools explained a lot about why they're failing.Not only does she explain the problem, she gives a solution. Get back to our roots! As a christian homeschooler I need to begin with God. This book outlines a Bible-based unit study of history in chronological order. Language skills are taught through writing (creative, narrative, copy work, dication, etc), keeping spelling, vocabulary, and Hebrew/Greek notebooks, and LOTS of reading. Science is taught in creation order.This curriculum is easy to follow and though each lesson is structured it leaves enough freedom for following my children's interests. I love the fact that Robin has found a way to tailor each lesson to 4 different learning styles. Not only that, it's age inclusive. The only subject I'll need to teach individually is math.Instead of boring color, cut, and paste projects, my children will be creating a portfolio of work that they will keep forever and show to friends and family. Every time they show it they review that lesson.Even if you don't want to use the curriculum, this book lists hundreds of resources. Different books for Bible study, history by time period, science by topic, and wholesome literature by age group.It's a must-have book.

Lie: \\" she clearly considers her brothers and sisters in Christ who adhere to the Covenant Theology doctrine, as heretical\\"WHERE---what page. She never says this.#2. Lie: She goes on to say those within the RT camp (though, remember, it is properly called CT) are anti-semetic (and are the reason for the holocaust). \\"WHERE? She never says this ANYWHERE? BOLD FACE LIES!!!!.#3.Lie: \\"Jews do not believe in Christ, but deny their Messiah has come. \\" Are you saying ALL Jews deny Christ? The entire first church were Jews. Don't you believe a Jew can be saved? What about the disciples--all Jews? You sound anti-semantic to me.Every one of Robin's books and blogs teach Jesus is absolutely the ONLY way to God.

I have throughly enjoyed all the knowledge and wisdom that I have gleened from reading Sections 1 and 2 about rethinking christian education. It has really been a blessing to be challenged to think about the methods by which we educate our children.

I bought it about six months ago but it sat on the shelf. Last year was our first year of homeschool. We put our son through what amounted to a state education with some Bible thrown in. We were stressed. He was stressed. It was way too much academic pressure for him. He was in tears. We were frustrated. Then this year, I was thinking about going to a classical education model. I was going through some of the curriculum and my spirit was saying, \\"What are you thinking? False gods, mythology, humanism?\\" I quickly picked this book up off the shelf. It was an answer to prayer.Through much prayer and seeking, I have found this: Our kids are not wards of the state. If we're just shoving curriculum or classics or Latin down their throats, we might as well put them back in public school. That's the knowledge of the world, which God says is folly. True wisdom and knowledge comes only from God. It's an entire paradigm shift. It's RADICAL! True wisdom is taught through daily discipleship in God's Word, mentoring and showing our children how to walk. That's what homeschooling for Christians is all about. It's about character, not knowledge. I seemed to have forgotten that. This book set me straight and showed us a path to get there.Thanks Robin!"},{"Title":"The Heart of Wisdom Teaching Approach: Bible Based Homeschooling","review":"Once I received this book, I couldn't put it down!

If you have worried over how you are teaching your children-then this is the only thing you will ever need to begin with.Even for adults that are not teaching their children,the roots of this book go way deep.She goes into the history of the past cultures and the whys.She speaks about education with authority and understanding.She opened my mind and my heart.I had learned so much from just the first sections of this that I thought what can I learn when I get to the actual teaching parts? I was shocked and pleasantly surprised.I bought this first and fore most because I was interested in teaching with the Bible and in the Charlotte Mason way.Robin has been led by God to toss old traditional ways and follow what God has laid on her heart.And that's not to say that she says her way is the ONLY way.She tells you to pray and use what God tells you and leads you.She takes various approaches and weaves them in to the curriculum that she wrote and the way of teaching she uses.Who is to say that one way-classical,Noah approach,Charlotte Mason,etc..is the right way? We as christian faith have to prayfully seek God and let Him direct us. I know that this book has opened my eyes and heart,And I will be implementing this in my life.And even if you are not homeschooling or teaching-this book with the wealth of information will help you to study in your personal life,or teaching Sunday School or what ever means you use it to bring fruit in your life.It certainly will bring fruit.No one can read this book and not be touched by it.And her unit study Adam to the Messiah is wonderful.I bought this to use in my personal studies and it is an eye opener as well.Robin is certainly inspired by God and led by Him.Good job!!!!!"},{"Title":"Your Nostradamus Factor","review":"You've probably had a day when you said to yourself, &quot;If I had known it was going to be this kind of day, I never would have gotten out of bed!&quot; You may have gone through times when you felt, &quot;If I had known life was going to be like this, I never would have been born!&quot;Those of us who accept ideas such as precognition and reincarnation know the irony of such statements. Somewhere during the night our sleeping selves did know what kind of day was coming. Somewhere in the heavens our unmaterialized souls did know what life held in store.Why then do we forget? Some have speculated that it is exactly because the foreknowledge would discourage us from going through the experience. If so, then why do we sometimes get brief breaks in the amnesia, allowing us glimpses of the future? What is this game?I'm pondering these paradoxes because I've just read a book that has fascinated and shaken me more than most I've seen lately. The book is, Your Nostradamas Factor: Accessing Your Innate Ability to See into The Future (Simon &amp; Schuster). The author, Ingo Swann, is a prominent psychic, learned and influential in the field of parapsychology. He has participated in countless experiments, projects his own creative wit helped make more interesting than the average statistics-gathering routine. By inventing the term, &quot;remote viewing,&quot; a techno-speak metaphor for clairvoyance, he prompted a new line of research that has achieved one of the best track records demonstrating the psychic abilities of the average person. In his newest book he turns his talents to what he calls &quot;future-seeing.&quot;He presents the mental dynamics responsible for future-seeing as well as for blocking future-seeing. He repeatedly emphasizes diagramming one's ideas to foster the psychic process of visualizing. He gives many hints on how to release our inner Nostradamus factor from the triple-walled prison of ignorance, prejudice, and expectation. One of the propositions in his theory, refreshing to someone who lives in a community where being psychic seems to pass for an education, is that it is easier to correctly see the future for subjects about which you are knowledgeable than for subjects about which you are totally ignorant. Knowledge creates a range of feasibilities for the future, focusing psychic sensitivity on anticipating the unexpected.To test his theory on eliciting the Nostradamus factor, Mr. Swann conducted his own experiment, the &quot;American Prophecy Project.&quot; For somewhat over a year, he distributed a newsletter to a select mailing list in which he published his predictions. He accurately predicted the U.S. economic downturn of 1990 and Margaret Thatcher's resignation, both of which were contrary to general expectations at the time he published them. In other areas where he was less knowledgeable, such as concerning geological events (e.g., earthquakes), his predictions were less than stunning.The book concludes with a solemnly guided tour of the future. Swann challenges us to form our own predictions and to act accordingly. His own predictions are quite sobering and yet different from what we might expect. Most of us have been exposed to enough fuss about &quot;end times&quot; to become numb to the future. Such numbness is exactly the opposite of what Swann intends. He wants us, in fact, to wake up to our own sense of the future, to begin to anticipate it more consciously.Swann proposes that future-seeing properly belongs to us as a daily tool for &quot;right living.&quot; It is not just the ability to see around the corner but also the ability to anticipate the consequences of our actions. What kind of future are you creating now? Can't you see it?I wonder what it would be like to awaken in the morning and see flash before me what my day will be like, and watch that prognosis change as I shift to put my right foot down first instead of my left. Yes, every wiggle, every thought, has its ripple effect. As chaos theory shows, the flap of a butterfly's wing can lead to a hurricane thousands of miles away!We can know all things, but can we handle all that information? No wonder we play ostrich with our future-seeing ability. Sometimes, however, our Nostradamus factor does try to get our attention, to prompt us to get our head out of the sand. How then do we respond to these occasional wake up calls?Take violence, for example, whether in the form of guns, earthquakes or financial calamities. Violence is a wake up call that Swann highlights as an ominous portent of things to come. Violence is a last resort reaction to inertia. If you have ever been so frustrated with your inability (AKA unwillingness?) to change a bad habit that you got angry with yourself, perhaps you can intuit how violence is born. Violence signals us there's conflict about change.There is a war brewing, Swann says, a war where the future tries to save itself from the past. Today's cigarette smoker is experiencing a precursor to this war. A private habit has become a public nuisance and the extermination campaign attracts zealots. Smokers are the target of aggressive attempts to extinguish their habit.

There is no reliable evidence that the alignment of planets have any effect on our destiny or that we can predict the future using Astrology. The evidence claimed for such effects can be better explained by selection effects where for example, only bad events were noticed when bad events were supposed to happen and only the good events were noticed and recorded when good events were supposed to happen. Such a selection effect could have led to the creation of the whole Astrological system.Ingo clearly states in the beginning of the book that he cannot predict the future and proved it in the end when nearly all but the most vague predictions he made did not come true. His one good prediction that the Berlin Wall would come down was made in front of a German audience when someone basically demanded he make at least one prediction. The wall did come down in the time frame he claimed but in retrospect that could have just been the obvious prediction to make under the circumstances combined with a bit of luck and no Astrology."},{"Title":"Neuroanatomy: A Programmed Text, Vol. 1","review":"when my college roommmate (now at yale med) recommended this book w/it's 1965 copyright, i was real skeptical about its worth. this a workbook, and in a dorky way, it's a lot of fun. for example, the first question might read: \\"the ___ fissure separates the temporal lobe from the rest of the cortex above\\", -turn the page-, \\"sylvian,\\" &lt;turn the page>, next question: picture of the brain with a line drawn toward a fissure above the temporal lobe requesting a label, -turn the page-, voila! \\"sylvian fissure.\\" it's a real gentle way to learn neuroanatomy, so through writing and repetition you really drum the info into your head. as my roommate said, you can do it watching tv. all my old college buddies at harvard med new pathway had sidman & sidman for 'summer hmwk'. do it over the summer, and i promise you'll knock the socks off of neuroanatomy lab. yeah, the drawings are ghetto, but it works.

I was really impressed with how timely the information is, and how easy it is to learn. Its repetitive nature of filling in the blanks really fit my learning style well. I highly recommend this book to anyone working with neuroanatomy (MRI, PET) applications. The only drawback is that about halfway through the text there is no way to check your answers-maybe its a space consideration."},{"Title":"Neuroanatomy: A Programmed Text, Vol. 1","review":"I graduated medical school in 1979. I recall that during the summer of 1976, in preparation for the following semester course in neuroanatomy, I used this book. I should not say I read it as it is a programmed text, meaning I interacted with it. This was the most benign pleasant way to learn anything ever !I am now a neuroradiologist and wish I still had the book to look brush up on some of the more obscure neuroanatomical pathways. If I try to read a \\"normal\\" textbook, by brain cannot process the information. This book spoon feeds predigested information in manageable bites.I give this workbook my highest recommendation for anyone faced with the daunting task of learning neuroanatomy."},{"Title":"Neuroanatomy: A Programmed Text, Vol. 1","review":"I just took neuroanatomy and got an A!

It's great for neuroanatomy and after you finished it you can impress all your friends with your knowledge of brain parts. It's not hard and the questions it gives are easy to do because all the questions build on each other. But it gets tedious after a while since it keeps trying to drill the concepts into your head. I guess it's a good way though. The book was published in the 1960s, so some of the pictures are pretty old. But they're still pretty clear and easy to learn.It's still in printing since the 1960s so that proves how good it is. Even if you're not a neuroscientist or anatomist you can use this book. It's fun. At the end are some clinical applications of the knowledge so you can use what you learned to find problems in case studies of patients. that come to the physicians complaining of symptoms. It's quite nice."},{"Title":"Neuroanatomy: A Programmed Text, Vol. 1","review":"Sidman and Sidman is probably the fastest most efficient method of learning neuroanatomy. This is a workbook or epic proportions. The set-up is quite odd and going through it involves going from cover to cover multiple times. Go through once in the A section, then go through it backward in the B section, then forward in the C section, then backward in the D section, etc... you get the point. This enables the book to utilize repitition and build on what it has already covered, which, I believe, is a pretty good way to learn it. Repetition is going to be involved any time you are learning anatomy. The nature of the beast.Some setbacks. The pictures aren't great. Never are they in color. At times they seem faded and hard to read, although I do not recall a single instance where I was inhibited from observing what I needed to observe in order to understand the point. It is also hard to review. Since you go through the book forward and backward multiple times, it makes a poor reference. Lastly, though it is highly accurate, it is not 100% accurate. It will give you the wrong impression on a couple of points, though I would guess that it is possible to find corrections on the net.Overall, I say that this book is an excellent resource for anyone who wants to learn neuroanatomy."},{"Title":"Neuroanatomy: A Programmed Text, Vol. 1","review":"This is exactly the kind of book that you wish you had gone through before you ever took neuroanatomy in medical school. All of those pathways and nuclei that just stymied and overwhelmed me during the class were drilled into my head by the time I finished the entire book, because the book makes you keep writing their names and identifying their functions over and over again. I hope that I'm not making it sound boring and awful, because it wasn't. Actually it's almost kind of fun to do, and since every item takes two or four pages (depending on whether the answer is given), you move through it quickly and have the psychological satisfaction of making a lot of progress. I just did one section per day over a period of several weeks and it was completely worth the time and effort. I highly recommend this book to anyone getting ready to take a med school neuroanatomy course.

In that tradition, Kathleen Ernst explores the nature of courage in THE BRAVEST GIRL IN SHARPSBURG. She centers her story around what has been called the bloodiest day in American history-September 17, 1862 when the people of Sharpsburg, Maryland found themselves embroiled forever in the Civil War.Told alternately in the voices of sisters Bethie and Teresa Kretzer, whose family sympathies lie with the Union, and their friend Savilla Miller, whose family is for the Confederacy, it begins when seamstress Teresa fashions a magnificent version of the stars and stripes and sends the banner waving over the town's main street, in defiance of her neighbors' neutral or South leaning politics. It ends in all three girls' involvement in the war as Lee's army crosses the Potomac and into their lives.Along the way, Kathleen Ernst's skill and compassionate heart invites lucky readers into a world of threads binding sisters and brothers and friends, where a blacksmith farmer introduces his boldest daughter with &quot;she's got sand&quot; , where women get &quot;belled up&quot; for festivities one day and scrap their knuckles bloody as they turn heirloom damask tablecloths into lint for bandages, another. Savilla, Bethie, Teresa and their kinswomen feed grateful soldiers who are &quot;skinny as stray dogs in winter,&quot; act as Confederate spies, are courted by a pacifist and men of both sides of the conflict, and assist conductors on the Underground Railroad.Ernst adds a unique new chapter to Civil War stories, giving voice to the usually voiceless casualties of that conflict: a wide-eyed boy killed by a mob when he was on the wrong road at the wrong time, the fleeing widowed refugees fearing reprisals against themselves and their children, the soldiers and civilians downed by fever, accidents, or their own comrades, and the citizens of Sharpsburg who endured the shelling of that infamous day.Through it all, this powerful novel brings the painful choices of a border state dramatically to life. In Author's Notes both fine scholarship and honor and affection for the people and events on which the novel is based are in evidence. And who was the bravest girl in Sharpsburg? Kathleen Ernst has wisely left that up to her young readers to decide.--Eileen Charbonneau, author of HONOR TO THE HILLS"},{"Title":"The Bravest Girl in Sharpsburg (Wm Kids, 5)","review":"Kathleen Ernst has very graciously refrained from rating her own book in her comments here about writing it, which has knocked down the average reader rating. Too bad. We need to get everybody who buys it from Amazon to rate it and bring the average up.The book is simply outstanding. The story is suspenseful, insightful, and very moving; and it bodies forth the historical events with astonishing accuracy. The addition of Teresa Kretzer's sister, Bethie, as a third narrator adds an unexpected dimension of inwardness. And how remarkable that the two characters locked in conflict, Teresa and Savilla, are so differently and deeply realized.This is a study in different aspects of courage. It is a study of war and its impact on friends, families, and neighbors. And for each character, it is a study of conversion and repentance and reconciliation.I believe I've read now all of Kathleen Ernst's stories to date. Every one of them is exceptional. This one strikes me as the best."},{"Title":"Sex Without Fear","review":"This book is a scientific explanation of the male and female reproductive systems and their function for adolescents and young marrieds. It tells in simple and objective language what we do and what to expect. The graphics are high-caliber, and are what you might expect to see in a medical book. Nothing is omitted or hidden. Call-outs are extensive. There are no pictures of intercourse and nothing suggestive or seductive. The title suggests nothing.

That point is utterly ignored by the Cliff Notes.It is also not clear which version the Cliff Notes reviews.

(Unfortunately, none of these characters are required kill themselves- instead, in each instance, they are saved by a miraculous event.)

Brian Karas captured the world's attention with his not-particularly-groundbreaking-but-still-interesting, \\"Muncha Muncha Muncha\\" he helped author Lenny Hort create a sweet little selection entitled, \\"The Seals On the Bus\\". Taking silliness to a whole new level, \\"Seals\\" replaces those tired old standby lines found in the song, \\"The Wheels On the Bus\\" and replaces them with a convoluted carnival of copious critters. It's silly, frenetic, and thoroughly enjoyable to the kiddies.A small family of four wait patiently at a bus stop. The kids are unencumbered and their parents read their book and newspaper respectively. Once on the bus, however, everything goes higgledy-piggledy. First some seals come on board (accompanied by the text, \\"The seals on the bus go errp, errp, errp\\"). I've always thought that seals were prone to more arfing than errping, but that's just me I guess. Suddenly the seals' boisterous errps make the driver more than a little angry. The driver, to the surprise of his human passengers, is actually a tiger. So the text says, \\"The tiger on the bus goes roar, roar, roar\\". This is where things start picking up. Geese jump aboard the bus, with the appropriate geese sounds in tow. Next come rabbits. Then monkeys, then vipers, then sheep. In a way, it's the final skunks that push the grownups completely off the deep end. Fortunately, at this point the bus as ended at a fabulous party and the kids are more than happy to join in the fun.Lenny Hort is the official author of this tale, and it's a funny enough concept I'll grant you. Still, it's Karas who brings the entire enterprise to full glorious life. I wasn't a particular fan of his work on \\"Muncha Muncha Muncha\\", I'll admit. Maybe that was because he didn't include any seals. Cause let's face it, the man is an excellent seal-artist. The book itself has a kind of faux sloppiness to it. At first, it looks like the pictures were just randomly brought together. But on closer inspection it's clear that Karas uses his gouache, acrylics, pencils and cut paper to the best of his ability. I was particularly interested in how the buildings and reading materials in this story were created out of real honest-to-goodness newsprint. Partly these amused me because Karas would carefully smudge important names on that newsprint. Partly they amused me because they were often ads of boring grown-up business/stock information (apropos when using that same material to create houses and buildings). As for the characters themselves, Karas is far better at drawing animals than people. In \\"Muncha\\" this was a problem. Here, it's an advantage. You may notice the family from time to time, but the real heroes of this tale are the myriad of different animals filling each and every page. And great seals. Great great seals.All in all, \\"The Seals On the Bus\\" takes an old song, modernizes it with silly and ridiculous images, and has a great time doing it. Consequently, your kids will have a ball reading it. And if you happen to be the kind of adult that can repeat the words, \\"Errp, errp, errp\\", over and over with the right amount of aplomb and humor, this will become your children's favorite bedtime story of the year. Definitely consider checking it out."},{"Title":"The Seals on the Bus (Owlet Book)","review":"This book brings new fun to the kid-pleasing song, The Wheels on the Bus.

I did not realize at the time that the movie came from a book by the same title. I now have both in my library.I read alot of non-fiction material on World War II and every once in awhile a book of fiction will be so good and so interesting that it will capture my attention. This book by Tom Chamales is one that calls out to be read. The book was written in 1957 in a writer's colony from which James Jones was once a part. Jones' \\"From Here to Eternity' was written from Jones' experience in World War II, and so it is also with \\"Never So Few.'The subject matter concerns itself with guerrilla operations in Burma having the Kachin native troops highlighted. Their mission is of course to fight the Japanese troops in Burma and to do so they must fight behind the Japanese lines. It \\"...is a violent, exhausting, perilous life.\\"The attention Tom Chamales paid to details is noteworthy in this his first novel. Should you enjoy reading on World War II and don't mind reading a novel this book will satisfy you.The Kachins, the Burma theatre, and the experience of being there will fill several informing hours for you.Semper Fi."},{"Title":"Never So Few","review":"Chamales spent a year and a half behind Japanese lines in northern Burma, commanding a group of Kachin guerrillas for the Office of Strategic Services, the WWII forerunner of the CIA. He arrived in Burma a lieutenant and left a captain; the Kachin christened him \\"Duakaba,\\" a very honorable title, for his wartime exploits against the Japanese. Chamales drew from personal experience when writing NEVER SO FEW. The battle scenes are excellent, as is the development of the book's characters, who represented the eccentric and unconventional warriors of the OSS. The romance with Carla adds to the story, in my opinion, although it often is painted with the somewhat hokey brush-strokes of the 1950s. That is a minor criticism. The writing is very raw, and Chamales never met an adverb that he didn't like, which can be a bit annoying at times. The editor at Charles Scribner's Sons had a light hand, sometimes too light in view of occasional typographic errors, but I think that Scribner's recognized the power of the raw, unschooled prose. It's a book that today's cookie-cutter publishers wouldn't accept, and for that reason alone people should read it."},{"Title":"Never So Few","review":"This is my Favorite Book of Fiction OF All Times. need paperbacks to read so I don't damage my First Editions for USA and Great Britian. Thanks for the Great Read."},{"Title":"Never So Few","review":"I have read many,many war novels over the last 40+ years so when one reader said in an Amazon discussion forum that this was the best war novel he had ever read I had to try it. Very disappointing. It is a well written story but the jungle war in North Burma is just a backdrop to the character development of a number of men and women. Very little action here. When I read a war novel I like to go from one graphic firefight to another. This is definitely not that kind of book. The writer is very talented but this book is not my cup of tea because of the scarcity of combat scenes. Not worth it in my opinion. Definitely not the best war novel."},{"Title":"Never So Few","review":"As an account of what was apparently the author's experience in Burma in World War II this book has some interest. But as a novel I thought it had little merit. I found myself being dismayed at how thick the book was and when would it end? The accounts of the romance between Con and Carla added nothing to the book, so far as I could see. The battle scenes were well-written but if they were factual, I would rather know it--namely a non-fiction account would have enabled me to know what was true and what was made up. The incident of the Chinese killing Americans, of which the author says he had first-hand knowledge--really second-hand, though--added an attention-holding portion to the novel, but that incident occupies only a small portion of the story. Frankly, I was glad when I got to the last page of this book. If you liked From Here to Eternity, I think you will be disappointed by the plotlessness of this pale imitation thereof."},{"Title":"Desegregating the Altar: The Josephites and the Struggle for Black Priests, 1871-1960","review":"In this book, Stephen Ochs has given a wonderfully informative history of an important aspect of African-American religious history: the struggle between 1871-1960 to include black priests in the Catholic Church. Ochs begins by noting (using 1988 figures) that there are thirteen Afro-American Roman Catholic bishops, with three hundred priests, and 1.5 million black Catholics in this country (about 2% of the total).However, the struggle to reach this position began with the experiences of St. Joseph's Society of the Sacred Heart, known as the \\"Josephites,\\" who were \\"the lone Roman Catholic clerical society of priests and brothers devoted exclusively to ministry in the Afro-American community.\\" Ochs notes that \\"Before the arrival of the Mill Hill Fathers, the church had basically failed in its mission to Afro-Americans. Successive waves of Catholic European immigration throughout the nineteenth century had taxed church resources to the limit and left few priests and sisters available for work among blacks.\\"The first black priests in this country were three brothers, who were all born slaves in the 1830s to an Irishman named Michael Morris Healy, who had ten children in a monogamous relationship with one of his black slaves named Mary Eliza (it would have been illegal for them to have married, of course). Their oldest son, James Augustine Healy, was ordained for the diocese of Boston, and eventually was made the second bishop of Portland, Maine. Unfortunately, \\"Healy identified more with his Irish heritage and his French training than with his Afro-American background.\\" Later, \\"On December 19, 1891, the six-foot-two-inch tall seminarian (Charles Uncles) became the first black man ordained in the United States.\\"Ochs covers many areas of fact, such as that Xavier University in New Orleans is \\"America's only Catholic black university.\\" He also notes that some of the friends of the movement for black priests weren't black themselves: \\"During the last two decades of the nineteenth century, the cause of black priests in the Catholic Church had no greater champion than the Reverend John R. Slattery.\\"Ochs also takes note of some intra-group squabbles, such as \\"the feud between the Josephites and the Committee for the Advancement of Colored Catholics,\\" and the later \\"rupture in the Federated Colored Catholics.\\"This is a fascinating and much-needed book that will be ESSENTIAL READING for Catholics, black Catholics, anyone interested in African-American religion, or African-American studies in general."},{"Title":"Desegregating the Altar: The Josephites and the Struggle for Black Priests, 1871-1960","review":"Excellent book to study the emergence of Black priest in America."},{"Title":"Poetry: A Pocket Anthology (Penguin Academics Series) (4th Edition)","review":"This is a great anthology.

When I was finally able to move to an acreage and get my own horses I realized that the scanty training I got by osmosis from my Dad did not quite prepare me for starting a new horse nor win at local shows. This lack of knowledge led me to various libraries where I browsed several volumes varying from dressage to training jumping and race horses.After reading several books and magazines and still feeling unsure, I stumbled across this book in the Cardston library. This book has it all in concise, easy to read language. Using the principles outlined I have become somewhat sucessesful in competive trail and pleasure showing of the Tennessee Walking horse.Mr. Williamson grew up with circus horses and claims the methods for all training go back to classic dressage. He is famous in cutting and reigning circles. I found his book so concise that I made a check list of training steps and memorized the leg aids and never had a bit of trouble applying them. It really covers all areas of good horsemanship. I do not think I have read anything since that is not covered in this book. The title is deceptively restrictive. The book is very easy to read. I have often wished I had the book on my shelf!"},{"Title":"Breaking and Training the Stock Horse","review":"This book was the most facinating book on training a horse I have ever read. Once you understand the process; put it to work; you will be amazed at how easy it is to train by this method. Uses all leg aids, body shifting, no pressure on mouth, no kicking or tugging. I have used it on a number of horses with great results. Horses learn with no stress. Be sure they know what you are asking of them before you go on to next levels. Wonderful basic training for either western or english riding - using snaffle or curb bit. It's the body language that works with horse and rider, not the equipment. I swear by Mr. Williamson's methods. Would work real well with Monty Roberts gentle approach to communicating with the horses' natural senses."},{"Title":"Breaking and Training the Stock Horse","review":"I love this book.

Jam packed with lots of good information."},{"Title":"Breaking and Training the Stock Horse","review":"I was very fortunate to grow up on a large ranch in the Bitterroot Valley near Mr. Williamson's School of Horsemanship in Hamilton, Montana. I took lessons from Charles and visited him in his home. His grand white mare could pole bend at a trot forwards and backwards faultlessly. She did wonderful one tempi flying changes, the Spanish walk, etc. ridden in a bridle or only a halter. It didn't matter.In no time at all Charles had taught me to ride my own horse lighter and with more abilities than I thought possible. For fun we would ride a square, so many paces forward, then so many paces to the left, so many paces back, so many paces to the right, and then so many paces forward to where we started. We did it at a walk and trot. It was fantastic training for a stock horse. Afterwards, when I put my leg on my mare's side she would slide sideways at whatever gait we were in: walk, trot, or canter.Everything is in his book to teach a person how to work with his horse as a partner. It was a blessing to know Charles. It is equally wonderful to read his book.

It may be or may not be the truth. He wasn't above lying. Whenever Johnston needed more money, he just printed more copies of this book, sometimes fooling the innocent reader by cutting off several chapters without bothering to mention it.Johnston, from Clyde, Ohio, was a mountebank and charlatan who traveled the Midwest in the last quarter of the 1800s, selling furniture polish, cheap jewelry, patent rights to doubtful inventions, trading horses, and auctioneering. It was an era when there were no truth in advertising laws and caveat emptor applied. By the time his customers found out they were cheated, he was gone.There are some humorous sections, but mostly Johnston boasted of his business acumen against innocent farmers and villagers.

There are many pluses to using this material.- The lectures are prepared and polished so that part of the weekly preparation is not a huge burden.- John Ortberg is a very engaging teacher.- The three books, taken together, provide a wide range of discussion materials ranging from \\"truth\\" to \\"life\\" so as to allow the leader to select where on this spectrum discussion needs to go. (Three books are the Reading Guide, Teaching guide, and Discussion Guide.)- Although this is a whirlwind tour of the Old Testament, the lectures make a point of emphasizing the important issues. Many of the lectures focus on the aspects of daily life today (e.g., raising children, telling the truth to people around us, the events of Sept 11, 2001) that the Old Testament speaks directly to.There are only a few minor annoyances:- The Complete Track reading guide is not synchronized with the weekly lectures, so it really almost forces the reader to use the fast track reading guide.- The lectures include occasional references to things projected at the time the lectures were given, but whatever was projected is not available on the included CD, leaving the listener wondering what was so funny.All things considered, I highly recommend this as a small group study."},{"Title":"Old Testament Challenge Implementation Guide","review":"I have used other products by John Ortberg in the past and have been very impressed with the delivery and the level of teaching. The DVD for this series disappointed me. It does not contain any footage by John Ortberg. In addition to that, it seems to have a difficult time defining its audience.

Most Spenser novels feel like a TV program. This installment feels more like a movie."},{"Title":"Small Vices","review":"Throughout the Spenser series, Robert B. Parker has consistently shown himself to be an excellent writer. Often, however, the quality of the story isn't up to the same standards. In Small Vices, however, it is.This is, I dare say, the best Spenser novel to date. Chance, Parker's previous contribution to the series, was a disappointment. But like a weak jab setting up the knockout uppercut, Small Vices is top-notch. There's mystery here, highly compelling characters (including perhaps the most interesting Spenser adversary to date), social commentary, excellent dialogue, several strong social themes, and, most of all, page-turning suspense. And, unlike most suspense works, the finish wasn't a disappointment.Parker's work is best read as part of the series. However, this still rates four stars as a stand-alone work. You lose out on a lot of the history behind some of the characters, but it's still basically whole.Maybe Parker, like Spenser, finally got off the decaf. If so, I hope he stays off. Sometimes, a small vice can be a good thing.Dan"},{"Title":"Small Vices","review":"I found every chapter was dealing with limited infromation crawling at snail paces. I also found that all the intermediate chapters recruited Spenser's so-called sweetheart Susan were totally meaningless and could be deleted. I found the only small vice in this book was that Parker to waltz a very boring and trivial plot into a jumbo book by using totally pretentious, try-to-humor-me, totally unnecessary dialogues to balloon into a third rated novel. Parker is still under the hypotic effect of Raymond Chandler's lazy genre and still failed to come out it. The whole book is just a waste of time, even considered waste on the toilet. What a bore"},{"Title":"Small Vices","review":"Not Mr. Parker's best...That being said, I an addict of Speserian writing, enjoyed Small Vices.

The story here was good and went back to a murder on a college campus with the black/white issue making it a real issue. I think Robert B. Parker handled a sensitive issue into a well written story."},{"Title":"Small Vices","review":"In SMALL VICES, Spenser is hired by one of the country's largest law firms to re-evaulate a past case and determine if one of their clients was sentenced for a crime he did not commit. The further Spenser delves into his investigations the more danger he (unwittingly) puts himself into but like the trooper (superhero?) that he is, he goes on regardless. This book is quality fiction. We have (of course) the inimitable Spenser, the ever loyal Hawk, and his girlfriend / lover Susan and Pearl the Wonder dog. We have the usual troop of baddies as well as one baddie so bad that he makes your skin crawl. One scene in particular is so well written and so craftily put together that it will make you uncomfortable reading it - but in a good way. The plot is very well structured and very deep which makes the reading experience that much more enjoyable. Emotional resonances with the reader are always sky-high in Parker's works but this one sets a new limit. The ending, when it comes is a beautiful thing and the final page ends a tale that you don't want to end.This is a Robert B Parker novel of the highest order. I hereby give it five stars out of five.-- Greggorio (LR)"},{"Title":"Small Vices","review":"I've never read a Parker & Spenser novel that I didn't like.

Too bad there are no writers stepping up to the plate."},{"Title":"Small Vices","review":"Advance the clock forty years from Chandler's Philip Marlowe series, and voila, we have Spenser! (Actually Parker is an admitted Chandler fan and even finished one of his books {\\"Poodle Springs\\"} for him and authored a sequel of Chandler's first novel, \\"The Big Sleep.\\") Like Marlowe, Spenser's tough-guy, private-eye work is his definition, and without it, he is nothing - a lesson that alternatively threatens then rejuvenates his relationship with lover Susan.This was our first Spenser story, so we have no background on the characters nor does \\"Vices\\" offer much. But the plot sizzled, the relationship with Susan provided interesting byplay, and in the end, things worked out in a satisfying fashion, with the exception of the man freed from jail, who was a total ingrate. The premise is that an innocent man was framed for a co-ed's murder, and a law firm hires Spenser to double check the outcome some four years later. That all the witnesses are lying, and that Spenser starts to get pushed around for his snooping, makes it seem likely right off the bat that something is awry. When a mysterious contract killer, the \\"Grey Man\\", nearly offs our hero, Susan, Hawk, and Spenser take a year in hiding to rehab (probably the least plausible portion of the story in terms of careers, money, etc.). Spenser then turns the tables by hunting the Grey Man while continuing to work the original crime to an entertaining conclusion. Suspense builds all the way to the end, keeping those pages turning briskly!We can see why Spenser and Parker enjoy considerable success. The writing is fine, the plot amuses, and some stuff on the side provides a thought provoking moment or two. Our only quibble is that we didn't particularly care for how the women in the book threw themselves at our leading man; while allegedly he's a \\"hunk\\", women tossing their clothes or thrusting their assets at him so readily seemed unseemly, though possibly that was a ploy to prove his fidelity to Susan. All-in-all, a good mystery -- good enough to encourage us to seek out more of Parker's lengthy bibliography."},{"Title":"Small Vices","review":"Ah, good old Spenser. It seems like I read a couple of these mysteries a year, and every time I do, it's like putting on an old sweatshirt that brings back great memories. In fact, with every new book, it seems like Parker brings back characters from his previous books (like his pseudo-son Paul, the cop Quirk, etc.), giving the reader a real sense of community and continuity.Like the other Spensers, Small Vices is a solid effort. The usual traits are there - glib, self-deprecating humor from Spenser, lovey-dovey dialogue between Spenser and Susan Silverman, and of course, Hawk. It's like visiting old friends - does it matter what the case is (career criminal wrongfully sentenced), where it takes place (somewhere near Boston), or what happens to Spenser (almost dies)? Not really. As long as the plot isn't stupid enough to distract us, we read these novels because Parker has created one heck of a genuine character (and supporting players equally as real).Sidenote you won't understand until you read the book: Is it only me, or did the \\"Gray Man\\" pop Terence Stamp into your brain? If they ever make this into a movie, I'd vote for Stamp to play the cold-blood dude."},{"Title":"Small Vices","review":"This book is one of the best Parker's ever written, fast, funny, and shows an insight into the sometimes seedy culture of WASP america."},{"Title":"Small Vices","review":"I have read and enjoyed all Mr. Parker's Books. His characters are real, the dialog is great, makes me smile and sometimes laught, but is to the point. The story flows and you never loose interest. Pearl is great too. I did see the movie based on this book and was impressed that it stayed so close to the story. I could almost say the words before the actors spoke."},{"Title":"Small Vices","review":"Small Vices just an excellent novel. It displays Spenser very well, both with his funny observations on life and his moral rigidity. I think that had Atticus Finch become a P.I., he would be quite a lot like Spenser. Seeing Spenser in a vulnerable position for the first real time was very interesting, though I wish they wouldn't have put it on all the summaries of the book. It would have been much better as a surprise. Also, I believe that the Gray Man is the best villian Parker has created, and one of the better I've encountered in fiction. He goes right up there with Koontz's Egler Vess, King's Randall Flagg, and Martin Fletcher from The Last Family. Finally, I highly recommend this novel. It's perfect for all Spenser fans, and it will be sure to snag some new ones."},{"Title":"Small Vices","review":"Robert Parker's Spenser novels are becomingincreasingly cartoonish in nature. The depth ofhis first several Spenser novels has been replacedby bigger type, thicker pages, and situations sounbelievable they only need four colors anda couple of BAMS and ZOWEEEs to enter the realm ofDC comics. Still, Spenser and Hawk remain anengaging duo.The problems here are many. The first is a casethat has a clear resolution almost from thebeginning. It's pretty clear whodunit and even whois trying to cover it up. The characters are cardboardcutouts, the Gray Man villain lives up to his name,a bland faceless adversary who manages to clipSpenser. (Why his always razor sharp sense of dangeris not working at the time he is shot never enters intothe story.) The moment that supposedly makesSpenser question life the universe and everythingis treated with as much seriousness as an ingrowntoenail. Although he is supposedly near death, wenever doubt for a minute that he'll recover.One last thing. Enough of Susan. The psycobabbletalks are less and less engaging, as are theconstant &quot;She's the only woman for me asides.&quot;Kill her off in the next book. Maybe Pearl theWonder Dog can attack her. I'm only hoping thatParker can reduce his book a year clip and startputting meat back into his story."},{"Title":"Small Vices","review":"This is one of Parker's best. The mystery is new and fresh - Spenser is hired by a law firm to learn the truth about an old murder. The enigmatic Gray Man is powerful and very creepy; it's about time Spenser met an enemy worthy of him. Susan almost redeems herself for all the stupid things she's done in the past, and Hawk is as much fun as ever. After some pretty weak novels, like 'Thin Air' and 'Walking Shadow,' and the abominable 'Hugger Mugger,' this one proves that Parker hasn't lost it. Thank heaven."},{"Title":"Small Vices","review":"I just spent an enjoyable two days taking a car trip during which I listened to two unabridged audio recordings of Spenser novels, both read by Burt Reynolds. CHANCE is the lesser of the two books, but Reynolds does an excellent job performing both novels. His delivery suits Spenser's wise-guy personality perfectly, and he is very good at bringing to life all the other characters. SMALL VICES, the more ambitious book, is also engineered better with music cues between the chapters. I hated for it to end.Wouldn't it be great if Reynolds and Dove Audio could start dipping into Parker's backlist and bring out some unabridged recordings of the earlier Spensers?"},{"Title":"Small Vices","review":"What a sleeper. Being a Spenser fan is a bit like being a fan of The Who - no matter how worn the product, I rush out and consume it. But tried and true fans will surely be disappointed, as you likely were with Chance and Thin Air. The brilliance of Catskill Eagle is long dead, though it showed briefly in Walking Shadow. There are many of us who think it's time for Susan to die. That might breath some life back into the series. And it's time for co-eds to stop hitting on Spenser every time he walks into a bar. Some authors freeze their characters in time. Parker did not, and should recognize that a 60 year-old with several gunshot wounds, scar tissue on his eyes and a oft-broken nose is not the kind of guy that the buxom girl in the college bar wants to sleep with. This book was way too close to Valediction. Parker is running out of story lines.

We also meet &quot;The Gray Man&quot;, who wishes to put Spenser into an earlier grave than anyone, including the self-effacing Spenser, desires.Add a friend asking for Spensers help in his framing of a murder of a young female college student, the search of suspects through Boston to the elite Manhattan crowd, and voila, another gritty up front Parker crime action in full motion.The dialouge snaps, the plot crackles, and the .22 pops.Thank you for your interest &amp; comments--CDS"},{"Title":"Small Vices","review":"This may be the pinnacle (or nadir) Spenser novel dramatizing an ultimate personification of Evil. An investigation of that concept seems to be Spenser's underlying and ongoing pursuit. SMALL VICES, # 24 Spenser, deals with the primary issues of Life, as individuals within the human species are struggling to get through it, comprehend it, and relish it (as often as possible), in the transition into The Third Millennium.Hawk's analysis of a dichotomy of desires between Spenser and Susan deserves a Grand Prize for capturing the core of conflict here. Of course any fan of the series would know that Hawk's conclusion would be drawn in a couple short statements including the perfect phrases in blue. It was amazing how refreshing it could be to have precise differences stated in such dry, clear terms.A scene with an apparent Shirley Temple type child took the show for humor, even though no one could one-up The Highest Dark Child of The Species (who was neither young nor female, in this case). The Gray Man was possibly Parker's most complexly captivating character. The battles between Good and Evil in SMALL VICES were of the best I've read in Literature. FYI, an equal (yet different) exposure of the essence of Evil Incarnate was in the film,Suspect Zero (Widescreen Edition)(See my review), in which the dank presence reduced itself to boneless worm jelly. The difference is that Parker's evil character was given solid strength and deadly substance (in varied shades of gray).Dealing with the issues of types of parenting and the heartbreaking, absolute lack of it in all types of ghettos, a cop named Jackson voiced the lack of awareness of \\"Do Gooders\\" without a clue about how impoverished families live. A small sample of Jackson's \\"right on\\" diatribe: \\"Like there's a bunch of white Anglo kids in the inner city, walking around looking for the f...ing malt shop. So I say, you people simply have got to stop talking \`bout f...ing inner city when you mean black.\\"In reality, a quintessential Malt Shop did exist in a small town in Colorado, a light in a desert of dark styles of poverty, with a single Mom who was a parent, see the Amazon Short, Coal & Coca-Cola.As is the case with each Spenser novel, many excellent quotes could be listed from this # 24 in the series. I couldn't help but notice a change in mood here, in the dedication (quoted below) to Joan, Parker's wife. Of course I wondered how Parker evaluated and passed through the road forks in his life, in contrast to what Spenser chose in SMALL VICES, in the issues brought forth between Spenser and Susan. It's obvious that the Parkers are parents with full presence, and that they love their children. This # 24 in series is worth reading for Spenser's takes on these issues alone.In contrast to the always flowery dedications to Joan in Parker's novels, the dedication in SMALL VICES read: >> For Joan: You may have been a headache, but you've never been a bore. &lt;&lt;A scene of Hawk washing his hands in Spenser's office was very telling of the above quote: >> He (Hawk) dried himself on a white towel that hung beside the sink. The towel said \\"Holiday Inn\\" on it, in green letters. It was one of my (Spenser's) favorites. I had picked it up in Jackson, Mississippi once, when I was driving back from Texas, with Pear the Wonder Dog. Whenever Susan came in she replaced the Holiday Inn towel with a small pink one that had a pale pink fringe, and a pink and green rosebud embroidered in one corner. As soon as she left, I put out the Holiday Inn towel again. &lt;&lt;During a conversation with Susan, Spenser narrated to himself: >> The way I loved her never varied. But how I liked her could go up and down, and it went down most when she was being professional. &lt;&lt;After the long days and months were done here, Spenser and Susan were again at one: >> \\"I'm not criticizing you, in all of this,\\" Susan said. \\"I know you're not.\\" I said. \\"The confusion of guilt and innocence just looks a little starker in this case and it interests you.\\"I believe that Spenser's comment there explains one of the reasons many readers, including me, retain a high degree of curiosity in how this series separates good and bad guys, good and bad acts. Stand-up-and-cheer support surfaced in SMALL VICES from various bad guys, in ways and in dialogues which added warmth, and continued discriminations between what's admirable and what's disgusting in examples of our species.Once again, the author prevailed and the tale fell deep and rose high,Linda Shelnutt"},{"Title":"Small Vices","review":"I really enjoyed this book. The storyline kept moving and it wasn't completely predictable like so many whodunits. That said, it got four stars from me rather than five because of a number of cliches throughout the novel. The book is fairly short, simple, yet well-written and engaging like so many Robert Parker books. I never read the Spenser novels but really found Parker's work to be fun reads from the Appaloosa westerns. When Parker died after the fourth of that series I started backtracking to the Spenser novels to keep my relationship with his work alive. Nice read."},{"Title":"Small Vices","review":"Spenser is back, this time he is investigating a murder where a man has already been convicted and sentenced for the crime. His semi-flame Rita Fiore is no longer a prosecutor; she is now in a powerful law firm. However, one case from her past disturbs her, a black man with a long record named Ellis Alves was convicted of murdering a white college female and there were two witnesses to him dumping the body. However, Rita is disturbed by the case and wants to hire Spenser to determine if Alves was in fact the murderer.Spenser agrees to take the case and proceeds in his usual way, asking people questions until they get annoyed. At first, he has absolutely nothing to go on but when four large men come to his office in an attempt to intimidate him, he realizes that there is something large and ugly hidden somewhere in the case. This leads Spenser into a direct confrontation with a killer that is so efficient that he would be considered too much for Vinnie Morris to handle. Spenser is extremely lucky, if being shot several times and put in a coma can be thought of as lucky. Spenser battles back and prepares himself for a second confrontation with the killer and through that, he is able to determine who killed the girl and why there has been so much resistance to his exploring an old case.This story is Spenser once again at his best, supported strongly by his friends; everyone pitches in to help, including some old adversaries. The dialog and action is crisp, Spenser is flirtatious with women, but only to a point and through it all he remains a white knight with standards that give him a rudder, but may get him killed."},{"Title":"Small Vices","review":"Robert B. Parker hit a homerun when he created Spenser. That's Spenser with an S like the poet. Parker hit a grand slam with this novel Small Vices.If you were ever a fan of Spenser for Hire on television in the 80's You need to pick up a Spenser novel. Take your pick there are over 30 of them out there.Parker's Spenser is a wise cracking former boxer, former police officer turned private eye. His sarcastic sense of humor will keep you laughing and the hard pounding action will keep you reading/listening until the very end.In Small Vices Spenser goes up against corrupt high society and a hired man in Gray hell bent on killing him. Along with Hawk, Susan Silverman, and a cast of others. Spenser finds himself in the fight of his life. The book covers areas in all our lives with racial humor, morality, integrety, and a quest for justice."},{"Title":"Small Vices","review":"I've read all of Robert B. Parker's books and this one is a standout. It grabbed me on the first page and I read it in one day.Well done.TFConfessions of a Catholic Cop"},{"Title":"Small Vices","review":"Burt Reynolds IS Spenser! Reynols gives the ultimate rendition of the Boston hard boiled sleuth and turns out to be a highly intelligent actor with great understand for the text. Perfect. The story itself is pretty much standard Robert B. Parker fare: well written, well paced, great characters & dialoge!"},{"Title":"Small Vices","review":"When Spenser's old friend Rita Fiore hires him to investigate a case where she believes her client was framed, he pokes a hornet's nest. The man in jail is a career criminal and no one wants to see him out; the young woman who was killed was dating a young up-and-coming tennis star who is the adopted son of a very wealthy man and there are two eyewitnesses who swear that they saw the murdered woman being pulled into a car by the suspect.To make matters worse, an assassin is called in who is good enough to get a drop on Spenser and puts Spenser into a coma. When Spenser wakes up, he finds that his friends have put out the word he is dead and he, Hawk and Susan head to California where he spends almost a year rehabilitating himself before he returns to Boston; first to take out the Gray Man, then to finish the case he had started.Confronted with his own mortality, Spenser and Susan have to come to terms with the fact that this is his life and that it is not going to change.I strongly recommend this book - it was one of the best in the series so far."},{"Title":"Small Vices","review":"This is one of Parker's best. The mystery is new and fresh - Spenser is hired by a law firm to learn the truth about an old murder. The enigmatic Gray Man is powerful and very creepy; it's about time Spenser met an enemy worthy of him. Susan almost redeems herself for all the stupid things she's done in the past, and Hawk is as much fun as ever. After some pretty weak novels, like 'Thin Air' and 'Walking Shadow,' and the abominable 'Hugger Mugger,' not to mention the Jesse Stone/Sunny Randall mess, this one proves that Parker hasn't lost it. Thank heaven."},{"Title":"Small Vices","review":"Overall, I enjoyed the book. It kept my attention all the way to the end. Even though the beginning of the story started out slow, events began to develop to get me hooked into the plot. The way the gray man, who was hired to kill off the detective, kept popping out of no where, kept me on my toes. I never knew if he was going to get the detective or not. When the main event finally unfolded, it was interesting to see how the author made things develop to keep things going. The book, SMALL VICES, was well written and easy to follow. I would recommend it to others."},{"Title":"Small Vices","review":"This was my introduction to a series that I'm sure will become one of my favorites. Spenser is a delight -- as are Hawk, Susan and especially Pearl. I like a mystery where the characters have more on their minds than just the plot. Spenser's relationship with &quot;the gray man,&quot; Susan's desire for children, issues of police corruption and racism all made the story richer for me. The only thing I didn't like was Burt Reynolds' performance. He sounded too old for part. Worse, at times his delivery made it sound like he was reading the book for the first time. Perhaps next time around I'll READ Spenser."},{"Title":"Small Vices","review":"Very Good! I really enjoyed listen to this book on audio. Really kept my attention. I really enjoyed the interaction between Hawk and Spencer. I am a big fan of the TV show Spencer for hire, so this is right up my alley."},{"Title":"Small Vices","review":"- It wasn't until I started reading &quot;Small Vices&quot; that I realized how much I'd missed Robert Parker and his Spenser series. During an 18-month period about two years ago I read all of Parker's books. I haven't read any of his books since. And then recently I picked up this new book and, although I was having a bad day, I was soon smiling and laughing. Spenser was back and I was sure enjoying his company. I've tried before to determine exactly why I love this series so much, since the basic concept is so cliched: Spenser is a tough, strong private eye, but with a heart of gold, who usually gets the bad guy. He's very ethical and serious at times, like Lawrence Block's Matthew Scudder character, but he is also quite funny at times, a la Donald Westlake. Mostly, though, he is witty, sharp and smart. I suspect that part of me thinks that I could be Spenser if I buffed up and learned how to throw a punch. The writing is always tight in his books. During one conversation, for example, Spenser tells the reader simply, \\"I had nothing to add to that,&quot; whereas other writers would elaborate on that thought. There is also a racial element to the series, with Spenser's buddy, Hawk, a black tough guy who acts dumber than he is and plays to the racial stereotype but is actually quite intelligent and uses people's expectation of him to his advantage. All of this results in great dialogue. At one point in this book, for example, Spenser is injured. &quot;I don't need that much help,&quot; Spenser said. &quot;He ain't heavy,&quot; Hawk said. &quot;He's my brother.&quot; In this book, Spenser is hired by a law firm concerned that a black man convicted of murdering a white girl in an almost all-white college may actually be innocent of that crime. The suspect is guilty, though, of raping other women so few go out of their way to help Spenser unravel the truth. Spenser also encounters great deal of racism. Soon some tough guys tell Spenser to quit his investigation and throw him some muscle. He pretty much ignores the threats until he starts getting followed by a guy who prefers to let his bullets do the talking. And then things get really interesting. Meanwhile, Spenser's long-time girlfriend, Susan, wants to adopt a child but Spenser is against the idea but doesn't want to make her mad either. This is certainly not Parker's best book, but even a weak Parker book is better than much of the novels currently available. Part of the problem may be that Parker has been writing this series for too long, more than 20 years now, so it will be interesting to see how a new non-Spenser book he has out compares. And when I read that one, I'll tell you my conclusion."},{"Title":"Small Vices","review":"Robert Parker writes like a skater on ice who floats effortlessly. He may put a lot of work into his writing, but he does not groan and grunt for our benefit. He presents the reader with polished pieces. This is elegance.I have read a dozen of Parker's books, and enjoyed every one. However, I would say Small Vices is the most heroic, in that this book deals with grand themes. Academics may sneer at mystery novels, or come slumming, but these are our myths for the modern world.If you haven't read the book, please stop reading this review here, because I wouldn't want to spoil anybody's enjoyment. The book has the classic Spenser scenes: the Threat, Displaying the Weapons, Pearl the Wonder Dog, great dialogue, vivid character sketches, and so forth. Spenser is careless, though. He shouldn't have been out running alone with the Grey Man on his trail.Curious. In the end, everybody gets off. Spenser gets off with wounds, the Grey Man gets off without jail, the parents get off, the murderer gets off, the wronged prisoner gets off, and Hawk gets off with no pay for ten months' TLC. The only person who really loses is the victim, and she died happy."},{"Title":"Small Vices","review":"This is one of my favorite Spenser tales. And we love him because . . . . I guess it's kind of that John Wayne feeling, you like to have a big guy around who can always be relied upon to take care of business. Here, he almost fails, and that's the magnetism of Small Vices.Spenser is hired by the now successful, leggy Rita Fiore. There is the usual overt flirting &quot;. . . too bad you didn't . . .&quot; and &quot;Boy, if you only had . . .&quot; and &quot;you had your chance . . &quot; that we've come to chuckle at and with the honorable sleuth.Here he's asked to track down 'the real murderer' which will free a man wrongfully doing life in the hard place.It's hard to pity the imprisoned man Spenser is asked to free. It seems most feel he doesn't really deserve to be freed . . . even the loyal friend Hawk feels that Alves belongs in jail, &quot;either for this crime or one he got away with.&quot;But Spenser, who again tells someone his first name but not us, gets too close and takes three slugs to the shoulder, leg and chest.It takes Susan, Hawk, Quirk, Belson, Lee Farrel and Vinnie nearly a year to rehab Spenser, who loses 40 pounds in the process, has a hard time making his limbs do what he wants them to, and basically can't walk. But they do and honor and heroism prevail, villains are suitably thrashed, and Susan and Spenser hook up. Again. And again.There's a lot of vulnerability in Spenser this time. Like Joe Pike in The Last Detective, his body has betrayed him and he is lost. Sadness, even tears. The pages describing Spenser trying to get up the hill in Santa Barbara after again learning how to walk again are riveting. Good stuff.If I had a disappointment, it was Spenser's laissez faire attitude towards Hawk who took a year off to mentor/train/help him. But maybe that's part of the mystique, he knew how he felt and so did Hawk.Great stuff. Rachel Wallace is still #1 for me but Small Vices is a close second."},{"Title":"Small Vices","review":"I have listened to most of the Spenser series in unabrdiged format from my local library, and this certainly ranks as one of the best I've heard.The production version is unquestionably the best. While I have loved Michael Pritchard's voice as Spenser in the past, Burt Reynolds does a remarkable job of portraying all of the Spenser cast. The hardest is always Hawk, and Reynolds brings it off beautifully. The music cues actually add to the novel, which is something I have never heard before in years of listening to books.The story is one of the more imaginitive ones I have yet heard from Parker. A good adversary for Spenser is something I have been longing for, and the &quot;Gray Man&quot; fits the bill. The plot is engaging, we see sides of Spenser and his relationship with Susan previously unexplored, and deeper glimpses of Spenser's friendship with Hawk.And this has got to be the only appearance of a rifle chambered in .458 Magnum in a novel. I gotta know where Parker gets his weapons information.I'd give it 4.5 stars if I could, but I can't, and it's closer to 4.6, so I give it 5. Not perfect, but wonderful. I hated to hear the ending."},{"Title":"Small Vices","review":"This is a review of the audio book - not the novel. Prior to listening to this version of the novel I had heard 10 other \\"Spenser\\" novels on CD. Then I bought two new CDs: one in which Wm. Windom is the reader and this one, in which Burt Reynolds is the reader. The previous 10 had been read by Joe Mantegna.Now I don't know how others feel, but when I discover a new author who has created great characters I like to spend time with those characters. I read the books over and over. The best ones I never tire of. I love the physical settings, the relationships between the characters and many other attributes of the story. Hearing the story read adds another dimension and, particularly in the Parker novels, which are filled with humor, I sometimes pick up added bits of humor because the pace of the story is slower than when I zip through it myself. This presupposes that there is nothing in the voice of the reader to distract from the story. Joe Mantegna's voice is neutral enough so that it doesn't intrude on the story itself.The reader in this story, however has such a deep, gravelly voice that it is a constant distraction from the story. The reader also moves his voice up and down an octave range that forces me to continually adjust the volume. Either he drops his voice so that I can barely hear him or his audio is so loud that the volume has to be turned down. I did not really appreciate Mantegna's presentations until I listened to Windom and Reynolds. With both of them the medium is indeed the message."},{"Title":"Small Vices","review":"This is my second reading of 'Small Vices'. I'd read it before, years ago, and all I remembered was that this is the one in which Spenser gets himself shot and very nearly killed. (The beauty, I guess, of having so many Spenser novels is that it is hard to keep them all straight so I can go back and re-read them like they're new every few years).If you are familiar with Spenser, most of your favorites see some action. If not, this may be a good one to start with, although I would recommend some of the older ones to begin.The never-aging Spenser lives through an entire year of his life in this one, but don't worry, he still doesn't age. Neither do Hawk or Susan. They're like James Bond in that respect. It used to bug me but I know that I don't want to read about Hawk and Spenser's adventures in a nursing home."},{"Title":"Small Vices","review":"The Spenser novels are really about Don Quixote, dressed up as a modern detective. Spenser is better at what he does than Don Quixote was, but has the same appeal.Fortunately for Spenser fans, the other characters are drawn as finely and uniquely, and bring much appeal to any story. It's like visiting your somewhat funny, dysfunctional family for a reunion.I appreciate it when Robert Parker breaks up the stories with new plot complications. Spenser's injury makes this book all the more rewarding by providing new perspectives on one of fiction's most appealing detectives.If you are a Spenser fan, don't miss it.If yo are not yet a Spenser fan, this is a worthy book to start with."},{"Title":"Small Vices","review":"I give this the highest rating because I consider it one of the important Spenser books. Basically, Spenser is confident that he's going to be better than his adversary, and so when he is nearly killed by an expert, he needs to deal with his mortality.The ironic part of this is that he's working to find out if an absolute loser of a gangbanger is guilty of the murder he's accused of. This novel poses questions both of mortality and of morality. There's the question of how important is \\"The Truth\\". Deals are made and those who end up in prison may be more worthwhile to society than those who don't.This is a Spenser novel which, although a quick read, gives you ethical problems to ponder. Very highly recommended."},{"Title":"Small Vices","review":"Just when I think that Robert Parker can't get any better with his Spenser series, I read something even more superior than the last. Small Vices ranks up there with one of his best.Spenser is hired by Rita Fiore, one time assistant DA and now working for a private law firm with deep pockets. A black man, Ellis Alves, has been convicted of murdering a young girl from Pemberton College. The firm believes that he was framed. Alves is a career criminal and not many people are sorry to see him behind bars. But as Spenser starts reinvestigating the case, it is obvious that someone very powerful will stop at nothing to prevent the truth from being discovered. Spenser matches wits with a professional hetman nicknamed Gray Man, who is the most dangerous and talented nemesis that he's ever faced. An encounter with Gray Man almost costs Spenser his life.As usual, the old gang is back including friend Hawk, psychologist-girlfriend Susan Silverman, and Pearl the Wonder Dog. There is also a subplot where Susan wants to make a major change in their relationship (I can't say that this change entails without spoiling the book). There is always great dialogue and good observations. Spenser evaluates his relationship with Susan: \\"The way I loved her never varied. But how I liked her could go up and down; and it went down most when she was being professional.\\"After reading a number of Parker's books, I'm tempted to go back and watch some of the old Spenser For Hire television series. I remember them being thoroughly enjoyable, but I'd now like to compare them to the books."},{"Title":"Small Vices","review":"When &quot;Small Vices&quot; begins you think that Spenser's biggest problem is going to be that Susan Silverman wants to adopt a baby and our hero does not. Spenser is hired by former assistant DA Rita Fiore to look into the conviction of career criminal Ellis Alves for killing Melissa Henderson, a Pemberton College coed. Alves' former attorney thinks he might have been framed and Fiore's law firm is footing the bill to find out the truth. Of course our hero meets with mondo resistance: Melissa's parents are outraged, the investigating cop is irate, the witnesses are not being forthright, and some thugs show up to warn Spenser to drop the case. If that last one was not enough to tell Spenser that something is up, the case does not make sense at face value. But as he gets closer and closer to the truth, a new person shows up to warn Spenser off. The &quot;Grey Man&quot; is a hired assassin, and people who know them both warn our hero that this might be the one man who can take him. After a first hit fails, Spenser continues to investigate while playing a game of cat and mouse with the Grey Man. That is when things get catastrophic. For the first time, Spenser has to depend on Susan, Hawk and the inner circle for the support and strength necessary to get through some very hard times.From time to time in Robert B. Parker's novels, Spenser takes a fall: clients have been killed, souls have not been saved, and the less said about Susan leaving him the better. But &quot;Small Vices&quot; provides a new level of personal trauma for our hero. This twist revitalizes the standard elements in Parker's series wherein Spenser searches for the truth and then has to determine what to do with that knowledge to make things right. In Spenser's world there are always hard choices to be made and &quot;Small Vices&quot; contains some of the hardest ones he has ever had to make. After all, you have to remember Susan wants to adopt a baby. &quot;Small Vices&quot; is one of the very best novels in the series, but please remember that you really should read these books in order as the dynamics of the key relationships and the addition of new members to the cast of merry men is an important part of what is going on. As always, these books are perfect for the commuter life style. With the rides to and from work, with lunch thrown in for good measure, you can read these in a day or two."},{"Title":"Small Vices","review":"I thought that this was one of the best Spenser books yet. I am relatively new to the series (I was a fan of the TV show)&amp; I found this to be a book that I could not put down. Definitely recommended. I love the way Parker uses references to past books and the way he uses an actual timeline. Spenser has aged well, let's hope we grow old before he does."},{"Title":"Small Vices","review":"An avid Spenser fan, I bought, read and enjoyed this book when it came out. A gift of the audio version let me hook up again with Spenser, Hawk &amp; Susan during my commute. Burt Reynolds does a marvelous job on this unabridged version, and I was not ready for it to end."},{"Title":"Small Vices","review":"Spenser is always a contender, but this time around, Parker delivers a solid KO. A fresh entry in a fine series."},{"Title":"Small Vices","review":"I have been a Spenser fan since my dad gave me the Godwulf manuscript to read. I have found myself rereading some of the old Spencer novels as the series started to sag, Spenser started his internal dialogue about donuts and Susan showed up in white cowboy boots. As I read the sagging Spensers I realized that some Spenser was better than none, but I remembered such classics as The Widening Gyre, Valediction, Early Autumn and A Catskill Eagle. In this novel, Spenser is back, and facing one of the more convincing villains in the series-The Gray Man. Spenser has a remarkable, tragic vision of himself walking across a deserted campus and this foreshadows troubling times. Although Spenser had become cliched, and worst of all, Hawk and his jive talk dated, Small Vices brings the Spenserian world of wit and moral wrangling into sharp focus. I highly recommend this installment of the Spenser series to newcomers and fans alike. As usual, the descriptions of new England are ri! pe and clear. It's uncanny, but the first time I travelled to Boston, I was surprised that the 15 or so Spenser books I had read had given me a unconscious mental map of Beacon Hill and Back bay!"},{"Title":"Small Vices","review":"A nice read, as are all the Spenser novels. They are my favorites. As such a I would recommend the book. I do not think it is the best Spenser. The older books had a harder edge, and you were not always sure how the book would end. Here I was sure, as I have been for a while with the series. I still enjoy reading them and will continue."},{"Title":"Small Vices","review":"This is a great read! I've been away from the Spenser series for a while, and I've read that the novels had lost some of their spark recently. Not if this excellent outing is any indication. The plot is strong, (though a bit basic), but the interplay between Spenser, Hawk, Susan and the various characters is as sharp as ever. Parker has an excellent ear for dialogue, and it's a joy to read him. And Parker gives us an excellent villain who might (?) be a match for Spenser.Check this one out - highly recommended, and perfect summer reading."}]`),x={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:C},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:B,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},H={class:"card-container"},W=["disabled"],M={key:0},E={key:1};function q(n,e,s,c,r,i){const m=g("PoemCard");return t(),a("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=o("div",{class:"top-banner"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),o("div",H,[(t(!0),a(y,null,w(i.visiblePoems,(h,f)=>(t(),p(m,{key:f,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),a("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(t(),a("span",E,"Loading...")):(t(),a("span",M,"See more"))],8,W)):b("",!0)])}const L=u(x,[["render",q],["__scopeId","data-v-9dc13436"]]),N=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"guide/9.md","filePath":"guide/9.md"}'),j={name:"guide/9.md"},D=Object.assign(j,{setup(n){return(e,s)=>(t(),a("div",null,[v(L)]))}});export{N as __pageData,D as default};
