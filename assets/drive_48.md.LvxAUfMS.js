Martin's A Corner of the Universe focuses on mental illness and family secrets as seen through the eyes of eleven-going-on-twelve Hattie Owen.At the beginning, Hattie looks forward to a typical summer of reading, taking walks, and helping take care of the boarders living in her parents' home. Instead, she learns that her family-parents and maternal grandparents-have been harboring a secret embodied in the mentally Adam, who returns home from a mental hospital.Hattie immediately takes to her child-like uncle, but is amazed that the family never mentioned Adam, and is even disturbed by the way her grandparents treat him. Adam's behavior-even his existence-immediately upsets the delicate balance of the universe Hattie's grandmother Nana has worked so hard to create. Most of the conflicts in the novel arise from Adam's conduct in contradiction to the rules prescribed by Nana.Soon Hattie comes to realize that everything she thought she knew about herself, her family, and the Millerton itself is wrong-or at least grossly inaccurate. Her feelings of confusion soon turn to anger, and Hattie too finds herself at odds with her family.Following Adam's sudden suicide and funeral-and a great deal of other changes in her life-Hattie begins to come to grips with the lessons learned from the brief time she had with her uncle, especially about lifting up the corners of the universe and poking around to see what's under there.This novel does a pretty good job of capturing the sudden feelings of isolation and disconnection in early teens regarding friends and family. It would also make a good early connection for later novels which deal with mental illness or with characters who create trouble because they are different and/or misunderstood in some way. (I am thinking in particular of the book Of Mice and Men; A Corner of the Universe even has a character named \\"Cookie\\"!)."},{"Title":"CORNER OF THE UNIVERSE, A","review":"The summer when 12 year old Hattie Owen first meets her uncle, Adam, he seems a little unusual. Not the quiet freaky unusual, but he's always happy and cheerful. Reciting lines from \\"I Love Lucy\\", speaking a mile every second, and constantly saying \\"Oh, ho ho ho!\\" Hattie thinks he's great and feels like she's made a new friend. The rest of the town, however, doesn't seem to think so. Adam, who is 21, seems to have a mind of a 6 year old although he can read and speak just fine. Hattie's grandparents are embarrassed of Adam and think he's a circus trick. One of the morals in this book is that you should never be embarrassed of what your child can or cannot do, which is a lesson that Hattie's grandparents eventually learn. Hattie doesn't understand why people stare at Adam, call him names, and hate him when they haven't even gotten to know him. Most of all, she doesn't understand why she has never heard of Adam for the last 12 years. She constantly asks herself: Why is her family hiding Adam from the town and their lives? What is there to hide?A Corner of the Universe, by Ann M. Martin is about prejudice that is put towards the mentally disabled, and how discriminating against others just because they're different can lead to unfortunate consequences. I recommend this book to anyone who has ever felt like they were superior to someone else or anyone who has been a victim of that. This book is also about Hattie and her family's dark secret. It is that very secret that changes Hattie's life forever and allows her to lift her own corner of the universe. I think anyone who doesn't give this book 5 stars obviously hasn't figured that out."},{"Title":"CORNER OF THE UNIVERSE, A","review":"In the Newbery Honor Novel, A Corner of the Universe, by Ann M. Martin, a heart tearing story comes to life. The novel starts off in October with Hattie, a twelve year old girl looking at home movies taken over the place of the last summer. From the movies, the Author takes us into Hattie's life at the begging of the summer, in the form of a flash back. Hattie is a girl that likes things the familiar way and doesn't want or like change. She doesn't want to think of the big unpredictable world out there, she likes things better in the protection of the families boarding house and its familiar routines. She likes the summer they way it is. Because of that, she was caught off guard when she was told her uncle, that no one has talked about or even told her about, is coming home because his \\"school\\" (an institution for mentally disabled) has shut down. Hattie's family must learn to cope with a 21 year old man, coming into their lives, which they have tried to forget about for many years. Her uncle, named Adam, is a guy who has a rollercoaster of moods, child like behavior, and is very unpredictable. What Hattie doesn't know, is that this uncle of hers has the power in him to change the way she looks and accepts life. During the summer, Ann M. Martin takes you on a journey of friendship, trial, and heartache.At the end of this book I was crying, it touched me in a way I never expected it to. We should all learn from Adam and live our lives the way he did by lifting the corners of our universe. Although Adam had a hard life, he was called a Freak, laughed at, had a lot of things he couldn't understand, and would never have the chance to live a normal life. But he learned to change what life has handed to him, to poke around a little, lift the corners, seeing what is underneath, poking that. Sometimes things would work out for him, sometimes they didn't, but he was always exploring. Life is more interesting and fun that way. We should all learn to live our lives like Adam. I think that everyone who reads this book will finish looking at life in a different perspective, live life to its fullest, and not take little things for granted."},{"Title":"CORNER OF THE UNIVERSE, A","review":"This book is about a girl named Hattie Owen.

In this 2002 Newbery Honor book, twelve-year-old Hattie Owen meets her Uncle Adam, a mentally disabled man who has been living in an institution that recently lost its funding.During the summer of 1960, people were less likely to dissect family problems than today, the era of the talk show. Adam was a family secret, but Hattie learns to love him. She was planning a summer of trips to the library and ice cream, but now Adam comes with her. He is closer to her age mentally than most adults and has an endless enthusiasm for new experiences. Hattie loves to go to the carnival and is happy to bring Adam along. But she does not know how to handle Adam when he is out of control, such as when she finds him walking in his underwear through the neighborhood or when he disappears. He also becomes angry when he can't have his way.Living with someone who is mentally disabled can be confusing at any age. Best-selling author Ann M. Martin of P.S. LONGER LETTER LATER (written with Paula Danziger) and the BABY-SITTERS CLUB series, does a wonderful job of showing the reader the joys and sadness of the experience, as seen through the eyes of likable teen Hattie.Powerful characters and plot surprises will keep readers interested in this title --- and it is sure to stay with the reader long after the book is closed.--- Reviewed by Amy Alessio"},{"Title":"CORNER OF THE UNIVERSE, A","review":"The book A Corner Of The Universe was an excellent book.

Her Uncle Adam was quite special. He had a mental disability. When her uncle came to the boarding house no one really liked him. They all took pity on him, all except for Hattie & her mother. Hattie was able to find a friend. This friend was very special as she didn't have too many. Towards the end everyone came to accept Adam for who he was.This book really helped Hattie (and me) to accept people, no matter how different or strange they are. This book really made you feel as if you were Hattie. This was a summer Hattie would never forget. There were some good times, some bad times, and a few sad times.

It is a reminder of the need for compassion and understanding.Beautifully read by two time Tony Award winner Judith Ivey it is the story of a life changing summer for 12-year-old Hattie. Her life has been rather predictable to date. She shares a home with her parents, a boarding house filled with outre characters. The life her mother and father have chosen is not at all in keeping with what her grandparents would wish, but that's fine with Hattie.And then there is a visitor, Adam - a surprising and intriguing young man. What is even more surprising for Hattie is to learn that he is a 21-year-old uncle, someone the family has never mentioned. His school, a home for the mentally impaired, has closed and here he is.

Adam, her twenty-one year old uncle, had been away to a special school. His school is closing and he has to come home. His \\"school\\" is really a home for people with disabilities.

Hattie thinks the two are a lot of like and they form a special bond. Unfortunately, Hattie soon thinks she knows what is best for Adam and this leads to trouble.I enjoyed the book. It was interesting because the setting is in the 1960's, a time when people with disabilities were not in the spotlight and as accepted as they are today. I could relate to Hattie's feelings when people make comments about her uncle, because I work with kids with disabilities. I think the book is more suited for older elementary age students, 10 - 12. It does a good job covering a sensitive issue, but sometimes lags in excitement.

The blunt-ness and lack of reality made it a poor read. The fact that it was a Newbery Honor book shocked me. The thing is that the topic was true...things like this do happen and the main idea was practically blaring at me the entire time I tried to read...I just could not enjoy this short-coming of a book.Thoughts from Indigo*Yellow:This book was confused about what it was, where it was coming from, and where it is going. It covers mature subjects such as mental illness, loss of innocense, and familial unstableness. And yet it was written in such childlike, bland prose that I coudln't have been more bored. A Corner of the Universe could have been a gritty, touching, and dark coming-of-age novel with interesting symbolism. Instead, it was a watered-down, fuzzy, children's tale. When thinking about the main idea, I couldn't figure out where the book was going! Was it trying to convince me to be kind to the mentally challenged, or was it simply talking about Hattie's ability to encompass the dark and light parts of her life? I coudln't be sure. I think this book is an uncertain, wobbling shadow of what it could have been, and Adam, Nana, and Hattie's father could have been played out to a fuller extent. I'd say, don't bother with this sad excuse for a Newbery winner."},{"Title":"CORNER OF THE UNIVERSE, A","review":"I thought that this was a great book ,but i wouldnt of expecdted that hatties uncle would have killed himself.

Hattie's uncle is coming to Millerton because his \\"special school\\" is closing down. At first Hattie is kind of worried to meet her uncle, but then she realizes they have a lot in common.

Chronologically, he is an adult but intellectually he is still a problematic child. Hattie forfeits her summer trips to the library and daily ice creams to spend time with Adam, her new friend. Adam has an endless enthusiasm for new experiences. He fantasizes a romance between himself and Angel Valentine. Adam's attraction was obvious to Hattie but Angel was oblivious. If she noticed Adam's romantic notions at all, she completely misinterpreted them as just another problem of the problematic Adam. Later his fantasy relationship with Angel is brutally shattered. To Adam this relationship with Angel was, apparently, a door to the normality and acceptance that had been denied to him since childhood. Angel's indifference to that relationship made him realize that normality and acceptance were only in his wildest dreams.I loved this book. Ann M. Martin is a fantastic writer and I love the precise detail and her marvelous form.

You cannot be too young to read this because you probably would not understand it that well. IF you are older and read this you probably would not be enteftained because you would think the book is too chidish.I thought A Corner of the UNiverse, was a very good book. It alwayas kept you interested and never bored. There were lots of exciting parts that made yyou want to keep reading. I suggest this book to kids because this was very exciting and interesting book."},{"Title":"CORNER OF THE UNIVERSE, A","review":"I started to read this book about two days ago, and I have to admit that it started out kind of slow. Once I got about 20 pages into it though, I couldn't put it down! I read the remainder of the book this morning. Wow. I laughed, I cried... I would reccomend this book to anyone who likes Sharon Creech's writing. It is great."},{"Title":"CORNER OF THE UNIVERSE, A","review":"The book A Corner of the Universe by Ann M. Martin is a book about a kindhearted twelve-year-old girl named Hattie Owen. This book takes place in the summer of 1960 and is a heart-warming novel, which will bring joy, laughter, and tears to your heart. Hattie Owen is a sweet girl yet has many troubles dealing with life because her perspective on life is different than many others, but Hattie loves her small town and boarding house that she lives in with her mother and her father. It is isolated from the rest of the world and Hattie feels safe and doesn't know much about everyday issues people go through. Hattie never could have imagined a summer more action-packed than this particular summer. When her twenty one year old Uncle Adam whom Hattie has never met before comes for a surprise visit to stay at Hattie's grandparents house for the first time, (because his residential school shut down) Hattie learns from her mother that he has mental problems, and that he is Manic depressive. Also that friends and relatives are embarrassed about the way he acts because everyone around him ridicules him. Family and relatives have denied Hattie's uncle's existence for many years but now it will be revealed to Hattie and she will be informed after all these years that her perfect life has many secrets hidden inside and is not so perfect after all. Hattie learns after spending quite some time with him that she and Adam are quite alike and she has to cope with him in some way. But Hattie also takes into consideration that dealing with him wont be easy and that it will take time to appreciate. He is looked down upon in every way and hated by all. Hattie takes it upon herself to help him, to bond with him and to find his true inner self while seeking for her own. Uncle Adam becomes for of a child like friend to Hattie than an Uncle figure in her life. Hattie realizes that she just has to \\"lift the corner of the universe\\" for him and open his paths a little wider so people can understand him better. Hattie is one of the few people who appreciate Adam for who he is and she is the only one who can see deep down inside of him. She feels that he has a lot of courage in facing the world and life's difficulties. This is an inspirational novel that gives hope and understanding for life. People don't often experience this exact same situation in life but we all face difficulties and this novel is good for children around Hattie's age because you can relate to her in different ways. Recommended for middle school ages, 12-14 years of age. This book will take you through the ups and downs of life just like a bumpy path. It sends the message that if we fall along the way we just get back up and try again, never give up hope."},{"Title":"CORNER OF THE UNIVERSE, A","review":"I listened to my corner of the universe in the car. The story is about a twelve-year-old girl, but an adult woman, who sounds very mature, reads it. Once you get passed that, you can appreciate that the orator is good at distinguishing between different voices in the story. The first half of the books describes a little girl who lives in a small town with her parents and has very few friends. She is reclusive, and unimaginative, all of her thoughts seem to be about the day-to-day universe. They are focused on her chores, the habits of the people who live in the boarding house etc. She observes, in a fairly flat way the world she lives in, and her shyness does not hide any quirkiness of character. She at first seems to be quite a dull little girl. The introduction of her mentally ill Uncle Adam adds some much needed spark to the story and the girl's affection for him makes her somewhat more endearing.The story is extremely conventionally structured; perhaps it is almost over structured. There is a clear climax, d&eacute;nouement etc.... the story lacks any of the playfulness that Adam embodies. But the details and the structure grow on you a bit, and could be comforting to a certain sort of child. I never would have gotten through this book, if it weren't for the audio version, but it may just be that it was just not to my taste. The \\"lessons\\" at the end were a bit heavy handed, but the overall sentiment was sweet."},{"Title":"CORNER OF THE UNIVERSE, A","review":"Visit THIS Corner of the UniverseA Corner of the Universe is a book about a girl named Hattie Owen. She lives in her parent?s boarding house, along with Angel Valentine, Miss Hagerty, and Mr. Penny. Hattie is lives like a normal girl but is very shy and feels most comfortable in her own house with her own family. She lives a couple blocks down from her grandmother, who is well off and very controlling.After her twelfth birthday, things start to turn a lot different from what she is use to. Her uncle, who lives in a medical home, comes to live with her grandparents unexpectedly. This confuses Hattie because she had no idea that her mother even had a brother. It seemed to her that everyone tried to keep Adam a secret and forget about him. So that very summer she becomes attached to him and seems almost break out of her shell. One of the surprising things that happened to her was a carnival came to her town. She went there several times and made her first true friend named, Catherine.I really liked this book because it is an easy read and a very good plot. It is very similar to Ann Martin?s other books, which are equally good.All in all, I rate this book 4 stars. The only things that I would change about this book, is to start the main story sooner. It starts out a little slow, but catches you in the end."},{"Title":"CORNER OF THE UNIVERSE, A","review":"I am glad for this book because I have a brother who also has a mental disability so I can relate to Hattie's emotions. This book is very realistic, almost like real life. It deserves five stars!"},{"Title":"CORNER OF THE UNIVERSE, A","review":"I had to read this book for a book-report and I was surprised to find out that I liked it. At first it seems a little weird, but it has a good lesson and story. Aslo, a surprise ending. I would recomend this book to others."},{"Title":"CORNER OF THE UNIVERSE, A","review":"I loved this book. For an adult it is a 5-star book. But this book was marketed for youth aged 12 and up, and there is such a heart-wrenching event at the end of the book that I could not recommend a child to read it.Hattie lives in a small town where live goes on in predictable patterns every day -- until her uncle arrives. No one has ever talked about Adam, who is now in his 20s. He has been kept in an institution because of his bizarre behavior, and Hattie finds herself alternately amused and alarmed by Adam's words and actions.The author helps us feel compassion and kindness towards Adam, so when Adam's heart is broken, and (Warning: spoiler ahead!) he kills himself, our hearts break along with Hattie's. In the end, this is not a book for children. It certainly could have been. The sex scene that Adam witnessed, and the manner of his death could have been changed or muffled. But there is a strength in the book as it stands. The shocking end has power, increasing our compassion for the man who didn't understand his world. I suggest instead that the age recommendation for this book be raised to 15."},{"Title":"CORNER OF THE UNIVERSE, A","review":"...\\"Corner of the Universe,\\" is an excellent book for teens. This story really shows how you can find great things in the most unexpected places. Hattie is a normal 12-year-old girl from a small town. Everything in her life is going great until her uncle, Adam, comes to back from boarding school. Adam gives Hattie one of the most interesting summers of her lifetime. Adam falls in love with one of the boarders at Hattie's family's boarding house. He can do something unexpected at all times so the reader must be ready for anything with this book. I recommend this book for young teens."},{"Title":"SAP Security: SAP Security Essentials","review":"I've never written a review before, but this book is so bad I feel obligated to save others from being ripped off. (I'm shipping mine back). The book is very weak. Not only are there few pages, but the type is probably 20pt, and there is much white space. Further, there is no substance as these are only answers to questions that were likely sent to a support desk. (An example from pg 34: \\"how is the ABAP Authority-check used?\\". There is a two sentence answer, and the rest of the page is empty.

If you want to learn about SAP security very quickly, this book will help you understand what is important to learn.That is an important distinction here. As a contractor I spend so much time reading and trying to figure out what it is that I should be learning - and that is why this book is so useful.This book contains only the information that is important for someone new to SAP security to learn.The book has several lists of transaction codes which are good to have around, and to have indexed in a nice format for easy lookup.I know that personally I have several notebooks and excel spreadsheets and Ms word documents and text files that now I can throw away because I have them all in this book. And that itself is worth the price of this book.But if I was new to SAP security, I would absoultely want this book because it would show me what I needed to know, and it would show me what I need to learn.I think lots of SAP consultants would flame this book because it puts their jobs in jeopardy and they do not what you to purchase this book because BASIS and Security jobs are so easy - and this book shows just how little it takes to know SAP security and SAP basis.good buy!"},{"Title":"SAP Security: SAP Security Essentials","review":"Few pages and more expensive.

Alligators killed nearly to the point of extinction, terns that need a secluded beach free of people and many other animals fill the pages. The photos are fantastic and the last page includes wonderful information to help your child learn more on the topic.My only gripe is the photo of a \\"Warning, Proceed with Caution\\" sign for the protection of manatees includes an obviously speeding boat! Still, even 20 years after being published, the information inside is not outdated at all (which is a bit sad from the animal point of view!).

August 1945 8 Uhr 15","review":"When the atomic bomb dropped at 8:15 a.m. on August 6, 1945, Hiroshima was a thriving city of two hundred forty-five thousand people. By 8:20, one hundred thousand of those people were dead. Combining the broad perspective of the absolute devastation of the city with the tiniest details of six individual lives, John Hersey provides a powerful closeup of a few survivors of the atomic attack on Hiroshima, giving the carnage a human perspective.Focusing on Mr. Tanimoto, a Methodist pastor; Mrs. Nakamura, the widow of a tailor, and her three children; Dr. Masakazu Fujii, a physician in a private clinic; Fr. Wilhelm Kleinsorge, S. J, a priest in a Catholic mission; Dr. Terufumi Sasaki, a young surgeon at the Red Cross Hospital; and Toshiko Sasaki, a clerk in a tin works, as they survive the initial attack, the author follows their daily movements, their subsequent illnesses, their fears, and the eventual outcomes of their lives. The victims become human, and their concerns become universal, as Hersey shows them digging themselves out and helping their neighbors, filled with an \\"elated community spirit\\" in the days and weeks after the bombing.Details of the fires following the bombing, the unexpected radiation sickness, the mysteries surrounding the kind of bomb this was (some Japanese believed that the allies had sprinkled powdered magnesium over the city and then ignited it), the devastating rains that followed, and the monumental scale of the damage are presented in straightforward, factual style, the horrors of the reality so overwhelming that Hersey had no need to try to control his narrative by selecting details or ordering them for effect.Published in the New Yorker in August, 1946, this account had immediate and dramatic repercussions, perhaps because the focus on \\"ordinary\\" Japanese citizens, as opposed to \\"the enemy,\\" resonated with his readers, who found the Japanese much like themselves. Thousands listened to four days of its reading on ABC radio, and many others bought the New Yorker to read his account. By raising also the question of the ethics of dropping such a bomb (which some of the Japanese agree was acceptable as a normal part of the war), he also forces his readers to consider the long-term implications of atomic warfare. Dramatic, powerful, and very personal, this account of six lives, changed forever, is a monument to the human spirit in the face of incredible adversity.

Wilson had John J. Pershing; Roosevelt had George C. Marshall. Lincoln had none; his greatest prospect was Robert E. Lee. So the very title of this book conveys a task for Lincoln that had to be done, if the Union were to survive. And so, Professor Williams starts out telling us in no uncertain terms that the beginning of the war showed no generals likely to be able to do the job . . . he completes Volume One with McClellan--who is not the general Lincoln wants. And we are anxious for subsequent volume(s) for Professor Williams takes us to Sam Grant--the general Lincoln finally found. This book moves along, and as it does, we fairly ache with the disappointment Lincoln suffered time and time again."},{"Title":"Lincoln finds a general;: A military study of the Civil War","review":"Excellent analysis of beginning of Civil War and McClellan's rise/beginning of his fall. William's easily readable, yet thorough analysis of the political and military goings-on just prior to the fall of Fort Sumter through Antietam makes one anxious to read the complete set of Lincoln Finds a General. Obviously no fan of McCellan, Kenneth Williams makes an eloquent case against &quot;the redoubtable McC&quot; and gives a clear picture of the difficulties he made for Lincoln by his hesitancy and obtuseness. In this volume, Williams paves the way for other volumes illustrating the further trials of Linclon in his search for a military man who could help him save the nation-one who was not overawed by Bobby Lee. One can imagine his thankfulness and relief when he found Grant: &quot;I can't spare this man--he fights!&quot; As a Civil War buff of 40 years, I was enchanted by this book and have spent over 10 years searching for the complete set--I found it once in an antique book store in Columbia, SC for $350 (first edition set of the complete original volumes) at a time when that seemed a fortune to me. I wish I had gotten that set as I have never seen it again, but I have re-read this little volume so many times that it is greatly worn--proof of its readabiliy and texture.

It goes into considerable detail regarding McClellan's failures and shows McClellans failure to follow orders and send troops to support Pope at 2nd Bull Run which could easily have changed it from a defeat to a victory. It also shows Pope in a much better light as a general than he is usually represented. It also goes into McClellan's apparent motives for thisfailure.

From simple setup info to get you started, API discussions and performance considerations to common sense learned through experience, etc., it's there. &quot;It&quot; is also scattered about the MS white papers and product documentation, but this book nicely collects all the interesting stuff into a single volume. I'd put it up with the NT Services book, as one of the best Wrox books for programmers doing server applications on MS platforms. (BTW, if you're one of these, you might also like Nik Okunsteff's NT 4.0 Security and Exchange programming books). Programming examples are in VB and C/C++; one or two might be in Java. So, the more widely-versed you are in languages/environments and the more you have worked on Web-based applications, the more you're going to get out of this book, although it contains rather intro-level coverage of app-building Wizards and the like, as well.I _read_ all the MS white papers and product docs while developing a prototype app soon after Site Server 3.0's release; it would have saved me a lot of time if this book had been available a couple months earlier.

Guess again; Site Server 3.0 can be a challenge to even install, depending on what else is on your machine, and if you can't install Site Server, or your company's admin can't install it on their production server, your app isn't going to get far...).Doing an app in a Site Server environment?

It would be nice if someone would write a book specifically focused on programming in ASP for P&amp;M as well as explain things a little better than &quot;This is what you type to get it to do this&quot;.Until there's something better out there... you're probably going to have to be satisfied with this."},{"Title":"Site Server 3.0 Personalization and Membership","review":"While this book is a necessary companion to the Site Server online help, I have been badly burned by using the sample code.

Instead I ended up wasting a lot of time.Use the Site Server SDK instead."},{"Title":"Site Server 3.0 Personalization and Membership","review":"This book contains a wealth of information about installation, security and programming aspects of site server. The only complaint I have is that the author's style. The author doesn't do a good job of capturing the concept before heading down to details and then internals. The constant mix of concepts, code and internal workings many times in confusing orders overwhelmed me. For example, the fact the AUO framework can get the user context from IIS, is mentioned so many times in the passing but never once explained in detail clearly. Before the reader digests this fact and tries to understand the basics of AUO object and the IADs interface he'll suddenly be introduced to the IADsContainer interface and methods with no explanation or introduction.With that being said, I do want to commend the author on the amount of ground he's tried to cover.

It does a fairly good job to get you started with Personalization and Membership (P&amp;M), but after a while you'll realize that there's still a lot of information missing.For example, the book speaks nothing of applying filters with ASP or querying the DS using SQL commands or even any other objects other than the Membership.Userobjects. Many of which is vital in developing almost any website with P&amp;M. There's a lot more that I'm just now learning about that I needed to know but this book never explains.The best way to learn? Until someone decides to write a comprehensive book on P&amp;M, I will continue to use the web administration pages that came with Site Server (the ones that allow you to go through and administer the DS via. the web) as the examples and use this book only as a reference from time to time.Good luck!"},{"Title":"Site Server 3.0 Personalization and Membership","review":"I learned a great deal about Membership &amp; Personalization from this book - without it I would have been lost; but I also learned many more things about Site Server in general that I had not seen anywhere else.

Basically it saved my butt. One problem it does have is that his pages all allow anonymous access and he deals with security in a patchy, circumspect way. For secure entry into the Membership Directory, you will need ADSI. I suggest also buying &quot;ADSI ASP&quot;, by Steven Hahn, also by Wrox Press. It will help fill this gap and round out your knowledge. Unlike the others, I rather enjoyed Mr. Howard's face on the cover.

Howard rightly focuses on just a few elements of the 'Hulking' Site Server Product (a decent book on the whole thing would have to 1000+ pages). A little dry for me in the first few chapters, but don't give up, ultimately this book has all you need to know re P/M, and is a well organized and readable book.

One night a few men barged in the house. The Exchequer's men came in the house. They seized Otto and severed his hand. Then Edmund ran and tried to evade the men, but they caught him too with their horses. They were about to cut his hand off too, but the sheriff came in and put him in chains. The sheriff noticed that he was very strong and looked fit for battle. There was a knight named Sir Nigel who needed a squire for he had lost one. He was going to choose from another youth named Hubert who could fight with a battle-axe and with a two-handed sword. Sir Nigel decided them to fight and choose the winner. They both became squires for Sir Nigel. Edmund became a hammer man. They trained under Sir Nigel for the crusade they were going to go on. Finally the crusade started. The crusaders started a siege on the city of Acre. After a while, they took it over. They had many prisoners. King Richard ordered for them to all be executed. This was the third crusade. Many people died. There was more, but you will have to read it to find out.This book was very realistic. Although I like fiction, I enjoyed this historical fiction. The story was mixed with the occurrence of the Third Crusade and an apprentice of a moneymaker becoming a squire.My favorite part was the siege of Acre. It was very descriptive and well written."},{"Title":"The Book of the Lion","review":"The Book of the Lion is a pretty good book, which tells of a young boy named Edmund. The book was good but it could have been better. The story is about Edmund going off with Sir Nigel to fight in the crusades, after he is arrested and Sir Nigel sets him free. You see, Sir Nigel is in need of a squire and Edmund immediatly agrees to join up with him, so that he can save his own skin. So after some begining adventures, which you'll find out about when you read the book, the two set off with the help of Sir Rannulf, another knight and a friend of Sir Nigel's, and Hubert, Sir nigel's other squire, as well as a whole batch of other characters that I again won't mention. The journy consists of them going to Italy and then sailing of to the Holy Lands. The next part of the story describes the battles of the Crusades, although the battles could have been a bit more exiting, and the whole book could have been a bit longer. I felt like the book centered to much on the time in between battles, and exiting parts, over just describing a lot while having something exiting happen. Although the book kept my intrest, I couldn't really get into it. If you like quick books, that are pretty exiting, not to bloody, and that have a dramatic side to them, than this book is for you."},{"Title":"The Book of the Lion","review":"Bought this for my daughter as it was required summer reading. She had to push hard to get through it, and she read me a few chapters so I could understand why it was so laborious. Just not our kind of book I guess - the story line and characters failed to capture, and the author's style didn't resonate."},{"Title":"The Book of the Lion","review":"I'm a mom with a family of boys. This book was shelved in the \\"young adult\\" section of our library -- it is for teens who can handle graphic violence. Parents should know that.The story is good, although the last 1/3rd needs proofreading. Many errors on the spelling of characters' names, and even noun/verb agreement.This tells the story of a young man (17) who escapes the penalty for counterfeiting (having his hand chopped off) and is chosen by a departing knight to come on Crusade with him to liberate Jerusalem.The story telling tends toward stream-of-consciousness. Narrated in the first person, the story gets a little jumpy, especially as fear and blood lust shut down Edmund's higher-level thinking skills.So, within the book, your child will read the following:\\"Two men stretched my master's hand out along the cold iron of the anvil, his fingers splayed out white against the black. I kicked and wrestled... We all fell silent, the only sound Maud choking back sobs. It took a heartbeat, no more. Steel flashed and rang against the anvil. A white, wriggling thing struggled in the char-dust on the plank floor and my master's cry was one of disbelief. Maud began to scream, and I was crying out, too, as one of the leather gauntlets picked my master's severed right hand from the coal dust. My master's cry took on a new tenor as blood pumped into the candlelight.\\" p 4.\\"As we continued south, perhaps an hour before sunset, two great brown mastiffs rushed through the brambles on the verge of the road, and seized our dog companion by the flank and throat. Within a moment our hound was ripped in two, blood flying, the two attacking monsters gobbling and growling as they tore the dog to pieces.\\" p 48.\\"I stood on something pillow-soft, and looked down to see a bright blue blouse, and a beard and earring, gleaming teeth. Before I could see if the man was alive, wounded or stunned, the army surged forward. I told myself I did not hear a dozen feet crushing the blue blouse into the earth.\\" p 149.\\"My past, my future consisted of this breathless climb. The rocks were slippery with red soup and broken teeth.\\" p 149.\\"Up some stone-paved lanes Frankish squires and footmen were celebrating, bare haunches rutting on the thin, splayed forms of pagan women. If this sight shocked me for an instant, I quickened my pace.\\" p 160.\\"The prisoners numbers two thousand seven hundred mouths. They accepted their defeat with no sound of complaint, waiting for the parleys that would agree on the price that would return them to their families and friends....\\" p 162.\\"When King Richard strode from his tent that afternoon, the camp stirred, neighbor nudging neighbor. King Richard was in dress armor, the brightest mail, an indigo cape flowing nearly to the ground. The king, accompanied by his personal guards and Sir Guy de Renne, hurried over to the roped-off area where the prisoners hunched, heads down, twenty-seven hundred humans as quiet as sweltering beasts....Men crowded close. A few of the knights loosened the blades in their scabbards, the camp intent on the king.King Richard said, \\"All of them.\\"Les tout.And he made an unmistakable gesture, a finger across his throat.... There was a space of time, three heartbeats, when nothing happened.The first blow sent a wave through the prisoners, a gasp like a great wind. A few of the men struggled to rise, but the tethers around their hands and feet hobbled them, and they fell. A woman began to plead. The prisoners swarmed in place, trapped.A child bawled, a noise like a crippled calf I had heard once... The male prisoners cried out, one or two quick-thinking enough to argue in their incomprehensible tongue....I kept Hubert from seeing it, held his face away from the sight, although the sloppy crunch of blade and ax, and the smell of blood and fresh-torn bowels could not be ignored....Many knights did not enter the harvest... When the tide of fly-carpeted blood crept close to us, Nigel kicked up a dike of dust to keep it from our feet....Nigel and Rannulf stood beside each other, arms folded, and only moved when the red tide crept too close.\\" pp 165-167.Edmund survives the Crusdae and returns home.

I am not sure I could use this book in the classroom without offending some of my more conservative parents. Thoughts from any teachers who have used the book in the classroom would be appreciated."},{"Title":"The Book of the Lion","review":"The Book of the Lion, by Michael Cadnum, is an interesting book. It begins with a boy named Edmund who is a coiners apprentice. But it turns out the coiner is cheating on how he makes his coins and his hand is chopped off by order of the king, he later dies from the blood loss. When they are interrogating Edmund he lies and says he's rode a horse and used a sword before. So they send him off to fight the holy crusade with a group of knights and squires. In the end he becomes the squire of a feared knight, because his first dies in a storm, and he fights the holy crusade with a war hammer given to him by his master, who is also the knight he works for.This book I great for detail it describes every little thing they possibly could. When they walk into a city for the first time he describes the people, the buildings, and the shops with great detail. When Edmund and a friend are captured and put in jail he describes the chains on the wrist and every board in the jail cell. Some of the greatest description is in battle he would describe the bodies, dead or alive, as if you were looking at them right at that moment.The battles are also very well descriptive, not just in the surroundings but in peoples' actions too. When the battles would begin he would tell about where everyone was and what they were doing and he would describe how loud it was. Then of course when the battle actually started the was also great detail, like in Edmunds first battle it described how he fought and when his friend fell he shielded him and smashed an enemies arm with his hammer. Then he would tell about people charging over rubble and slipping on blood.Another thing described nicely is how everyone changed over the story, or how peoples' views on other people changed. Edmund, when the story first started was reluctant to go to battle, he also was afraid of the knight that most said was a murderer. In the end they were friends and Edmund knew the rumors were wrong and he was a good man. His friend Hubert however was just the opposite, when the story started Hubert was very brave and ready for battle, but in the end Hubert wanted to go home because he was scared after his first battle. So everyone changed.I would recommend this book to someone who is very complex and can understand and respect a lot of detail. All in all it was a good book that most would love."},{"Title":"The Book of the Lion","review":"I was reading this book and previewing it to see if it would work for my 10th grade world history classes. Though, I am not a prude and understand that literature can be subject to interpretation, I must agree with some of the other reviewers here on the inappropriateness of some parts of this book. I was looking for a good YA book on the middle ages, and was a bit thrown off by the several really unnecessary sexual references in the book. I understand that for the book to be accurate or semi-accurate for the middle ages and the crusades it is not going to be a Disney story and there is going to be some blood and gore as it was a violent time period. But it was the several sexual references that turned me against this book."},{"Title":"The Book of the Lion","review":"I love to read, but I wanted to put this book down by page 10, and i would have if it hadn't been assigned for English.

The description made are very clear so that you can imagine as if you are there."},{"Title":"The Book of the Lion","review":"My 11 year old chose this book for an assignment on historical fiction. The school librarian had made it an available choice and one I do not feel is appropriate for middle school students. My son was having difficulty understanding what the author was saying, so he asked me to take a look at it. As we started reading it together, I saw clearly where the problem was coming from. The author's style of writing,choice of vocabulary, and sentence structure make the story very cumbersome to read. The author does an excellent job of describing the people, events, and places the main character encounters, but does so in a way that is difficult to understand. I would equate his style of waiting to that found in Ivanhoe and definitely more appropriate for high school students. We did manage to get through the book by reading it together and stopping regularly for me to explain what was happening in the story. My son is in an advanced language arts class and has a good knowledege base of the subject matter. I am a licensed teacher and consider myself to be well-read, so I feel our difficulty was due to our lack of ability or understanding. Another problem I had with this story as a book for younger middle school students is the continual reference to \\"women of pleasure\\", sex, and even King Richard's preference \\"to the company of young men\\". An example of both the other's writing style and reference to prostitutes can be found in this passage:\\"The side streets were denuded, every latchstring and window curtain of a groat's worth having long since been taken. Up some stone-paved lanes Frankish squires and footman were celebrating, bare haunches rutting on the thin, splayed forms of pagan women.\\"I think there could be other books on this subject matter better suited for middle school students."},{"Title":"The Book of the Lion","review":"It was a ok book, telling the story of a young? apprentince coinsmyth.

I recommend this book who likes historical fiction and lots of action at the climax.-Colin"},{"Title":"The Book of the Lion","review":"I liked this book because it wasn't a fairy tale. It told the Middle Ages like they were. Cleanliness and personal hygene weren't exactly a priority. People waited like, years before they had a bath. Nobody could read and write (except monks).

If i could rate this book on a scale from 1-10 it would be a 9 1/2!"},{"Title":"The Book of the Lion","review":"Michael Cadnum puts us squarely into the alien environment of the 12th century in this well written and evocative novel of a young man's coming of age. Young apprentice Edmund is sentenced to go on Crusade for abetting his criminal master, and finds himself caught up in the excitement and terror of the Cause. Cadnum's vivid imagery had me holding my nose when Edmund's ship drifted down the sewage-laden Thames; this is not a pretty portrait of a romantic Middle Ages. Battlefield rape, smashed skulls, torture, and mutilation should put this novel out of reach of anyone under middle school age, but the unsentimental story and exquisite writing recommends it to anyone older, including adults."},{"Title":"The Book of the Lion","review":"I can't get over the graphic sexual references in a book intended for young middle-school aged children. For example, \\"Wenstan and Miles disagreed on a song about a woman in a citadel who grew her hair long, so any passing knight could climb up the long tresses and join her in corporeal delight. Miles contended that the hair in question was her privy hair, while Wenstan said this was the most irritating example of twisting a jolly song into something sinful. 'It was the hair of her head,' stammered Wenstan, 'Her head hair!'\\" (page 67).It is one thing to reference some examples of prostitution and rape to give an idea of the zeitgeist of the Crusades; it is another to intersperse them throughout the book in such a cavalier manner, seemingly designed for the shock value or perhaps the entertainment value of the author as he knows he is writing for young children. I picture the author chuckling to himself as he slips these things past the parents and the teachers who are assigning the book."},{"Title":"The Book of the Lion","review":"My first Michael Cadnum book will definitely not be my last! The depth of his research is apparent, as well as his grasp of the historical realism of the period. I particularly enjoyed the characterization of Edmund (the main character). His traits were well developed and personal. They helped me to identify even more with the story, as if I could feel what it would be like if I were really there.The gritty realism of the battles and medieval life were well done, I thought. It left me wanting more of the same. Having never read Cadnum before it took a little getting used to his crisp style. He paints scenes and \\"frames\\" (for lack for a better word) to help his story move along.

This part of the book got me absorbed into the story, but as I read more throughout the book I started to get more and more bored of the story.

It is filled with scientific errors, ungrounded assumptions and vapid generalizations. I found no real knowledge, insight and certainly no inspiration within its covers. Most of the book is not about kundalini at all but about the authors opinions and understanding of different subjects. I found those quite unremarkable."},{"Title":"Kundalin Rising: Mastering Creative Energies (School of Metaphysics, No 100147)","review":"Exactly what I was looking for; a straightforward discussion of the subject free of over-arching intellectual babble and minus the typical, cheesy new-age marketing fluff--or worse, self aggrandizing prattle about the author.This book is not an academic work--it's a discussion, so of course everything stated should be taken as opinion. If you're out to labor, split hairs and check sources, there are already plenty of works that can provide you with that kind of challenge. If you're simply a student of meditation who wants to be inspired by some quick examples of the Kundalini force demonstrated by great minds, and a fast-moving discussion of the chakra system and how you can best use yours, then this is a worthy investment of your time.As other reviewers have mentioned, this is not the best place for a beginner to start learning about meditation.

It is not the best book for a person who has just started studying this subject, or who wants to do some hands on work.The thing I didn't like about the book is the authors interpretation of the bible, which seemed to me at times to be completely lacking in any real knowledge on the subjects she was translating into her theories. I doubt that she did any 4-6 years of Bible School to get her title as a Minister."},{"Title":"A cornet of horse: A tale of Marlborough's wars","review":"As a lightweight history buff, I enjoy reading the fictionalized stories of historical Europe and America. This one tells the story of a young man going to battle in the War of the Spanish Succession - a little known era to me. John Churchill, Lord Marlborough, was the primary English commander who tried to unite the armies and leaders of Holland, Hapsburg, Hanover and Prussia against the French and Spanish. The bloody wars and seiges lasted from 1702 to 1713. The book describes many of the battles, the terrain, the planning, and the bloodshed.The \\"Cornet\\" of the story was young Rupert Holliday, who survives duels, war, prison, love, Louis IV, battles, escapes and recaptures. Along the way, author Henty gives great descriptions of famous battles that occurred. I followed some of them by googling various locations and battles and it appears fairly true to the real stuff. George A. Henty (1832-1902) wrote numerous other adventure books.

(it's also a quiet love story, by the way)"},{"Title":"Autocrat of the Breakfast-Table, The","review":"Two oral practices flourished in antebellum America: the lecture (or sermon) and the conversation. Lectures, such as Emerson's \\"The American Scholar\\" and sermons, such as the abolitionist sermons of Henry Ward Beecher, are well-known examples of this era. But it was also known as the Golden Age of Conversation, and its greatest practitioner was generally agreed to be Oliver Wendell Holmes, Senior.Holmes was considered an important American writer until the 1920s when he was excised from the American canon by the modernists. They depicted him as willfully provincial, and elitist. What those critics failed to understand was that the Autocrat is also a comic pose, and that Holmes is making sport of everyone, including elitists. Holmes' democratic view of conversation as an open, free-wheeling discourse where anyone could join the Autocrat at his table, as long as they enlivened the conversation, ran counter to the views of his more elitist friends in Boston's Saturday Club in Boston. Holmes loved to talk, and his love for talk made him a democrat, or perhaps a true republican.His Autocrat is a many sided character: stern and foolish, admonitory and celebratory, a polymorph who will don any temporaty mask necessary to keep the conversation alive. Holmes' playful metaphorical imagination is also a revelation. His gift for translating complex ideas into homey metaphors, aphorisms, and similes is nothing short of miraculous. In the words of another seriously comic American whom I'm sure Holmes would have delighted in, the Autocrat \\"floats like a butterfly, stings like a bee.\\"The Autocrat of the Breakfast table begins \\"in media res,\\" in the middle of a conversation, with the Autocrat attempting to set the rules for conversation at his table. They are generous rules, but even they are open to sabotage by his tablemates at the boarding house. He begins by banning \\"facts\\" from his table as impediments to conversation, (a condition that should prevail on today's too numerous current event talking head shows. But I, like the Autocrat, digress).Here's how the Autocrat starts: \\"I was just going to say, when I was interrupted, that one of the many ways of classifying minds is under the head of arithmetical and algebraical intellects. All economical and practical wisdom is an extension of the following arithmetical formula: 2 + 2 = 4. Every philosophical proposition has the more general character of the expression a + b = c. We are mere operatives, empirics, and egoists, until we learn to think in letters instead of figures.\\" \\"They all stared. There is a divinity student lately come among us to whom I commonly address remarks like this. \\"In other words, as Gibian says in his marvelous OLIVER WENDELL HOLMES AND THE CULTURE OF CONVERSATION: [The Autocrat] only asks us to study his beliefs the way a pragmatist would study the doctrines of any religion: \\"I don't want you to believe anything I say; I only want you to to try to see what makes me believe it.\\" How refreshing in this age of factoids and statisticoids recited with rancor and ideological certitude, to hear the Autocrat and his tablemates at the boarding house attempting to fashion a democracy through and by their conversation. Nowadays all we have are the unironic Autocrats, control freaks like John McLaughlin, Ted Koppel, Rush Limbaugh, and that guy on FOX whose name I have, pleasantly, forgotten.Listening to the Autocrat you can almost hear American singing. It's not exactly Walt Whitman's America, but it's still America in the hopeful, experimental antebellum era, and thus a good antidote to the cold technocratic chatter and lukewarm public relations cant we are showered with in this hypermediated century."},{"Title":"Autocrat of the Breakfast-Table, The","review":"The Autocrat of the Breakfast-Table is a demonstration of New England civility in the 1850s.

Comprising a series of articles published in the Atlantic Monthly in the 1850s, The Autocrat of the Breakfast Table is a rambling but never disjointed first-person narrative of \\"conversations\\" between the narrator (the \\"Autocrat\\" from the title) and his fellow boarders in a Boston boarding house. I use the term \\"conversations\\" because the work is primarily monological, with the other boarders chiming in only infrequently to interrupt the Autocrat's musings and observations.The Autocrat is learned and urbane. He speaks intelligently on a diverse array of topics, including the rules governing the art of conversation (including the \\"pun-question\\", which he dismisses as \\"verbicide\\"), horse racing, writing, deja vu, the superior ability of the olfactory sense in recalling old memories, old age or \\"senectitude\\", laughter, poetry, knowledge, the benefits of rowing, boxing, hats, trees and other topics. Interspersed throughout the work are collections of verse as well.While not a page-turner, I found myself reasonably engaged throughout the work with two exceptions: (1) there are a couple of passages in French (I have no French), one of which is fairly long and (2) the budding and finally flowering romance at the end of the work I found to be rather dull reading and somewhat superfluous, given the nature of the work.While reading this book I felt as though I had escaped from my overly-structured, hectic existence - and the collection of (often vulgar) characters that pass uninvited across the stage of my life - to become a part of the much simpler yet richer world of the Autocrat. Time slowed down. Reflection and conversation were the order of the day. I realized with regret that the deliberate reflection that nourishes a flow of ideas, and from which yet new ideas oft emerge, had at some point been demoted in my own life to the status of a luxury."},{"Title":"Autocrat of the Breakfast-Table, The","review":"The imaginary scene is a boarding house breakfast. Conversation is dominated by a lively gent who's seen it all. He holds forth on women, school, philosophy, rowing, interrupted from time to time with verses such as the Deacon's Masterpiece. It's witty, poignant, and rightfully a classic."},{"Title":"Autocrat of the Breakfast-Table, The","review":"\\"The Autocrat\\" is convoluted but remarkable nevertheless. First published in 1858, it is still refreshing. Don't wince at the potential for the rigid corset-style of Victorianism. Holmes casts it aside and even surprises you with the typeface in one instance. His language is often refreshing and is usually easy to read. Whether or not it is original or not I cannot say, but I recognize some of Holmes's words as influencing later writers, like Irvin Cobb and H.L. Mencken, and I imagine he influenced many more.Holmes writes charmingly. He is funny and philosophical. He also manages to transport the reader to an earlier Boston and New England. The only thing lacking is a plot.Holmes was an alumnus of Philips Academy in Andover, MA, and the library there is named after him. I'm going out on a limb here, but I think it was his genius and not his munificence that was being commemorated.PS: Do not confuse him with his son, Junior -- the famous justice of the Supreme Court."},{"Title":"Autocrat of the Breakfast-Table, The","review":"Delightful, because his ideas are so modern and so all-encompassing - the man thought about everything! - and yet expressed in a form genial and classical, and as non-dogmatic as you can get. His tongue-in-cheek style is a charming context for such far-ranging thinking. A grand insight into into the mind of a real American ante-bellum intellectual.But it is so endlessly rambling that I kept getting confused. Why divide it into 12 sections, when each section is indistinguishable from the others? If there is any theme or system to the material, I lost it in the intellectual underbrush. Also his style is rather turgid, even for the 1850s; I find it easy to read his contemporaries Dickens and Carroll, but I found myself having to go back from time to time to sort out Holmes' grammar.If you feel at home in unstructured literature, you will find much to love in the Autocrat. If not, maybe not."},{"Title":"Autocrat of the Breakfast-Table, The","review":"An interesting range of thoughtful opinions, imbedded in a look at American life in the 1850s, by the father of a future Supreme Court Associate Justice. Part of the charm of this book is in the fact that at that time horses had been the only means of human-assisted transportation for the last few thousand years (with the exception of the new-fangled railroad which was changing the world).

Automobiles were 50 years into the future."},{"Title":"Routledge Philosophy GuideBook to Locke on Government (Routledge Philosophy GuideBooks)","review":"Routledge Guide book has taken efforts to concisely introduce its readers to works of John Locke. The text is intelligible to beginners and is an easy read.The Second Treatise details the state of nature; the development of society; the contract between the government and its people and the right to rebellion. The issue of rebellion has considerable interests especially to the residents of California with the event of the recall of the Governor Gray Davis. According to Locke if the government fails to enforce the law of nature; fails to further the common good of people; loses trust of people; and fails to act within the bounds of the law the people have the right to rebel. If the above conditions were met then the recall of the governor was a justifiable action by the people.The Second Treatise has immense relevance to all democratic state as it has been stated by political scholars that it was one of the first all encompassing profound document; advocating for democracy.This was an easy to understand read and the authors have done great justice to the works of John Locke.

I was given this as a child in the early 1960s, and even my 10-year-old mind couldn't miss the deeply authoritarian Nazi flavoured undertones which permeated the book. The author appeared to worship the ground Werner von Braun walked on, adding a rather obsequious touch to his version of post WWII rocket science. But the real howlers involve the science. For example, Schroeder insisted that rockets would take off horizontally from water, so as to derive maximum benefit from the rotational velocity of the Earth. Didn't anyone ever tell him about the difference between radial and tangential velocity? And he blithely dismissed special relativity with the observation that if two spacecraft travel in opposite directions at near light speed their velocity of separation must be nearly twice the speed of light - so that faster-than-light travel is obviously possible.

Blackmore guides the reader on an exhilarating crashcourse through all the issues relevant to the problem of consciousness, from Descartes to the thought of contemporary scientists and philosophers.This book has a number of unique strengths. Most importantly, Blackmore has managed to distill to their essences the various features of what is often a baffling subject, and writes in clear, lively prose. This alone would justify the book's purchase.Another strength is her focus not just on the speculative, but on the hard science relevant to consciousness. She frequently makes reference to (and explains) experiments illuminating the characteristics and activities of the mind/brain.Blackmore also does a good job at introducing prominent thinkers in the area of consciousness by including photos, mini-bios, and explaining their work and why it is important.Blackmore seems very clever, and overall is quite fair in her assessment of the competing strands of thought within this field. There is only one peculiarity (whether it is a fault or not depends on perspective) that concerns me: almost every discussion of any aspect of consciousness seems to include, and often concludes with, entirely uncritical descriptions of what Tufts philosopher Daniel Dennett thinks about the issue. This is odd, because virtually everyone else's ideas are subjected to tough questioning by Blackmore. As if to punctuate this seemingly uncritical embrace of Dennett, Blackmore even uses photos of - guess who? - Daniel Dennett to construct a montage demonstrating blind spots (see page 82).As a kind of prima facie indicator of whether there was indeed a dramatically lopsided reliance on, or deference to, Dennett, I turned to the index to count up the number of pages in which various scientists and philosophers were referred to or discussed in the book. To be generous, I disregarded thinkers mentioned only in passing, and focused on eleven prominent names (Chalmers, Churchland, Dawkins, Damasio, etc.). The average number of index pages for each thinker was fourteen, while the total number of pages for Dennett was....71! No one else even comes close to half the citations.Despite the real achievements of this book, Blackmore's handling of Dennett might be of concern to some readers, who, like I have, have gotten the sense that at this point, it is far too early for the construction and reinforcement of any orthodoxy or dogma; while many theories have been proposed, we all still seem to be feeling about largely in the dark vis-&agrave;-vis this most mysterious of fields.However, as is again made clear in quotations from him in the book, Dennett seems (sometimes gleefully) predisposed to dogmatic, Cardinal Ratzinger-like pronouncements about almost every aspect of this science (note, for example, the telling title of his 1991 book, \\"Consciousness Explained\\" [sigh]). He often seems to advance his arguments using rhetorical features that place them stylistically in with arguments made by people like Jimmy Swaggart and Pat Robertson. (Perhaps this is an inevitable consequence of a commitment to any fundamentalist, absolutist world-explaining ideology [whether theist or atheist, like Dennett embraces]; but since, as I mentioned, this is only the dawn of consciousness studies, who knows? Perhaps future research will finally reveal whether the relentless arrogance and dogmatism of Dawkins and Dennett and Swaggart and Robertson are indeed attributable to identical neurological processes in the brain, showing all four humans to be of the same unique type, no matter how much they might all loathe being associated with each other; and depending on how the free will debate turns out, we might even be able to find out whether any of them can even be held accountable for the general intolerability of their pedadogical styles).This is not to say that Dennett is wrong about everything; he may turn out to be right about everything. All I mean to say is that, given the current less-than-airtight evidence for Dennett's ideas, and a modus operandi that suggests he may not exactly be open-minded, Blackmore's attachment to Dennett ought to be considered by readers. If we buy a book called \\"Economics: An Introduction\\", and we see that of all the economic authorities cited, Karl Marx has over five times the average amount of citations and is the only one treated uncritically, we would have every reason to suspect that possibly a prior commitment by the author has inhibited her ability, or even desire, to evaluate or present Marx's ideas sans bias, or even sans what psychologist Daniel Goleman calls mental lacunae.If, as seems indisputable, Blackmore thinks Dennett is closer to the truth on everything than everyone else, can we see the requisite hard evidence that he is? And if this evidence does not exist yet, should Blackmore's endorsement of Dennett not just be made explicit so we can take that into consideration as we try to form our own conclusions about things?In fairness, I should say that Dennett, for better or for worse, is a leading voice in consciousness studies, so one might as well become familiar with his ideas (I won't spoil the surprise).Despite the Dennett issue (Blackmore and Dennett might argue \\"because\\" of it), the truth is that this book is still by far the best that I know of for introducing the emerging science of consciousness. Blackmore might be twitterpated with the chest-thumping Dennett, but she's very smart and a very good writer, and covers pretty much all the bases that need to be covered in an intelligible way. That's why I'm giving this book five stars.Good luck"},{"Title":"Consciousness: An Introduction","review":"I am glad to find a complete book dealing with all aspects of consciousness in CLEARLY written format, with graphs and tables to facilitate comprehension. The book covers everything I had seen before from Artificial Intelligence to Philosophy to Neurology to Evolutionary Biology.Say one wants to get an idea of Dan Dennett's theory of consciousness (without having to get through Dennett's circuitous, unfocused and evasive prose) or Searle's Chinese room argument or Turing's test or Chalmer's position or Churchland's neurophilosophy or a presentation of research on the neural correlates of consciousness...Everything I could think about is there."},{"Title":"Consciousness: An Introduction","review":"You have to wonder when an author declares her intention to perplex you. With any book about the human mind, you have a right to expect information and clarification. There's a great deal of information here, and it's presented with clarity. However, while you will learn much from this book, at the end you will be aware of how much remains to be done. That situation, as Blackmore explains, is due to the nature of the subject. Not only are the issues of consciousness difficult to explain, but, a definition - the very foundation of discussion - is lacking. With such a frail base, what can an author give the enquiring reader? Blackmore summarises the advances made in attempting to define \\"consciousness\\". Her approach, although formatted as a textbook, is accessible to anyone wishing to delve into studies of the mind. She's to be applauded for synopsising a very dynamic topic with apparent ease.The study of consciousness is inevitably contentious. With so little firm information available on the workings of the brain, theories of \\"how the mind works\\" abound. Blackmore skilfully guides the reader through the many theories of mind that have emerged over many centuries. Blackmore uses those theories to organise her presentation, describing a theorist and his/her idea as a discussion focus. Inevitably, it is Descartes and \\"dualism\\" that provide the opening scenario. The structure allows the author to post some \\"assignments\\" that may look like academic exercises, but are couched in terms any reader can understand and use. After all, we all have ideas about what \\"consciousness\\" means. Why should we not test our assumptions? Blackmore helps us do this as each chapter offers another step in contrasting our own views with that of the philosophers.With over two millennia of thinkers on thinking, ideas proposed and overturned, it would seem this book might be a Rogue's Gallery of theories and theorists. Blackmore is too even-handed to render summary judgements, especially condemnatory ones. There are few heroes in this tale - with the exception of William James. He's frequently lauded, not only for founding the science of psychology, but for the lengthy list of insights into the human mind he discerned. Blackmore's tributes to James are low-key and not effusively laudatory. But there are few chapters that aren't introduced by a Jamesian quotation. James' successors, from Chalmers to Searle, address Cartesian dualism in various ways. Dennett, the most scathing critic of the \\"Cartesian theatre\\" in which a virtual little \\"person\\" sits in our brain viewing the world, crops up repeatedly. That's only right and proper, since many of those claiming to have dumped dualism, secretly harbour it. The hints are often well camouflaged, but Blackmore shows how Dennett's discerning gaze penetrates any obscuring verbiage to triumphantly expose it to public scrutiny.As Blackmore guides us through most of the prevailing concepts of consciousness, she introduces some of the novelties that distort our perception of it. Nearly half the book is composed of descriptions of things that mislead us. Various dream states, and their impact on the body are presented. The \\"phantom limb\\" syndrome, amnesia and perceptions of spirits and fairies all make their appearance. Blackmore parades these anomalies before us, accompanied by explanations of their real nature - which runs from cryptic neurotransmitter behaviour to outright fraud.Although this book appears as a university text, and will likely be welcomed in many classrooms, its readership will not be confined to academic halls. The mysteries of consciousness are of concern to us all. That alone should lead to it being placed on countless shelves. These are issues that continue to intrigue us.

The book examines consciousness from myriad viewpoints;philosophical, psychological, and biological. Ms. Blackmore presents a plethora of fascinating topics such as:What is it like to be a bat?,What are we actually seeing?,What is it like to be an animal?,Could a machine be conscious?, What are the neural correlates of consciousness?, How do we distinguish between reality and imagination?, and, finally, How are Buddhism and consciousness related?All the key players involved in the study of consciousness such as Renes Descartes, David Chalmers, Patricia Churchland, Daniel Dennett, Alan Turing,Francis Crick, Roger Penrose, John Eccles, etc. are found in this wonderful book.Each chapter contains profiles, concepts, activities, and practices,and readings. The references are excellent. And Ms. Blackmore writes in clear, concise prose.If you have ever wondered what consciousness may be, then this is the book for you whether you plan to use it for a college course or simply read it yourself. This is a great and fun read! Don't delay; buy a copy today and the price is right!!!"},{"Title":"Consciousness: An Introduction","review":"Don't kid yourself. Reading this book will be a lot of hard work, as each chapter takes a lot of thinking and reflecting.But is also lots of fun. And Susan Blackmoreguides you through the subject with plenty of good and precise insights. So, it is well worth the effort.Some chapters I would have liked longer and more in depth, while some could have been shortened considerable in my view. However, with a subject matter that has kept the best thinkers on the planet busy for at least the last two millennia - I guess you shouldn't be surprised that readers might disagree on the weight certain issues are given in this book.Nevertheless, as far as I can tell, consciousnessgets covered from all the angles you would expect from such a book. From neurology and biology to philosophy and onwards to artificial intelligence. Certainly, I don't feel that there is anything missing in Blackmores introduction to the subject of consciousness.Like other readers I feel that it is far too early for the construction and reinforcement of any orthodoxy or dogma in the field of consciousness (Except of course that I think we should keep the loony stuff out - and there I go, on my way to my own definitions of good and bad).And I do enjoy Dennett as much as the next guy - but from time to time in the book you have the feeling that Dennett is \\"truth\\", while the author feels free to deal a mortal blow or two to others, as being merely silly believers in the cartesian theatre model.Certainly I don't think e.g. Antonio Damasio is given fair deal in this book (as I consider his work really outstanding and far above any cartesian theatre illusions). Damasio is also more in line with what I think might be the truth of the matter that Dennett. Blackmore has the bias the other way around. Or so it seems. But nevermind.Still, it is a brilliant and enlightening book.-Simon"},{"Title":"Consciousness: An Introduction","review":"I used this book for a philosophy class. Blackmore took ideas that could potentially be very confusing (especially to someone new to the philosophy and explanation of consciousness), and explained them in layman's terms...this book was written clearly and thoroughly. Consciousness: An Introduction was my saving grace in that philosophy class, through this book I was able not only to understand, but become interested in learning about consciousness."},{"Title":"Consciousness: An Introduction","review":"Really nothing great here as far as advancement or variety. Blackmore gives a straight up the line (biased in her favor and Dennets, note the HEAVY citing of their papers) history of consciousness research and theory. However, anyone other than the mainstream dennet followers are given a mention at best, and I was VERY surprised at the few pages she affords Chalmers. Of course, it gets preachy towards the end with Blackmore's Americanized buddhism, but overall is a good start for exploration. Aside from the heavy bias there are some cute cartoons. Seriously though, most of the research cited isn't current, challenges to Dennet and Blackmore herself dont exist in this book (or their reality) and really should be given to students with a grain of salt and a bit of surrounding information on some of the very brief topics (qualia? turing? ndes?). If we teach all students to think in this same mold we're probably going to get...more of the same! I suggest this text with supplementary readings and heavy elaboration for the suggested classroom use."},{"Title":"Consciousness: An Introduction","review":"Blackmore wrote a very important book, because it is the first \\"true\\" textbook on the subject. There are other texts, like Wallace's consciounsness and behaviour, and other collections, like Block et. al.s nature of consciousness, or Carters consciousness, but these could be described or used as textbooks without being textbooks per se. That is, Blackmore's book has the exercises, review questions, profiles of some important figures, that make it a real textbook. However, I am impressed more by the scope of the book. There are many different chapters on many differetn things, and the author does not forget about issues like parapsychology (Blackmore was once a psi researcher), time, animal consicousness, all issues that many other authors seem to leave aside.The book itself is very readable, and the strenghts,like the number of different chapters, come with weaknesses, like too brief discussions of certain very important, or central, themes. Blackmoere does succeed in giving a sense of the perplexities of studying consicousness to the reader. She is also a very apt philosopher, and explains philosophical ideas much more clearly that other non-philosophers do. She is also very common-sensical and does not fall for many of the traps laid on the field of consicousness studies, save, of-course, only one. The \\"illusion\\" trap. Let me explain.Everey time the discussion is about to climax, and the reader expects an insight, or maybe a conclusion, Blackmore seems to state that everything may just be an illusion. Visual perception? an illusion. Free will? an illusion. Binding? an illusion. qualia? an illusion. Now I do not believe that illusions do not exist, or that they cannot serve an explanatory role. Certainly, visual perception and free will might be illusions. Attentional blindeness studies, and Wegners or LIbets work suggest these possibilities. But why should perceptual binding be an illusion? it is a fairly simple conceptual question, it is empirical and many empirical studies, like the synchrony or attention- models, seem to offer not so mysterian answers. The thing is, I believe, that Blackmore got caught in the intuition pumps created by none other than Daniel Dennett, the philosopher who by the way is most quoted, discussed and brought to bear on every question posed in the book.Blackmore seems to believe not only that there is no cartesian theather, a place where all consicousness comes together, (which is right), but that it is impossible that consicousness could be located anywhere at all. If this is so, she is wrong. Consciousness is in the brain. How, why, at what time, we still do not know. But if we can locate consicousness in a brain, why not several brain areas? we can just discard those that seem not essential for consciousness, in lesion experiments, for exapmple. Why not just couple of brain areas? now, it may not be that simple, maybe consicousness does not reside or happen at a time, maybe its just identical with those brain a reas. Why the big fuss about consicousness and everything about it as an illusion? Because Dennett is probably the most convincing philosopher, and Blackmore was convinced.How about qualia. An illusion, Blackmore tells us. It only seems there are qualia, but there are not. The thing is, qualia ARE that seeming, and it is that seeming that needs explaining. Qualia are real, and that anything seems like anything at all is a proof of their existence. What exactly they are, I do not know. But they are not just illusions. AS if their being so would solve anything anyway.Blackmore also got too carried daway with drawing lines. Either you are a physicalist, a functionalist, or a dualist. She also knows how to determine that. Either you believe in zombies, or not. This is by far the most simplistic analysis of the philosophical quarrels I have read lately. This is not to say she does not make some important points, however. Philosophers, nevertheless, would have a field trip in reviewing this book. Scientists woould be angered by her mysterianism and pessimism. Maybe this makes this book perfect for non-specialists.This is all too negative. The book is very, very good and complete. It covers many, many important issues. It has an extensive bibliography, although extensive is not enough with such a complicatted subject. It is trully the first textbook, and is very accesible. For the same reason, it ends up being quite superficial at times. It is all good for the undergraduate taking a course, but the really interested reader should only see this book as a good place to start. Those familiar with the field could do without reading it, but they should anyway. Blackmore does deserve her name among those considered experts on the field."},{"Title":"Consciousness: An Introduction","review":"Indeed this is, as the subtitle says, an introduction to the many topics related to consciousness. Within, the reader will find sections on attention, theories of self, agency & free will, evolution of consciousness and its function, artificial consciousness, neuroscience of consciousness, the unconscious, altered consciousness (including sleep/dreams, drugs, hypnosis), meditation, and more.With clarity that textbook-style volumes usually lack, Susan Blackmore begins by posing the fundamental problems of consciousness to the reader and asking us to genuinely reflect on this idea of \\"my consciousness\\" that, perhaps until now, we've never truly investigated very deeply. Blackmore goes on to introduce us to the many issues and problems related to the study of consciousness, and how many great thinkers have attempted to solve them. Of course, each approach has its merits and failures and Blackmore attempts to address them each on their own grounds. Whether she succeeds or not may depend on who you ask, especially considering how deeply divided the proponents of various theories of consciousness are. I think the apparant bias in Dennett's favor (claimed by other reviewers) is probably real but, in defense of the author, a fair hearing of Dennett's theory does require considerable attention and I think she succeeds in giving it without implying its superiority.Throughout the book are many flashy graphics, illustrations, personal profiles, and \\"Concept\\" and \\"Activity\\" side-bars to help the reader (and potential instructor) along. Some were useful, but unfortunately others served to distract more than anything else. A book on conscious awareness shouldn't be cluttered with distractions! The only other issues I encountered had to do with a few vocab words thrown at the reader without clear initial explanation (e.g. \\"homunculus\\"), and also at least a couple times during Blackmore's descriptions of experiments I found it difficult to piece together exactly how the experimental set-up was supposed to work.These things aside, this book is a great introduction to those (like myself) not yet familiar with the consciousness debate and its major players. With such readability and the obvious enthusiasm of the author, it's hard to put down once you've picked it up. The meat of the book is in the first half where the major theories of consciousness and self are initially laid out, so if you don't have the stamina to see it all the way through you'll at least get the most important parts. The author encourages readers to begin at the beginning, but to feel free to skip to the sections that most interest them once they've read about the basic problem of consciousness.After reading this book, I feel like I have a broad enough base of knowledge that I can read much more in-depth studies and topics and still keep a larger perspective on the consciousness debate. Now I just need to choose which book to put on my list next!"},{"Title":"Consciousness: An Introduction","review":"I decided to order this book after reading an article from Susan Blackmore on the web.I am half way through the book.God, it is so good.Takes you through so different approaches to think about consciousness.I am a computer guy and don't know much about psychology, cognitive sciences... but Susan makes it very accessible and you get to learn about many different fields (philosophy, psychology, biology, computer science...)It's the only book I have read about the subject, so I don't know how it compares to others.But I found the book extremly clear, well divided and the layout is just great.Amazing job.If you are like me, you may have your opinions on consciousness, and you may wonder what other people that thought about it have to say.Then this book is for you."},{"Title":"Consciousness: An Introduction","review":"Susan Blackmore has written a textbook on \\"consciousness\\". Do not be put off, it is eminently suitable as a reference. A feature is the extensive bibliography at the back. Blackmore is a determinist but freely discusses the work of other researchers who do not share her viewpoint.For anyone seriously wanting to come to grips with the latest ideas in human consciousness, this book is invaluable."},{"Title":"Consciousness: An Introduction","review":"I am not a student and wanted to read a somewhat in-depth overview of consciousness. I am very disappointed by this book, despite liking the author's book The Meme Machine.The book contains large sections on ESP, out-of-body experiences, etc. This shows the book's target audience; undergraduate students presumably like this cool stuff. The book is full of boxes and pictures that are there presumably to make the text easier to read. This is in itself a signal (not proof) that the text itself has been dumbed down as well.Many classic experiements are described (this is good), but not in a very satisfactory way. For instance Libet on arm flexing and free will. However, there are no conclusions. I would for instance like to know what the majority of researcher think about the issues today. If they fall into two camps, fine, just describe the current status. Instead the author describes some follow-up experiments but she gets too hooked on describing them rather than mention their theoretical significance for advance our theory of consciousness. And then she ends and moves on to another topic.In a way the book is easy to read, but it is harder to feel that one has understood anything after reading. It is like reading Nietzsche; easy to read, but to understand is another matter. But I suppose the similarities end there."},{"Title":"Consciousness: An Introduction","review":"Shortly after read THE MEME MACHINE, I had a dream in which I was arguing with Susan Blackmore about her denial of the existence of a self. She told me that I had just misunderstood her. Though quite sure that I had not misunderstood her, from past experience I know that my unconscious is aware of more things than I am, it seemed a good idea to further examine her ideas. Though an excellent book, this review will concentrate upon those parts with which I disagree, since those were the part that forced me to think more deeply about my own bias.Susan Blackmore presents the strictly materialist view of consciousness. In other words, she believes that the self, free will, and consciousness are all illusions. To say that something is an illusion is not to deny that it exists, but that it is something quite different than it appears to be. Some years ago while working in a hay field after dark, my friends and I saw several rabbits jumping around near a hay bale. When we got closer, we saw that these rabbits were just paper beings rustled by the breeze. The paper really existed; the rabbits did not. As I understand SB, consciousness is more like papers blowing in the wind than real rabbits. This conclusion necessarily follows from SB's assumption that it has already been proven that consciousness is a product of blind evolution.SB points out that \\"the underlying molecular processes are usually assumed to be deterministic, so this is one reason why there appears to be no room for free will.\\" Quantum effects cause indeterminacy, but these infinitesimal effects merely provide for a range of similar, random outcomes rather than drastically altering the possible outcomes. This is also necessarily true for molecules functioning in the evolutionary process. It is a truism that life and human consciousness can only exist because molecules have to potential to form them. Blind evolution insists that this potential is accidental rather than intrinsic. Dennett's evolutionary algorithm - \\"If you have variation, selection, and heredity, you must get evolution\\" - glosses over the fact that for life to have formed there had to have been hundreds of molecules, each with a complex, highly specific structure, working together to capture and extract energy, replicate, and protect themselves. These molecules had to do these things because the Second Law of Thermodynamics dictates that they must assume the most stable, lowest-energy confirmation available. Why more reasonable to assume that these molecules did this by mere chance than to assume that life and consciousness are innate qualities of existence? We might assume, as many intelligent people do, that these qualities were put in the molecules by God, but explaining the existence of complexity by assuming that it was created by something infinitely more complex answers nothing. It is more reasonable to assume that life and consciousness exist in primordial form in non-living matter. If this is true, then evolution is not a consequence of selfish genes being by haphazardous gamma bombardment and fighting amongst themselves by survival of the fittest; genes are naturally self-mutating and survival of the fittest is merely the rule life must follow as it naturally progresses towards a level of complexity capable of self-reflective intelligence. This is the possibility that SB either completely ignores or derisively dismisses as \\"magic.\\" The actual evidence is no better for accidental than intrinsic consciousness, and the latter assumption has the virtue of being optimistic. We are not required to imagine gene machines at odds with their constituent molecules, as Dawkins does, or that consciousness might actually be harmful, as SB does.If consciousness exists in its own right, then asking what consciousness is for is meaningless. Consciousness just is. Matter is so that consciousness can organize itself into life and intelligence. SB quotes Searle's statement, \\"brains cause minds.\\" True, but consciousness causes brains. Therein lies the conundrum of human existence, because brains, as SB tells us, function essentially as \\"mindless\\" meme machines. Meme machines form \\"selfplexes,\\" arbitrary identities forged by whatever environment we happen to be in. One brain can even form multiple selfplexes. If our minds are cut off from the primordial consciousness that is the center of our being, our sense of self is indeed delusional, with only delusional free will, and with a pronounced tendency to ideology addiction. In SB's world, our being has no center, so there can be no true self.According to Carl Jung, the main human task is to undergo the individuation process in order to realize the higher self. SB dismisses Jung's theories as frustratingly untestable, though this complain is equally true of her meme theory, and of Buddha's (SB is a Buddhist) notion that one can awaken to the fact that there is no self through meditation. I was surprised to discover that Buddha denied the existence of self. Jung favored Buddhism above all other religion, yet the doctrine of no self clearly contradicts Jung's notion of the higher self. However, this is really only so if Buddha was a materialist. If Buddha was not a materialist, it is surely misleading to call him a \\"bundle theorist,\\" as SB does. What could it mean for a bundle of sensations to achieve enlightenment? There is no self beneath the delusional self to be free of delusion. SB quotes Wren-Lewis: \\"it is no longer the 60-year-old John who looks out at the world, but the shining dark infinite void that in some extraordinary way is also \`I.'\\" D. T. Suzuki says, \\"Absolute faith is placed in a man's own inner being.\\" These two men, at least, seem to experience a self beneath the delusions. However, when we once start giving this pure sense of \\"I\\" names such as \\"divine self,\\" and claiming that Christ is a symbol of this higher self, we will most likely delude ourselves with memetic jargon. So if Buddha was not a materialist, I think I understand what he was getting at. Since SB is a materialist, I understand but disagree with what she is getting at.(Peter Payne, author of CAPTAIN CALIFORNIA: A YOUNG MAN'S ENCOUNTER WITH THE EVIL WITHIN HIMSELF)"},{"Title":"Consciousness: An Introduction","review":"Blackmore provides a readable, comprehensive introduction to the field.

This is just about the most dangerous place anyone can walk. Significantly, Meegan sees this walk as an obsession, and his worst experiences were not near the slums and impoverished shanty towns that he passed throughout Latin America, but right here in the U.S.A. Gun-crazed, car-crazed, and arrogant, Americans almost managed to bump him off. Canadians were not as much a threat, but they were not at all very helpful either. You might think that impoverished Latinos would be a big threat, particularly in places like Guatemala or Nicaragua (this was in the 1980's, when many of these countries had revolutions and death-squads), but you would be wrong. The impoverished \\"Indians\\" who he passed daily in Latin America treated him with understanding and respect. They almost always took him into their hovels and gave him food and drink. In contrast to his descriptions from Latin America, the miles he spent along the roadside in North America are just briefly noted. Things only come alive again when Meegan relates his experiences with the Native Peoples of the Yukon and Alaska-these pages sparkle. This is not just an adventure tale-it is also a great love story, since Meegan embarks on this journey with his Japanese girlfriend Yoshika-who he subsequently marries. They have a great romance, and Meegan manages to father two children. If you love romances, this story will lift your spirits.

This 1988 volume gathers 25 of his short stories, nearly all of them pips.\\"Haircut\\" may be his most anthologized tale; while \\"Champion\\" and \\"Alibi Ike\\", presenting Lardner at his darkest and lightest, both became successful movies with Kirk Douglas and Joe E. Brown, respectively. But its only by reading a book like this that one gets a true feeling for the breadth of Lardner's genius, how he successfully mimics a multitude of narrative voices (nearly all these tales are written in the first-person) and takes just as long as he needs to make his point.Take the jaded society girl of \\"I Can't Breathe\\", writing letters to a friend while she successively throws over a variety of suitors with hilarious insensitivity: \\"He asked me if I didn't love him more than anybody else and I said yes, but only because I thought he had probably had too much to drink and wouldn't remember it anyway and the best thing to do was humor him under the circumstances.\\"Or the separated husband of \\"Ex Parte\\", writing a letter to be read after his death: \\"Most always when a man leaves his wife, there's no excuse in the world for him. She may have made whoop-whoop-whoopee with the whole ten commandments, but if he shows his disapproval to the extent of walking out on her, he will thereafter be a total stranger to all his friends excepting the two or three bums who will tour the night clubs with him so long as he sticks to his habits of paying for everything.\\"Lardner often wrote of sports, and in a comedic vein, both of which make him entertaining to read and regarded way too lightly. Even a story as clever and funny as \\"The Mayville Minstrel\\", about a fellow who writes terrible poetry and becomes convinced by a wiseguy traveling salesman he could be up there with Walt Whitman, carries a powerful sting. The dupe realizes he's been fooled, and thinks for a moment of getting even. Then Lardner hits you with a killer last line: \\"But even as he spoke, Stephen realized there was nothing he could do about it.\\"Lardner may read as bitterly as another sardonic American author mistaken for a humorist, Mark Twain, but unlike Twain there is always a humane side to Lardner that makes his work singular and compelling. The rich may abuse the poor with willful ease, but they also suffer their children's neglect in \\"Old Folks' Christmas\\" and offer comic relief in \\"Mr. Frisbee\\", about a chauffeur who manipulates his employer through golf. Lardner's sentimental streak pokes through in \\"There Are Smiles\\", about a traffic cop smitten with a wild driver, and \\"Harmony\\", about a baseball player who wants to sing.Baseball is a subject in several of these stories, like \\"Alibi Ike\\" and \\"Harmony\\". [It was also the subject of Lardner's best-known novel, \\"You Know Me Al\\".] Reading this after Lawrence Ritter's \\"The Glory Of Their Times\\" helped me a lot; I was able to recognize many of the baseball names Lardner drops, like Mac and Matty and Charles Faust. My favorite of these, \\"Horseshoes\\", introduces us to a World Series hero who tells a writer he punched out a member of the losing team after the last game, and he'll buy the drinks if the writer doesn't think him justified. With a build up like that, you know Lardner will deliver the goods, and he does, in a brutally funny way that reads as fresh today as the day it came out of his typewriter.Lardner was a product of his times, the 1920s, and people will find the occasional instances of political incorrectness. It's the price Lardner pays for riding his fictional subjects so close to the bone, in all their ugly humanity. As with Twain's \\"Huckleberry Finn\\" they present not meanness on Lardner's part but valid social comment.Reading Lardner short stories makes one realize how rare the classic short story has become. So many of these tightly-written pieces are like the tips of vast icebergs, just hinting at complexities beneath. Economy, verve, humor, Lardner had it all. This book represents an artist, masquerading as a craftsman, working at his stunning best."},{"Title":"The Waterman's Song: Slavery and Freedom in Maritime North Carolina (Default)","review":"This is the best book about slavery I have ever read. Cecelski is one of the most eloquent historians writing today. Because he focuses on the shifting shoreline (literal and figurative) between slavery and freedom, this book uncovers fascinating insights about the ways African Americans navigated the treacherous shoals of slavery, Emancipation, and Reconstruction. Although he does not slight the horrors of slavery--read the chapter on canal digging--Cecelski shows how African Americans used their skills and understanding to best advantage, and how they created a vibrant culture of homegrown abolitionism and helped win the Civil War in eastern North Carolina, too. The research is incredible and the writing is beautiful. The author's mastery as a storyteller shines best in his tale of Abraham Galloway, the runaway slave, Union spy, state legislator, and daring rebel whose unbridled life defies every conventional wisdom about slavery and Reconstruction--this chapter should be a Hollywood movie.

This book seeks to justify religion by pointing out some of the problems with atheism. But none of these supposed problems need be solved by religion. For example, one can behave morally and ethically based on logic without belief in a supernatural being; the Golden Rule, (Do unto others ...), to take one example, makes plain good sense, was originated in both secular and religious contexts, and does not require one to flatter a particular deity in exchange for promises of immortality. Furthermore, religious beliefs have led to far more immoral and unethical behavior than atheism. Similarly, the \\"despair\\" of the atheist (as exemplefied supposedly by Niezche & Russell) as cited by Zacharias often is taken out of context from \\"convinced\\" atheists who grapple with the question of mortality. I personally think that not having to worry about eternity and the shape of my \\"soul\\" is a tremendously liberating and comforting. But Zacharias seems to suggest that I should be terrified and full of despair--\\"proof\\" that atheism is a bad thing.

This book \\"The Real Face of Atheism\\" is actually a slightly updated version of his 1990 book titled \\"A Shattered Visage: The Real Face of Atheism\\".I do not consider this to be Ravi's crowning work but he did not write it to be an \\"exhaustive\\" argument against Atheism.In his original introduction he explains his intention for this book---It was born from a presentation to a group of scientists from Bell Labs. He addressed the topic of \\"Why I am not an Atheist\\" as a response to Bertrand Russel's \\"Why I am not a Christian\\".Zacharias goes on to say that the questions that followed were not technical or scientific but rather were \\"heart-searching questions of men and women in pursuit of meaning in life.\\" He wrote from a perspective dealing with his lecture and the questions of life that followed.Many reviewers have said that Ravi has not argued effectively against Atheism and for Theism.He gives a reason for that for those who care to read it---- \\"Others, who love the process of dialogue, might wish that the arguments were weightier than they are. My hope is that they will not fall into the trap of intellectualism and forget the splendor and power of simplicity. We are neither just brains floating around or hearts bouncing about.\\"Ravi Zacharias tends to dwell in the realm of bringing the highly philosophical down to the level of the more common reader. This is not always easy. A few here have pointed out that Ravi is not an effective debater. If you will listen to any of his question and answer sessions from various colleges and universities around the world and his lectures from the Harvard Veritas sessions you might think differently. His answers correlate well with his intended audience.Other works such as \\"Can Man Live With God\\" address this topic as well."},{"Title":"Real Face of Atheism, The","review":"I found this book to be rather helpful. I appreciate the author's flow of thought in making his case from the point of origins, morality, meaning, and destiny. That line of thought flowed nicely. Of course this book isn't exhaustive, but it was a great introduction to the philosophical problems of atheism, its contradictions, and its uphill struggle for real unifying meaing as a worldview.

This should be required reading for all atheists, but many would probably not want or try to understand much of it. The book spells out the hopelessness of atheism. Zacharias systematically examines atheistic positions on human nature, the meaning of life, the \\"first cause,\\" death and more."},{"Title":"Real Face of Atheism, The","review":"Ravi Zacharias has done an excellent job of tackling a huge subject in a manner which creates an enthusiasm for further reading. This book is very well written, with a huge index of quotes and citations from a wide variety of sources. The inclusion of countless viewpoints from across the philosophical spectrum makes for a very engaging and enjoyable read.The book is segmented into several areas of focus including values, morality, meaning, and more. In each chapter Ravi opens with some contrasting viewpoints that start a dialog about how the logical conclusions of atheism lead to some rather interesting and unavoidable realizations. Nietzsche, who is among the few to truly embrace the full conclusion of his beliefs, suffered tremendously as a result as his worldview neither answered nor solved the dilemma of a world without God. (Page 30). Aldous Huxley, another renowned atheist concluded \\"science has \\"explained\\" nothing\\". Darwin himself warned against \\"the presumption of believing that one could, by contemplating nature, be in possession of final truths, either in divinity or philosophy.\\" (Page 38). Yet with atheism, the natural determinism is all that is available to examine such meaning.Quite often, as Ravi discusses, an atheist often finds him or herself denouncing, yet embracing, a value system that they cannot uphold within their naturalistic worldview. Nietzsche understood this well and stated \\"When one gives up the Christian faith, one pulls the right to Christian morality out from under one's feet\\". Another famous atheist Bertrand Russell when in a debate on morality confessed the Achilles heel of atheism when he had to respond to the question of how one differentiates between good and bad, by stating he did so on the basis of his feelings. (Page 59) Ravi clarifies his position and the corner atheism paints itself into by stating \\"not all atheists are immoral, but morality as goodness cannot be justified with atheistic presuppositions\\" (Page 64).In hard terms the morality that atheism teaches, implies, or espouses is unlivable. Nietzsche himself bore testimony to that fact.What of the search for meaning and truth? The face of atheism reveals only the human intellect. G.K. Chesterton warned that the insane man is not just one who has lost his reason; he may be one who has lost everything but his reason. (Page 80). Bertrand Russell recounts with some accuracy that the inevitable conclusion of atheism's search for meaning is \\"only on the firm foundation of unyielding despair\\". (Page 91) After a long study of the many who have defined atheism, Ravi states that having in essence killed god, the atheist is left with no reason for being, no morality to espouse, no meaning to life, and no hope beyond the grave. Of what hope he or she may possess, it is does not exist within the framework of their worldview.In the end Ravi discusses the hope of faith. God has put enough into the world to make faith in him a most reasonable thing, and he has left enough out to make it impossible to live by sheer reason or observation alone. (Page 113). G.K. Chesterton responds to critics of Christianity by saying \\"The problem with Christianity is not that it has been tried and found wanting, but that it has been found difficult, and left untried.\\" (Page 117). The atheist risks everything for the present and the future, on the basis of belief that we are uncaused by any intelligent being. We just happen to be here. That one is willing to live and die in that belief is a very high price to pay for conjecture. (Page 155).Overall, this is a wonderful exploration of philosophy, ideology and meaning. There are quotes, citations and input from far too many people to count, and I finished the book with a long reading list for follow up. If you are at all curious about the core differences between atheism and faith, then consider this a great place to get a quick overview."},{"Title":"Real Face of Atheism, The","review":"I confess up front that I have not read this book. In the process of deciding whether or not I should, I do what I always do - read the reviews, from 5 stars to 1, and decide if my interest has been piqued enough to purchase.I can't resist commenting here. I haven't yet read all the reviews, but so far I have not encountered a single 1 star review of this book without mentally recoiling from the vituperation of the reviewer. Had already confirmed Christians given the book 1 star, for reasons of poor readability, sloppy organization, badly researched facts, etc., I would have concluded that perhaps my money would be better spent elsewhere. If those who honestly disagreed with the author's point of view had suggested that better books were available to start a productive dialogue about this important topic, I would have listened with respect. But the reality seems to be that those who are sniping against the book do so because they have an entrenched atheistic world-view that prevents them from honestly considering whether the information in this book is valid or worth genuinely debating. They do not present counter-arguments against the author's logic, or intelligently explain the reasons they believe the book is uninteresting or incorrect; they simply want to bash the author himself, along with his conclusions, because it runs counter to their own cherished dislike of any religious belief.All of you reviewers who have made your bias painfully evident in your poorly thought out comments do more to convince the potential buyer to get this book, if only to hope it teaches them how to skewer the hate-addled logic of people just like you. If we can truly know a man by his enemies, then Ravi Zacharias is an author with whom I should probably become more familiar. This may be the only case when I was persuaded to purchase a book with so many 1 star reviews due predominantly to that fact alone."},{"Title":"Real Face of Atheism, The","review":"As Zacharias indicates in the preface to the book, The Real Face of Atheism touches on -- but doesn't go too deep into -- the various philosophical underpinnings for these opposing worldviews. It is a well written, easy to read and understand, informative and even enjoyable book. Zacharias does a pretty good job of highlighted the weaknesses of atheism from various angles.In spots, he seems to gloss over some of their arguments, in something of a dismissive fashion. But part of that appears to be because the book was not intended to delve deep into any one particular argument or topic. Think of The Real Face of Atheism as a primer or introductory work.If you're looking for answers to some of man's deepest questions, it's a good starting point. Zacharias cites scores of sources, so if you want further study, just look in his notes/bibliography. He makes abundantly clear those minds whose work he most admires (e.g. Muggeridge, C. S. Lewis) and those with whom he most strongly disagrees (e.g. Nietzsche, Russell.) He leaves it to the reader to make up his or her mind."},{"Title":"Real Face of Atheism, The","review":"Ravi is such an elegant writer, a real pleasure to read. This book does a great job of revealing the underpinnings of an atheistic worldview. Well done, Ravi."},{"Title":"Real Face of Atheism, The","review":"Although there seem to be several people quite dissatisfied with the book, I found it to be a good compendium containing the logical consequences of atheism. I do however, agree that it seemed to be poorly organized and lacking in an overall smooth, structural flow. But that would really be my only criticism. Otherwise, Ravi speaks on the logical consequences of atheism, quoting many philosophers who embraced such logical conclusions like Nietzsche and Sartre. This book has many of those same ideas written down. In fact, it reads very much like he speaks. If you enjoy his lectures, you are sure to enjoy this book.The purpose of the book is to discuss the logical consequences of atheism, to develop a logical atheistic worldview. In that sense, it argues a reductio ad absurdum against atheism; that is, that if atheism is taken to its logical conclusions, it is not something that is livable. One thing in particular that I learned was the proper understanding of the so-called \\"Pascal's wager.\\" Ravi says that Pascal argued that if there is no God, then one must live in a way that \\"works\\" for them. The atheist does this, of course. But so does the Christian, because Christianity \\"works\\" for him, and in the end, both he and the atheist have had a meaningful life (whatever that means). However, if there is a God, then the Christian will have lived a life that \\"works\\" eternally but the atheist will have not. That's a real brief summary, but it points out the distinction between how Pascal's Wager is normally understood, and what he was actually saying. It was interesting, if for no other reason than a historical curiosity.All in all, a short and easy beginning level read, but a good one to start to see the many problems with a logical atheistic worldview."},{"Title":"Real Face of Atheism, The","review":"Ravi Zacharias was born in India in 1946 and educated at Cambridge University in Romance literatures. He then moved to Canada, where he eventually switched from a career in business to one dealing with religious matters.He has a master of divinity degree from Trinity International University in Deerfield, Illinois. After earning this degree he founded Ravi Zacharias International Ministries. He rapidly became a popular radio personality and dramatic preacher.The Real Face of Atheism is a revised and updated version of A Shattered Visage: The Real Face of Atheism, which was originally published by Baker Books in 1990 and then later reissued in cloth and paper.It was the original version of this book with which he began his literary career.He does not offer a history of atheism or describe its various varieties, nor does he provide an explanation of its social, political, and intellectual roots. He does not set out the arguments employed by atheists.Instead, he defends the notion that there is a Christian worldview consisting of, among other things, arguments demonstrating the reality of God and hence furnishing the ground of faith. This worldview provides an emotionally satisfying explanation of nature and history, as well as insuring a sense of meaning, which cannot be done without this worldview.Zacharias thus provides a homily in support of a worldview rather than a carefully set out argument demonstrating the reality of God. This is a book for believers and not for atheists."},{"Title":"Real Face of Atheism, The","review":"Zacharias' poorly organised arguments never really address the core logic of atheism but rather attacks atheists for, at worst, imagined agendas, and at best for not taking the Pascalian wager (that it's better to gamble on God's existence than otherwise), arguments which were much better placed forward by Blaise Pascal himself.Modern theists of the foundationalist sort (as opposed to Catholic theologians, most of whom are better debaters) never really get to the heart of the debate, i.e., the logical critique of theism. Contemporary arguments for the existence of God like these are more deeply flawed than in ancient times (when the absence of scientific knowledge made it more difficult to debate). The postulated existence of a supreme being, for example, has empirically verifiable consequences that are never borne out.RZ never anticipates atheistic rebuttals to theistic speculation, further exposing his impotence as a debater. I was hoping he might at least propose some answers to the 2300-year-old riddle of Epicurus: \\"Is God willing to prevent evil, but not able? Then he is not omnipotent. Is he able, but not willing? Then he is malevolent. Is he both able and willing? Then whence cometh evil? Is he neither able nor willing? Then why call him God?\\"Virtually every one of God's supposed attributes (omniscience, omnipotence, omnipresence, omnibenevolence) when considered in conjunction, show his alleged existence to be self-contradictory and thus makes the existence of a supreme being not only improbable (given evidential considerations), but rather impossible (given logical considerations)."},{"Title":"Real Face of Atheism, The","review":"The author isn't interested in examining atheism, merely attacking it.

It simply isnt so.For one, there are many more types of atheism than \\"eastern mysticism\\" and \\"american cynicism\\".For another, an atheist will clearly tell you that it's quite the contrary; the awe and joy of seeing your children grow, or the wonder of a sunshine are basic human experiences - and they're not improved by wrapping them into dusty theories about vengeful deities brimming with rules that your kids must follow or feathered serpents that cause the sun to rise. Far from it; the sheer joy and beauty of such experiences is dulled and trivialized by filtering them through the lens of whatever crackpot theories you elect to see them through.The book then goes on from there to claim that unless you filter how you experience life through some rigid set of unlikely theories (whether that happens to be Islam, hare krishna or, in his particular choice, intolerant christianity) there is nothing but angst and despair for you.The rest of the book follows very much along the same lines, whether it's recycling silly old arguments (the prime unmoved mover and such) or adding the authors own spin on them.Overall, I'd say the book is entirely worthless, unless you already believe this stuff and yearn for proclamations that anyone who doesnt is having a terrible time and suffering lots.

The book is tremendously disorganized and reads more like someone who is just throwing thoughts together and complaining on a superficial level how atheism is bankrupt. Atheism is bankrupt, but that does ot mean that it is inherently wrong (which it is).2. Ravi's use of science is well- pitiful. He did not effectively show how the second law of thermodynamics prevents molecules from self assembling.3. Ravi's thoughts were convoluted and he seemed to skip from one subject to another. To me, it was as if he were sitting on a plane and talking into a record. It may sound impressive live, but was terribly unimpressive in written form.4. Just showing how post modernists helped destroy and reek havoc on the world is fine, but what was the point? More importantly, what is the solution?

As a result I will probable not end up finishing the rest of the book or any other book Ravi Zacharias writes. If I am going to give Christianity a chance I am not going to trust in a intellectually dishonest person such as Zacharias.

This morality is by no means self-evident: this point has to be exhibited again and again, despite the English flatheads. Christianity is a system, a whole view of things though out together. By breaking one main concept out of it, the faith in God, one breaks the whole: nothing necessary remains in one's hands. Christianity presupposes that mans does not know, cannot know, what is good for him, what evil: he believes in God, who alone knows it. Christian morality is a command; its origin is transcendent; it is beyond all criticism, all right to criticism; it has truth only if God is the truth--it stands and falls with faith in God.As you can see Zacharias has grossly distorted the truth of what Nietzsche was trying to communicate. Shame on you Mr Zacharias! I am one atheist that you have made more staunch in my atheism. If Christianity makes one more moral you have shown that to be a lie.

The only remaining argument for the existence of the supernatural is FAITH that unicorns and God exist.From what I've read about atheism, this philosophical stance does not espouse any particular moral system anymore than the belief in God espouses a specific moral system. If a person claims that the supernatural (or God) exists, then that person has to choose a moral system such as Christianity, Buddhism, Islam and so forth (and a particular sect within that religion). If a person claims that the supernatural does not exist (atheism), then that person must pick or develop a moral system. Examples of secular (without God) moral systems are as follows: (a) secular humanism; (b) the philosophies of Peter Singer, Bertrand Russell, or John Dewey; (c) the morality of your family or community if these people are secular and (d) so forth."},{"Title":"Real Face of Atheism, The","review":"There is a mountain of evidence based on research and studies done over nearly sixty years that demonstrates that Christians are more likely to be incarcerated, more likely to suffer from depression and other mental disorders, and more likely to commit suicide than nonbelievers -- and, btw, atheists have a lower divorce rate than Christians. The premise of this book, that atheist life is a \\"life of despair\\" and Christians live a spectacular life just because they are Christians is pure nonsense. This book exemplifies Christianity in that it vehemently dismisses, out of hand, anything that doesn't suit the authors preconditioned beliefs, regardless of the mountain of cold hard verifiable facts and verifiable evidence to the contrary. This book is a perfect example of intellectual dishonesty at its worst. Christianity is a failed mythology that serves no purpose other than to justify un-necessary wars, make people FEEL important and superior, and help unscrupulous people make lots of money."},{"Title":"Real Face of Atheism, The","review":"I have read 4 of Ravi's books now, and the primary argument of each one is that an atheist has no basis upon which to judge good or bad.I am no expert on the subject, but my analysis is that Plato adequately debunks this notion. All of the dialogues deal with an abstract quality that humans can intuitively disguinsh. For instance if two people are running, one can intuitively know that one person runs faster or better than the other person.This is the Greek notion of 'arete' or excellence. 'Good' to an ancient Greek was a person who possessed more of these abstract qualities from strength, speed, endurance, skill in a craft, compassion, humor and so on. A person can make moralistic evaluations based on what leads to more arete, each one being knowable to man through observation and reason.A circumspect person realizes that being excellent at making money is counterbalanced by being excellent at showing compassion and thus any argument that atheism has no basis for rejecting selfish or destructive behavior seems deeply flawed to me.An atheist that uses relativism to justify instantaneous gratification is as off base as a Christian who used the Bible to justify something like the Inquisition.Ravi can see this distinction in the Christian but fails to see this distinction in the atheist.I give Ravi's books 3 stars for his ability to make you think, but he continues to misunderstand the ancient Greeks. Other reviewers have noted that Ravi tends to tear down opposing arguments without making much of a positive argument for theism. Couple this with his incomplete view of the opposing argument, which is understandable for an apologist, and Ravi's conclusion doesn't have much left to stand on.I would offer Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance by Robert Pirsig as an entertaining overview on the ancient Greek notion of quality as an alternative point of view.Nietzsche's Beyond Good and Evil gives examples of how Christianity inverts the value system of the ancient Greeks in a few places and I think some of the tensions within Christianity today are the result of these inversions. For instance, is it OK to be strong, rich and successful if it is the meek, poor and persecuted that are the blessed ones in the sermon on the mount?"},{"Title":"Real Face of Atheism, The","review":"\\"It is far better to debate a question before settling it than to settle a question before debating it. While the process does not always guarantee an inerrant conclusion, it often protects against vacuous leaps from ignorance to ignorance.\\" (p105)One might say that a relatively small portion of Zacharias' book is actually apologetics proper. The treatment of the cosmological argument is cursory. That argument has been well enough presented by many others, beginning perhaps with Aristotle. The design argument is sketchily treated in a discussion of the second law of thermodynamics. His argument here will beg criticism, not that it is strictly invalid (it is not), but the atheist has an even larger philosophical stake in arguing for \\"the optimistic arrow of time\\" (evolutionary 'ascent') than the theist has in pointing to the ubiquity of \\"the pessimistic arrow of time\\" (the laws of entropy). After all, a world in which biological life would succeed in spite of the hardest law of the universe would have to be a strikingly \\"fine tuned\\" world! On this issue, it would be awfully tough, if not impossible, for atheism to find a winning move, however, it will of necessity attack Zacharias' underdeveloped argument here. The discussion on this point should have been further developed (perhaps referencing the work of the agnostic physicist and mathematical geneticist, Hubert Yockey, for example) or else omitted. As Yockey has rightly pointed out, it is disingenuous for philosophical materialists to dogmatically argue would-be \\"science\\" on points on which we should all honestly admit ignorance. In other words, there are better ways to argue for, and/or against, Design. It is probably the case that Zacharias did not treat the cosmological and design arguments more strongly than he did because they are not a critical part of his thesis in The Real Face of Atheism.The moral argument, however, along with the widely assumed concept of 'rightness', emerges necessarily whenever examining atheistic judgments. The essential thesis here contrasts the final implications of the two opposing worldviews: the inherent hope and meaningfulness of the theistic worldview, the inescapable meaninglessness of the atheistic view. Zacharias states that few who insist on a Godless world have acknowledged, or even understood, the logical conclusions of such a view -- the absence of basis for epistemological and ethical judgments and the absolute futility of human consciousness itself.\\"Sisyphus and Solomon came to the same deduction, born out of their experience: monotony finds no relief in adding variety or changing our attitude about it. Activity does not create meaning; it is the other way around. If life in its existential expression has no meaning, then a change of attitude does not change the reality of meaninglessness.\\" (p77)One of the few \\"morticians of the Absolute\\" to recognize bluntly the pointlessness of the human condition in a Godless cosmos, was Nietzsche, who understandably sank into depression and never recovered mental health. And here is the general argument of the book -- contrasting the concluding implications of the theistic worldview/philosophy with that of atheism. Either there is an external Absolute guarantor (however mysterious this may be), or we drift hopelessly in (logically self-contradictory) 'absolute relativism'.The two appendices might be better seen as the concluding chapters, they are not unimportant. They argue that a worldview must be reasoned toward -- rather than inherited or accepted because it is easy or \\"feels good\\" -- and must be more coherent, consistent and defensible than contending views. It must be strong on many points, with an eye always toward explanation rather than existentialist default. This will mean acquainting oneself with opposing ideas and arguments. In this vein, the reader would do well to examine two books by James W. Sire: Habits of the Mind, and The Universe Next Door. In spite of a few weak points, which are a bit peripheral to the main thesis, and the fact that it could easily have been much longer (more thorough-going), this book is a fairly good analysis of the psychological, ethical, and epistemological 'cost' (i.e., \\"real face\\") of atheism."},{"Title":"Real Face of Atheism, The","review":"Some have expressed disappointment that Zacharias did not attempt to prove the existence of God, when, as the title plainly shows, he was seeking to show what a purely atheistic world would look like. The main points I picked out of his book are that there can be no good or morality if there is no standard of good or morality with which to compare, that there is no hope or purpose to life without God since death's the final word, and that a lifestyle based on the evolutionary idea of natural selection allows humanity to commit astonishingly immoral (I'm allowed to use the word since I believe in God) acts. In this, Zacharias does a brilliant job. I've read stacks of philosophy books both Christian and not, with all kinds of different schemes to create morality and purpose without God, and Zacharias managed to provide surprisingly intelligent information that cut to the core of what I formerly considered sensible atheistic philosophies.And to the Epicurus dilemma, if you really want to find a sensible answer you can. In my opinion, it's quite a waste of time to ask questions for the sake of asking them without really wanting to know an answer.And yes, people have done bad things in the name of the Bible, but another important point that Zacharias brings up is that their actions were in direct contradiction with the teaching and method of the Bible, whereas people like Hitler and Stalin were acting out the direct conclusion of Darwinism in their quests to eradicate the world of the weak and inferior.The point of the book is that theism answers a lot of important questions that atheism cannot. The illustration Zacharias uses to describe the atheist's predicament is that atheism does a great job of smelling others' rotten eggs without producing any good eggs of its own. This book contains a wealth of eye-opening and well-connected information to anyone interested in the serious and relevant shortcomings of atheism."},{"Title":"Real Face of Atheism, The","review":"This book will probably do nothing for a smug and self-righteous atheist evangelist.But it may prove to be life-changing for a person who is honest enough to admit that he/she has an emptiness inside and needs a redeemer. Ravi's writing is born in love, and as the Bible proclaims: God is love."},{"Title":"Real Face of Atheism, The","review":"In the introduction, the author suggests that some readers might prefer to first read the two appendixes at the end. The first: The Finger Of Truth And The Fist Of Reality shows how philosophical ideas infiltrate popular culture and come into our lives. The second: The Establishment Of A Worldview, provides the conceptual foundation upon which the framework of truth will stand. They explain the process that the author used to examine various concepts in order to arrive at his conclusions.Part One deals with mankind as the measure of all things. In the chapter Morticians Of the Absolute, the author shows how determinism, Freud's views on religion and Darwinian theory have placed theism under severe pressure. The assault of atheism has become manifest in the political arena with totalitarian movements like communism and fascism. The author considers Nietzsche with his profound hatred of religion as the bridge between the 19th and 20th centuries, since he exerted a strong influence on Freud, Yeats, Jung and George Bernard Shaw, amongst others. A passage from The Madman is quoted here. There are illuminating comments by GK Chesterton and Malcolm Muggeridge quoted, to the effect that they foresaw that atheism would lead to violence and hedonism.The second chapter looks at the doctrine of atheism - the belief that there is no God, which is an affirmation of God's non-existence. The author refers to various thinkers like Mary Hesse, Jurgen Habermas, Stephen Jay Gould, John Polkinghorne and Sir Fred Hoyle and considers the 2nd law of thermodynamics by asking the question of how biological systems manage to swim against the entropic stream. It makes absolute sense that scientists ought to maintain a judicious agnosticism about the obvious limitations of human understanding.In chapter three: Virtue In Distress, the matters of purpose and morality are discussed. Zacharias demonstrates that the idea of being good has in popular culture been replaced by the idea of feeling good, in a twisting vortex of relativising. The traditional underpinnings of society have been ridiculed, which explains some of the present moral confusion. Very importantly, the author shows how secular philosophy cannot logically answer the question of how to determine right from wrong. Without God there is no starting point for ethical theorists. He provides interesting quotes from Alasdair MacIntyre (After Virtue) and from Paul Johnson (Intellectuals). In their own lives, many intellectuals separated their mental skills from their moral practices, for example Sartre, Hemingway and Bertrand Russell. Nietzsche's influence on Hitler is discussed and the author concludes that morality as goodness cannot be justified with atheistic presuppositions. In other words, atheism's morality is unlivable.The chapter: Sisyphus On A Roll deals with the issue of meaning and the problems of pleasure and pain. Here the author quotes from the lament of Voltaire, Solomon's Ecclesiastes and from Blaise Pascal, to show that without God there is no meaning. Only God can fill the emptiness within. The next chapter deals with death and quotes extensively from the book of Job. No hope exists in the naturalist universe. The shattered visage of atheism offers only the stare of death and a barren desert of despair. On the other hand, the book of Job offers hope in the response of God after all the questions, discussions and lamentations.Part Two is about God, the treasure of life's pursuits. Zacharias acknowledges that the Christian faith has suffered severely at the hands of both its defenders and detractors. He shows how its detractors have assaulted it and how many of its adherents have cheapened it or made it incomprehensible. The narrative then discusses the journey ofC S Lewisfrom atheism to Christianity. The author shows how the love of God stimulates a desire for studying the creation and concludes that Christ adds balance and detail to truth. Chapter seven: With Larger Eyes Than Ours, takes up the argument from design and demonstrates how the shackle of determinism is broken. Love precedes biological life and there is a moral nature to the universe. Chesterton, Lewis andDennis Pragerare some of the many authors quoted where it is explained how God puts things in perspective. The value of the individual and the meaning of relationships are also discussed here.Every chapter of the main text concludes with questions for study and discussion. The book concludes with copious notes arranged by chapter. The Real Face Of Atheism is rather more difficult and intellectual than the two other books of his that I have read: Light In The Shadow Of Jihad and Deliver Us From Evil. But it is still accessible because of the author's engaging writing style and the way that he integrates the thoughts and observations of so many other authors into the text. I highly recommend those aforementioned books plusSinisterism: Secular Religion of the Lieby Bruce Walker,Godless: The Church of Liberalismby Ann Coulter andLiberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaningby Jonah Goldberg. Two compelling books that shine a light on the fruits of atheism areMenace in Europe: Why the Continent's Crisis Is America's, Tooby Claire Berlinski andWhile Europe Sleptby Bruce Bawer."},{"Title":"Real Face of Atheism, The","review":"I can't put this book down. A wonderful book especially the chapter about recent decades of how we got to where we are as a society in 2013. RZ takes on: Friedrich Nietzsche, Darwin, Jean-Paul Sartre, etc. and tells the true story of how their worldview lead to their own demise and insanity in the end. Atheists are up in arms on Amazon bashing this book because it blows huge holes in their limited, narrow, and ultimately HOLLOW world view. They don't like being exposed! The same one star reviewers will praise Dawkins and Hitchens as gospel, take their reviews with a grain of salt. Atheists always think they're the smartest kids in the room, and RZ simplistically unravels their arrogant, poorly researched, and limited viewpoints. A key line from him was \\"we've educated ourselves into imbecility,\\" reading the 1 star reviews by persons who think they are so clever, illustrate his point beautifully. You want to really learn what Atheism is about?, read this book. The more educated you are about how limited and arrogant their worldview is, the better you can understand them and take pity on them. Any argument they give is easily disarmed and explained in simple easy to understand terms. I've come to the conclusion, there aren't really \\"Atheists\\" they are truly Pagans. They worship: The State, Climate Change, Celebrity, Abortion, Vegetarianism, Homosexual rights, Animal rights, and higher education. When they say they are without \\"beliefs or Gods,\\" that is a false statement, they do have many hardcore beliefs of the world they create around them."},{"Title":"Real Face of Atheism, The","review":"I really enjoy Dr. Zacharias's ability to communicate thoughts with careful articulation and aesthetic appeal. He's great ot listen to on the radio on Sunday mornings. And as I was reading this book, I observed that often, he takes a relatively simple idea and presents it with such flourish and zeal that it edns up seeming more profound than it really is. While this is certainly not a bad thing, and the church needs more people who can make basic truths and ideas more appealing to study and revisit, the price is paid in that this book is not as compelling an apologetic against atheism as it could have been.He didn't set out to make a technical refutation of atheism; rather, in this book, he's addressing what is, for many, at the heart of their embrace of it. It's very good in that context, but it doesn't have the same 'bite' that Geisler, Behe, etc. do. Still highly recommended, if only to work through the inevitably hopeless real-world implications that come with atheism."},{"Title":"Real Face of Atheism, The","review":"Atheists who hold that God does not exist, not only operate within their own system of faith, they do so with one that has many philosophical and practical contradictions. The Psalmist's words still ring wise and true: \\"A fool has said in his heart, \`There is no God'\\" (Ps 14:1). Ravi Zacharias does not just ask the all-important question, \\"Does God exist?\\" He asks, \\"Is atheism a sustainable belief?\\" The Real Face of Atheism is a revised edition of Ravi's first published book, A Shattered Visage (1993). Ravi is a popular evangelist and apologist for the Christian faith, and a master storyteller. This is evident in this book, which also makes Ravi's style is very readable. He is good at taking difficult concepts and, without dumbing them down, makes them simpler to understand. This book is borderline academic, but yet seems to me to be written in a way that makes it easier to grasp the logic of the Christian faith and the illogic of the atheist's belief system. The text, because of the numerous illustrations, stories, and quotes, is enjoyable to read and takes the edge off the difficult philosophical concepts needed in the discussion on God's non-existence. This book is a good first book for the Christian on the subject and is great to give to non-Christian friends, or someone who is still questioning God's existence. There is plenty of \\"preachable points\\" that can also enhance sermons and bible studies in order to arm congregations with reasonable answers to give when ask about the hope within us.

I was going to give this one a 4 star rating, but since other (non-)readers have unfairly trashed his rating with a 1 star rating (and hateful comments which say nothing specific about this particular book), I will give this book the benefit of the doubt, with a 5 star rating (which it does deserve in spirit, if not delivery), but I do have constructive criticism about this book.\\"Nothing, absolutely nothing, has a more direct bearing on the moral choices made by individuals or the purposes pursued by society than belief or disbelief in God.\\" (page 21).In this book, THE REAL FACE OF ATHEISM, Ravi teaches us many things about the intellectual history, concepts, and people who have championed the cause of the devil: Atheism! I always feel better about intellectually (not emotionally) debating the pros and cons of faith versus atheism after being exposed to Ravi's thoughts, and this book is no exception. It is a good book, but not a great book.This book gives a great overview of the famous people and major points made in the name of Atheism, as well as the individual and cultural ramifications of Atheism versus Faith, and Faith being defined exclusively, (and correctly) as JESUS CHRIST! Amen, that, Brother Ravi!Without a belief in God, then life becomes meaningless and people become more and more corrupt and without conscience! The lack of a higher authority, God, makes people think they are their own highest authority on the planet, which has historically, and individually, been disasterous, self-destructive, and downright suicidal. Ravi explains why.I thought THE REAL FACE OF ATHEISM's overall flow of logic was a little unclear, on occasion, from chapter to chapter, though the points made on any given page are always pretty interesting.After I read the two appendixes, I suddenly understood this book's overall construction better. I think these two appendixes would better serve the reader if they were in the front of the book. They work better as brief introductions to his overall thought process, and then the reader can better see were his points fit into his case, because we would have had the overall plan explained. In fact, in the Introduction, Ravi does mention to the reader to check out his two brief appendixes, but I think he should go ahead and just put them in front of the book, in my opinion. It would have helped me out.I have read Ravi's 2006 autobiography book, in which he mentions that this book, THE REAL FACE OF ATHEISM, and his other book, DELIVER US FROM EVIL, are his most popular books ever. I MUCH prefer DELIVER US FROM EVIL over this one. Ravi's best book is DELIVER US FROM EVIL. It is bettered organized than THE REAL FACE OF ATHEISM, and it flows together to make a much better, more contained and defined point of view.I have also read and enjoyed Ravi's 2006 autobiography book, EAST TO WEST: GOD IN THE SHADOWS, and found it more memorable and entertaining than THE REAL FACE OF ATHEISM, but THE REAL FACE OF ATHEISM has more important ammunition for defending the faith in a culture overrun by atheistic values run amok. THE REAL FACE OF ATHEISM is more important to read, while EAST TO WEST: GOD IN THE SHADOWS is more casual and friendly.I have also read his short, gift book, THE LAMB AND THE FUHRER, which I cannot recommend, sorry to say. That book is fiction, an imaginary conversation between Jesus and Hitler, which is an interesting concept, but Ravi's fiction writing is the weakest project that I have ever come across from Ravi Zacharias, so far.I enjoy the weekly radio shows of Ravi Zacharias, where he explains Christian concepts from an in-depth, intellectually reasoned point of view. It always helps me become better equipped to defend the faith and to gently explain Christian concepts to non-believers. Actually, I think his radio ministry work is more consistent and more powerful than any of his books which I have read, so far. Radio is where Ravi excels, more than in books, but his books can be very good, as well."},{"Title":"Real Face of Atheism, The","review":"In his book, \\"The Real Face of Atheism,\\" Ravi Zacharias sets out to expose the \\"fatal flaws\\" of atheism, and to explain how it is that atheism is \\"the womb that conceived our moral malady.\\" He fails completely, identifying neither flaws nor malady; but I can nevertheless recommend this book to atheists and scientists, as it will help them to understand how scientific ignorance helps to fuel the \\"moral\\" arguments of fundamentalist Christians.Though science is Zacharias' enemy, he cannot engage it, because he does not even begin to understand it. Central to his argument is the old conceit that life violates the second law of thermodynamics, and so must be a divine miracle. In the midst of an otherwise tired rehash of creationism, he mentions \\"dissipative structures,\\" (pg 46) but any hope for an intelligent discussion of the origins of order quickly fades, as he appears to have heard of the concept only, perhaps, from other creationist screeds (he gives no literature references concerning the science he distorts and mocks). He concludes that scientists are engaging in a \\"sleight of hand\\" when they point out that the increase in entropy that applies to a closed system like the universe as a whole, does not apply to the open systems that comprise parts of that whole.Amusingly, he later (pg 79) makes hash of his own misunderstanding when he tries to accuse atheists of reversing themselves on the issue of meaning by holding that meaning is local (as is the increased order in living matter). For Zacharias, it is a reversal to say, in the case of entropy, that what applies to the whole does not apply to the parts, while in the case of meaning, what applies to the parts does not apply to the whole. So I guess A not equal to B contradicts B not equal to A. And he says atheists misunderstand logic.His inability -- or stubborn refusal -- to comprehend a very simple core concept in thermodynamics may be crucial, but it is only one part of his extremely distorted view of science. He wants his readers to view science as fragmented and dis-unified (pp 39-40), but he does nothing to address the ongoing unification of cosmology, physics, chemistry, biology, neuroscience, mind research, and even social science and ethical research that is the real reductive future of science, and which is undoubtedly the aspect of science of which he is truly frightened. And he portrays the changes in theory and the new discoveries that comprise the history of science as evidence of the weakness, rather than the strength of science (pp 41-43). Far better, he apparently believes, to tell yourself lies about the \\"certainty\\" of knowledge, and stay the course.. well.. religiously, than to admit human error and correct a body of knowledge when new evidence comes to light.But his misunderstanding of science is clearest, and most telling, when, in Chapter 3 (\\"Virtue in Distress\\") he recommends to the reader a \\"parable\\" taken from Notre Dame philosophy professor Alasdair MacIntyre, in which a post-catastrophe society is imagined in which only fragmented remnants of what used to be scientific knowledge are preserved, revered, and even worshiped, but are neither understood nor utilized. This, MacIntyre and Zacharias want to suggest, is analogous to the situation with morality in the modern world, where they see morality in shambles because people have lost faith in the authoritative roots of their traditional moral knowledge.But science is not the authoritative system portrayed by this metaphor, an upside-down pyramid of absolute facts that would collapse with the loss of particular books, persons, or foundational \\"facts\\". It is a network of working theories, any or all of which may be mistaken, but which mutually support each other to create a whole, the truth of which is seen to be more probable than any of the many alternatives that have been suggested.Theism may be one of those alternatives, but, having gained the endorsement of only about 40% of all American scientists over the last century, and of less than 10% of today's most productive scientists (members of the National Academy of Sciences), it may properly be described as highly improbable (\\"Scientists and Religion in America\\" by Edward J. Larson and Larry Witham, Scientific American, September 1999). Zacharias dismisses T.H. Huxley's observation that, in conflicts between science and religion, religion has always had to retreat, asking why then are there not more unbelieving scientists (pp 38-39). Apparently, he is simply ignorant of the published work on the subject.Modern religion itself provides a much better match for MacIntyre's imagined pious but ignorant post-catastrophe society, as it has indeed forgotten or denied the human origins of its ancient rule-lists, and pretends an other-worldly divine origin and eternal verity for moral solutions which may have been appropriate, at one time, to the vanished human circumstances of the past. Zacharias is convinced that, without divinely inspired rules, there can be no incentive for atheists to, say, refrain from bearing false witness against their neighbors. But, convinced of his own divine inspiration, it is he who proceeds to misrepresent both atheism and science, and to divorce morality from reality and meaning from humanity.In the end, we are left with Pascal's wager, which Zacharias presents not as a proof, or even a reason for belief, but as a reason to be content with belief, even if it should be mistaken (pg 153). After all, What have we lost? As Zacharias's book makes plain, we have only lost science."},{"Title":"A Shilling for Candles","review":"A popular actress/singer's body is found on the beach. At first it is believed to be an accidental drowning, but soon it becomes apparent that this is murder. The novel begins well, and there are some interesting characters, but then it begins to go downhill. Instead of vintage Tey, we seem to have an Agatha Christie plot, and not the best Christie.There are red herrings galore, a false arrest, 2 escapes, supernatural overtones, and then an unexpected, unprepared for, and totally implausible ending. That the guilty one would have and could have perpetrated the crime in the manner indicated is just beyond belief. The author even has to make her turn out to be insane to create a strong enough motive--no, not nearly strong enough actually.If you want to read excellent Josephine Tey, try BRAT FARRAR or THE FRANCHISE AFFAIR.

Still, the characters are so brilliantly drawn, it is just plain fun to read about them. After the first five chapters, the mystery becomes immaterial though.

Clay worked her way up from nothing, with a mother who spoiled her brother rotten while having all kinds of excuses why Christine couldn't have proper schooling. Christine managed to escape to the life of the stage; her rise was so rapid that when she married a wealthy man with a title, she was considered to have made a catch, but within a couple of years *he* was thought of as 'Christine Clay's husband'. (Her background, gradually uncovered by police investigation, is enough to support a story in itself.) Now she has been found drowned at the lonely seaside place she was visiting incognito, and a youngster who seems like a stereotypical victim of circumstances is on the run, suspected of her murder for what seems like an inadequate motive. And given the brilliance of Christine Clay's shining star, why was she alone on holiday, with neither a court of hangers-on nor her husband?Grant carries part of the story's action during his investigation, but Tey isn't shackled to a stylistic formula. Erica, the local Chief Constable's 16-year-old daughter, wades in where angels fear to tread, and generally assists Robin Tisdall, one of the chief suspects, to stay out of police custody while the police try to find out how Christine died. (This last provides an excuse for several mildly entertaining bit-part characters to appear, so I can live with it in the name of entertainment.)A few too many plots getting in the way of the story, and could've used better editing to work as a book. I think it works better as a performance on the audio edition than it does on the page. As always when Stephen Thorne is the reader, the audio edition is performed well.Elizabeth Mackintosh (\\"Josephine Tey\\" was a pseudonym) was primarily a playwright; she only produced 8 mystery novels altogether, 7 featuring Grant. Incidentally, she used yet another pseudonym, \\"Gordon Daviot\\", as both a playwright and for the original publication of many of her books. A SHILLING FOR CANDLES (1936) was Mackintosh's 2nd mystery novel, with an emphasis on 'novel' rather than 'who done it?' Tey isn't particularly interested in playing fair with the reader here, but I personally can live with that since the book works as a story. (I've taken off points for it, and for some issues with the story construction, but on the whole it's enjoyable, so the audio edition is worth having.)"},{"Title":"A Shilling for Candles","review":"As an audio book, this is a great production.

The investigation gets even more complicated when the young and adventurous daughter of Inspector Grant's boss injects herself into helping to solve the crime.While a manhunt ensues for the young suspect, who initially evades Grant's clutches, alternative suspects do not escape his shrewd eye and, from there, Tey weaves a masterful set of sub-plots into this very solid mystery. At one point, Inspector Grant gets side-tracked by pursuing a nefarious brother of the victim, a clear suspect, which nearly costs the former his life.It is not likely that the reader will guess who the murderer is in this literary roller coaster ride.

A young man appears on the scene, weeping. It seems that he had taken her car.The name of the drowned woman is Christine Clay. Inspector Alan Grant of Scotland Yard is called to the scene by a worried constabulary. The young man, Robin Stannaway or Robert Tisdall, the name had been changed to Tisdall to please a relative, stayed with Chris. She had picked him up when hitchhiking, saying that she was alone. The boy clearly has charm. Grant and others determine that it is probable murder.The book suffers from having the most likeable characters mainly off-stage or dead. In other respects, of course, it is wonderful, given that Josephine Tey was one of the best people writing in the genre."},{"Title":"A Shilling for Candles","review":"Josephine Tey is a marvellous mystery writer, but she does use the Golden Age formula. In this book there are actually three plot strands (one of which is a murder). In true \\"Golden Age\\" fashion we don't get the answer to any of the three until the end when the murderer is unmasked. Even though she uses the formula, it is apparent in this book anyway that she likes to flout the rules. It's that hint of the unexpected that makes her books such a treasure. And her titles!! They say so much in so few words.In this book Inspector Grant is looking into the drowning death of a famous film star. There are no shortage of suspects, and there is so much extraneous information that he gets quite frustrated trying to unravel it. But he peseveres and discovers the murderer in the end."},{"Title":"A Shilling for Candles","review":"This book just proves that great writing is timeless. It isn't gory and it doesn't have lots of action. But the characters are very well drawn and the investigation into a murder includes lots of twists and turns to keep your interest.Police procedures, the life of those who work on the stage, evangelicals, rags to riches - there are so many little stories in this larger story that it isn't ever boring. It will make you want to read more of her work in order to know more about some of these characters.This would be an excellent book for those times you have to wait - traveling or visiting doctors or waiting for kids to finish school/games. It is good for men, women and teens - anyone who would like a well written novel."},{"Title":"A Shilling for Candles","review":"\\"You've introduced characters in the last few pages that were never in the book before! You withheld clues so we the reader couldn't possibly guess 'who dun it'!\\"I channeled the late Truman Capote's Lionel Twain a lot reading the last few pages of this 1936 mystery novel. Sure, Twain was addressing a Miss Marple parody in the classic Neil Simon comedy, but he could have been just as easily been telling off Josephine Tey.Another movie to reference here is Alfred Hitchcock's \\"Young And Innocent\\", which was an adaptation of \\"A Shilling For Candles\\", though a very loose one. How loose? The main two characters in the movie are rendered secondary in the book halfway in, and the murder itself almost completely different except for a dead body washing up on the Kentish coast.Hitchcock played fast and loose with structure and sense in his movie, but Tey was even less tethered by the mystery-writing discipline. As other reviewers have noted, various subplots parachute out of the blue sky. Worse, they never connect in any coherent way to create some unifying concept. The worst involves the revelation of the killer. In an introduction to this edition, Robert Barnard praises this being \\"only revealed just before the unmasking of the criminal\\" as a kind of innovation and rebellion against mystery-writing convention. Lionel Twain would have called it something else.What's good about \\"A Shilling For Candles\\"? Well, Tey's take on the sleepy southern coast of England, and the bustle of high-society London where the victim was a celebrated fixture, presents delicious if dated social satire in the Evelyn Waugh vein: \\"The Sunday Telegraph liked influence and art. Even boxers never described punches to it; they explained their art.\\"Young tomboy Erica Burgoyne, a lively center of the movie as played by Nova Pilbeam, is a perverse delight in the book, too. Here, unlike the movie, she hardly needs convincing that the suspect she befriends, Tisdall, is innocent of murder.\\"You're not capable of it,\\" she tells him.\\"Thank you,\\" he replies.\\"I didn't mean it that way,\\" she answers.Erica's search for a missing coat is the high point of the novel story-wise, though here as elsewhere Tey's casual reliance on coincidence is very annoying. In the end, her slapdash plotting renders \\"A Shilling For Candles\\" too weak to recommend to non-fans of period mystery, but for those willing to endure the agonies of Lionel Twain, some fine writing and a few laughs are there to be had on the journey."},{"Title":"A Shilling for Candles","review":"This book bears the usual Tey earmarks--it's more story than mystery, the reader isn't given sufficient clues to solve the mystery, the language is sometimes a bit stilted, there are some (at least to me) obscure British expressions not understandable through the context, the main character Inspector Grant is considerably less than all-knowing, there are some annoying stereotypes (in this case Jews, in others foreigners in general), but the characterization of at least some of the characters is very fine. I've upgraded it to a 3 mostly because of the delightful character Erica. In this particular book, the ending is pulled out of a hat even more than Tey's usual ending. There are lots of red herrings too. Some were interesting--but not really explored very much--almost vignettes. The beginning of the novel seemed more like a play--and, of course, Tey was a playwright. Overall, it's just okay, nothing really special--not in a class with \\"Brat Farrar\\" or Tey's masterpiece, \\"Daughter of Time.\\""},{"Title":"A Shilling for Candles","review":"When a beautiful, successful movie star who's &quot;getting away from it all&quot; in the country is found murdered, Inspector Alan Grant is overwhelmed with suspects: the unstable young man who's just run through the last of his fortune and whom she took in on impulse, her husband the adventure-seeker, an elusive Balkan revolutionary, rival actresses, her hypocritical brother, an enigmatic songwriter, a wealthy monastery, and the self-styled &quot;astrologer to the stars.&quot; (Throw in a couple of art dealers and it'd sound a lot like Santa Fe!) Tey blends all these disparate characters into a complex, entertaining tale, and tops it off with one of the most delightful adolescent tomboys the reader is ever likely to meet. The solution is shocking but believable, and the conclusion of the book is charming. Greatly enjoyable, and the points she makes in passing about the pitfalls of fame and the power of the press are still relevant even if the technology is dated."},{"Title":"A Shilling for Candles","review":"If you want actual detection, as opposed to character studies, this is the Tey book to read.

He's not the most interesting Detective Inspector doing the rounds in murder mysteries but he was a work in progress when this was written, he reminds me of a very early Adam Dalglish in his mannerisims.There are some great characters ,especially the Chief Constable's daughter -she is worth a story of her own.The author knows how to amuse with a few laugh out loud moments and some great dialogue. Only a woman could have written about her sleuth walking up carpeted stairs trying to solve a murder and musing how difficult the stairs would be to clean.Its not a great 'who dunnit' only because D.I Grant has very little to do with locating any of the evidence, but as it was only the authors second outing she can be forgiven. I have read that she got much better prior to her early death in 1952.I love these ' golden age' of crime mysteries.

One morning, Christine turns up dead, drowned in the sea, and Inspector Alan Grant from the Yard is called in by the local constables. He has his eye on Tisdall for doing the crime for various reasons, but his case is solidified when Clay's will is read and Tisdall comes into an inheritance. Hmm. But Grant's got a niggling doubt -- and so sets out to investigate anyone who may have had it in for Christine...and finds that there are more than a few people who would have liked to have seen her dead.The characters are entertaining but the book is just average. Perhaps this is because it's only the second book of the series. The mystery is good and solid, and there are a number of suspects and red herrings that are thrown out for the reader's consideration, but some of the plot lines seemed a bit confusing at times. The end, truthfully, I saw coming from a long way out so that was sort of off putting. However, many people really enjoyed this one, so it's one you'll have to try yourself.

My daughter is an extreme reader (has always had more AR points than anyone else in her school) & I am extremely well read, but somehow missed this one growing up. I will be honest, as an adult I had a hard time dragging myself through this novel & I read a lot of Russian lit (translated) from the turn of the last century! I do understand that there is value in this novel, but it is a very slow story & understanding it is difficult if one doesn't already have a very strong grasp of Civil War History (neither my daughter nor I do). The plethora of underdeveloped characters makes them bleed together, the language is written in such a way that it makes it difficult - and those with reading disorder will TRULY struggle with spellings and word meanings, and military strategy is discussed across the book - but sadly it is so broken up that it has very little meaning at all if one doesn't already have that knowledge at hand (and maybe a map would have been nice for those of us that are lost). With 2 strong readers in my household struggling to drag through this one, I was hoping for some amazing things in the last couple of chapters to make all the work worthwhile (let's face it, the beginning of some fine works are pretty boring - \\"Frankenstein\\" springs to mind), sadly, the end of the book brings nothing more than the beginning or middle offered to us. In my daughter's case this book is being used to screen out Pre-AP students for 7th grade year. At the rate her peers are getting this done, she may well be the only kid qualified for the class.If, as an educator, you elect to use this book, please be sure that your students have a firm grasp of Civil War Battle History. Also, be sure that you either read this aloud to them or offer other options for students with reading issues. The \\"creative\\" spelling of so many words makes this a minefield for kids with any processing issues.At the end of this book I felt as if I had crawled through razor wire to get to a piece of burnt toast. I have rarely considered any book a waste of my efforts, but this one, sadly, falls into that category."},{"Title":"Across five Aprils","review":"My Granddaughter needed a copy of this book to have at home, her teacher said the children will need to re-read at home what they read at school.

After a while the North was able to escape with the victory after the town comes to togther to help the family.The reason I'm reading this book is because it has been picked for me for a group book by Mrs. Shea my english teacher.My favorite part is the whole thing because it is the first book I have read with so many emotions. It makes you want to cry, laugh, smile, and frown. The family's problems and jokes never end. Once one does another one starts all over again. This made me feel like i was watching a TV show.

It presents great accounts of both everyday life and wartime in the previous century -- historical fiction at its best. But Irene Hunt excels at painting human beings and relationships -- the young boy, the family, even Abraham Lincoln.

My story is actually very ironic. In the beginning I didnt want to read the book because people who have previously read it were saying that this was the worst book ever. So I blew the book off and totally forgot about it. And when it was two days before the first day of school I relised that I still have yet to read the book. So i found out how many chapters were in the book and made a reading schedule. So I read six chapters a day. But when I got to chapter three I relized how good this book really is. It was soo heartfelt and real. I literally felt as if i was sitting rite next to Jethro and Bill in the field. It was a really strong story and plot line. I could feel the anger, the sadness, and the fear in this book. And when I finally came to the end of the book I didnt want the story to end. I wanted more. I wanted to know what happened to Bill and Eb. I wanted to know if Shadrach and Jenny had any children. I wanted the story to last forever. That is the best book that I have ever read in my entire life. And I would read a thousand times over if I could. I recomend this book for anyone who is from the age 13 up and to anyone who is interested in how the people lived in the Civil War when they weren't the ones fighting in it.

If you are interested in what war does to a loving family's everyday life, this is your book.Jethro Creighton, the central character, grows from the carefree &quot;baby of the family&quot; to a hardworking, thoughtful adolescent who has seen his brothers go off to fight and in one case, die in the Civil War. Two of the family's sons fight for the Union, one for the Confederacy, and Irene Hunt explores in some detail the ways in which everyday farming folks dealt with these divided loyalties.Hunt is not the sort of writer to condescend to young readers.She creates situations that make you think and reflect. So maybe a junior-high reader who is &quot;made&quot; to read Across Five Aprils would find it tough going.I first read this book when I was in high school, so I was a little older than some of the readers who seem to be having major problems with it. Twenty years later, it's still a book I re-read from time to time. Hunt's characters lose none of their vividness -- when you're an adult, you find a whole new interest in her portraits of Jethro's parents and their anguish over their children in wartime.My advice is, if you're being told to read this for a report and you don't like it, grit your teeth and get through it -- but don't throw the book away. I guarantee that in a few more years you will love it -- unless you've given up on reading altogether."},{"Title":"Across five Aprils","review":"I read Across Five Aprils along with my own son and the 8th graders I teach as part of a unit on the Civil War. Ms. Hunt does a wonderful job of drawing her characters, particularly Jethro Creighton. Jethro and his family, farming in southern Illinois, find that even though they are not in the midst of the battlefields, their lives are nonetheless swept up in the events of this tragic period in our history. Jethro's growth and understanding of the sweep of history as well as of himself are well-detailed. Well they might be, as Ms. Hunt crafted this story from family stories of her great-grandfather, who was the young protagonist, making this novel something between historical fiction and family lore.She deftly weaves the family events with historic fact, adding faces to the stories in the history texts. As a midwestern gal myself, I found the perspective of a family from that part of the country to be very interesting. Many other similar works make their settings much closer to the historical action, and it is this unique setting that allows the reader to understand just how all-encompassing the Civil War was for the whole country.I found the last few chapters to be disappointing, as she seemed to want to rush to the end of the war and hence her story. The writing took on a feeling of newspaper reports of battles, with very little of the narrative from the Creighton family viewpoint that made the book so engrossing.As a teacher, I feel that the authentic dialect that was used in the dialogue might make for somewhat difficult reading for many kids who struggle with involved text. Nonetheless, a book such as Across Five Aprils makes for a much more interesting and meaningful study of the Civil War than the dry texts we read and forgot."},{"Title":"Across five Aprils","review":"If you asked me about this book before May of '08, I simply would have answered I read it for school 10 years ago in 8th grade, and don't remember a thing about it. This all changed last year. I had a flight overseas to catch. Before I left my home for the airport, I randomly grabbed this book off the bottom of the shelf, not really thinking, just needing something to read on the plane.What a treasure I discovered! This book is beautifully written with undertones on how Jethro's thought process changes and develops as the war goes on. It's an incredible read, and really paints vivid pictures for the imaginative. During the course of my trip, I read and re-read this book several times, and learned something new every time. I wish I knew what happened to Bill and the rest of the family after the war.This 3/5 rating is a bit skewered. Most of the 1 scores are from students who do not want to read it and are being forced to, so they're being spiteful. I challenge all of you younger guys and girls to either genuinely give it a chance, or put it away for 5-10 years, and discover it again. It's an amazing read if given a chance."},{"Title":"Across five Aprils","review":"Firstly, I am an Australian who is interested in the Civil War. I have had no formal education about American history and have only started to become a serious student of the Civil War through my husband's interest in the event.I am greatly fascinated by the effects that Civil War (as with the Holocaust) had on the people of the country. I found Across Five Aprils a perfect introduction to Civil War fiction. It was well researched and written with great compassion. As a &quot;foreigner&quot;, I found the apparent &quot;Lincon&quot; worshipping a bit much, but now, after a lot more research and many hours of watching documentaries and reading non-fiction works, I can understand the writer's adulation, especially from Jethro's adolescent point of view. Indeed, I was deeply moved by the last few pages, even to the point of tears as I could imagine Jethro's pain at the loss of his (for want of a better term) last great hope.I am greatly amused by other reader's opinions of the book being &quot;boring&quot;. Well, what can you expect? Amazon describes it as a fictional work. It doesn't say &quot;Read the exiting adventures of a farmer boy as he single handedly wins the Civil War&quot; does it?This is an excellent read, as the author is so damned good at descriptive prose that you can feel the heat of the fields, take pleasure in the simple pleasures of these people's lives (who could've imagined that salads would have been such a treat!), rejoice in their small triumphs and feel for them in their loss.I would whole-heartedly recommend this book for &quot;foreigners&quot; with an interest in the Civil War and its effects on an everyday rural family. I also liked this book as I was an avid fan of the Laura Ingalls Wilder (spelling?) Little House series as a child, and I sort of found this book in much the same style."},{"Title":"Across five Aprils","review":"For me, this book wasn't at all bad. In fact, I started it yesterday and today I'm finished. If you want a short little story that will keep you interested, then you should try this one. But that's not all it did; I picked up a lot from what I didn't remember in the Civil War. This book hardly made it an American history lesson--it made the Civil War come alive instead. For the kids, well I can understand your pain. In junior high I wouldn't have given this book a second look, but wait a few more years until you can appreciate the history and writing in it. All right, take care."},{"Title":"Across five Aprils","review":"Somehow, I made it through childhood without ever knowing about this book. The story itself is very interesting, dealing with issues of death, and joy, and contentment, and innocence, and honor, and responsibility.The setting is the five years of the Civil War, away from the front lines in rural southern Illinois. The characters are country people -- a large family and their neighbors. Jethro, our protagonist, is nine years old as the book opens, and the dreamy peacefulness of his protected childhood bursts wide open as the war talk turns to open conflict within his own family. He bears up, and by helping his family through the endless farm work, he develops manly honor and insight.This book is a treat to read. I am raising a family of boys; I would want Shad or Mr. Milton or Bill or Matt, or Jethro himself, as a role model for any of them.Irene Hunt does a wonderful job with the sibling relationships in this book, the personalities of the sons and the daughter, the affection and conflict. It helps to read this book with a good atlas of the Civil War... try this one.Great Maps of the Civil War: Pivotal Battles and Campaigns Featuring 32 Removable Maps (Museum in a Book)OrAtlas of the Civil War: A Complete Guide to the Tactics and Terrain of Battle (National Geographic)"},{"Title":"Across five Aprils","review":"Across Five Aprils is a book that is set during the Civil War. It is about a 9-year-old boy named Jethro who lives on a farm in Illinois, and it chronicles his experiences across the five aprils that the war goes through.I particularly enjoyed this book, because most books about boys set during the Civil War are about how the boys go off to fight. This book is different, because Jeth does not join the army. Instead, he stays at home and helps his family with the crops. I thought that this was a most refreshing change.I learned many new things from this book. From my history books I had always gotten the impression that Lincoln was a grand hero. We know now that he was, but at the time, many people didn't think so. They criticized him and blamed him for all their problems when the war went wrong. In truth, when the Union army lost battles, it was because the Generals in charge ignored Lincoln's orders and did something different instead.I would recommend this book to people ages 10 and up. I would not recommend it for younger children, because some of the things described in the book are a bit scary. It is, after all, about a war."},{"Title":"Across five Aprils","review":"Wow! It saddens me to read some of the low-star reviews of such a wonderfully written book as Across Five Aprils. Whoever said there is no plot or depth of characters either has no heart or doesn't know how to read a book that is above a 4th grade reading level. Yes, I will admit that an elementary child may not be able to understand the longer descriptions of battles or grasp the emotions of the characters on his own. But, it would make a great read-aloud, if the reader can hold back the tears long enough to get the words out. This should forever be required reading for middle/high school students. The problem with our society is that people won't push themselves when reading. Even if it's a little hard, keep reading! This book is a classic and there is reason for that. Please do not continue reading simple stories with fast-paced plots, easy wording and no purpose. Slow down and take your time with a classic like Across Five Aprils. You will gain far more by reading one of these books than 10 of the new YA books out there. Please give this one a fair chance!!"},{"Title":"Across five Aprils","review":"I did not read Across Five Aprils by choice and did not expect to like a story about a boy named Jethro and his family. Suprisingly I was pulled into the story right away. I found the characters feelings very real. It painted a very real image of the times. I felt, for a few hours a day, that I was living on a farm in southern Illinois during the Civil War. I read the book for the first time over 2 years ago but I still find my self fliping through it now and then to find one of those many lines that really touched me."},{"Title":"Across five Aprils","review":"I am currently reading this book with high school students. In my opinion, this book is most appreciated when one allready has an understanding of the context of the Civil War. I think it is so crucial that students read literature like this (whether they want to or not) so they can actually visualize our nation's history. Some students are less excited about this book compared to others but we read it together as a class for comprehension's sake. If I assigned this as an out of class book, I can not see many students actually reading this on their own time. It is a bit slow but the details of life during the 1860's and further education of our country's history is why I chose this book for our class. Sometimes, I sense that our student's grasp of history is so weak so I wanted to bolster their knowledge with this historical fiction written about a young man and his family dealing with the trials and tribulations of the time."},{"Title":"Across five Aprils","review":"The story follows a young boy, Jethro, and his family at the start of the Civil war and as he grows. The book is similar to \\"My Brother Sam is Dead\\" as it follows a young boy into early adulthood. His family is divided between the views of the South and the North. His brothers go off to fight and he must stay behind to help run the farm and take care of the famliy. The dialect used in the book can make it difficult to read at times, especially for young readers. There are many facts about the war and different battles, which can be difficult for a younger reader to understand, but it is easier to remember these events when put into the context of a real story and family. It can be slow at times, especially at the beginning, overall it is well worth the read and the reader will learn something."},{"Title":"Across five Aprils","review":"It's April of 1861, and the Creighton family is living in southern Illinois. Then war breaks out, and the family must somehow live through the struggles of the Civil War. After the firing on Fort Sumter, Tom Creighton and Eb, the family's cousin, went to help the Union Army. For a while the Union Army was not doing very well, and was losing many battles against the Confederate Army. While one of the oldest Creighton sons, John, went to help the Union with the schoolteacher Shadrach Yale, John's favorite brother Bill decided to fight for the Confederacy. After the Union started winning victories, the Creighton's father Matt had a heart attack, and Jethro, the youngest Creighton, and his sister Jenny had to do all of the work on the farm. Then, some people came and burned down the Creighton's farm because Bill was in the Southern Army. After Tom was killed in battle, Eb deserts the Union Army. Jethro wrote a letter to President Lincoln, asking him what to do about Eb, and the President told him that all deserters would be pardoned. Shadrach returned from battle in critical condition, and after he has time to heal, he married Jenny. Bill wrote that he had been captured by the Union, and finally the war came to an end. Jethro went on to get an education with Shadrach. This book showed very well how someone you think is an enemy can turn out to be a good friend, how something like a war can greatly effect a family, and showed how even someone who seems weak can be a very important person.Across Five Aprils depicted very well how a war can tear apart, or bring together, a family. Shadrach Yale and Jenny Creighton were in love, and wanted to get married, but their marriage was delayed five years because of the Civil War. Also, Bill Creighton went to the Confederate Army instead of the Union Army, and this caused the town to turn against the Creightons. Also, because nobody else was at the home, Jethro was forced to do all of the work on the farm after his father's heart attack.The book also showed that an enemy can become a friend. The Creightons had a daughter named Mary who was killed in an accident by Dave Burdow's son. Dave Burdow was also part of the group of people who spoke badly about the family when Bill became a Confederate. But one day on his way home from town, Jethro was overtaken by some evil men. Unexpectedly, Dave Burdow came to his rescue, and stopped the men from hurting Jethro.This story explained how a seemingly weak or unimportant person can really be a key person in a time of tragedy or struggle. Jethro Creighton was just an 8-year-old when the Civil War broke out. But he ended up taking control of the farm, a job that was meant for at least three older men. He also had the courage to write to Abraham Lincoln to ask about his cousin Eb, and in doing so saved his cousin's life. He also stood up for his family when many people were saying they were Confederate supporters.Across Five Aprils is an interesting book that wonderfully shows the life of a family during the Civil War, and the struggles and hardships that they had to face during those five years. It is a masterpiece that anyone would enjoy reading.W.Pillow"},{"Title":"Across five Aprils","review":"In this thrilling and exciting story of a boy named Jethro who went from a safe house to the treacheries of the Civil War, Irene Hunt keeps her readers interested in seeing how the family will overcome many obstacles. {Irene Hunt shows the importance of the setting and her character traits are great.} The Civil War and the fields at his house is the setting of the story. By the second week of April that year,the fields were dry enough for plowing, and Jethro, full of the optimism of inexperience, harnessed his team and went out to the field alone. This once young little boy who didn't know how to do much is now plowing the field as a young man. The characters in this story are Jethro and Shad. &quot;He watched the wagon from the corner of his eye as he worked, and when the team started coming down the road toward the potato patch, he put the heavy bag of cuttings aside and raced across the field to the roadside.&quot; Jethro is a very hard working boy. He is young smart and a fast learner. He was about 10 years old when he started hearing about the Civil War. After a little while his brothers left and then Shad. As he grew older he became stronger and wiser, then he was old enough he joined the army. He had book learning and was almost 21; still he could make a boy feel as proud as a man. Shad was much older than Jethro and smarter. He was the school master of the kids around the area. He was also the on who Jenny loved. He was a book taughtperson from the east he also joined the army. Irene Hunt's historical knowledge gives this book a sense of realness."},{"Title":"Across five Aprils","review":"one of the best novels i've yet read on the civil war, and it really does an excellent job of personalizing war, and showing how this war in particular affected a vulnerable american family. the main character is sympathetic, as are his parents and brothers and sister, and their relationships are touching and believable. the interactions with the townfolk are powerful as well, and this book gives a real slice of life into a time and place that just doesn't exist anymore. i wasn't surprised when the author wrote that her inspiration for the novel came almost directly from stories her grandfather told of his actual experiences as a boy who lived during the civil war - this book was too personal, too detailed, too heartfelt, and too simply real to just have been &quot;made up&quot; from her imagination...it just had that ring of truth that made it special.book's major weakness: i felt that in the last quarter of the book or so the author just lost her feel for the characters, or perhaps herself just wanted to finish the book. it started turning into a history lesson. the first three-quarters were wonderful because she DIDN'T do just that, and really let the lives of the characters carry the book and let the battles and history be the backdrop. that last quarter, though, god, it just got dull. sometimes for pages on end there was nothing about a single LIVING character in the book, and just paragraph after paragraph about lincoln and this general and that general and supply lines and politics. it was like...SHUT UP, I WANT TO READ A NOVEL, NOT A TEXTBOOK!that said, i'd still recommend the book highly. it's one of those books that puts a real human feel on a war, and thereby gives me a point of reference when i hear or read further on the civil war.

Sorry folks, I hated this book so did my whole class, even my teacher!"},{"Title":"Across five Aprils","review":"I recently read a book titled Across Five Aprils; it's about a young boy named Jethro from Illinois. He is a farm boy who was of age when the Civil War broke out. He and his family worry about the war and if he would be able to dodge having to go. Young Jethro has to grow up faster than most adolescents and he learns to take on huge responsibilities. He gets up early in the mornings to help his mother in the field's he helps with the dishes. The community does not back up the Creighton family because Jethro's brothers join the Confederacy. The Confederacy is against having slaves. This causes problems for the whole family. To get through it the Creighton family sticks together and finds a way through this miserable Hardship.I started reading this book because my English Teacher, Mrs. Shea, recommended it to me. When I saw the cover of the book I didn't want to have anything to do with the book. It looked boring; it looked like something someone old would read. It seemed like a waste of time, but I had to read it. So I read on. At the begging of the book it didn't seem worthwhile to read, but then it got interesting.My favorite part of the book was the opening of every event that happened. Every time he mentioned the fields you could feel the heat of the fields. When he mentioned the murder of someone you could hear the gunshots and the horses gallop. At the dinner table when they all gathered and someone said something that they shouldn't have, you could feel the awkwardness. Irene Hunt did a great job with the descriptions and with the feeling within the whole entire book. This was an extravagant heart-pounding book and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys books about Hardships wars, or excitement."},{"Title":"Across five Aprils","review":"[...] I read this book when I was nine or ten years old, and I understood it perfectly. In fact, despite the many books I have read since, I remembered this title and have often recommended it to others as a great example of American historical fiction. I learned so much about the Civil War by reading it, and thought it beautifully captured the emotional conflict so many felt at the time. I have had a passion for American history, particularly the Civil War Era, ever since.Books like these are great for learning about our past in a more personal way than a dry history book. They help us to understand what generations before have gone through in order to make our country what it is today.

It is one of the few American historical novels worthy to stand with the writings of Rosemary Sutcliff. (She and Scott O'Dell are likely the greatest writers of historical fiction for young people ever.) Irene Hunt writes with great compassion and beauty of her ancestors in Illinois during the tumult of the Civil War. She has an almost heartbreaking intensity in her choice of language. This is a great novel, an American classic. People who do not see that are probably not able to read with any sense of artistic appreciation. Well, for them there is always the Magic Tree House series, nice and easy and comfy and not challenging in the least. For those who want something else, there is Across Five Aprils. It is a scandal that Hunt's Newbery Medal winner Up a Road Slowly is out of print."},{"Title":"Across five Aprils","review":"An excellent novel to re-read yourself while introducing it to your child.

I love this book! It is awesome! I had heard it was extremely boring (like a lot of other people). Those comments are the misstatements of the year. I think you should seriously consider revising your thoughts! This book is one of the best books I have ever read.I like this book so much because you can relate to it and feel like you are being the character(s). I also like it because it has something for everyone. For kids there is a young character; for men there is a war story; for women there is a love story. It has everything you could want in a book --- action, romance, emotion and substance.The story is very strong because it has so much agony, and yet the family holds together through it all. It holds through death, suffering, and through war. I encourage you to read this book.

There are rumors of a short war starting and then suddenly, in April, Confederate soldiers attacked Fort Sumter. After this the story is about the Civil War from Jethro Creighton's point of view. At the time the war started he was nine. Two Creighton brothers and one of their cousins enlist for the Army and two of them die. The story ends after five long years with the Creightons hearing about President Lincoln getting assassinated.This book was the most exciting book I read about the Civil War. It has many details, emotions and lots of setting descriptions. I especially liked how the author described the battles and the Creighton's farm. This book tells abot the characters' thoughts, instead other books only say facts about what happened with no emotions. I really felt the sadnees and cruelty of the war from all the letters the Creighton boys sent home.

It seemed interesting and unique and I got attracted to it.The main character in this story is Jethro Creighton. Only being 9, he finds that he has to grow up faster than he thinks. In the time of war and chaos, Jethro develops responsibility. He was the survivor among his three siblings who died, and was favored greatly by his mother. Jethro is a bright and mature kid who helps his family through the hard times.I didn't particularly enjoy this book. Although it was a very touching book, it didn't really catch my interests. Not only did it talk mainly about war and death, it revolved too much around an historical event. The words were confusing to understand and the content wasn't very fun to read about.

It is a book about the Civil War. Though you are never actually in a war in this book you hear about how bad they are and who is winning and such from other characters in the book. In this book the main character is Jethro. Jethro is a young boy whose brothers go to was and he is left to take care if things. He feels like a real man when his dad sends him with the horse and carriage to get a newspaper where he sees the father of the man who killed his sister. My opinion of the Across 5 Aprils is that it is a pretty good book. I liked the story, it wasn't like the Red Badge of Courage where it is just detail after detail. It was a very well written book I would recommend it to just about anyone, and if you had to do a Civil war book report (like me) I would especially recommend it. Across 5 Aprils is about a kid named Jethro and his family who get caught up in the Civil War, their other son went to war and was not expected to return because the war was so brutal and terrible.

Across Five Aprils is a historical novel that takes place during the Civil War. The Creighton family, which the story revolves around, has members of the family that are fighting on opposing sides. Even though this may have seemed like and interesting character conflict, it wasn't, ad the characters also became impossible to relate to. I felt like an outsider while reading the book because I continually became confused as to what was happening because of the lack of character detail and description.

That's enough to make anyone want to read this book, but what really made me like it so much was the patterns of family life woven around all of this. In the story, nine-year-old Jethro Crieghten learns to become the man of the family when his brothers Tom and John and his cousin Eb go off to war. In the parts of the book about them, Irene Hunt draws a relistic picture of what life was like for the families waiting anxiously back home, drawing in death, and desertation into the story. Jethros favorite brother, Bill, leaves the family to serve the south, and when this causes an uproar in the pro-Union town, Jethro must learn to stand up for what and who he believes is write, in the face of his grief and the towns anger. Other characters woven into the fast-paced plot of this story are Jethro's older sister, Jenny, who her father deems to young to marry the schoolmaster, Shadrach, who is Jethro's hero and a fair, thoughtful person. There are Jethros parents, kind and worried Ellen, and Matt who is always questing for what is right. There is his brother John's meek wife, Nancy, who is brought closer to her husbands family by the war, Dave Burdow, a misunderstood town criminal, Ross Milton, a kind editor and friend, and Abraham Lincoln, the presidant who Jethro admires for his abilities to lead the country towards what is right.

However, I am not a child that can't understand books. I have read many great works which I know that many adults have never even dared touch (ex. The Catcher in the Rye, The Grapes of Wrath, Uncle Tom's Cabin, The Three Musketeers, The Red Badge of Courage, The adventures of Huckleberry Finn, etc.). I agree with many that this book is so boring that it would put many to sleep.

You just have to sit and think about it.

When I read other kids complaining about this book I thought of something Eleanor Roosevelt once said. \\"It takes curiosity to gain intellegence.\\" So, if you're curious about the Civil War, this is a good read!"},{"Title":"Across five Aprils","review":"I can't say enough good things about this book!!I was an insatiable reader as a child and this was one of my favorite books! I read this with 5th graders as a teacher and fell in love with it all over again! Many of my students had NEVER read a chapter book on their own, let alone read for pleasure, but they became captivated with reading as a result of this book and went on to read non-fiction books about the Civil War, biographies about Abraham Lincoln, Rifles for Watie, etc., on their own. This is significant since I taught in a low socio-economic area (95% free or reduced lunch). If kids find this boring, it is because it is over their heads - I read this WITH my students. They each had a copy and we read it aloud together in unison, stopping to clarify and discuss. Using historical fiction to introduce history makes it interesting and \\"digestible\\" for young people. It also sparks a desire to know more. A teacher can't tell a student everything, s/he must inspire them to investigate further. When students endeavor to learn more on their own, they are on the road to becoming educated. Abraham Lincoln himself only had one year of schooling - he educated himself with BOOKS!Specifically, this book is about a farming family in Civil War times torn apart by the war. It helps students understand the realities of the war that pitted \\"brother against brother\\" when the oldest son goes to fight for the \\"other\\" side. When he discovers that his brother was killed in battle, this big, hulk of a man sends word to his \\"mama\\" that he did not fire the shot that killed his brother. The book makes real the pain each family member must have felt. It helps students understand that the war was not just about slavery, it was also about states' rights and whether or not the people of the US wanted the federal government to be able to tell them what to do. The future of our government depended on the outcome of the war. It also helps them understand human rights and the fact that there are many gray areas in the complex world of politics and that issues rarely have an easy black or white answer.PARENTS, this book is worth reading with your child line by line if necessary! It can be tough, but it helps young people grow up a little and see the world more clearly, giving them a glimpse of a world outside of themselves.Books can change you and this one will for the better, without the shocking slap in the face that sometimes accompanies life lessons. You will notice deeper understanding, more maturity, a sense of accomplishment when your child masters this book. THAT is how you develop genuine self-esteem.For other character developing books, try The Secret Garden, The Diary of Anne Frank, and Anne of Green Gables. I can't explain why, but my 6th grade boys liked these as much as the girls, although they would never have picked them up on their own. Sounds crazy - I wouldn't believe it if I hadn't experienced it myself!"},{"Title":"Across five Aprils","review":"I have to say I love this book! It is awsome! I had heard it was boring, slow getting into, stupid and about everything else bad about it you can think of. Those comments were and are the understatements of the year!I like this book so much because you can relate and feel like your being the character. I also like it because it has something for everyone for kids their is a young character, for men their is a war story, and for women their is a love story.The story is strong because it has so much agony and yet the family holds through it all. It holds through death, suffering, and through war.Overall this book is very wishy-washy but it is good none the less!!!"},{"Title":"Across five Aprils","review":"I had to pick a book to read for my American History class and I'm in the 7th grade.

We both rated the book the same (3 out of 5 stars). At the first listen, I thought how soporific! and hoped my son would not complain. To my surprise Ms. Hunt garnered his attention for at least the 40 minute driving time on most days. The story gave an interesting perspective on the Civil War and was a catalyst for discussion on the war, slavery and the social issue of what to do with \\"them\\" after they're \\"free\\". My son enjoyed the southern dialect, but gives the rating primarily because the book was sad.

It gave a different perspective on the Civil War and what it was like to be in that family shoes, so to speak. I had read it to my children and they enjoyed it, caused a lot discussion. I didn't give much thought to the title or author when I returned the book to the library, till I wanted to recomend to their teachers as a good book to read to the class. I had forgoten the name of the book and the author. I searched the library and on internet trying to locate it with no luck, I had given up and was sick about it.

In history books people say the Abraham Lincoln was a hero. In this book, they criticized him and blamed him for all the bad things that happened in war.The reason that the Union army lost battles, is that the Generals would ignore Lincoln's orders and would so something else.

It tells how it would have been living during the civil war. Well thats what i think of this book.

Jethro was around during the Civil War. He was very sad beause of Abraham Lincoln's death. Jethro is from Illinois and Lincoln was too. Life isn't fair.

The Civil War almost destroyed the whole South."},{"Title":"Across five Aprils","review":"This book offers a different perspective on the Civil War - a boy too young to fight in the war, but old enough to understand the consequences. This isn't an action-adventure book - the battle scenes are told through letters written home - but Jethro, a nine-year-old boy, becomes a man during the four years of the war, as he takes on the responsibilities of the family and the farm. This book really makes you think about the Civil War, and how complicated it was for everyone, not just the soldiers and politicians and slaves, but even for a young boy in a small farming town in Illinois."},{"Title":"Across five Aprils","review":"Hi. I am in 7th grade and I didn't have to read this book but I did. It only took one day to finish it. It was totally cool. I'm not really into history and yet I loved it.

I was touched by the love and compassion in this book and am looking forward to reading Irene's next book. Look if you want to read this book find a day where you have nothing to do.

As a teacher, I found the students enjoyed the book when I presented and reviewed it in an enjoyable and exciting way. Irene Hunt makes that type of presentation possible. My kids enjoyed it, and they really read it. Thanks, Irene."},{"Title":"Across five Aprils","review":"I first read this book as a young child. I enjoyed it so much that I have re-read the book at different times in my life. The author certainly is one of the best I have read. She has the special talent to portray the full gament and richness of human emotion.The book inspired me to write. I am still trying to obtain the depth of character that Ms. Hunt is so talented. Unfortunately, many of the reviewers here were unable to enjoy and understand the emotional interactions. I feel very sad for them, as they are surely unable to embrace what it is to be a human. We are emotional beings and the book is able to portray life in all of its good and bad terms.Terry L.

It is about a kid and his family during the Civil War. They have many heart-lifting moments. I sometimes found myself laughing outloud and cheering right along with them. If you get this book you will find yourself laughing and almost crying during certain parts of the story. You wil feel as if you are part of the family. During the book Jethro goes to town for the first time, finds out what war really is, and finds himself stuck with nothing but his thoughts to guide him through hi troubles. I find that anybody who likes the Civil War and like books that make you feel as if you're right there shdowing somebody you wo't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Across five Aprils","review":"It shows how the civil war effected a family that lives on a farm. Three of the sons go to fight in the army and out of them one dies and one becomes a deserter. They also have a another son that went to fight on the rebels side, so there were a group of people that hated the family for that. There daughter was in love with a man that went to war and he became wounded, but she eventually marrys him. Then there youngest son, Jethro, who was most loved, had to work on the farm after his father had a heart-attack. So I would say this is a touching story of a family and everything that happens to them on the way."},{"Title":"Across five Aprils","review":"I haven't even finished the book but it sounds really good and who ever doesn't like this book probably doesn't like history either.

This book was a very well wriiten book and it was wounderful. Not many books about the Civil War tell about how the young boys who didn't fight in the war had to cope with the hardships of not having their brothers to help them work the farm. It was extreamly hard for Jethro for his father could not even help him. He only had his sister. I would truly recomend this book to anyone who is interested it the history of the USA."},{"Title":"Across five Aprils","review":"I had to read this book for an 8th gade class. I had a hard time reading the book because the story was so dull. I was a little dissapointed. I was also lost for some of the time. I watched the movie based on the book after I read the book. The movie was horrible. It was an ultra low budget that was worse then the book."},{"Title":"Across five Aprils","review":"This book was so excellent! When you get into it is so sad, with much hate and prejudice, but also with a love that binds the Creightons so they can get through all the tradgedy they suffer. Jethro is so tough in appearence, but underneath he is sad about the losses of his family. He becomes a man way too early and through the book i was sort of worried he wouldnt be able to do it any longer. I will say no more except for this: Anyone that misses out on a book so touching and well thought and told, is missing out on one the great parts of life!"},{"Title":"Across five Aprils","review":"For an 8th grader this is way too boring for these children to read"},{"Title":"Across five Aprils","review":"This book is hard to understand, mostly because of the dialect.

Only someone that likes Civil War History could like it. I read it for school and it just about bored me to death. The slang talk and the writing was the worst.

Half the time you didn't know what was going on and it was really confusing. There was alot of extra detail that made it even MORE confusing.

The characters barely even have personality."},{"Title":"Across five Aprils","review":"Across Five Aprils is the story of a young boy, Jethro Creighton, and his family who live in Southern Illinois during the Five Aprils of the Civil War. Jethro is faced with the responsibility of running the family's farm after his older brothers leave to fight in the war and his father suffers a heart attack. With the help of friends and neighbors, Jethro manages the farm fairly well but almost faces death after mobleaders almost kill him and ruin the Creighton farm over Bill Creighton's, one of Jethro's brothers, joining of the Confederate Army. The war does affect the Creighton family more significantly, however, as Tom, one of Jethro's brothers, is killed in a fierce battle.The book gives a good illustration of what occured during the Civil War era. Almost every family was affected and often brothers fought each other in different armies. The book is relatively short and easy to read. It contains alot of Southern Illinois Accent in its dialogue but it is easily understandable. The book is suitable for any child who can read well and it is fun, interesting, and enjoyable. It provides a new perspective on one of the most terrible wars in the history of the United States. Across Five Aprils is one of the best books of its kind."},{"Title":"Across five Aprils","review":"I read Across Five Aprils only because it was on my summer reading list (entering seventh grade). The subject matter is not something I am usually drawn towards, but as American history dominates my seventh grade year, many books about war ended up on the list. Across Five Aprils is about the Creighton family, a typical family living on a farm in southern Illinois during the turbulent years of the American Civil War. The story opens on the days immeaditly before the outbreak of war. Jethro Creighton, then only nine years old, is very confused. He doesn't know what to expect of war, and he is very unprepared for what happens to his family in the next five years. Torn apart by war, Jethro must deal with all the problems a man faces during a time of war, as well as his own, internal problems.This book has a good mix of historical events and ficitional scenes. Many of the battles that took place are described in letters to Jethro and his family, coming from his brothers at war. It is written in rural dialect, as this family would have spoken back in the 1860's, which is at times quite hard to understand. Though I did enjoy the book, I would reccomend it solely to those people who have a great interest in this time period."},{"Title":"Across five Aprils","review":"My reason for rating the book Across Five Aprils by Irene Hunt low was because this book had several words that were had to read example:from pages(51-52)&quot;you're too young to be married, Jenny; you're jest a little girl.' Oh. Jeth, it's horrible to be so young. Why does there have to be a war to take Shad away from me before I'm of an age that Pa thinks thinks is old enough fer marryin'?&quot; Several accounts of the book were true which was good. I did not like how Jethro who was at the age of nine in the beginning was shown as so mature and to me was percepted as a boy of a man's age. At the early parts of the book I recieved an opinion of Lincoln from the book and reasons were not explained for this opinion being formed. I would also recomend not reading this book in a school enviorment,the children do not like this plot in my past experiences. I have seen it used with seventh graders and feel they werent interested in the book's story. thank you -Mimi"},{"Title":"Across five Aprils","review":"So mabey it was a little dull.I had to read it for my book report.But it was a good book.Read it for yourself.You will either love it or hate it."},{"Title":"Across five Aprils","review":"I very seldom rate books, not because they're not good or they are good, just because I read so many. But this one deserved something... what, I'm not sure.I live in the south, and I'm proud of it. I love the way we talk and think, and sound. However, Irene Hunt -- an author who usually I like -- really took the phonetic spelling TOO far. Even I had problems understanding it at times, and that's the way people around here talk!Aside from that, I did find the book dull, and hard to get into.In short, Hunt has written some very good books (The Lottery Rose was brilliant) but this isn't one of them."},{"Title":"Across five Aprils","review":"I think that the book was kind of boring.

A good perspective of the other side of the war - the farms and villages."},{"Title":"Across five Aprils","review":"Irene Hunt describes life on a southern Illinois farm in much detail. Combine this with a dialect and you have a book not all readers will appreciate. However, some readers will find themselves caring deeply for young Jethro and all he struggles with - the loss of a brother, the responsibility of farm work, the hostility within the community, etc. They will also learn much about the Civil War as it unfolds throughout the story. This is an extremely well written book, truly deserving the Newbery Honor it won."},{"Title":"Across five Aprils","review":"I read all the reviews before buying this book from Amazon.com. I wondered why some said it was great while others said it was boring. I went ahead and bought it and loved every page!

Irene Hunt did a great job of telling what happened to families. Jethro was the only kid left after Tom, Eb, and Bill went to war.

I wish it would have never ended."},{"Title":"Across five Aprils","review":"Across Five Aprils is a very good, easy to read book. If you want a feel for what some familes went through during the Civil War, then you should read this book. If you only want dates and battle descriptions, this is not the book for you. Across Five Aprils gives you a perspective of the Civil War through the eyes of a nine year old boy. One who had to grow up quick and watch his family torn apart. These things really did happen and I couldn't stop thinking about my nephew, and how I'm glad he isn't having to face the same type of problems that Jethro had to face. This book should really be on school reading lists."},{"Title":"Across five Aprils","review":"Young adult readers may find that the book is boring, but this is usually because they do not read well or do not like to read. Jethro is a character that meets all of the requirements of a hero. The events reflect the treatment given families who suffered from division and prejudice. The local ruffians remind one of the Klan and their activities after the war in the South. Those who call the book boring have no understanding of the history of their country. If you are lead through the first two chapters, you then become engrossed in the story of Jethro and should learn a great deal about the worse war in our history and how we treated our own citizens."},{"Title":"Across five Aprils","review":"This is the stupidest and most boring book I have ever read.

They bought it.I was forced to read this in my stinking Advanced English class. None of the other eighth graders had to read it -- just like they didn't have to read Little Women (which I liked, apart from that last abysmal Mr. Bhaer romance...but I digress) or Call of the Wild (which had me seriously wondering whether London actually enjoyed the kind of gruesome scenes that have me covering my eyes and make my evil friend constantly read those scenes aloud to me). Anyway, that's not the point. The point is, maybe I just disliked it because of the -- ahem -- forced reading (which I think is a bad way to introduce someone to a great book, as it effectively clouds their opinion on that book FOREVER.) Maybe that's the case. But any book that, when I am assigned to write a \\"last chapter\\" in class, makes me title the said chapter \\"Conclusion: A Sarcastic and Satirical Mockery of Across Five Aprils (In Which Every Character I Loathed Is Ruthlessly Killed)\\" -- typically I tend to avoid such books.Maybe it's a masterpiece. Maybe I'm just really dumb, not to like such classic, wonderful, fantabulistic (not sure if that's a word) book. If I am, so is my entire Advanced English class, because not one person (excluding the teacher) did anything less than declare undying hatred for Jethro's plight.But, hey, it's a book. I honestly like some (most, actually) historical fiction, but generally I prefer middle ages, or renaissance at least. Except most kids' historical fiction of that era is altered a bit and called fantasy.Rating: A toss-up between Average and Terrible"},{"Title":"Across five Aprils","review":"Across Five Aprils is a horrible read. It is based around a colicky 10-year-old boy named Jethro who lives on a potato farm on southern Illinois during the Civil War. Throughout the book, he whines about how horrible war is and how he wishes his brothers would come home from it. The combination of his constant complaints, his occupation of potato planting, and the fact that the \\"big adventure\\" is a four hour trip to the town of Newton, make this book about as exciting as watching grass grow.Do not get me wrong, the book has some redeeming qualities. It provides historical information in the form of letters from the brothers at war, and from Jetho's one-room schoolhouse education. The other positive things about the book have, for the moment, escaped me. Nonetheless, they were surpassed by the book's slow movement and the author's poor writing, lack of originality, and conformity with the \\"war is bad\\" theme in all its political correctness.

The only part i liked was when there barn was burned down."},{"Title":"Across five Aprils","review":"I read this book when I was still learning how to speak English and I honestly could not put it down. This is one of the books my teacher made us read and was actually my third choice but read it anyway. The book takes you back to Civil War era in a Southern IL farm through the eyes of a nine year old boy, Jethro. He has brothers fighting for the Union Army but one chose to fight for the Confederate so his family was harassed by neighbors and people from other towns. The book is very accurate on historical facts and invites the reader to think and contemplate the views and beliefs of the North and South through the eyes of an innocent child. A reader who do not care to stop and reflect on the feelings and emotions of different characters will obviously find the book boring. But this is the opposite when you know how to appreciate a writer's creativity of bringing the story into your mind. The book also used spellings to closely portray how people in the setting speaks which actually caught my interest as I was still learning American English. Very interesting and entertaining at the same time. A must read for every American child who needs to learn his/her country's history and appreciate that he/she can actually read contrary to slaves in Civil War era who were denied that skill."},{"Title":"Across five Aprils","review":"Six brothers who live on a small farm in Southern Illinois durng the Civil War, have a family conflict. Four of the five brothers went to fight for the North and one brother fights for the South. Jethro, the youngest brother, has to stay home with his mother and sister to run the family farm. Everyone at home worries about the brothers at war. Getting letters helps the family know about the war battles. I gave Across Five Aprils a three star rating because it was slow moving in the beginning. If Hunt had added information about war scenes, the story would have been more interesting."},{"Title":"Across five Aprils","review":"My 8.8 year old son and I listened to the audio version of Across Five Aprils to fill \\"drive time\\" with something worthwhile. We both rated the book the same (3 out of 5 stars). At the first listen, I thought how soporific! and hoped my son would not complain. To my surprise Ms. Hunt garnered his attention for at least the 40 minute driving time on most days. The story gave an interesting perspective on the Civil War and was a catalyst for discussion on the war, slavery and the social issue of what to do with \\"them\\" after they're \\"free\\". My son enjoyed the southern dialect, but gives the rating primarily because the book was sad. If you enjoy Civil War history the audio version may be more palatable than the book."},{"Title":"Across five Aprils","review":"The Best book I have ever read. Across Five Aprils takes place on a Southern Illnois farm during the civil War. Jethro Creighton, a ten-year old farm boy is split between his favorite brother Bill, and his three other brothers John, Tom, and Eb. John, Tom, and Eb fight for the Union while Bill fights for the Confederates. Neighbors find out that Bill is fighting for the Confederates so they burn the Creighton's barn. Then Tom dies, Matt Creighton (Jethro's dad) has a heart attack, and Eb deserts. Now Jethro is faced with a man's work on the farm. I give Across Five Aprils 5 stars because it is a great drama story, it is well written, and it has the best wording I've ever seen. Read this book if you like the Civil War and and drama."},{"Title":"Across five Aprils","review":"This historical novel starts slowly; it also takes some getting used to the dialogue, which is written in rural dialect--liberally dispersed throughout the 12 chapters, but it is well worth the visual effort. We are introduced to a poor farm family in southern Illinois--a border state which is divided between Dixie and the Union, over issues such as Slavery and Secession. As war clouds rumble and decades of social and political friction ignite the War between the States, towns and even famlies are rent asunder by conflicting loyalties. If a man is going to risk his life for a cause, he ought to believe in it, but should his family suffer for that individual decision?Jethro is only 9 when the book opens, but his childhood is quickly terminated by disastrous national events which impact heavily on both his community and his large family. Tempers run high in the pro-Union town; some vicious hotheads resent the fact that one of Jethro's brothers joined up with the Re! bs. The boy and his entire family are persecuted for that action, even though other brothers join the Union army. One wrote home describing a battle: &quot;the suferin and scenes of death was sech to make a mans hart hate war.&quot; Which seems to be a major theme in this novel.Jethro comes of age too quickly during the five Aprils (or years) that span the Civil War. As the only able-bodied male left on the farm, he gradually assumes an increasingly adult role; still he deeply misses not only his brothers, but his sister's beau Shadrah, the gentle schoolmaster, who encourges him in geting an edcuation. With so many brothers invovled in the war, it is inevitable that some will not return. The story of the Creighton family is intense and holds one's attention, but excessive historical detail makes for uneven pacing, as though the author really wanted to write a treatise on the cause, horrors and course of the war--disguised as a novel.This book provides in-depth tre! atment of our great national shame, as well as a gripping p! ersonal story about ficitious characters who are very real. Hunt discusses such serious issues as slavery, Lincoln's two elections, Sherman's March to the Sea, Emancipation, Lincoln's assassination and the seesaw careers of various Generals. These details contribute to our complete unerstanding of the drama of the times, but water down the intensity of the storyline. Still I would recommend this book to any student of the Civil War, for the plot holds the reader's interest as we grow to care about this one, socially- insignificant family. A good introduciton to the Civil War era in a literary package."},{"Title":"Across five Aprils","review":"I'm going to be honest here, because there's a statute of limitations on grade school book reports. I wrote a book report on this one without ever actually READING it. Not sure if my teacher ever picked up on that. I think someone told me about it. Out of guilt, it has been on my bookshelf since, and I've promised myself I'd read it. It's short, why did it take so long? Well, there's TV afterall, quite distracting. But eventually I've gotten around to reading it, and I was OK with it. I'm sure in grade school I wouldn't have been. BORING would have been my chant. I've matured since then.It's not a face paced read. I don't think it was meant to be. What it does is reveal a world torn apart by events larger than the people who lived them. Events forced choices with real consequences. No one really knew for certain WHO was right. People had very little trust in the leaders of the day. And people you loved dearly often didn't make it home. And unfortunately for these people, who had no access to the latest from the front lines, who had no heliocopters following the troups, who had to wait for someone heading to town to bring a month old newspaper back to them, they really had to hang a lot on faith. Facts during the Civil War were awful hard to come by.I'm not sure I'd say this was spelled out in the book in dramatic fashion. Irene Hunt was going for realism, not shock value. She let the events stand on their own and if you're a good reader, you rise to understand just how compelling the subject matter is.Frankly, I'm glad I waited."},{"Title":"Across five Aprils","review":"I read this book aloud to my five children aged 7-16. We all loved this book and couldn't bear to stop at any chapter. This book provided excellent insight to both the North and South during the Civil War. I cannot imagine how anyone could rate this story low. We laughed, cried, and cheered throughout the whole thing. I HIGHLY recommend this book."},{"Title":"Across five Aprils","review":"I read this book and was riveted. I found it really interesting how this one family came to be divided during the cival war. Because they were on the boarder between the north and south their family ended up choosing sides. Two sons went to the north and one went to the south. They were still a family though. I thought the author did an excellent job including old letters and news articles that the family had had."},{"Title":"Across five Aprils","review":"It shows how the civil war effected a family that lives on a farm. Three of the sons go to fight in the army and out of them one dies and one becomes a deserter. They also have a another son that went to fight on the rebels side, so there were a group of people that hated the family for that. There daughter was in love with a man that went to war and he became wounded, but she eventually marrys him. Then there youngest son, Jethro, who was most loved, had to work on the farm after his father had a heart-attack. So I would say this is a touching story of a family and everything that happens to them on the way."},{"Title":"Across five Aprils","review":"Across Five Aprils is more than a story about a boy during the Civil War. It is the telling of how one family struggled and survived many difficulties suffered during a period of great turmoil in our nation's history. It is the story of how Jethro Creighton is forced to grow up quickly to become the sole source of food and shelter for his family, his brother's family and himself. It is an accurate historical account of the war as seen through the eyes of a child. I have read other reviews that describe the book as boring, unlikable and primitive. Anyone who has a negative comment about Across Five Aprils doesn't get it. They never will. This is a wonderful book that all children from ages 10 through 16 should be required to read."},{"Title":"Across five Aprils","review":"I love how Irene Hunt took the knowledge provided by her grandfather and put it together in this phonominal book.

Not only it's the best history based book, it also reflects the affection of Jethro towards his family, his brothers and, ofcourse the civil war. The incidents of the book were arranged sequentially in a very good way. It also described the civil war in a very nice way.Before I read this book, I didn't have much clear concept about the civil war. But later on when I read this book, the concept about the civil war became absolutely clear to me. This book helped to increase my general knowlodge. Not only that, it enhanced my thinking ability and it gave me a chance to see some important aspects in a different view.I love this book. And I would like to suggest the readers to read this book with their heart, and not to make irksome comments about it without understanding the story.To conclude, I would like to thank the writer of this book, Mrs. Irene Hunt for providing us such a nice book."},{"Title":"Across five Aprils","review":"When you first look at this book you think that it will be super boring, but it is super interesting. This book tells about how a family enters the world war in bad shape and exits gracefully. It has certains things that really made me want to cry, laugh or get mad. It shows alot of emotions. It really proved to me that you can actually do anything that you want to do as long as you try hard enough and believe in yourself and never to quite. I will tell you the truth when you first start to read this book it starts off really really bad but don't let that stop you from reading it because after you get to about the third chapter you start to realize alot of things that you would never believe would be true during 1890's.

Unfortunately when it was assigned the book was packed in boxes from our move so I bought the eBook version for the assignment! This fall I read this book aloud to my 7th grader as it was a parent-child discussion assignment.Set in southern Illinois, the story unfolds over five years, starting just before the Civil War and ending soon after the war ends. Jethro is the main character, a nine year old farmboy who is the baby in the family. Soon all his older brothers go off to war leaving his sister, he, and his parents to tend to the family farm which is a lot of work. Jethro's father falls ill and all the farmwork then falls to Jethro. Forced to grow up before his time given both the family's individual situation and the unrest in the country, this winds up being a coming of age tale. At the start of the story Jethro was a little boy and by the end he is a fourteen year old young man.Issues with the Civil War are debated and discussed in the story by the characters. An early situation is one of Jethro's brothers sympathizes with the Southerners and leaves the family to fight with the Rebels. This causes discontent, anger and hatred in the community, since they live in The North. Later the Creighton family is the target of hate crimes punishing them for the crime of the traitor son.Throughout the book we are informed of the happenings in the Civil War as the family hears news of various battles. Sometimes we read letters written by family members at the battlefront and other times we hear the opinions expressed in the newspapers. The opinions of the public about the Generals and President Lincoln are also shared as part of the story. I felt this showed that the issues were complicated and that even a family raised with the same values could not agree on which opinion was the right one. Later we wrestle with the issue of what should happen to soldiers who ran away from the battlefield and also what should happen to the traitors when the war was over.A subplot is the romantic love that develops between the fourteen year old girl and the schoolteacher who winds up fighting in the war. Her father had banned their marriage before he left to fight saying she was too young to marry. The girl matured in the war years and in the end we hope to see them united in marriage and hope he makes it through the war alive. (I'll not spoil the story...)I confess I am not a war story lover so in the parts that detailed the details of the battles my interest waned. However I was rivoted to the book and wanted to find out what happened to the Creighton family in the end. I would guess that any reader who likes battle details will be most interested in the book but honestly the story is solid and moves along quickly so even if you just want to know what happens to the individual people in the family and in the community you will enjoy the book.Character traits and virtues are clearly present in this historical fiction story. There is a lot to talk about regarding ethics and values as well as the topic of the Civil War. The book gave me a sense for what life was like for those who were both fighing in the war and those who were left at home struggling to make ends meet with most of the men in the family gone off to war.This is a solid, high quality historical fiction book that I think every middle school aged student should read, hopefully in conjunction with a study of The Civil War. I bet they'd learn a lot more by reading this than by reading a boring old textbook."},{"Title":"Across five Aprils","review":"This was one of the most boring books I have ever read.

What I remember the most about the book was the coverage of the events during the Civil War and a little bit of everything else. Also, I do remember that the book was confusing to follow at times. Having read the book again now, much of what I thought still holds up true. What is worse is that I now feel Across Five Aprils is a mess of a novel. Irene Hunt jumps around too much, providing a paucity of character development. Some of the characters are introduced, and then the author forgets about them. As the book claims to be about Jethro Creighton, Across Five Aprils slowly makes a transition from him being the central focus to the events of Civil War. And then the author ultimately lets the war to take over, leaving out the Creighton family and friends. At the same time, I am thinking, \\"Is Across Five Aprils supposed to be about the boy who lived through the Civil War or what?\\" Irene Hunt also fails to expand the details at a considerable length, causing gaps in description of the action, feeling, and incident. Whenever Irene Hunt brings up the battles of the Civil War, she gives a very, very superficial account of them, only letting a hand out on a life preserver by describing the kind of character the famous men were and what kind of a battle was it in terms of blood. While she lays out the events of the Civil War, I felt wholly unabsorbed due to the lack of Fear and Loathing '72: On Campaign Trial technique of mixing self and the events of the campaign that were happening at the same time. When I read that Hunter Thompson's book, I was simultaneously absorbing two sides of the story whereas in Across Five Aprils, Irene Hunt failed to provide the same treatment for me. All in all, Across Five Aprils is such a poorly developed novel."},{"Title":"Across five Aprils","review":"i had to read across five aprils for the start of 8th grade and it was so boring that i couldnt take it anymore.

It is just about to start and he is excited. Jethro and his family live in southern Illinois. So they live in a union state and have a union family. All of Jethro's brothers go into the war, and also his cousin. His brother John and Tom, and also his cousin Eb, go to fight for the union. However, his brother Bill makes a decision to fight with the confederacy. Jethro respects his decision and still loves him. While a lot of his family is out at war, Jethro is still at home and expected to work even harder out on the farm. All day he works in the heat, but he doesn't mind it so much. But things start going wrong. His brother Tom is killed in battle, it is very sad. While that happened, some of the men in the down are very angry that Bill went to the confederacy. They call him a traitor and said he deserted the union. Then they start taking action for it and start tormenting the Creighton's. After countless things they end up burning the Creighton's house down. Then Jethro finds Eb, he had deserted the union army. Jethro wrote a letter to President Lincoln to see what he needs to do. Jethro doesn't tell the family cause he doesn't want anyone to get in trouble. Later the war ends and Jethro gets his education. This book was ok, not the greatest I have ever read. There were things about it that I liked and there were things that I didn't like so much. I liked how it showed what war is really like. It showed that enemies aren't always your enemies. What I didn't like is that it was sort of boring.This book showed what war is really like. Sometimes people actually want to go into war. They do not see what it is really like. It's really hard to imagine what it is really like. At the begging of the book Jethro is excited about it, he thinks that it will be fun, cool, and interesting. Later on in the book he figures out that it is none of those. He realizes that war is horror, filled with pain and sorrow. His brother dies; he doesn't even know how any of the other ones are doing. This portrays the way war is in a great way.This book showed that your enemies aren't always really your enemies. A lot of them can actually be your friend, even if you don't know it. In this book there is a family that has a bad reputation. The son of the man who started the bad reputation killed Jethro's sister accidentally. But then Jethro goes on a ride with the father. He is frightened but then the man saves Jethro from people that want to hurt him, so really he is his friend. Also, even though some of Jethro's brothers are fighting each other, they aren't really enemies; they all still love each other.This book was sort of boring. Though many things happen in it it's hard to stay with it. There isn't too much action that you actually read about. You hear about things that happen but you never get to read like you were there. Such as all the battles, you just read about what happened, not as if you were there.This book was alright. I'm not sure I would read a sequel if it had one. There were just things about it that were good and some bad features also. I would recommend this book to people who like reading a lot and don't care if there is action or suspense in a book.-J.

Not only is it a story with sympathetic characters and a primarily-balanced views of the opposing opinions about the Civil War, but Irene Hunt has worked in descriptive passages that do more than describe. Many of the descriptive passages are symbolic, the symbols either referring to time-honored meanings (farm = green = growth,life; red = blood of sacrifice, the soldiers who sacrifice themselves for their cause of freedom for all) or Amer.History meanings (the silver poplars = silver = grey of Confederacy). Such underlying symbols are the sign of a good author, not action and adventure. Finally, as we learned during the late '60s and early '70s, the events on the &quot;home front&quot; are as important to the &quot;war effort&quot; as the events on the battle line. Hunt does an excellent job presenting the &quot;war&quot; on the home front."},{"Title":"Across five Aprils","review":"This book is not one of Irene Hunt's greatest novels. Having read the &quot;Lottery Rose&quot; first, I thought that this book would have been equally as interesting.

The main character is a young boy named Jethro Creighton who journeys from boyhood to manhood throughout the course of the book. He has to take on the responsibilities of the older boys when they leave. The community does not back the Creighton family because one of Jethro's brothers joins the Confederacy. This causes problems for the family as a whole. Needless to say, they stand by one another and stick together. The book has a few other little sub-plots, but none that are overly interesting.

As a Newberry Award Winner I knew it would be acceptable to our school. I was amazed at the ability of the book to affect both me and my students.

At one point I became saddened by the tragedy developing in this family & the students also became visibly saddened because they seemed able to transpose themselves into the role of the younger family member. As the family was divided between the North and South armies my students realized that families can be very different, but still be capable of loving each other.

I didn't want to read it, but I didn't have a choice. So, I just read 15 pages every night and did the homework assignment. However, as I got farther into the book, I started to read more than I needed to.I thought this book was a little boring because it was only about a 9-year-old peasant's life through the Civil War, but there were still parts of the story I enjoyed reading. My favorite part in this book was when Guy Wortman and his friends broke into Sam Gardiner's store. Sam had pretended to go on a business trip to St. Louise, but he was really hiding in his store. He had hit Guy right where he wanted to with buckshot, and held a lamp for the doctor."},{"Title":"Across five Aprils","review":"Across Five Aprils is a wonderful recollection of what went on during the Civil War, through the eyes of a child.I loved the way the book is written, since we rarely get to experience what children live and how they feel and react to terrible events that not only influence but change their lives forever.It is true, this book is not a history one explaining past events, but a novel about everyday life in a time of war, and as such it includes some not very accurate comments on what happened, but it does a wonderful job telling us what people percieved to be happening at the time.I liked the way the main character Jethro is developed, because I felt I could identify with him, his experiences and his suffering. Also, I thought some of the books passages were very realistic, such as his encounter with President Lincoln.Finally, this is a book about family, about different points of view, about tragedy, but most of all, about an event that changed this country forever."},{"Title":"Across five Aprils","review":"Across Five Aprils, by Irene Hunt is historical fiction. In 1861, Jethro Creighton is a nine year-old boy at the start of the American Revolution. This book tells how his family is affected throughout the war. His mother had twelve kids, but three of them died the year Jethro was born, the oldest daughter was murdered by a man in their town, and the oldest son went to California looking for gold. They haven't seen him since. This book, Across Five Aprils, goes through five years. In the beginning, all of Jethro's brothers and friends are drafted in the war. The war causes Jethro's family many hardships. First, his favorite brother, Bill, joins the war with the south, and not the north. Many towns people call Jethro's family &quot;Copperheads&quot; which means traitors. They think the Creightons are spies for the south. Gangs come to their house in the middle of the night and burn down their barn. Second, Jethro's father, Matt Creighton, has a heart attack, and becomes too weak to work the farm anymore. Time passes, and Jethro's family gets the news that Tom is dead. Eb, the Creightons' cousin who has lived with them for years, becomes a deserter. Jethro writes a letter to Abraham Lincoln asking him what to do about Eb. I like this book because i think it is very interesting. It gives a very accurate idea of what could happen to an average family during the American Revolution. I mostly liked the love story. Jenny Creighton, Jethro's 14 year-old sister, and Shad, Jethro's friend, are in love, and want to marry before the war, but Matt Creighton thinks Jenny is too young. When Shad becomes hurt, the family lets Jenny go to him and they get married. I don't like how sad this book is. Everyone in his family is dying or gone. Jenny, Jethro's sister, is my favorite characterb because I can relate to her. We are about the same age, and have many of the same problems. The scene when John and Bill see eachother for the first time in the war means something to me because it was very surprising. Most books are predictable, but this book was very surprising. This book is different from other books I have read because it is a historical fiction and I still think it is interesting. Usually these kind of books are boring, but this book kept my attention. I would recommend this book to other people. I tell them how interesting and exciting it is. After reading this book i have a few questions such as: What happened to John and Bill? Did they ever make it home? Does everyone in town hate Bill? Will anything happen to Eb when he returns to the war? The strongest reason I recommend this book is because it kept my attention. I would recommend this book to people of all ages."},{"Title":"Across five Aprils","review":"This Civil War era novel contains plenty of details on battles and generals for the history buff. But even for those only slightly interested in the Civil War, interesting perspectives are offered concerning both the North and South. Of course the main story of a young boy becoming a man during through the five Aprils of the war is the most compelling. The reader gets a frank picture of what daily farm-life was like, especially for a teenager carrying the responsibilities of a man. Young Jethro has to deal with heavy issues such as death, questions of loyalty, and the necessity of forgiveness. Highly recommended for 12 and up."},{"Title":"Across five Aprils","review":"Like many others, I was required to read this book in school. Unlike those who apparently have no attention span or appreciation of our country's history, I enjoyed it a great deal.Through Jethro's experiences, Ms. Hunt does an excellent job of touching on what the true heartache of this particular war was: brother against brother, with a difference in beliefs which split families apart and tore the nation."},{"Title":"Across five Aprils","review":"When I read the book, Across Five Aprils, the book kept me interested throughout the story. I can see a clear picture of the Civil War;hungry soldiers and hardworking farmers. Across Five Aprils is a story about the Civil War through the eyes of a nine year old boy,Jethro. I remember the part when Jethro's favorite brother,Bill leaves to fight with the South. I can feel the pain. I can picture Shadrach's and Jenny's happy face when they got married. I also felt Jethro's anger when Jenny had received a letter from Shadrach, while he was fighting the war, and would not show it to anyone. Jethro had misunderstood and soon realized that it was a private letter so he had forgiven Jenny quickly. During the confusion of the war, Jethro and his family had a hard relationship with each other,but when the war ended, the family would soon be united."},{"Title":"Across five Aprils","review":"This book is a coming of age tale for southern Illinois preteen Jethro, who's hard-working farm family is forced to face the American Civil War. Jethro's schoolteacher, brothers, and cousin (who later deserts) fight for the North while his favorite brother fights for the South. The family must face the horrors of the war from the home front while also facing the prejudices of the zealots of home. The book would be incredibly difficult for young readers because of the dialect. Also, the plot is more tell than show. But, still, a powerful human tale of a border-state family during a tragic period. Grade: B"},{"Title":"Across five Aprils","review":"I read this book in 5th grade and thought it extremely boring. I recently re-read it in college and still think it is. There are many elements of family time and it does portray the way families were torn apart by choosing sides."},{"Title":"Across five Aprils","review":"I found this book to be a wonderful introduction to the Civil 'War. It has spurred a desire to learn more about early American history, much of which I have forgotten over the years. I enjoyed the dialect very much, and found the characters to be very well drawn, especially 'Jeth'. I was sad to see the book end, and will definitely make it a part of my library. I couldn't part with it!"},{"Title":"Across five Aprils","review":"I thought this was an excellet book. I have only read it once but plan on buying it very soon. Across Five Aprils tells of how young Jethro Creighton and his family cope with the bad and good news duringthe Civil War.

GO READ THIS BOOK.......IT IS EXCELLENT......MY FAVORITE BOOK OF ALL TIME!"},{"Title":"Across five Aprils","review":"A civil war is going on around the country, in the book Across Five Aprils, by Irene hunt. A young boy , named Jethro, is changed by it. Jethro is left by all of his brothers, during the Civil War, in a farm house, in southern Illinois. He has a very big family, of which he only knows half of, being the youngest of twelve children. Jethro is left for five years to put up with the bitterness of people who despise one of his brothers for being a Confederate. He is not alone. His mother, sister, Jenny, Father, and sister-in-law all deal with the same problems he is going through. During this time of war, Jethro matures and realizes the results of war, and learns to deal with the harshness of it all. A neighborhood of old enemies is brought together again by a war that has torn neighborhoods apart. This is a wonderful book and I would recommend it to anyone that likes Civil War stories. Though it is not a real story, it is based on the authors memories of her grandfather's stories, which are just as great as this story itself."},{"Title":"Across five Aprils","review":"Across Five Aprils is a well, written book and you should read it, but it may be too complex for young kids. Jethro Creighton shows true leadership in his early life as his brothers went to war, either fighting for the Union or the Confederates. When most people think of Abraham Lincoln, we think of him as a president EVERYONE liked from the beginning. Well, actually, he was not. Although he came out good in the end, the beginning was a rough one and during the election of 1860, he didnt even gain a majority in electoral votes, and ten southern states didnt even have his name on the voting ballot. This all has to deal with the coming of the war and the setting of this book. I rated this book a 4 because some parts of the book were a bit confusing, unless you reread it over again."},{"Title":"Across five Aprils","review":"i first tried reading this book when i was 8 or 9 because there was nothing else in the house that i hadnt read. Even then i had a fairly high reading level, and so most books like this were no problem. But this one i just couldn't read. It was moving too slowly in the beging. I tried reading it now at 14, and i found it more interesting and easier to read."},{"Title":"Across five Aprils","review":"I think this book is really good. I like the characters espically Jethro because hes determined, shy, and outgoing, he likes to help people. this book has also many other interesting characters, you might like, there are also many different parts there are scary, sad, mad, glad, and cheerful. It teachs you different things about the civalwar and racism. And thats why I like this book."},{"Title":"Across five Aprils","review":"Ok...I'm not going to lie here..This book was down rite awful..It was the worst book i'v ever read!

This book takes place in the united states wile the civil war is going on. It tells the story of a man named jeth and his family. It thells what they have to go through during the war. the Creighton family witch jeth belongs to lives in southern Illinois.It shows there feelings obout war from the begining to the end. Even though jeth and his family are closer to the south they do not want the union to split apart. So jeth goes to serve in the union army. The book does nicly show how friends and famils get streched apart by the war. This book is very confusing at parts. When I read the back of the book it looked alot better. Even though this is a boring book I do not feel it is the worst I ever read."},{"Title":"Across five Aprils","review":"Across Five Aprils is not the wonderful book people claim it is. The launguage is crude, hard to understand and makes a mockery of the North in the Civil War era.

The only reason why I read this book was because I had to read it for my english class at school. If it wasn't for the class there is absolutely no way I would have read this book. the teachers thought that we should read a civil war novel for english because were doing a civil war unit in social studies. Before we even started the novel I thought we were doing plenty of civil war, but no we have to do even more civil war. I probably wouldn't have such a hard time with this book if I didn't have to do school work with. I had such a hard time understanding some parts of this book because the family had so many people in it. I struggled to read this book every night not only because it was boring, but because I had to try to understand it so I could do the work that went with it. The only thing that happens in this book is in the begging the civil war is about to start and then some people from this family fight in the war and then they write letters to the family. Thats litteraly the only thing that happens in this book. In my opinion this book was boring and I would not recomend reading it, unless you really want to because you have nothing else to do."},{"Title":"Across five Aprils","review":"Across Five Aprils by Irene Hunt was so boring!

My favorite part was when I got to the end and the torture was over. I'm a HUGE reader and I absolutely love books, but I think this is the only story I can say that I didn't like it AT ALL.I did find one good thing about it. I'm a person who has problems falling asleep. I started reading the assigned chapter right before bed, and it was a very good sleep medication; it was that boring.It had no story line whatsoever besides a detailed account of Civil War battles (and letters home that had such bad grammar and spelling it was painful to read them). All the characters were flat and unrealistic. It was the worst book I ever had to read.Please don't waste your time on it."},{"Title":"Across five Aprils","review":"It's a rich look at life on Southeastern Illinois farm during the Civil War. Young Jethro is forced to grow-up too soon and wrestle with questions adults don't have clear answers for. While the author doesn't shy away from addressing the harsh realities of war, she doesn't linger over them. Much her characters, she acknowledges them and moves on."},{"Title":"Across five Aprils","review":"OK, well I read this book, or at least I tried to, in 8th grade, and it is the most boring book I have ever had to read. It seemed like it always took place in a field where the family was farming. I had to stop reading it after a few chapters because it was excessively boring (watching corn boil on the stove took hold of my attention more than this book did) and I was not in the least bit interested in reading it, let alone finding out what happens in the book (at the time it seemed like the plot was nonexistent), it was not until my teacher explained what was going on that I realized it could have been so much more interesting. Sure the family's troubles make for a great story, but the author just did not create a good story. I'm sorry Irene Hunt, and I realize that you put a lot of work and effort into this book, but it just didn't do it for me. Although I must admit that I did not give this book a fair chance, I would say that I would have been able to appreciate it much better if I had read it when I was older."},{"Title":"Across five Aprils","review":"The book Across Five Aprils, by Irene Hunt, is a story about the Civil War. It takes place in the early 1860s in a rural area of Illinois. It is about a young boy named Jethro Creigton. At first, Jethro likes the idea of the war and thinks it is cool. Shortly afterwards he changes his mind about that for a very good reason. Jethro's brothers (Bill and Tom), his cousin (Eb), and his teacher (Shadrach, who Jethro really liked and is romantic with Jethro's sister, Jenny) go off to war. Bad things happen to all of these people in the war. First of all, Bill (who is Jethro's favorite brother), fights for the South. This makes many people angry at the Criegtons, since they lived in Illinois. Tom gets killed in the war. Luckily for the sake of the Criegtons who are not at war, Jethro finds out that it was not Bill who killed him. Later on, Eb runs away from the army. Jetro finds him in the woods, and takes care of him for a little. Then he makes it so it is ok for Eb to go back to the army by writing a letter to the president. In the end of the book, Shardrach gets hurt and Jenny visits him in Washington and marrys him. The war ends, and Jenny and Shadrach go home and live with Jethro. I would never recommend this book to anyone. It was extremely hard to understand, which was partially due to the characters' country grammar. I had to re-read many pages and sentences before I could truly understand what was going on. The plot was very hard to grasp because of this. I found the book to be extremely boring."},{"Title":"Across five Aprils","review":"I REALLY DON'T KNOW WHERE TO START WITH THIS BOOK. I AM IN THE 7th GRADE AND I HAD TO READ IT FOR SUMMER READING.

THANK YOU."},{"Title":"Across five Aprils","review":"Across Five Aprils obviously brings you through five aprils.It also brings you into the realm of the mid 1800's through the eyes of a low class child from the north,Jethro Creighton.Whats great about the plot is the sake of realism with bits of unbelievable events that stir the drama up.Keep in mind this is a childrens book so it doesn't go too in-depth.The depth offered though isn't bad as it's a fairly short book.Jethro Creighton is an average boy growing up during a war.His brothers get sent off to war causing controversy.Jethros household becomes very unstable and soon he ends up doing tasks as tough as his father Matt Creighton.This book emphasizes the fact that he had too grow up during a difficult point in history and needed to mature faster then others his age.It shows the wisdom that he obtains in those 4 years and how his opinions on war change.Across Five Aprils has some of the most diverse characters truly showing it's ok too be different and stand up for what you believe in much like Bill Creighton and his joining to the reb side.Besides following Jethro's life you get filled in on some historical events and some of the brutal battles that took place as the campaign marched onward to much of Americas destruction and the death of a memorable president.The only issue i noticed with this book is the pace, at sometimes it will hit you with all these massive issues, and other times it moves so sluggishly that at the end of a chapter you are bored out of your mind.With all that in mind this is a really great and many learn to aprreciate this book them ore they read it much like how i did."},{"Title":"Across five Aprils","review":"This book is about a boy named Jethro. He was the youngest in the family and his mother favored him. He lived in a small farm in southern Illinois. The Civil War was going on and lots of Jethro's brothers were in the war. One of his brothers joined the Confederate army. He became mature during the years of the war. One of his brothers died in the war and one was held as a prisoner. He considered President Abraham Lincoln as a friend while many of the farmers hated him. He really hoped the chaos would end and live in peace.My favorite part of the book is when Shad and Jenny married. Jenny was Jethro's sister and Shad was Jethro's schoolmaster. Jenny loved Shad for a long time, but her parents refuse them to get marry. When Shad was hurt badly in the war, Jenny's parents decided to let them marry. Jenny was very happy to be the wife of Shad.I like this book because it gives us information about the Civil War in the United States. It also showed you how the people that time think of Abraham Lincoln and how a family lived during such hard times. When you read this book, it feels like you went back through time and experienced the war yourself. I recommend this book to anyone that is interested in the Civil War."},{"Title":"Across five Aprils","review":"This book is a very good book. It is about a boy who enlists in a war.

It is in the 1800's and Jethro, Ellen, and Matt live on a farm. The war is going on, so Jethro enlists in the war. His father never went to war because, he wasn't born in that part of the time. But Jethro was, so he enlists in the war. The character traits of some of the main characters, are a very important part of the story. Some character traits of Jethro are that he is very hard working and he is a potato farmer. He is also one of the main characters. Matt is Jethro's father, and he is strong and very hard working too. Ellen is Jethro's mother. She is the lady of the house, so she does the washing, and house stuff. She is very hard working too. All of their family is very hard working. Those are some character traits. Well that is the setting, and some Character traits. So this is a good book.

It is amazing how such a concise book could incorporate evaluations of Eastern systems of thought and practice while demonstrating their underlying theoretical foundations by discussing their Western equivalents. Unlike other academic texts on Eastern thought, Sakhai enlivens us to rethink the mysogonist, self-destructive and normalizing tendencies of Christianity, Islam and Sufism which intellectuals often overlook when seeking to obscure or reform these supposed pathways to salvation. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn about Eastern thought, and on the impact ideologies have on everyday social/individual practices."},{"Title":"Communicative Reason & Medieval Iranian Thought","review":"Kambiz Sakhai was born in Tehran Iran, in the decade of the 1970. He received his elementary and secondary schooling in Tehran, and continued his studies in Sociology and Social research at the university of Rome, Italy. Following completion of his studies in Rome, he enrolled at New York's Columbia university, in their Ph.D. program in Iranian cultural history.The areas in which Dr. Sakhai has conducted research include: Medieval Islamic and Zoroastrian Thought, Anti-Islamic trends of thought in Sufism, Sociology and Soviet legal thought during the twenties. The common theme of his work is the analysis of the revolutionary theory and practice, and emancipatory struggles of the poor and powerless people of the world over the centuries.Dr. Sakhai's interest in the field of Iranian studies and specifically in Zarathushtrianism has been rooted in the existential questions that had occupied his mind since he was a young student. He had always pondered the meaning of life, truth and justice, and was always yearning to comprehend the reason for all the pain and misery in the world and why people were not able to find a solution to the problem of evil. He has been seeking to do something to help the poor, powerless and the oppressed people. Quoting Dr. Sakhai, \\"I learned very soon that neither the Western capitalist solution that was based on instrumental reason and utilitarian ethics nor the Oriental mystical approach that preached flight from that type of rationality and that type of ethics provided a satisfying answer. I found my answer in the life affirming, emancipatory and communicatively rational approach of Zarathushtra.\\" Dr. Sakhai's reason for selecting his field of Ph.D. studies derived from the above considerations. In his own words, \\"There were obviously other influences but Zarathushtrianism was among the main ones.\\""},{"Title":"Communicative Reason & Medieval Iranian Thought","review":"Kambiz Sakhai is one of the most innovative thinkers amongst the Iranian intellectuals today. He has been reared in the sociological tools of Marx and Weber while much of the spirit of his though remains indebted to Kant and Critical theory. He is one of the few Iranian intellectuals who has remained an advocate of the poor and oppressed and stood against capitalism."},{"Title":"New to North America: Writing by U.S. Immigrants, Their Children, and Grandchildren","review":"I found the book fasinating especially from a immigrant point of view. The hardships, aspirations and dreams so valued from previous generations and the correlations to current immigrants. There lacks an economic impact comparative to previous generations and a lack or comparison of a puritan work ethic implied or a philosophy of a new found loyalty to a country that supplies the life blood of a new age family, but the points are well made and reads as a sincere point of view from the immigrant point of view. Very well written, and gets the writers points of view across. It would be refreshing to see the socio-economic impact, positive or negative related in the collection, but this does not appear to the writers intention. I commend the writer for the boldness, honesty, and compasion throughout the collection.I would recommend this book based on the writers collection of events that translate to the concerns of all citizens. The writer is articulate in view and has taken great care of letting the reader decide what moral decisions and implications are present in our view points in the current social environment.Great Read!!!!"},{"Title":"New to North America: Writing by U.S. Immigrants, Their Children, and Grandchildren","review":"\\"I tell you this because when I picked these berries I never dreamed I would be speaking at a college that would someday rise up in view of where I knelt in the dirt.

Its strength is in illustrating potential pitfalls and what you can expect to see after implementing a particular step (e.g., if your number of documented changes decreases, you may want to start searching for unauthorized ones). If you're not familiar with the basics of ITIL, I would recommend a book/course from Art of Service or the official ITIL books to help you gain a firm understanding of the relevant terminilogy and concepts.

This book is invaluable to getting everyone rowing in the same direction with understanding how and why complex computer systems break.One of the things that is always hard to explain to both developers and management is the importance of managing change. It is almost always unplanned change that causes your major problems and Spafford explains this in a funny and accessible way. It is always a challange to \\"push back\\" at the business and make them understand the real cost of not having adequate testing and controls in place. This book really helped me both clarify your own thinking on the topic and make a good case to the developers and business owners. This book would especially be useful for someone who worked at a start-up or other unstructured environment and who didn't know where to start first.I bought 15 copies and gave one to every programming manager at my job as well as all my direct reports.

In IT there is an exception to every rule, but The Visible Ops is something that could help any IT group. The eye opening statistic is that 80% of outages are operator induced. That's a huge number and obviously leaves a lot of room for improvement. This book goes over the basic steps that are required to stabilize and improve your data center. It's short (95) pages and offers an ITIL compliant framework for making your changes (or more specifically, stopping them from being made with out forethought). I started as a system administrator and I hate the idea of following procedures instead of \\"just fixing things\\".Stability is what your customers look for in their computing environment as well as flexibility. Are you providing both?"},{"Title":"The Visible Ops Handbook: Starting ITIL in 4 Practical Steps","review":"The information contained in this book is important. As an example, the book quotes Stephen Elliot, Senior Analyst with Interactive Data Corporation (IDC) as showing that on average 80% of IT system outages are caused by operator and application errors. The authors present many highly standardized and effective methods to control and continuously improve software systems. The topics discussed include issues and indicators, specific steps to solve issues, audible controls and many helpful hints. I highly recommend this book to engineers and Lean Six Sigma professionals, who are team members for IT development projects, are working on IT systems which need to be integrated within their process workflows or for quality assurance applications."},{"Title":"The Visible Ops Handbook: Starting ITIL in 4 Practical Steps","review":"Great book.

Implementing a process requires not only the definition of the process but efficient management of that process. For the most part, this book provides practical ideas and good descriptive examples of real world situations.This is also a great book for anyone studying for the ITIL Certification Exam. It is even better for someone that is trying to implement some of the ITIL best practices into their organization. I would recommend it as a reference for Senior Management and other IT leaders in IT operations.It was quite interesting to learn about the author's concept of DSL (Definitive Software Library). Some of the ideas presented in this book can be viewed as radical & extreme. For example it indicates that if a team member makes a unauthorized change to the system without getting approval first, he should be demoted to a position on the team where he can no longer make any changes. Depending on the impact of the change, this might be warranted but doing so, just to \\"reinforce the process\\" seems too excessive."},{"Title":"The Visible Ops Handbook: Starting ITIL in 4 Practical Steps","review":"The book provides a great taste about how to improve your IT department.

It is also a good quick measure of/sanity check for folks who want to see where their organization currently stands. Quick read. Relevant. Very helpful."},{"Title":"The Visible Ops Handbook: Starting ITIL in 4 Practical Steps","review":"I read The Visible Ops Handbook because a friend told me his company was considering integrating the booklet's ideas into their product line. I had not heard much about the Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL), but I was familiar with the problems caused by poor administration. I perform network incident response (IR), so I am often asked to solve problems in three days that clients have been confronting for three months or years. After reading Visible Ops, I will recommend it to every IR client who asks me to remediate intrusions.Simply put, Visible Ops provides four simple steps to stop the IT insanity. The book offers a quote attributed to Albert Einstein on p 42: \\"Insanity is doing the same thing over and over, and expecting a different result.\\" Many organizations have unintentionally embraced this concept, continuing to pursue the same broken administration techniques and wondering when they will ever stop fighting fires. The Visible Ops process is the answer they have been pursuing.My favorite aspect of the book is its narrative examples. These contain quotes by real administrators and managers and address problems like \\"the DHCP server, running on a DNS server, built four years ago by a college intern, that no one touches nor understands.\\" Another similarly amusing (and sad) section presents seven steps in the \\"spectrum of change\\" on p 36. This ranges from the poor end, like \\"Oblivious to Change: 'Hey, did the switch just reboot?'\\" and \\"Aware of Change: 'Hey, who just rebooted the switch?'\\" to the most mature option, \\"Managing Change\\".In terms of the booklet's advice, I found it rock solid, especially this recommendation: when a problem occurs, don't log into the infrastructure and begin troubleshooting. Rather, check to see who made the last configuration change. Since \\"80% of IT and system outages are caused by operator and application errors,\\" and not intruders, those confronting an incident should always begin by looking at themselves, and not outside \\"hackers.\\"I also found Appendix A, Preparing for Audits, to be a succinct and helpful look at the worldview of the auditor. The \\"Controls 101\\" section described preventative, detective, and corrective controls, which reminded me of the protection, detection, and response phases of the security process. Advice on p 70 also made sense in light of the debate over intrusion detection systems vs \\"intrusion prevention systems\\": \\"Document your preventative controls, and have detective controls in place to show they work.\\" If your IPS is both a preventative and detective control, how do you check when it has failed?I found few reasons to dislike Visible Ops, but I had enough issues to give only four stars. First, the book needs to be printed in a bigger form factor. The problem with Visible Ops is that its small size (5x7) reduces some of the fonts used in various tables to be almost illegible. Second, the booklet is too internally repetitive. This is especially true in the appendices, where points continue to reappear.Third, I fear that the book, along with all those taking an audit-centric approach to security, sees controls as the be-all, end-all of the security process. It seems too much attention is paid to preventing incidents, with not enough resources devoted to detection and response. Corrective controls, for example, do not receive the attention they deserve. Rebuilding from bare metal is the recovery action of choice in Visible Ops, but rebuilding another vulnerable server strays towards the definition of insanity mentioned earlier.Overall, I recommend everyone associated with IT, security, operations, and audit read Visible Ops. The booklet is small enough to read in a few hours, since the main material and Appendix A ends on p 73. I look forward to more extensive materials from this excellent team of authors."},{"Title":"The Visible Ops Handbook: Starting ITIL in 4 Practical Steps","review":"Visible Ops gets to the essence of good control practices for today's IT environment.

The authors do not drift off on tangents or lose sight of the scope of the book - they present a realistic starting point and four clearly defined steps that will move you forward towards implementing ITIL.I like the emphasis on change and release management, which (to me) is the keystone for ITIL. I also like how the steps have clear objectives that can be measured, as well as exit criteria to assure that each step is completed before moving to the next.This is not a comprehensive book on implementing ITIL, but a starting point. More importantly, the approach set forth in the book will significantly improve the operational process capabilities of most IT organizations regardless of whether implementing ITIL is a goal.Additional information about the book and the approach can be found on the authors' site. You can get to the site by pasting the ISBN number - B00006CNEY - into the search box, selecting all products, and clicking the GO button.This book is a welcome and important addition to the ITIL body of knowledge because it cuts through to the essentials and provides you with a clear path to getting started."},{"Title":"The Visible Ops Handbook: Starting ITIL in 4 Practical Steps","review":"This very impressive work is based on sound fundamentals.

Its premise is based on Gartner research stating that 80% of unplanned downtime is caused by people and process issues and 80% of the time spent in resolving downtime is unproductive and there are systems administration principles and activities that can mitigate. The problem with Visible Ops is that the volume of content warrants a whitepaper, yet the authors seemingly add filler to justify the $22 sales price.The authors are one of the first to offer in print some solutions for infrastructure support that validate what IT infrastructure managers have been doing for years. The ideas of rebuild v. repair, \\"source control\\" of infrastructure builds, repeatable infrastructure build processes are right on. Yet instead of case studies and further exploration, we get multiple pages of testimonials, a forward, an introduction, a multiple-page TOC, a mere 40 pages of content which include repetition, constant summarization, and more testimonials, and 30 pages of appendices of largely copyrighted and incomplete material. As a final insult, there are ads on the front and back covers. At least one of the authors sells tools to remedy some of the problems mentioned in \\"Visible Ops\\" and it seems he is hedging his bets by charging for materials that should be marketing and product literature.Why not give more detailed examples and case studies, expound on the CMDB, give some ideas on organizing builds or address other ITIL areas? This is *great* stuff here, but I feel like it has been cheapened. Regardless, I recommend \\"Visible Ops\\" because it addresses common and significant problems and solutions that are rarely addressed elsewhere."},{"Title":"The Visible Ops Handbook: Starting ITIL in 4 Practical Steps","review":"I manage the Configuration Management process for a major credit card company.

It makes me wonder how many more books I will buy via Kindle."},{"Title":"The Visible Ops Handbook: Starting ITIL in 4 Practical Steps","review":"There are a noticeable number of first and second letter swapped typos in the text. Overall message structure could have been improved as well. Tighter editing would have made this book even more compact.I'm unsure why Jim Kimball said the Kindle edition was unreadable as it seemed fine to me.Best parts of the book are about the characteristics of high performing organisations and the overall approach, though for a book called Visible Ops, there's not a lot on visual management. If you're thinking about improving your IT operations, this is a good place to start."},{"Title":"The Visible Ops Handbook: Starting ITIL in 4 Practical Steps","review":"This little book provides a very logical, implementable approach to get your ITIL transformation off the ground. It provides a methodology for applying controls early...where most required, and then reinvesting resources to attack the cause of the pain....allowing a demonstrated \\"quick win\\" in order to keep the momentum going. I provided this book to my IPRC instructor and he gave it a solid two thumbs up, as well. A quick read....that might just help you crack the code on how to get started in a meaningful way."},{"Title":"A Simple Life","review":"Rosie Thomas's story of a mothers love for the child she gave up for adoption is heartwarming. Her shame of this secret eats away at her until she finds the courage to do something about it. Her characters spring to life and are so real you can &quot;see&quot; them. In this audio version, Clare Higgins switches from character to character with ease and panache. Dinah's life comes full circle, and I'm so glad I was along for the ride. A must!"},{"Title":"A Simple Life","review":"I've read many books by Rosie Thomas and thoroughly enjoyed them - all very different though, but all remarkably well researched. I enjoyed A Simple Life too, but not one of my favourites by her. I found it a little implausible in parts and somewhat predictable. I bought it on the basis of rave reviews by other readers, so was slightly disappointed. However, if you're looking for a good read, which is not too taxing, then this will be good for you. Maybe a good one to put in a suitcase to read on the beach."},{"Title":"Linda Goodman's Sun Signs","review":"I read this book years ago my children were small.

My wife and I keep it handy for reference when situations arise with our friends and family as well as in the workplace. If you're remotely considering buying this book, you will absolutely not regret it. I consider this a must have for all the people I care about. No need to read front to back, just dive in anywhere to figure out why people are the way they are and do the things they do and say the things they say, etc."},{"Title":"Linda Goodman's Sun Signs","review":"Do you know and understand yourself as well as you think you do? Do you have trouble understanding the behaviors of loved ones, co-workers, friends and neighbors? This book will help to make your live so much easier, because it provides you with a deeper understanding and compassion for yourself and others--for to know someone is to love them!"},{"Title":"Linda Goodman's Sun Signs","review":"The description that is provided for each sign (for the Woman, Man, Child...) is so on point.

However, when I did I was pleased with the book. Very considerate seller. Would use again."},{"Title":"Linda Goodman's Sun Signs","review":"I can't believe how accurate these signs were for myself and my kids. The book was easy to read and follow. I wish I would have read it when my kids were babies so I would have had a better understanding of their personalities and before I married so I might would have reconsidered. Definitely 5 stars."},{"Title":"Linda Goodman's Sun Signs","review":"I owned a copy of this book over twenty years ago, then gave it away two years ago when I moved. I needed it again, it's just such a good reference, so thanks, Amazon."},{"Title":"Linda Goodman's Sun Signs","review":"I read this when I was a 18 years old, amazed at how accurate it was, but also amazed at how USEFUL it is. While it's never 100% accurate, it is filled with insights into your own sign and the sign of others that is just too useful. Reading it again at the age of 40 I was even MORE impressed. I highly recommend this book, for it's usefulness, humor, and entertainment. You won't be sorry."},{"Title":"Linda Goodman's Sun Signs","review":"If you're fascinated with astrology, like me, you should buy this book. If you're skeptical of the amazing accuracy of astrology, then you should definitely buy this book. Author Linda Goodman will turn you into a believer with her uncanny perceptiveness of each Sun sign. When the term \\"Sun sign\\" is used, it means the zodiac sign that the Sun was in while you were born. For roughly a month, each of the 12 signs passes through the Sun. For instance, I'm a Leo since I was born in between July 23 and August 22 and that's the time the Sun is in Leo every year. Every planet in your birth chart represents something different about you. The Sun, being the center of the universe, naturally represents \\"the center of you\\". Its your essential self and personality. Its the most important planet in your birth chart, and the sign you would tell people you are if they happen to ask.Goodman acknowledges in her introduction that you may not possess every single trait of your Sun sign. Some people's Sun sign traits are less conspicuous than others that share their sign. This is because of the other factors in your birth chart, like your Moon sign (which rules your emotional nature and instinctive reactions) and your Ascendant, also known as the rising sign (which rules your appearance and the way you consciously present yourself). These factors may temper or hide certain traits, but your Sun sign's characteristics are always present to some degree (whether secretly or openly). Read this book and you be in awe and probably have a good laugh when you read about your sign and your loved ones' signs. You'll finally understand why your Gemini daughter seems to have two (or more) different personalities, why your Taurus husband is so stubborn, why your Sagittarius boss is always innocently pointing out your mistakes, and why your Aries employee can't seem to take direction very well. They all just can't help themselves. Its part of their nature. As a Leo, I was amused at but couldn't argue with my description: arrogant, attention seeking, dramatic, warm-hearted, financially impulsive.The ironic thing about this book is author Linda Goodman inadvertently revealed her sign through her writing. She's an Aries: assertive, confident, lovable yet self-absorbed. Read this and notice how long the 'Aries woman' section is compared to the others. As she said, Aries love to talk about themselves. This book was written in 1968, which goes to show how accurate astrology is. This information is still very relevant and useful today. The examples in the 'man' and 'woman' sections are dated, however, since this book was written before the feminist and gay rights movements. The celebrity examples are not relevant to this day and age either (except for the icons like Marlon Brando, Marilyn Monroe, Elvis Presley, etc.). But as far as having a fun read and an astrological education, you can't go wrong."},{"Title":"Linda Goodman's Sun Signs","review":"I first read this book when I was a sophmore in high school. I loved it. It was one of my favorites and I shared it with many friends. I've read through it a few times since and though I'm slightly more skeptical and analytical now I still find it to be a fun read. I think you can identify with many of the things stated in this book and its fun to get familiar with other Sun Sign characterisitcs and try to guess different people you meet. Its a fun little game I like to play now. I recommend this book if you are interested in astrology and sun signs, however I think its important to not take it too seriously and just enjoy it. (***This would probably make a great gift for a teenage girl!)"},{"Title":"Linda Goodman's Sun Signs","review":"Wow! This book is amazing. I have owned it for many years, and although the examples in the book are slightly time dated, I would still recommend this book to anyone interested in astrology, no matter if it is your hobby or profession. As a matter of fact I buy this book for everyone I know.... This way they will stop calling me and asking me to read chapters to them over the phone! This book is a great way to tell others about yourself because it accurately describes every detail about you. It is also a way to get to know those around you. This book allows the reader to know how to treat others based on a person's sign. For example, you can better understand your family members, friends, romantic partner, co-workers, and even your boss! You can get to \\"know\\" people before you actually \\"know\\" them based on their sign! Even if you do not believe in astrology, this book is very interesting and fun to say the least. It is a great source of entertainment too! Linda Goodman MAY just make you into a believer after all."},{"Title":"Linda Goodman's Sun Signs","review":"i really enjoy reading about the sun signs and about my friends and read how they are"},{"Title":"Linda Goodman's Sun Signs","review":"Quite simply, this is The Bible of astrology. It is the standard by which all others should be measured."},{"Title":"Linda Goodman's Sun Signs","review":"I was in a class for beginner firefighters, learning about the Incident Command System in the fire service. As my instructor was discussing interpersonal skills within the overall aspects of the fire service, he mentioned that the best book he ever found for dealing with the guys (and ladies) in his firehouse was this very book. He said it had helped him to solve conflicts, to find his people's strengths to be able to use them to the advantage of the group as a whole, and to better understand the people who made up his shift and his superior officers. I remember writing the title and author down, went home that night, looked it up and purchased it. I have never regretted it since. I may lose other books, but this one, I always know where it is. If you have a tough boss, a co-worker you can't understand, a close friend you want to help better, etc., this is the book to understand just about everyone. Hope you enjoy it as much as I have."},{"Title":"Linda Goodman's Sun Signs","review":"I have referred to this book over &amp; over for 25 years. every time i have fallen in love-your words endeared me to him. when i fell out of love &amp; luck-your words rang true. they made me like &amp; respect myself again. you have a loving poignant inner sight into the positive side of humanity. when my wheels spin and i feel calloused and cavalier-i need your perspective.who else would say &quot;hitch your wagon to a star&quot;words of hope and joy that will ring true through the ages. when i first picked up the book-it was a fad to be into astrology. but when i found myself or someone dear to me in need of inspiration and a sense of self-worth, i once again turn to &quot;the sun signs&quot;if i had one goal in my life, it would be to write words that would echo true the timeless gift of loving one's fellow man-the way you did Linda.Wherever you are, you are one of my heroes."},{"Title":"Linda Goodman's Sun Signs","review":"What can I say? There are some excellent books and resources avaliable on the subject of astrology. However I promise nothing holds a candle to Ms. Goodman's work. This is money very well spent. You will find yourself refering to this book for years, and each time it is somehow fresh and as meaningful as the first time. I have bought this at least 20 times over the past 13 years....I either give them away, or Im so often travelling with it that it has been lost once or twice, which is always tragic. I CANNOT LIVE WITHOUT THIS BOOK AND NEITHER SHOULD YOU! Excuse me for rasing my voice I get excited. Its a great book and if you are not familiar with it then Im excited for you. First of all the information is just dead on accurate. Now each persons natal chart includes a whole lot of elements beyond the sun which accounts for say two scorpios that are comepletely different ect. Nonetheless she manages to nail it pretty damn close. Each signs chapter is comprised of sub-chapters including how to recognize the sign generally, men of the sign, women as well naturally, child, boss and employee.Interestingly enough she begins each with a verse from Alice and Wonderland that in an abstract manner manages to also describe the nature of the sign represented quite well. I think the best thing about Linda Goodman is that she is never disparaging or remotely negative in her descriptions. It is not sugarcoated just spoken it seems from a sincere, vibrant understanding and optimistic perspective of human nature. I feel like I've just been gushing but it really is that good.Love Signs as well as Relationship Signs(which was I believe compiled from her lifetime of work after she had passed away) are both great as well. Love Signs also being a must have. I had her book Gooberz years ago and I am not suggesting it todayt. I had no idea what she was talking about to be quite honest. Perhaps I just didnt get it...Good Luck"},{"Title":"Linda Goodman's Sun Signs","review":"Being a professional astrologer, I rarely endorse a general 'sun sign' book on astrology, however Linda Goodman's book is, without a doubt, a classic of its kind. It certainly made an impression on me when I first read it and was one of the early reasons why I decided to make this area my life work. Read and enjoy!"},{"Title":"Linda Goodman's Sun Signs","review":"This is the most amamzingly accurate book of astrology I've ever seen. I have read other astrology books for entertainment, without every really believing what they said, but this book actually opens up the possibility to even the harshest skeptic that there may actually be a real science to astrology. It was almost embarassing how well Ms.Goodman seemed to know me and my friends. We laughed hysterically at some parts that pointed out our awkward behavior, and oohed and ahhed at the parts which she knew that we thought only we knew about ourselves. This is truly an amazing book. Since I can't force anyone to buy this book, I will just say that I very highly recommend this book to anyone, and everyone. It's just incredible!"},{"Title":"Linda Goodman's Sun Signs","review":"I've always enjoyed astrology, but after reading Linda Goodman's words.. I grew to love it. I love the cutting edge it gives you on people's personalities. I've never read a book with my mouth open in awe from start to finish. SunSigns made me do it. Definately a recommended read... if nothing else it will entertain you... and it will definately get you thinking."},{"Title":"Linda Goodman's Sun Signs","review":"This was the first book I bought on astrology- sixteen years ago- and I haven't found a better book on the subject since.

This book and its companion, Love Signs have been part of my library for nearly 20 years. Though basically kind-hearted and quite broad minded (especially for an Aries!), she doesn't sugarcoat our personalities. Our less than stellar attributes appear as well. That alone gives this book a far more accurate slant than those horrible 'daily horoscope for [fill in your sign]' books that have a paint-by-numbers quality about them. For those who wish to really understand themselves as well as their family &amp; friends, this is THE book. For simple, though wildly inaccurate, fortunetelling, try one of the other authors."},{"Title":"Linda Goodman's Sun Signs","review":"An excellent beginners astrology guide to the sun signs.

Unfortunately my husband disagrees."},{"Title":"Linda Goodman's Sun Signs","review":"Every person I have ever looked up in this book has been described perfectly. Somehow I lost this book in my last move and was crushed. I am thrilled to know it has been reprinted and I am going tommorrow to pick up a new copy. If you are interested in astrology this is the only book you need!!!"},{"Title":"Linda Goodman's Sun Signs","review":"I first read &quot;Sun Signs&quot; back in the late 70's. At the time i was working in psychiaty and found the book most enlightening in understanding patients and co-workers. This book started out as entertainment but upon further reading and with an open mind (essiential) you find that it definitely provides insight into the pesonalities of loved ones and friends. Others came to the same conclusion once they opened their minds and really read it objectively. Very benificial when meeting new people. Put it right up there with &quot;Dianetics&quot;. A must read for anyone interested in the human psyche."},{"Title":"Linda Goodman's Sun Signs","review":"This book is excellent except for one error: women in the workforce.

NONTHELESS, I SUGGEST THAT EVERYONE BUY HER BOOK. IT WAS A GREAT HELP IN MY STUDIES OF ASTROLOGY, AND BROUGHT A LOT OF INSIGHT INTO THE SUBJECT. IT WAS PERSONAL, INTERESTING, AND WELL WRITTEN. EXCELLENT PIECE OF WORK, AND I'M VERY GLAD I OWN A COPY. THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO SHARE MY OPINION."},{"Title":"Linda Goodman's Sun Signs","review":"This book gives astrology's critics all the ammunition they need. Simplistic, silly and stereotypical profiles, with no acknowledging the complexity of character and personality. Also, I know the book was written in the 60's but the incredible sexism kept my teeth on edge. Read this book if the only women you know are housewives and \\"girl\\" secretaries (and find out which ones are out to marry the boss to boot!)"},{"Title":"Linda Goodman's Sun Signs","review":"This book was yellowed and falling apart. I wrote tothe distributer but got no response."},{"Title":"Linda Goodman's Sun Signs","review":"I first read the book for laughs. Was I suprised the laugh was on me. It was truly amazing,how 'Sun Signs' represented the people that I know and love the best. Myself included. Now, when I met new people, I read up on them. Believe me, there have been times had I taken this book more seriously, much heartache and agravation could have been avoided."},{"Title":"Linda Goodman's Sun Signs","review":"Rarely do I believe in astrology and numerology. I thought of them as subjects which were great entertainment pieces, but not to be taken seriously. Then I read this book. It so accurately described me as well as several of my friends. It was scarey to think that so much of your personality and antics could be dictated by the universe at the time at your birth. Goodman's use of humor also adds to the enjoyable reading of this must-have book for anyone who has the slightest interest in astrological signs"},{"Title":"Linda Goodman's Sun Signs","review":"This book may be the best there is at bringing the sun signs to life. Linda does an entertaining segment on the sign in general, and then breaks it down into men, women, children, bosses, and employees. She illustrates her chapters with quotes from Alice In Wonderland. I can't think of a better way to get started learning about the signs of the zodiac than reading this enjoyable, light book from cover to cover. Don't think of it as a Bible of astrology. Don't poke for areas of disagreement. Just absorb the big picture.There is no pure example of a sign. When you were born, the Sun, Moon, and planets in our solar system weren't all in the same sign. We are combinations of signs. But this book will get you started in a fun way."},{"Title":"Linda Goodman's Sun Signs","review":"I love this book. In fact, this may be Linda's seminal work on astrology. This book is easy to read, and easy to put down. Everyone you will ever meet is analyzed using \\"sun sign astrology\\" (e.g. all we are concerning ourselves with here are the generalities applicable to any of the twelve basic personality types assigned by month of birth). She takes each astrological sign and shows how that sign (or person) sees the world in different situations. Father, mother, sister, son: you are not getting a simple overview of the astrological influence on personality, but a fun to read examination of the sun-sign influenced personality in life's situations, so that you can better understand what to expect in ANY situation that person may be found in.Linda understands the limitations of \\"sun sign astrology\\" in that it only goes so far, much like the \\"Men are from Mars and women are from some other planet\\" psychology that was popular in the 1980's. While you cannot completely base your views of humanity on such sweeping generalizations, Linda accepts this in this book and writes in a style that allows for variations of personality type, circumstance, and past events that help shape personality. Her writing style is upbeat and engaging, making this a very fun book indeed. Personality analysis through astrology can be an extremely complex and messy affair when you dig too deeply into the mass of information available in the minutiae accessible with a little study*. Linda floats above all of that by presenting in clear, concise terms how your employee, husband, brother (et al.) will generally react when you &lt;do this or that>.This book is a great reference tool, an one that should be used often with anyone you have to deal with on a regular basis, and most especially BEFORE you hand over your wallet - or your heart - to them. This book doesn't pretend to have all of the answers. It guides you through several of the recurring situations life will present to you, and offers you fun advice that you can choose to acknowledge or ignore, but at least you go into any situation armed with positive knowledge. This is a book you will spot-read over and again, and each time it will bring new insights into \\"why so and so did this or that.\\"[* HIGHLY recommended books for serious astrological study include A.T. Mann's \\"The Round Art: The Astrology of Time and Space\\" - which is simply one of the BEST mass-market books on Astrology ever. Get the hardcover. Also, the classic:Llewellyn's New A To Z Horoscope Maker & Interpreter: A Comprehensive Self-Study Course. Llewellyn George is a god. This book founded an empire. If you can actually get through it and really understand the wealth of information contained, you will be well on your way to being a great astrologer.]But buy Linda's books! They are loads of fun, quick and easy to read, and give you a LOT of easily accessible information you can use to make your life more enjoyable."},{"Title":"Linda Goodman's Sun Signs","review":"This book is BRILLIANT. Linda Goodman was a great astrologer who combines knowledge and humor in her writing about the 12 sun signs. The descriptions are accurate, interesting, and so funny to read that it never gets old.

There's not much else to say except that this is a fantastic book."},{"Title":"Linda Goodman's Sun Signs","review":"I came across this book while waiting for something exciting to happen. A friend of mine offered to let me read it. After reading my own sign I was just totally amazed. Almost everything I read was true. The next sign I read belonged to this girl that I really liked but did not work out. I can't say what would happen had I read this book first, but I can say I would definitely know more about her than I had during our brief courtship. Not only is this book accurate, but it is very detailed too."},{"Title":"Linda Goodman's Sun Signs","review":"Lindas description on sun signs is excellant.

It seemed pretty accurate when it described me or my relationship with my mother, boyfriend, coworker etc. I usually don't keep books but this one is one of a handful that has made it to my permanent collection.

I've read many other books since this one came out, and somehow I always return to it. The more you know, the more you go back to Linda Goodman. She was one of the pioneers, and I think she has exceptional clarity in her thinking and her writing. I'm a professional coach (personal and business, not sports!) and sometimes when I really hit a deadend with a person, and can't quite understand them or what's going on, I get down to what their sign is and check it out in this book, and bingo! I wish there were more books like this ... and there never are!"},{"Title":"Linda Goodman's Sun Signs","review":"I have about 50 - 100 books on Astrology, yet this remains the best one in my collection. I constantly buy and have extra copies on hand at all times to hand out to friends that relate an interest in this field.Being an atheist, I was one who did not like to beleive in mumbo jumbo like religion or astrology. Like most, I thought of astrology as the \\"fortune cookie\\" quotes that would apear in the paper every day telling you if you were going to be rich, or get a new job or lover. Well, turns out that Astrology is the science of personality traits, NOT predicting the future.The Astrology section in your local paper IS mumbo jumbo, and has the same acuracy as a fortune cookie.This book does not tell you if you are going to be rich or predict your future, it just describes personality traits of people.How can the day you were born on determine your personality? It works the other way around, your personality genes determine what day you are born. But we all know that, for instance, two brothers raised by the same parents and upbringing can have completely different personalities, so that really has nothing to do with your personality at all. You can try hard to change behaviors like being impatient, practical, emotional, critical, but all this is part of your genetic makeup, no different than your eye color or other things you can't change about yourself.Talking to a stranger many years ago, after just a few minutes of talking, she was able to tell me what Astrology sign I was, and was correct. She got my attention, recomended this book, and now I am able to guess people's astrology signs many times and also recomend this book now.What makes this book great, is that it has seperate personality traits for males and females of the same sign, and traits for children, bosses, and employees. Get a new job? Find out your bosses birthday, then look him up in this book to find out the best way to ask this type of person for a raise, or what he likes or dislikes in his employees. Or for the employer, find out the same about your employees.Instead of reading this book from front to back, you want to think of your best friends and family members, then read the chapters about them and see how scary close the descriptions really are.After a while, when you know at least a few people of every sign, when you meet someone new, and find out their birthday, you just think about the other people you know with that sign, and you instantly know a lot about this person you never met before, because they will react and behave in the same way.The other reason this book is a must, is that the cut off days that give the end of one sign, and the start of the next sign is exactly right from my experience. Many books will differ on dates, and I have known some people who say they don't know which sign they are, because some books say they are this, and other books say they are that, but knowing them after a while, it is not hard to see which one they actually are, and this book has always been acurate with the dates, when comparing to actual people I have known that are on those border dates.In fact, there has been an argument over if Hitler was an Aries or a Taurus, because his birthday is on April 20th. Some books include that as Taurus, this book and some others include it as Aries. Having researched Hitler extensively over the past few years, and just having read about his youth from his childhood friend, there is no doubt he was an Aries, and that again jives with this book.I have read through most of the astrology books available, and none come as acurate and close as this book does. Linda Goodman was a genius in this field, and it is sad she is no longer with us."},{"Title":"Linda Goodman's Sun Signs","review":"Linda Goodman is probably my favorite astrological author because of her knowledge and her witty style of writing. To say this book is a classic would be an understatement. Five stars seems a bit much, but that is the esteem in which I hold this book. It was the first that I read on astrology that was accessible without insulting one's intelligence, funny without being trite, profound without being &quot;heavy&quot;."},{"Title":"Linda Goodman's Sun Signs","review":"Contents summary: The Sun interpreted in the twelve signs of the zodiac (528pp). Each sign placement's interpretation is subdivided into six sections, covering its general, male, female, child, employer and employee manifestations.By far the lengthiest Sun sign portraits ever written, dating from 1968 and still unsurpassed quantitatively although arguably superseded qualitatively. Comedic and chatty writing, awash with poetic licence and sometimes seems rose-tinted; a dated style you may love or hate, but the writing itself is selectively very observationally insightful without being heavy on psychology or overly distracted by mythology. Fine for its purpose; inspiring for astrological sceptics and beginners, and worth reading from beginning to end in order to increase familiarity with the Sun signs, though not the last word in understanding them."},{"Title":"Linda Goodman's Sun Signs","review":"As the author of a series of Sun sign books starting withHow To Survive A PiscesI was inspired by Linda from a very early age. There are some books that never really go out of date, and this is one of them. Linda writes in a friendly, intimate way that pulls you into her world of Astrology.She is one of Astrology's most well-known authors and it is a well-deserved title.She describes each sign of the Zodiac, in all their permutations and you can almost imagine those people as real, live, human beings, because that is what they are.I bought this book when I was a teen, now I'm a grown mom and astrological author myself.I also keep an eye on her wikipedia page, as even though she isn't here in the flesh anymore, her up-beat, realistic writing inspires and delights and must be credited :)"},{"Title":"Linda Goodman's Sun Signs","review":"I have the original mass market paperback or rather one of the many printings. I must say while this gives great information it does not include so much of what my paper back includes. I would really like to see the full version even if its not free. Three stars for this version not the work its self that is five stars all the way."},{"Title":"Linda Goodman's Sun Signs","review":"So Linda knows a lot about astrology? She has very few qualifications. Do you know people study astrology for years before they become even passably proficient? She just read a couple of books, writes in a very interesting style... and there you go, she's an appointed expert in the subject. Astrology's not just about sun signs, it's a very complex science.Generalized statements like 'Arians are like infants, think only of themselves' and 'Taureans are slow learners and troublesome for teachers at school' ... well, are applicable only in some circumstances. There are lots of selfless Arians (like my aunt) and lots of Taurean whizkids. How can she get away with atrocious statements like that? She also said, 'Aquarius is the sign of genius.' I know so many Aquarian duds (obviously there are lots of Aquarian geniuses around too, but no statement of hers can be taken to be conclusively applicable to all signs.) She implies Capricorns are slow at learning and states 'Capricorns' learning methods are outdated.' I always top my class and grasp things before anyone else (Before lots of people who belong to intelligent signs - read Gemini, Aquarius.) Obviously, that isn't to imply that there aren't Gemini and Aquarius school toppers, there must be plenty.As for her saying that even if someone appears wildly different from their sun sign, if you study them closely you will see they are true to their basic nature.... well, if you try really hard you can just about pin anything to anybody.I was reading out what she said about Pisces to my father, and it went from bad to worse because not even one thing she said applied to him (My father does not frequently haunt museums at all, and he's not at all dreamy). Do you know why? 'Cause everyone has a unique chart consisting of ascendant sign, moon sign, descendant, etc. Plus there are so many other signs like healing sign, love sign, communication sign, rebellion sign, etc. Every person is a unique individual. If you must believe in astrology, then believe in those who study personal charts and everything. Don't go for generalized nonsense.Two stars for the entertainment value (it was fun reading at the least.)"},{"Title":"Linda Goodman's Sun Signs","review":"I liked this book alot, except she didnt really pay any attention to developing the sun sign profiles of women like she details for men. Its annoying and lame, just because she is so good at what she does but is really not concerned with developing insight into women. But still i love to read this book over and over to help me keep my world an enchanted place, which i enjoy."},{"Title":"Linda Goodman's Sun Signs","review":"I owe much to this particular compendium of astrological insights...It singlehandedly motivated my interest in astrology and metaphysics by illuminating me to the deeper realites of existence. A stunningly accurate and descriptive book intergrating the a sense of the narrative along with a unique clarity regarding astrology. This is one book that has been 'borrowed' from me and never returned, not to mention instrumental in helping me obtain a deeper perspective of humanity. A must read."},{"Title":"Linda Goodman's Sun Signs","review":"Linda Goodman is brilliant. This book is so entertaining, and frightfully accurate. It not only gives you an analysis of your sign, but also you can find out more about your boss by his sign, your child even. This book even has a chapter on how to recognize what people's signs are. It works. I am an astrology junkie, and let me tell you, out of the 30 or so astrology books I own, this one has always been my favorite. Linda Goodman is the greatest astrologer and a brilliant writer. I would give this book 10 stars, not five. :)"},{"Title":"Linda Goodman's Sun Signs","review":"I have the original version of this book published in the 60's and it is the best astrology book I've read. It is so on target with everyone I know and has taught me so much about dealing with people on different levels according to their sun sign. I love how it describes physical characteristics of people, not just behavioral like most books. It is amazing how people of the same sign have similar appearances."},{"Title":"Linda Goodman's Sun Signs","review":"This is probably the best book on astrology. Linda Goodman seems to characterize most sun signs well. Every sign has a man, woman and child profile. For example, leo man, leo woman and leo child. The descriptions are fun to read. It helps me understand certain behavior from other people (which is sometimes irritating to say the least) The major criticism is that Linda seems to have a preconceived notion about certain things. For instance, on her web site, it is said &quot;Presidents should be never from a mutable sign.&quot; And then she goes on to say why Lyndon Johnson and Kennedy were not suitable for the president's post. I for one, believe that hard work will yield the results, not the sun sign you were born under and who is Linda to decide who is a fit or misfit? We all saw how a fire sign (Linda is fond of saying she is a &quot;double&quot; aries fire sign) president did ! (Bill Clinton) Just keep in mind that a sun sign (or a moon sign or star sign) cannot pigeonhole people. The fact is people are JUST TOO UNIQUE. They ARE CAPABLE of doing whatever they SET THEIR MINDS ON."},{"Title":"Linda Goodman's Sun Signs","review":"None of this is scientific in any way! Do not recommend buying this at any price! Nothing makes sense, and it's just pandering to confirmation bias."},{"Title":"Linda Goodman's Sun Signs","review":"This is a book I have enjoyed for many many years so ordered it for a friend. Imagine my disappointment to find once it arrived the fly leaf was torn. Where was the quality control??????? She graciously accepted it but I felt embarrassed...........I must admit to feeling apprehensive about ordering again.....sincerely Ted Gorrod"},{"Title":"Linda Goodman's Sun Signs","review":"I like the book very much except for one thing. Linda really sings praises for librans. I think that's not true. Beneath their charm, Librans are the most deceitful people. They lie so much just to make others beleive how good they are. This comes from being with many librans and is not biased or prejudiced in any way. I think Linda ought to reveal this trait in her book"},{"Title":"Linda Goodman's Sun Signs","review":"I don't read my daily horoscope--that's bull. How would anyone know your day just cuz of your sign?However, I was convinced that astrology is for the most part, accurate. Of course--not entirely. I'm sure not every Pisces is creative, not every Virgo is a loner, and not every Capricorn is conservative.Astrology is just a basic generalization that hits most of the targets of a person's personality, according to their sign. I'm an Aquarian, and I can assure you I am not unemotional. Not every trait of your sign has to be true.This is a good book, and like the other reviews say, don't treat it as the FINAL word. It's not. It's just a fairly accurate reference. That's all. Don't take it too seriously."},{"Title":"Linda Goodman's Sun Signs","review":"I HAD THIS BOOK IN SOFT COVER AND READ IT SO MUCH THAT IT SIMPLY FELL APART.

Just as I expected, they rely on their own copies now. Linda Goodman's Sun Signs will be the one book that remains on my nightstand for years to come"},{"Title":"Linda Goodman's Sun Signs","review":"Linda was a true teacher. Her books, every last one of them, are spiritual primers of the highest order and for those, who want to take their seeking to a higher level, her books will give you the required , preparatory grounding and introduction. And from there, you take it to whatever level you want to go to. I cannot recommend them highly enough to anyone. The mysteries of &quot;Gooberz&quot; got to me in the deepest, most profoundest sense, and I desperately needed answers to some of the myriad of questions it raised and was able to locate her former next-door neighbor, Ruth Cook in Cripple Creek, mentioned in that book. Linda passed on in October 1995 from adult onset diabetes and the mystery of Sally as mentioned in &quot;Love Signs&quot; and &quot;Star Signs&quot; was never fully solved. A body was discovered but Linda never accepted the results. Her twin married that cool-sure-Scorpio mentioned in Gooberz. As for her literary legacy, it's in the hands of a company now, which produced &quot;Relationship Signs&quot;. Though that book is quite good in understanding the synastry of charts between two persons, reading it, one is immediately struck by the fact that it's not Linda writing. This is further exacerbated by some glaring astrological mistakes, and quite frankly, I don't think Linda would have been so sloppy. Some of the sentences are definitely her's, while the rest of it is patched up together and for the less-discerning reader to come off as Linda speaking. The real Linda Goodman magic, with her innate ability to click with the reader simply isn't there. Which brings into question the authenticity of future Linda Goodman books, my own feeling is try as that company might, those books won't fly. Linda's not here but her spirit lives on and I think she would want us to take her work and push it and take it to a higher level, whatever that level may be. I don't think she meant us to be spoon-fed and perhaps the lesson of her death despite &quot;Physical Immortality&quot; as per &quot;Star Signs&quot; was for us to keep learning on our own. If there is anyone out there with more info. on Linda and her life, please do contact me. GET ALL HER BOOKS, THEY ARE WORTH IT!"},{"Title":"Linda Goodman's Sun Signs","review":"For all of you skeptics out there - give this one a chance. I dare you. It's not your typical, tabloid-advice horoscope funnies, it's a map of detailed characteristics representing each human under their sign of the zodiac. Linda tends to be wordy at times and divert to smaller topics a little too often, but if you examine the core of her text, it is almost frightening how close she comes to truth. She is a down-to-earth, spiritual, God-believing woman, and an author whose words will help you in relating to others in daily life.

Love her insights; most are right-on. Everyone can benefit from reading this book."},{"Title":"Linda Goodman's Sun Signs","review":"I was skeptical about astrology until I read this book.It converted me, and I got into a serious study of the subject.When I read about my sun sign (Aquarius) in this book I was bowled over by Linda's penetrating observations.Astrology tells us much more about personality than psychology ever can, especially when it is made so accessible by Linda.She writes in a very readable manner, and has an enormous appreciation of the quirks and foibles of human nature.Linda gives generous servings of a delicious sense of humor.For example, many Librans, she says, have dimpled knees, &quot;but be careful.Very few girls will believe you when you tell them that you were staring at their knees 'because I want to see if you were born in October.'&quot;Linda presents a rundown of how males and females of each sign act in a romantic situation.Men can learn much from this book because Linda has the knack of showing the more subtle aspects of relationship from a female point of view.For example, one way, she says, of attracting a Cancer man is to &quot;Wear one of those bracelets made of foreign coins.That will strike two sensitive chords - travel to faraway places - and cash.&quot; In the book are many helpful hints for lovers, tailored for each sun sign.As Linda says in her introduction, she believes people can be more tolerant of others if they understand them through astrology.This book is informative and a joy to read.The world today is too conformist.Linda makes you realize how wonderful and wacky people can be, and we need all people to enrich life by living out their star-spun destinies."},{"Title":"Linda Goodman's Sun Signs","review":"First of all, if you own this book &lt;I'm talking about the small mass-market version; if you're fortunate enough to have the hard-cover first edition, put it under lock and key, won't you?&gt;, don't loan it with any expectations of getting it back. It just won't happen. The friend you loaned it to will loan it to another friend who &quot;just has to have it,&quot; and that friend will loan it to another friend &quot;who's going through a really bad time and will need this,&quot; who will loan it to another friend who has &quot;just met this person, and needs to know all about him/her&quot;, who in turn loaned it to. . .and on it goes.This book is a classic. I don't use that word lightly. I still have my &quot;first edition&quot; put carefully away as if someone handles it one more time, it will likely fall apart.&quot;Linda Goodman's Sun Signs&quot; is one of those books I pull off my library shelf and read through randomly for sheer pleasure, or because I've met someone new and interesting and discretely discovered their birthday. It's rarely led me wrong.What's worse, when I read the description of the typical Sagittarian, and the Sagittarian male, it reads like it was written by me, my mother, the CIA, the FBI, and all my friends through more than the half century I've spent on this planet. I first found that rather scary, but now I find it comforting. It means I'm simply being me, the person as I am supposed to be.Over the years, Ms. Goodman has been criticized for her somewhat &quot;shallow&quot; approach to a controversial topic. Whether Astrology has any &quot;scientific&quot; validity, I leave to better minds than my own. But I can testify, from my own experience, that if I can learn an individual's birthday, read Ms. Goodman's text on that sun-sign, and whenever possible, take into account the ascending sign, the moon sign, and other astrological influences that may alter the basic influence of the Sun on a person's birth, I've rarely found Ms. Goodman to be far off the mark.But of course, that's simply my own unique experience. Many scientists, physicists, and astronomers will swear on a stack of Bibles that the position of the planets cannot possibly influence the personality of a person born at such-and-such a place at this-and-this an hour, under that-and-that configuration of heavenly bodies. I must in fairness point out, however, that mathematics will also conclusively prove that a bumblebee cannot fly! A bumblebee's wings are too slender, it's body is too fat an unaerodynamic, for it ever to acheive the condition of lift plus thrust being greater than load plus drag; the situation necessary to acheive flight! L+T &gt; Ld + D = F. That's the equation. Look it up.All I'm saying is that Ms. Goodman's charming book gives me a roadmap of the Twelve Signs of the Zodiac about as reliable as the latest Rand/McNalley to earthbound travel.And that's about as good as it gets.Just don't loan it out and expect it back. Buy two. One to loan, and one to keep &lt;and keep the second one for yourself!&gt;!!"},{"Title":"Linda Goodman's Sun Signs","review":"I remember reading this book years ago! And I do mean years! I was probably 16 or 17 years old. Why would that be important for a review? Because I understood it then, and refer back to it now. In fact I am on my 3rd copy! 1st one, because of all the use, fell apart. 2nd one, lent out and was so good never came back. 3rd one, sits on my bookcase in the area designed for most frequently used books. Sun Signs describes the Suns aspects on ones personalities for everyone in your life. Boss, Male, Female, Child. And very darn accurate if I may add. The reading is kept simple while staying informative. Personally, I don't want to learn how to perform astrology on someone, I just like to read the characteristics. Trine and Seventh Houses overwhelm me! This book is terrific if thats what you are after. I have to say, it helped me to learn where someone is coming from, the way they view life, and the best way to manage my interactions with them. So by understanding where that person in your life is operating from, your encounters can be on a more positive note. As far as enchancing myself and my life, it helped there as well. I am a Sag. When I read this book eons ago, I recall reading about the Sag woman. I was barely a woman at 16 but thats the chapter I read just the same! heehee I recall reading how sometimes a Sag can wound others with their words...they do not mean to do so, but they do. And whether intentional or not, wounds hurt. Even at the young age of 16, upon reading that description, from this book, it aided me to weigh my words just a bit more! Havent conquered this totally quite yet! hahaha But Linda Goodmans insightful words sure did help. Recommend adding this to your collection strongly.

In a witty , entertaining and shockingly accurate way, she describes all 12 sun signs &amp; has included 5 main classifications under each sign (man ,woman ,child, employer,employee,) so you could learn how to deal with anyone from your Aquarian boss to a Leo child.Although &quot;Sun Signs&quot;is an excellent base for anyone , you must remember that it is not wholly accurate as it can't take into account the various other aspects of a person ;for eg: a Piscean with a Leo moon is more aggressive than a Piscean with acancerian moon.therefore you might not feel that the description of your sign fits you completely.Still, this book remains one of the all time astro classics as it can convince even the sceptic about the accuracy and usefulness of astrology when it comes to understanding others."},{"Title":"Linda Goodman's Sun Signs","review":"There is a reason this book is still in print over 30 years after it's original publication: it is simply the BEST astrology book ever written.

Goodman isn't the deepest person in the world or the greatest astrologer, but she sure knows how to reach out and grab a person. If you want to understand your boss, or better yet, create the perfect boss -- click &quot;BUY&quot; and get this book over to your house right away!! This book is also an essential to every astrologer's library. Read the whole thing all the way through at least once."},{"Title":"Linda Goodman's Sun Signs","review":"I have purchased several copies of this book over the past few years, but every time I loan it to someone because I want them to read a certain part, amazingly they never return it. Then I have to buy another copy!Linda Goodman has an amazing talent for explaining astrology in a humorous way in which we can all relate and understand. I refer to this book a lot when I'm trying to &quot;figure someone out&quot;. I personally have a library of Astrology books, but this is the one I most often refer to, followed in a close second by Linda Goodman's &quot;Love Signs&quot;, and a puple book entitled &quot;The only astrology book you'll ever need&quot;.For anyone who is interested in astrology, even if they don't know a lot about it, this is a good book to start with!"},{"Title":"Linda Goodman's Sun Signs","review":"I own this book in hard copy and despite being the oldest, most decrepit book I have ever set eyes on, people still ask me to lend it to them, promising to take care of it. As has already been said, buy at least two copies; one for you and one to loan out.That's where the five star rating comes from. When I was given aKindle Keyboard, Wi-Fi, 6\\" E Ink Displayfor Christmas this was the first book I bought. Unfortunately, it appears that the original author's words have been badly edited to better \\"fit\\" these modern times. The allusions to well known celebrities that Linda Goodman herself made were sensible, but the new version has replaced these with icons that don't always fit what the author has said.As well as this, the \\"Boss\\" sections of each sign have been altered to use a female pronoun. Being a woman myself, I would have had no problem with this if it had been done neatly and correctly. But it WASN'T.From The Gemini Boss: \\"But the Gemini executive doesn't know HIMSELF which side of the bed SHE'S going to get out on each morning...\\"From The Cancer Boss: \\"...with HER father's picture on one side, and the group picture of HIS family on the other.\\"These are only a couple I scooped out from a quick skim read just now. I mean, hooray for equality and all, but if you're going to edit a book, do it properly. Besides, this was written in the 1960s! That was how things were!There are other, unnecessary alterations, such as changing the original, firm \\"Don't try to be a career girl. He'll never stand for it. HE'S your career,\\" to a more noncommittal \\"He'd prefer you not be a career girl. He'd prefer it if HE took all your time and attention.\\"As a summary, the original book by Linda Goodman is a five star masterpiece complete with detailed description, interesting insights and plenty of humour. But I would appreciate this masterpiece on Kindle, not a butchered up version."},{"Title":"Linda Goodman's Sun Signs","review":"This book is very enlightening for people who are just becoming interested in their astrological side of life.

Linda Goodman has done an outstanding job describing them in their purest forms.Goodman's examples reflect men's and women's roles as they were in 1968, when the book was written. Given how much the climate has changed in regards to gender roles, it's understandable that some people might find her examples offensive. Perhaps a more constructive view is to think of it as a history lesson on how men and women were expected to behave, even as late as 1968. (I mean, don't we all think of the '60s as a time of free love and sexual liberation? HA HA!! No way. There were still *strongly* defined roles for men and women then, much more strongly defined than they are now.)The wonderful thing about understanding the sun signs is that you can apply that knowledge in so many ways. I'm having a lot of fun \\"people watching,\\" trying to figure out what a person's sign is based on their behavior. A knowledge of the sun signs can also be used to help understand the planets that rule the signs, and also to the houses.Well worth the money even if you are not an astrology student and just want to figure out your spouse or kids!"},{"Title":"Linda Goodman's Sun Signs","review":"I first read this book years ago when I was in high school (won't tell you how long ago that was!). I think everyone goes through phases in their life where they investigate astrology, then usually forget about it after a while.

I got on Amazon and ordered a copy and was once again astounded at how well it described people I knew. My eleven year old daughter got her first look at it and was also quite intrigued by the accurate descriptions of people she knew. I would definitely recommend this book, (despite it's age!) to anyone who would like to understand someone a little better and to perhaps realize that there just may be something to this astrology stuff after all!

So does every other astrology book that focuses on the \\"Sun Signs.\\" A person is always made up of more than just the sign their planet is in. However, of all books to read on a generalization of the sign, Linda Goodman gives the best descriptions, observations and analogies...and that's why you should read this book.If you're looking for a book to tell you why you act a certain way, although your sun sign says you shouldn't be, you can try those books that explore other aspects of an astrology chart.The book is as the title says, \\"Linda Goodman's Sun Signs\\", not Moon Signs, not Venus Signs, not Ascendants, \\"Sun Signs\\"."},{"Title":"Linda Goodman's Sun Signs","review":"I tend to disagree with the very first review, I am a Libra and I am not deceitful, But, That's not why I'm here, :-) I love this book, It's amazing and completely true, I recommend it highly, I don't think she adores one sunsign alone, I think she gives each the same amount of praise and criticizim(Sp).

She uses many examples to get her point across about certain personality traits and quirks.As another reviewer said, it all depends the most on the exact time, location etc. of birth, but this book offers great generalizations for men, women, children, bosses, and employees.

I believe this work to be honest and not biased in any way."},{"Title":"A Wilderness So Immense: The Louisiana Purchase and the Destiny of America (Lewis & Clark Expedition)","review":"What I learned about the Louisiana Purchase in school was pretty cut-and-dried: A bunch of very statesmanlike men wearing powdered wigs made an incredible real estate deal that more than doubled the size of the United States and enabled Manifest Destiny to happen, usually within the next five pages.Jon Kukla did us all a service by sitting down and asking what the Louisiana Purchase actually meant to the North, the South, and the burgeoning Western Territories, both then, in the more distant future, and even now.In 1803, New Orleans was a Caribbean port with a large population of free mulattoes, Creoles, French, and Spanish -- not to mention a sprinkling of American traders. It was like nothing that the original Thirteen Colonies ever saw, and it was but a foretaste of the rampant multiculturalism that has become a dominant feature of our lives.Did you know that the first impulse to secession was not in the South, but in Massachusetts? The \\"Essex Junto,\\" dating as far back as 1786, allowed itself to be influenced by Spain for purely regional benefits. As late as the Hartford Convention in 1815, the threat of secession was primarily a Yankee threat; only later did the South adopt it.Jefferson, Livingston, and Monroe tread on new ground in cutting the deal: There was nothing in the new Constitution to allow them such powers, nor was there anything that expressly forbade it. And no sooner was the deal made than the United States began to face new problems, such as the expansion of slavery in the new territories. It was the Purchase that led in an almost direct line to the Missouri Compromise of 1820; and from there, to the Dred Scott Decision; and from there to the horrors of the War Between the States.Kukla's book can be read on several levels. I read it as an exciting tale of diplomacy between the United States, Spain, and France spanning twenty years. As a work of scholarship, it contains extensive but unobtrusive endnotes, maps, and appendices containing the texts of the 1795 treaty with Spain, the Louisiana Purchase Treaty and Conventions, and some draft amendments to the Constitution proposed by Jefferson in 1803 to legitimize the Purchase.I did not expect much from this book at first, but Kukla was so successful in working in threads and themes that continue to this day, that the book is highly relevant and thought provoking. It is odd to call a book about diplomacy gripping, but any tale that weaves together Thomas Jefferson, Aaron Burr, Toussaint L'Ouverture (the Black Haitian revolutionary), Talleyrand, and Napoleon Bonaparte so well can be described in no other way."},{"Title":"A Wilderness So Immense: The Louisiana Purchase and the Destiny of America (Lewis & Clark Expedition)","review":"By the time twenty years passed after the American revolution, the young United States, already an immense country by European standards, had yet again doubled its land mass through Thomas Jefferson's Louisianan Purchase. Within the next 16 years, again due to this purchase, it would stretch across the entire North American continent, from the Atlantic to the Pacific oceans.The story of this land acquisition is intricate, filled with intrigue. It spans the globe including such diverse locations as Haiti, Madrid, Virginia, New York, Paris, London and New Orleans. It involved scheming, daring and negotiation between traditional contenders France, Great Britain, Spain and the United States and involved a cast of characters Hollywood could only hope for: Napoleon, Jefferson, Monroe, Livingston, Talleyrand, Jay, Wilkerson, Burr, and many, many more.Jon Kukla does a masterful job of spinning the tale of the world's largest real estate transaction. He makes it clear that as the French Revolution, and Napoleon's empire building, rocked the Atlantic community, Spain's new world empire became increasingly vulnerable to its American and European rivals. Jefferson hoped to take Spain's territories piece by piece, while Napoleon schemed to reestablish French colonial empire in the Caribbean and North America.Interweaving the stories of ordinary settlers and kings maneuvering on the world stage, the author depicts a world of revolutionary intrigue that transformed a small, faltering experiment in self government into a world power. And all without blood shed and for about 4 cents per acre. Exceedingly well written and with significant attention paid to key transitions and detail this is a most excellent work."},{"Title":"A Wilderness So Immense: The Louisiana Purchase and the Destiny of America (Lewis & Clark Expedition)","review":"The man can write! I looked on the back cover to see the photo of a middle-aged man who's apparently been doing something other than writing books for most of his career - a shame. Superb at character studies and evoking the atmosphere of the time, Kukla's book was a joy to read. I thought this book would be a light quick read - but instead it was dense with information - vividly protrayed. How interesting it was to read of all the British/French/Spanish entanglements in the southern US. Kukla did his work and presented it well."},{"Title":"A Wilderness So Immense: The Louisiana Purchase and the Destiny of America (Lewis & Clark Expedition)","review":"I read this book for my own personal research. If you want detail, this has it: Not only what people did, but what they ate and who they were sleeping with. The thing I did not like about the book was each chapter dealt with one thing, for example Pickney's treaty. This made each chapter have to go back and cover time frames in other chapters, so it got a bit confusing with all the overlaps. I would have rather he wrote it straight chronologically. Also, most the chapters had titles that did not give much of a hint as to what was in them, for example: \\"A Long Train of Intrique\\", \\"Banners of Blood\\", and \\"Selling a Ship\\". When I needed to go back and find something, it was very difficult to figure out which chapter it was in. You can't say, \\"Well, I know it happened before this\\" because lots of chapters before and after have things from \\"before this\\". There is an index, but there are lots of references to Napoleon, Charles IV and Jefferson, so you have to do a lot of extra looking up. Bottom line, very thourough, but difficult to sift through."},{"Title":"A Wilderness So Immense: The Louisiana Purchase and the Destiny of America (Lewis & Clark Expedition)","review":"I admit I decided to read this book because I thought it only fitting in this bicentennial year of the Louisiana Purchase to do so, and that I was struck by the felicitous title (on a par with other titles which stand out in my memory (They Shoot Horses, Don't They? [read 9 Apr 1952], Right Hand, Glove Uplifted [read Jun 30, 1983], I Came Out of the 18th Century [read 3 Feb 1979], I, Too, Have Lived in Arcadia [read 26 Feb 1987], Keep the Aspidistra Flying [read 2 Apr 2002], and What Me Befell [read 24 Feb 2001]). But it turned out to be a super-interesting book, especially when it got to the actual events leading up to the negotiations with Napolean. One stands in awe of the superlative job which Livingston did in conditioning Napoleon to be willing to sell and the suspense which attends the negotiations is surprising (since one know that it all turns out for the best, because here I am living in Iowa and an American citizen). The research is impeccable, and the footnotes ample, and one is even favored with the text of Pinckney's treaty of 1795 as well as of the Treaty to buy Louisiana. (In the next edition the statement on page 251 that Napoleon died on Elba should be corrected, as well as the statement on page 272 saying Livingston met Talleyrand on &quot;January&quot; 12 instead of April 12, 1803.) The book is full of interesting tidbits, such as telling what happened to Shays of Shays' Rebellion fame, and to Toussaint after the promise to him was broken and he was arrested. This is history which cannot fail to be appreciated when read."},{"Title":"A Wilderness So Immense: The Louisiana Purchase and the Destiny of America (Lewis & Clark Expedition)","review":"Jon Kukla certainly provides a vast account of events leading up the Louisiana Purchase, but seems to get lost in the Wilderness in the process. He offers interesting character sketches and numerous anecdotal references, but it takes him most of the book to get down to the nitty gritty of the purchase itself.He tries to hook readers into his account by providing a very questionable view of Jefferson in Paris in the opening chapter. He assumes a pedophiliac relationship between Jefferson and Sally Hemings. He plays this against an account of the building of the Richmond capitol to illustrate how Jefferson was not afraid to use subterfuge to get anything he wanted. Kukla also plays Jefferson off against Monroe, who he seems to have more admiration for.Kukla also has an obsession for the early secessionist drives in the fledgling US, and how the Spanish played off these sectional differences, particularly in regard to the nefarious James Wilkinson. I think Kukla made too much of these secessionist drives. Mostly it was a battle between the Federalists and the Republicans, not deep-seated sectional differences. Of course these differences would ultimately lead to the Civil War, but at this point the Union was in its formative stages, and the new territories vied for statehood not independence.I got the impression that Kukla was trying to build a picture of the early United States and its place in the world moreso than illuminate readers on the Louisiana Purchase. There is an awful lot of information on the Spanish-French-American connection, but so little on the strong tie between the US and Britain. He focuses heavily on the Virginians, and presents the Northeastern contingent as incidental characters with the exception of Robert Livingston, who set much of the groundwork for the Purchase.Kukla spends an inordinate amount of time on the French Revolution, as a means of introducing us to Napoleon and Tallyrand. He also uses the revolution as the basis for the Haitian Independence drive which so greatly consternated Virginia planters. Kukla does provide a pretty good account of Citizen Genet and his attempt to form a militia to take New Orleans prior to the repossession of the territory by Napoleon.It seems Kukla is trying to impress readers with his universal knowledge of events rather than focus on the more salient aspects of the Louisiana Purchase. All in all, it is an entertaining account of events but one that seems to lose its bearings in a wilderness so immense."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Beating Debt","review":"If you are at all aware of the credit and debt industry or in any way a responsible adult, this book will not help you out.

I had already implemented most of the things this book recommends for getting out of debt and, for me, it was the affirmation I needed to keep going on the right track.

Not only did this book fail to prove, unequivocally, that these Bears were the best team in professional football history, but also failed to thoroughly reveal the team's \\"self destruction\\" in any significant way. While there were a few of interesting behind-the-scenes stories, the book is dissatisfying in terms of being long on common knowledge about the team and short on inside information. John Mullin is a reporter with a major Chicago newspaper and should have more \\"reach\\" into the non-public happenings of the team than he demonstrated in the book. Maybe he wasn't able to publish his juiciest findings--did an overly cautious publishing company dump the good stuff? In any event, the book was dismally underachieving in terms of bringing any new information to light.Additionally, and this is more a matter of personal taste, I found Mullin's style to be a little disjointed. His stories seem to end abruptly, and he jumps immediately into another topic without a decent segue. Some topics are dropped without conclusion and others appear intermittently throughout the book without any rhyme or reason. His writing style was more like reading 200+ pages of USA Today style \\"snippets\\" of information than a cohesive tale of a historically great football team.In the hands of a more capable storyteller, this book may have been a winner, but the lack of new information and poor organization of the material made this one a loser for me. I kept reading in hopes of something to make the task of reading this book worthwhile, but such a moment never materialized."},{"Title":"The Rise & Self-Destruction of the Greatest Football Team in History: The Chicago Bears and Super Bowl XX","review":"This story of a football team illustrates a much more profound element of human psychology - how to handle success. Whether success is a relationship, career, business, or any other endeavor, the lessons here are to be heeded or the result will invariably be the same.To put this in context, the 1985 Chicago Bears football team is arguably the best ever assembled in the modern era. While other teams may have had more success over time, or had 1 less loss, this team is widely regarded as the most dominating. In addition to the on-the-field success, the team created media stars like Mike Ditka, Jim McMahan and \\"The Fridge\\", along with established all time greats like Walter Payton, Mike Singletary and Dan Hampton.So what happened? How did it blow up so fast? A classic tale of forgetting to continue what made you successful in the first place.The players and the team became successful by playing harder, and using an almost desperate intensity to how they played the game from a play design perspective to personal and individual motivation. At first this focus (the 46 defense, the frenetic play style) took the league by surprise and gave them a decided advantage, but like most of us with any kind of success, once it was achieved they forgot to keep changing to adapt to the world they created. In addition, they succumbed to the temptation of starting to believe their own press, and became infatuated with their own greatness. Once that happens, it slips away quickly. The detail behind the strategy success and infighting that eroded the spirit of the team, are depicted clearly.After reading this book, which is full of delicious insights and salacious comments amongst the team about each other, it is hard to find where to place the blame. Everyone seemed so wrapped up in the media circus that they all seemed to drift away from the mission.For the football fan, this is a great book, full of strategic detail and player reactions. For the person who wants to better understand the dynamics of how to keep themselves or their organization from getting too full of themselves and their success, the lessons here are easy to see, though often difficult to avoid.The book is written exceptionally well, in that it flows easily, is always interesting, follows a nice chronological progressions, and does what it intends - describe the amazing success and quick burn out of perhaps the greatest football team ever assembled."},{"Title":"The Rise & Self-Destruction of the Greatest Football Team in History: The Chicago Bears and Super Bowl XX","review":"My one star review is not meant to convey any negative feelings toward the Chicago Bears in general. It is merely my opinion of the quality of THIS particular book, which is bad.Take an interesting, if not fascinating, sports subject and grant unfettered access to the participants, and one usually expects a relatively coherent summary account filled with interesting insights not available in other forums. At least that's what I usually expect. What the author delivers here is a disjointed commentary that floats from one topic to the next, with no transition or resolution to the schizophrenic anecdotes that are hurled at the reader. The author routinely introduces a subject in one paragraph and then jumps to another subject in the next paragraph without finishing the original thought.Then there are the quotes. The pages are littered with quotes from the players and other personnel that may or may not be related to one of the topics in the general area of the quote. However, the author never indicates where you should stop reading and jump to the quote, so the reader is constantly being interrupted. It's an unbelievably annoying style that I've fortunately never encountered before. And to say that the quotes are relevant or interesting would be extremely generous.I was excited to read this account of the great 1985 Chicago Bears. I bought the DVD set of games that is also available and watched a few of them while I was reading this book. Suffice it to say that this particular book adds nothing to the enjoyment of reliving that glorious season. I strongly recommend looking at one of the other alternatives that is available simply because nothing can possibly be as annoying as the writing \\"style\\" of this particular author."},{"Title":"The Rise & Self-Destruction of the Greatest Football Team in History: The Chicago Bears and Super Bowl XX","review":"Great reading.

Anyone who remembers that '85 season (the 'Fridge, Ditka, Buddy Ryan and the 46 defense, the domination during the play-offs) will love the inside stories about how that season came to be and why that dominating ride ended way too soon."},{"Title":"The Rise & Self-Destruction of the Greatest Football Team in History: The Chicago Bears and Super Bowl XX","review":"This book follows the rise and fall of the 1985 Super Bowl champion Chicago Bears. Unfortunately, it falls way short of the same greatness that they achieved.While the book does a nice job of revealing some new stories (like the Jay Hilgenberg saga), it doesn't really uncover much of substance regarding the Bears.

This is a long ways from what we would get from an author such as David Halberstam who has done books on great teams. Leafing through the book it appears to have been put together in a very short time. I read the book in one sitting, a couple hundred pages with less than the usual amount of information on each page. This \\"greatest football team in history\\" may have been great, but it was so for only one year. Several of the things that caused this team to self-destruct are also found in other teams in other sports. The reasons are hardly unique to the 1985 Chicago Bears. The book is entertaining, but it lacks the meat and potatoes a book of this sort is trying to project. I found this book to be of similar quality to \\"'63: The Story of the 1963 World Champion Chicago Bears.\\" Neither one is destined to become a classic in a sports' library.

Somerset MaughamAh KingPrefaceFootprints in the JungleThe Door of OpportunityThe Vessel of WrathThe Book-BagThe Back of BeyondNeil MacadamHeinemann, Hardback, 1936.12mo. xii, 355 pp. Pocket edition. Preface [vii-xii] for The Collected Edition, 1936 (greatly expanded from the original one).First published by Heinemann in 1933. Original preface titled Ah King.First published in The Collected Edition with a new 6pp. preface by the author in 1936.=============================================This is Somerset Maugham's fifth mature short story collection and, as he states in the preface to The Collected Edition in 1936, the last one which contains stories popularly known as \\"exotic\\". Originally published in 1933 by Heinemann, \\"Ah King\\" is another achievement of Maugham in the genre of the short story that leaves me breathless while reading it. All six stories it contains are perfect examples of exquisite craftsmanship, at least four of them are true masterpieces (and the last two are quite close to perfection even if not as affecting as the other four). They all were published in magazines save \\"The Book-Bag\\"; \\"Footprints in the Jungle\\" as early as 1927 and all others in 1931, except \\"Neil Macadam\\" which appeared on the magazine pages in 1932. Interestingly, the last two stories had different names in magazine form, \\"The Temptation of Neil Macadam\\" and \\"The Right Thing is the Kind Thing\\" respectively. As almost all such changed titles, the ones that appear in the book are distinctly better.The preface written for the inclusion of \\"Ah King\\" in The Collected Edition in 1936, just three years after its first edition, is worth noting. It is an excellent piece with a lot of meat in it. Maugham starts with giving a detailed account how he came to the title \\"Ah King\\". In case you are wondering what on earth that means, the explanation is that this is the name of the Chinese servant Maugham had during one of his travels through Borneo, Indo-China and Siam. He found him in the very last moment before starting and the boy turned out to be an excellent servant except that when Maugham was about to catch a train he was nowhere to be found. Finally he always strolled leisurely on the platform in the very last minute and said with his constant smile \\"I miss no train. Plenty time. Train always wait\\". But when the time came for them to separate, an extraordinary thing happened. I could not for the life of me describe it better than Maugham himself did and that is why I will allow myself to quote. It is rather poignant and it also shows that even so shrewd a judge of human nature like Maugham could sometimes be quite wrong. It is to his credit that he admits it with his usual frankness:\\"''Good-bye, Ah King'' I said. ''I hope you'll find another job soon.''Then I saw he was crying. I stared at him with amazement. An excellent servant, he had attended to all my wants for six months, but he had always seemed to me strangely detached; he had been as indifferent to my praise as he was unconcerned at my reproofs. It had never occurred to me for an instant that he looked upon me as anything but an odd, rather silly person who paid his wages and gave him board and lodging. That he had any feeling for me had never entered my head. I was embarrassed. I felt a little uncomfortable. I knew that I had often been impatient with him, tiresome and exacting. I had never thought of him as a human being. He wept because he was leaving me. It is for these tears that I now give his name to this collection of stories that I invented while he was travelling with me.\\"One could hardly help being sorry that Maugham never returned to writing exotic stories (except the rather lurid \\"Flotsam and Jetsam\\" written in 1940 and included in Maugham's last short story collection, \\"Creatures of Circumstance\\", seven years later). But the great author was adamant. In the same absorbing preface he says flatly that he had written all stories and devised all characters out of the tropics he could. He makes lots of very interesting points about choosing the locale of a story and developing its characters; he chose the tropics and the Englishmen who lived there simply because the incidents and characters that excited him could not happen in England although they might well happen in other parts of the colonies. And he chose Englishmen because, being English himself, he knows them better than any other people and perhaps this is what gives his stories their astonishing verisimilitude and makes them completely convincing. Some may find Maugham's claims about how different and impossible to know the other races are somewhat racist but I think that is a rather narrow point of view.Incidentally, the two aforementioned stories that are not quite up to the perfection of the others are actually the only ones which do not deal, at least directly, with British planters, administrators, district officers, governors and other exalted duties in the vast British empire. But even if slightly less compelling, \\"The Vessel of Wrath\\" and \\"Neil Macadam\\" still make very enjoyable read. The former is the only amusing rather than dramatic story in the collection and it is actually one of Maugham's most famous ones, perhaps because it is something like a reversed version of his definitely most famous story, \\"Rain\\", but quite unlike its famous cousin it is extremely funny. As for \\"Neil Macadam\\", albeit lacking the dramatic strength of the others, it contains a perceptive description of fighting the temptation within you as well as terrific (and terrifying indeed!) character depiction of voluptuous and nymphomaniac woman.But for Maugham at his very best you have to choose the other four stories here: \\"Footprints in the Jungle\\", \\"The Door of Opportunity\\", \\"The Book-Bag\\" and \\"The Back of Beyond\\". They all deal with Maugham's favourite theme in the tropics: the English gentlemen and ladies busy with building the British Empire and leading uncommonly dull lives. But Maugham never was in the least interested in dull characters or incidents. So together with the humdrum monotony of planters' lives you will find a lot nice and purely human qualities like conceit, complacency, cowardice, snobbishness and you will feel quite strongly the darkest side of human nature: adultery, murder, incest. It may not be a real picture of life, although nobody knows that for sure, but it certainly is an extremely compelling thing to read. Moreover, there is not a single character here that is one-sided or as simple as you might think at first glance. Maugham always gives the creatures of his fancy an astounding complexity and that, perhaps, is what makes them believable and convincing, even when their actions seem rather illogical and devoid of any common sense. A short quote from \\"The Book-Bag\\" may well serve as introduction to all these stories:\\"But the human beings are incalculable and he is a fool who tells himself that he knows what a man is capable of.\\"\\"The Book-Bag\\" is the only story here that was never published in a magazine. Ray Long, a friend and an admirer of Maugham as well as editor of \\"Cosmopolitan\\", had to draw the line somewhere and refused to publish a short story concerned far too deeply with incest than it was acceptable at the time (which means not at all of course). Maugham never mentions the word in the whole story but he makes it quite clear what he means; he understood and did not blame Ray Long for his decision. By the way, an interesting detail is that \\"The Book-Bag\\" was first published in book form one year before \\"Ah King\\" by the very same Ray Long as a part of book with his favourite short stories that bore the subtitle \\"20 Best Short Stories in Ray Long's 20 Years as an Editor\\". He also had the audacity to choose \\"The Book-Bag\\" for title of this book. The story itself is one of Maugham's most powerful ones. Beside the incestuous affair, even more vivid against the tropical background, which ultimately leads to the tragedy, the story contains one of Maugham's most charming, and self-revealing, introductions about books and reading as well as some profound thoughts about love and affection, another theme he was always absorbed in:[First lines.]\\"Some people read for instruction, which is praiseworthy, and some for pleasure, which is innocent, but not a few read from habit, and I suppose that this is neither innocent nor praiseworthy. Of that lamentable company am I. Conversation after a time bores me, games tire me, and my own thoughts, which we are told are the unfailing resource of a sensible man, have a tendency to run dry. Then I fly to my book as the opium-smoker to his pipe. I would sooner read the catalogue of the Army and Navy stores or Bradshaw's Guide than nothing at all, and indeed I have spent many delightful hours over both these works.\\"\\"Though I said that affection was the greatest enemy of love, I would never deny that it's a very good substitute. I'm not sure that a marriage founded on it isn't the happiest.\\"\\"Footprints in the Jungle\\" is a rare exception in Maugham's oeuvre when he attempted a crime story. He always claimed he regretted that he did not have the talent to write this kind of stories. If you think of crime story only as one that should keep until the last page the information who did it, you cannot but agree with Maugham. He once mentioned that this story was given him complete and he just wrote it down without trying to write a who-did-it story. No, Maugham used the crime as he used everything else in his writing: as a mere skeleton on which to develop his views about the human nature. He did a brilliant job. I find \\"Footprints in the Jungle\\" not only one of his stories most thrilling to read but one of those who make me ask myself tons of serious questions as well. I wonder what is the relationship between the minds and the actions of the people around me. After all, am I concerned with the former or should I stick only to the latter? It is easy, and quite cynical according to a good many people, to devise motives behind any action of a person but is it worth while? Besides, one can never, absolutely never, be sure that the motives his fancy suggested have anything to do with reality. I am curious if we ourselves know all motives behind our own actions or there is something deeply buried in our brains that we can never perceive. Be that as it may, the final words of \\"Footprints in the Jungle\\" certainly are some of most haunting I have ever read:\\"'I'll tell you what, there's one job I shouldn't like,' he said'What is that?''God's, at the Judgment day,' said Gaze. 'No, sir'\\"\\"The Door of Opportunity\\" is another story that shows Maugham's extraordinary ability for creating suspense and leading the plot until stunning climax. The story starts prosaically, in an almost banal way: Alban and Anne come back in London after three years in the tropics. Then you are given a hint that not everything in their relationship is quite all right but you learn exactly what is wrong in the very end of the story, after being brought back in the tropics where you gradually learn the whole background of the catastrophe. The end is not at all surprising and unexpected but it is written in so powerful and highly charged emotionally dialogue that always leaves me stunned. Indeed, the dialogue is brilliant throughout the whole story; what is more, Maugham rarely depicted characters and incidents with a psychological acumen so outstanding that not just makes you believe everything but it also makes you live the whole story. And ask yourself a great many questions about life, arts, virtues and some other not altogether unimportant things.\\"The Back of Beyond\\" is another of the finest short stories Maugham ever wrote. It is superb in every aspect: plot and characters, dramatic intensity and thoughtful reflections, there is everything for everybody. Speaking of characters, George Moon certainly is quite a character and he is indispensable as the detached observer who gives the reader a great deal food for thought. He surely is one of the characters that Maugham must have based very firmly on himself and his own views of life. Monstrously cynical and cold and detached and insensitive as they may look to the majority, I don't think anybody with any common sense would refuse to consider them seriously.\\"Is one's honour really concerned because one's wife hops into bed with another man?\\"\\"Oh, my dear boy, one mustn't expect gratitude. It's a thing that no one has a right to. After all, you do good because it gives you pleasure. It's the purest form of happiness there is. To expect thanks for it is really asking too much. If you get it, well, it's like a bonus on shares on which you've already received a dividend; it's grand, but you mustn't look upon it as your due.\\"\\"You're behaving generously, old boy, and, you know, one needs a devil of a lot of tact to get people to forgive one one's generosity. Fortunately women are frivolous and they very quickly forget the benefits conferred upon them. Otherwise, of course, there'd be no living with them.\\"\\"I haven't deeply considered the matter [...] but if to look truth in the face and not resent it when it's unpalatable, and take human nature as you find it, smiling when it's absurd and grieved without exaggeration when it's pitiful, is to be cynical, then I suppose I'm a cynic. Mostly human nature is both absurd and pitiful, but if life has taught you tolerance you find in it more to smile at than to weep.\\"It may very well look unbelievable that such extremely profound and amazingly perceptive speculations about the human nature are part of a dramatic short story that is first and most of all a great pleasure to read, but it does happen to be true. George Moon certainly made a success of his life and that's the important thing for every one of us. But we must always keep in mind that this is something highly subjective and completely personal, so we must be tolerant if somebody else's idea of success in life is quite different than our own. I should like to finish here shamelessly quoting again, this time a part of conversation between George Moon and his ex-wife whom he was fool enough to divorce:\\"'Have you been happy too?''I think I can say I've been a success.''Oh, well, that's probably all the happiness you were capable of.'\\""},{"Title":"Ah King (and Other Famous Stories of Love and Hate in the Tropics)","review":"Huellas en la Jungla William Somerset MaughamLas seis historias cortas que componen esta obra, est&aacute;n escritas de la forma ingeniosa con que este autor siempre nos hace interesarnos por pasajes ex&oacute;ticos.

A combination of personal ignorance and Texan bravado has merged to formulate a being who cannot and will not think of women as his equals.Long gone are the days when Republican president Gerald R. Ford openly supported women's equality through public policies such as equal pay and the ERA ratification campaign, etc...The only thing diverse about Bush is his appointment of other women to enact the retrograde policies to intentionally undo the last thirty years of progress they themselves have ironically benefited from.Bush's chilling goal is for all of us to end up like his wife Laura, a robo-wife not allowed to have any public oppinions unless her husband thinks they will somehow support his goals. In this same world, our differing ideas (especially about reproductive issues) will be kept under wraps.Some of this basic premise was previously covered in Tanya Melich's 'War Against Women' (1996) which took an insider's look at how/why the late 20th century Republican Party intentionally began attacking women's rights.While she is an outsider who has never voted Republican, Flander's work benefits from the timeliness and 'pop' format unavailable in Melich's public confession. Serious topics (and alarming statistics) are condensed into the 'sound bite' read which our culture obviously thrives on.Buy a copy for yourself, and then purchase copies for all the women in your life who believe there is no important difference between the major political parties during this election season.

Maybe he has, but other women in the US and elsewhere have seen policies that, even where they were advertised as \\"women-friendly\\", have had the actual effect of making this a harsher, meaner world for the feminine population.The W Effect is a collection of over 60 articles from a wide variety of sources, which relate how US initiatives originating from, or supported by, the current White House have damaged women around the world. Some of them tell how hostility towards low-pay workers, gays and lesbians, and the poor have affected women and their young families. Others more directly address policies that particularly affect women, such as women's healthcare.An Afghan woman tells how the US government has snubbed local and ex-patriot Afghan women's organizations, which could cost-effectively rebuild Afghanistan's infrastructure. Instead money has been poured into expensive American security firms. A self-styled Iraqi \\"computer geek\\" mourns her computer-related job, destroyed by the war. She used to enjoy equal pay and conditions with male colleagues, but now can't even leave her house without a male guard to protect her and dressed in confining clothing. She expresses her frustration at Americans who expect her to show gratitude for having \\"liberated\\" her.What Laura Flanders provides is a good deal of detail for people who are already concerned at the way the nation is increasingly being run by \\"greedy, frightened, violent bullies.\\" What it won't provide is a balanced, objective report for those who are open-minded, but not yet convinced.

You will have to have charts of some sort to make sense of the fields in which these objects lie. Perhaps in a second edition.There are many books for the amateur who wishes to expand beyond the basic 500 object lists, but there is a dearth of observing guides for the scientifically up-to-date amateur astronomer just expanding beyond the Messier list.This is one, and I recommend it.Don PensackLos Angeles"},{"Title":"Concise Catalog of Deep-sky Objects: Astrophysical Information for 500 Galaxies, Clusters and Nebulae","review":"Hello, I recently purchased this book in Kindle format and have found it to be a very handy guide, especially for use in the field.

Kirkpatrick has a knack for identifying and tackling great drama and he writes it beautifully to boot.I knew of Thomas Eakins from his paintings of rowers on the Schuykill. From Kirkpatrick I was more properly introduced to Eakins and learned that he was a fiercely independent genius who was castigated, disgraced and impoverished.The Revenge of Thomas Eakins is an apt title. Eakins was just far too ahead of his time.Kirkpatrick's effortless style and attention to detail really drops you right into the mid to late 1800's, comfortably sharing the historical context along with development of Eakins.I recommend you read this one right away."},{"Title":"The Revenge of Thomas Eakins","review":"I highly recommend this well-written, balanced biography of Thomas Eakins. It would be a perfect choice for readers with any level of familiarity with Eakins' paintings. I agree with the other reviewers that the book does an excellent job of placing Eakins' work in its historical context. Eakins emerges as a fascinating personality, and a guy who would have been great to know. In my opinion, Kirkpatrick deals honestly with the controversial aspects of Eakins' character, but without dwelling on them ad nauseum.I thought that the descriptions of the paintings themselves were especially effective. The book communicated exactly the information I wanted to read about for paintings like The Gross Clinic and Max Schmitt in a Single Scull: the main points of the design, the background and tecnhical details, the dramatic impact, and the pyschological levels. I have read very few biographies of artists that were this helpful.The book is generously and beautifully illustrated. There are 42 color plates, and each of those paintings is described in detail in the text. There are also a number of drawings, sketches, maps, and photographs (some taken by Eakins, and others of Eakins and his family and friends). The photos in particular (such as the one of Eakins, himself nude, carrying a nude female toward the camera) underscore the independent and controversial aspects of Eakins' character.This was a very enjoyable read, and a tribute to a great artist."},{"Title":"The Revenge of Thomas Eakins","review":"When I picked up this very well done bio the little I knew about Eakins was the wonderful scull portraits, the shad fishing pictures and that a vague scandal surrounded his name. Now having read almost 500 pages, I want to know even more and there is a lot more to know.Kirkpatrick covers the whole life, giving balance to each stage. It is a full book. There is no \\"filler\\". The research and background knowledge of the author shine forth on every page. The author shows great restraint in sticking to the known facts, otherwise this would be a 1000+ page book!For instance, Eakins' fixation with the body, down to using mechanical contraptions on dead animals to demonstrate movement to students is factually presented. It is not sensationalized or psychoanalyzed. Similarly, whether Eakins was oblivious to or had discounted the consequences of asking so many females (again and again) to pose nude in this Victorian age is not discussed. The known instances of these invitations and the resulting alienation of those who said no, and the alienation of the friends and families of those that said yes are covered. With this background we learn the known facts of the tragedy of his niece Ella, and student Lillian, and about accusations regarding his sister Margaret. There are some documented opinions of family members, but the author stays with the known record.No wonder, the self portrait that adorns the cover shows a tortured man with barely restrained sadness and anger.It's ironic that the lack of appreciation for Eakin's works served to maintain the integrity of the collection for future generations. It's interesting that due to the nondescript Charles Bregler's collecting and acquiring memorabilia of his beloved teacher, today's researchers have a large collection of personal letters, photos and sketches to work with.This is a very readable book. It is rich in plates and photographs that illuminate the text.

In an age when you can get rich and famous by glueing broken crockery to canvas or stuffing a dead fish into a tank of formaldehyde, it is usually a case of a poor choice of publicists than undiscovered talent and the real loser is the poor fool who buys contemporary art for a high price only to watch the value crash when the artist moves on and his work starts to fall apart or rot.But there was a time when truly great artists did suffer. We all know about Van Gogh, but Thomas Eakins was also a classic example. Everyone loves his sports pictures and his two group portraits of heroic doctors lecturing their students (the Gross Clinic and the Agnew Clinic) even make a Christian Scientist envy those who have chosen the medical profession.But for my money, his portraits stake the primary claim to Eakins' greatness. His sitters usually refused to accept their portraits, some destroyed them, others refused to sit at all (Mr. Kirkpatrick quotes one lifelong friend of Eakins who always refused to sit for him because he was afraid that Eakins would uncover what he had spent his lifetime trying to conceal).And I'd imagine that viewing your Eakins-painted portrait for the first time must have been an eerie, almost supernatural event. Looking at his splendid portraits today, you KNOW the subjects, their hardships and triumphs, their hopes and fears. These are not prettified and bowdlerized pictures to hang on a wall, these are the real thing. It is as if Eakins stripped away the skin of his sitters to reveal the pure psyche underneath. They are beautiful and informative and moving. Fifteen minutes with an Eakins is more enlightening than a month in a room of Sargeants.Mr. Kirkpatrick's fine biography is one of the best on any subject. He manages to capture the man and his times and the man IN his times, in a way that few biographers can accomplish. He manages to make the story exciting, even as he takes the reader through an almost brushstroke by brushstroke description of Eakins' painting process.At first, my only reservation was the title. The point of it is to show how Eakins fame after death was his revenge for the tragedy of his career (a close and valued student conspiring to replace him, loss of reputation for insisting on painting things as they are, base and highly publicized accusations [about which Mr. Kirkpatrick carefully assembles the evidence for and against, describing the scandals as fairly and dispassionately as he can], rejection of his works, etc.), but the author discusses Eakins death only two pages before the end of the book, hardly enough time to develop the world's slow acceptance of Eakins' genius.But then I realized that the book itself is Eakins' revenge. Very few people of even the first rank ever have a biography written about them as fine as this one. This book will be read as the classic text for the next one hundred years and it should be read, merely for its quality, by everyone no matter how slim their interest in American painting."},{"Title":"The Revenge of Thomas Eakins","review":"I find all of Kirkpatrick's books to be great reads. They combine impeccable scholarship with elegant style and profound insight. As I am interested in art, I found this one to be especially powerful -- the first major biography of Eakins that brings this enigmatic man into focus for me. Kirkpatrick has filled in the puzzling gaps in Eakins's life and brought new and unexpected meaning to Eakins's artistic and personal struggles against the conservative art establishment in Philadelphia that denied him recognition in his lifetime."},{"Title":"The Revenge of Thomas Eakins","review":"This is really the first book written that tells the full Thomas Eakins biography in context and gives all the details without the kind of filter that sometimes says more about the writer than it does about the subject. Kirkpatrick takes us back to turn-of-the-century America and allows us to see Eakins' life and work in the context of his times--and lets us make up our own minds. It is a wonderful read and an excellent biography for everybody-even those who don't know of Eakins or his work. I loved it!"},{"Title":"The Revenge of Thomas Eakins","review":"I have read and enjoyed several of Kirkpatrick's other books (on very different subjects), and was eager to see how he would handle a subject as complicated and controversial as Thomas Eakins. Through his telling of the Eakins story, the reader becomes privy to moments of nearly cosmic dimension as well as deep emotion. It's utterly convincing, lucid and intelligent, highly informative and extremely compelling. His most moving book to date."},{"Title":"The Revenge of Thomas Eakins","review":"Refreshingly pleasant writing style. I couldn't put it down. Was glad that several color plates included--amazingly, so many art biographies don't include the actual art work."},{"Title":"The Revenge of Thomas Eakins","review":"This is a fine biography of the great American painter. It is a very substantial look into Eakins life, era, and evolution as a painter. The author treads very lightly on Eakins personal proclivities, a dated but acceptable reluctance. If only all artist biographies were so excellent. An essential read for anyone interested in painting, you will learn a great deal."},{"Title":"The Revenge of Thomas Eakins","review":"I came to this book seeking to renew my acquaintance with Eakins scholarship following a visit to Philadelphia to see the newly-restored Gross Clinic, never having read any of Kirkpatrick's previous books. Could this book really be better than Lloyd Goodrich's definitive 2 volume biography? In a word: yes. It is nothing short of a masterful page-turner, comprised of relatively short chapters that keep the book flowing along. Kirkpatrick incorporates the relatively recently rediscovered Bregler Collection of Eakins letters, etc., which wonderfully illuminate many previously obscure aspects of Eakin's life and scandals. Approaching Eakins primarily as a story teller, rather than as an art historian has worked wonderfully. This book would probably be the best biography with which to begin a study of Eakins. I think that Elizabeth Johns' Thomas Eakins: The Heroism of Modern Life remains the best scholarly analysis of Eakins paintings (and maybe the best book ever written about Eakins), and would be an excellent pairing to Kirkpatrick's modern biography."},{"Title":"Beyond The Razor Wire: (A collection of poem from inmates)","review":"The title of this book is so misleading. I was looking for a poetry, not for a religious new born Christian propaganda. You could've put somewhere that this was Christian brainwashing poetry and not about real people's real feelings behind the bars. I want my money back."},{"Title":"Beyond The Razor Wire: (A collection of poem from inmates)","review":"This is a very interesting collection of poetry. All these poems were written by inmates in the Virginia prison system. As with any collection of poems, some are better than others but one thing they all have in common. Each of these poems comes straight from the heart.As you read through these pieces you will feel the pain and the guilt these inmates live with every day but most of all you will feel the hope. It is hope that this collection is really all about. Hope for the present and the future but, mainly, hope for the soul.Included in this collection is a short autobiographical piece by David Berkowitz, the Son Of Sam. The story of how he went from serial killer to servant of Christ is truly inspirational.This book is not just for prison inmates. We have all felt, at one time or another, that we were in bondage. We have all felt trapped; by family and friends, by emotions, by circumstances beyond our control. For anyone who has ever felt walled in by life this book delivers a powerful message of hope and release."},{"Title":"Midnight at the Well of Souls","review":"There are not many books I read more than once. This is one that over the years I have read at least five times. Jack L. Chalker created a not so well known masterpiece. Read it. You will be glad that you did."},{"Title":"Midnight at the Well of Souls","review":"If you like sci-fi this is the one"},{"Title":"Midnight at the Well of Souls","review":"\\"Midnight at the Well of Souls\\" is a book with a great deal of potential, which is the main reason I found it to be such a grand disappointment in the end -- most of that potential goes unrealized, and the book is a rather trite (and not terribly well-written) example of what's wrong with much of modern science fiction.Mind you, the ideas in the novel are intriguing. The concept of the Well World, for example, is fairly original and has a lot of potential for easily delving into many different cultures and alien races. Unfortunately, the idea is not explored nearly as well as it could be, and is really only a superficial device to serve the plot... such as it is. The different alien cultures and races of the Well World are only explored thinly, with no sense of richness or history in it. The different races seem to be created for their wierdness factor than any actual examination of different cultures.What's worse is the story itself isn't all that great. Remove the concept of the Well World, and you have a fairly standard quest framework. The main character has a \\"mysterious\\" (but rather predictable) origin, but his personality is still a carbon-copy hero from any swashbuckling space opera. Think Han Solo and you've pretty much nailed him. The other characters only seem to act as foils for how his story is told. Throw in some alien sex here and there, a standard \\"universal translator\\" device to get over the problem of different languages, and end with a very predictable conclusion, and what the story amounts to is... not much.Without the concept behind the story, it's really pretty bland. The plot moves along sluggishly, with several blatantly obvious passages of exposition masked as character dialogue. I found a scene near the end, in which the characters are travelling down an extremely long moving walkway to their destination, especially annoying in this regard. There was no good reason for the walkway to be there, and it had already established that such clunky transportation was unnecessary on the Well World. The only reason for it to be there was so the main characters (and the reader) could be told what was going on up to that point. This passage was perhaps the worst example of several similar parts of the novel, in which story exposition is dealt with in an exceptionally clumsy way.Chalker's writing style leaves much to be desired as well. His use of language is minimal and not suggestive at all of the weight he attempted to give the subject matter. Dialogue was essentially the same from one character to another, with none of the usual language markers to differentiate different people or different groups (this goes to the lack of cultural depth in the book discussed earlier). The characters lacked any feeling of honest emotion, such that I didn't connect with any of them at all.For an idea with so much potential, this book was really lacking in so many ways. It was vaguely entertaining in some parts, but overall felt poorly-written and trite. Chalker's treatment of a good idea ended up very broad but also very superficial, only scratching the surface of the story's potential. I would love to see an idea like the Well World given a proper treatment by a better writer, one with a talent for how to craft alien worlds and different cultures with some sense of validity and history. Without that, a book like this just falls flat.I won't be keeping this one, and I do not recommend it, unless you're into shallow, poorly-written science fiction."},{"Title":"Midnight at the Well of Souls","review":"A wonderfull story that can be read on so many different levels, that you can always find something new in each reread that you didn't catch before."},{"Title":"Midnight at the Well of Souls","review":"If you like books that make you feel you're on another planet, you may like this book.

This is classic Sci-fi...."},{"Title":"Midnight at the Well of Souls","review":"Midnight at the Well of Souls is an old-school piece of sci-fi, with a brilliant setting and a story that doesn't just examine the concept of what it means to be human, it kicks it over and scatters the pieces everywhere.Just so you know what kind of ride you're in for, the book opens with characters learning the true nature of the universe. From there, the protagonists are transported to an artificial planet divided into thousands of \\"hexes,\\" each with its own unique form of life. Moreover, the protagonists themselves are transformed into different forms of life, not just once, but multiple times throughout the story. It's not every day you read a sci-fi novel where your main character is a talking elk who runs around with a centaur, a talking bat, a giant sentient insect, and a sentient tree.Although Midnight features some interesting examination of character, the real star is the setting. The planet itself is one giant mystery to be unraveled, and despite a few clunky points in the middle, I found the journey a fun and satisfying one. Those familiar with Chalker's penchant for gender-bending and toying with sexual identity will also not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Midnight at the Well of Souls","review":"Jack L. Chalker has written nearly as many series (11) as he has stand-alone novels (12).Jungle of Stars(Nov 1976) was his freshman novel but was quickly followed by his sophomore novel and most well known work, Midnight at the Well of Souls (Jul 1977). More than a year later, Chalker would write the sequel,Exiles at the Well of Souls(Sep 1978) along with another in 1978, two more in 1980, and two much later novels in 1999 and 2000.I first read Chalker in 2008 with his Rings of the Master quadrilogy (1986-1988). Basically, Midnight at the Well of Souls follows the same formula as the Rings of the Master series--group of characters find themselves on a quest for an artifact and undergo physical transformations along the way. It's a generic summary but it fits both--this book and the latter series--to a \\"T.\\"Rear cover synopsis:\\"Who was Nathan Brazil... and what was he doing on the Well World?Entered by a thousand unsuspected gateway--built by a race lost in the clouds of time--the planet its dwellers called the Well World turned being of every kind into something else. There spacefarer Nathan Brazil found himself companioned by a batman, an amorous female centaur and a mermaid--all once as human as he.Yet Nathan Brazil's metamorphosis was more terrifying than any of those... and his memory was coming back, bringing with it the secret of the Well World.For at the heart of the bizarre planet lay the goal of every being that had ever lived--and Nathan Brazil and his comrades were... lucky?... enough to find it!\\"------------The planet of Dalgonia was otherwise barren and desolate, if it weren't for the enigmatic ruins of the alien race--the Markovians--dead for a million years without a trace of artifact beside their crust-thick planet-wide computer of unknown capacity. The hexagonal mystery of the city's layout is pondered upon by researcher Skander, but its his mathematician Varnett who discovers the breakthrough in understanding the computer's nature. Skander's greed for power drives him to murder the other crew and chase after Varnett, who both soon find themselves at the foot of a giant portal to another dimension.Nathan Brazil and his freighter passengers are on a long haul trip when an emergency beacon beckons them to the planet of Dalgonia. The diverse passengers, ranging from the cloned Confederacy diplomatic envoy to the forced-addict farmer, descend to the planet to investigate the murder of the scientific crew. Their search takes them to the same area as the hidden portal where they are also transferred to same dimension.Received by a 6-armed muscular snake isn't the warmest greeting, but when that same creature knows Nathan by name, the lot of them settle down to absorb the confounding truth of where they have found themselves--the Zone is a reception level for people (aliens or humans) who stumble upon the Markovians' hidden portals. The reception level gives access to the greater mystery--a planet plated with 1,560 hexagons, where each hexagonal tract of land is dedicated to a different species of alien. Once through the access portal, each of them will be transformed into a phenotype which corresponds to their respective attitudes and behaviors.The four passengers are transformed into a mermaid researcher, a centaur wallflower, a photosynthetic creature who also researches, and an insectile servant while Nathan, himself, remains human, whose species had recently undergone extinction in their hexagonal habitat. Nathan seeks out the other passengers and slowly discovers that he knows more about the odd planet than he first thought--something is familiar, something which may explain his immortality.One collection of passengers, now planet-fallen and physically diverse, is rounded up my Nathan and aim to approach the equator which is host to a towering divide between the hemispheres and may be part of the mystery involved in the ubiquitous casual mention of Well of Souls across every language. Another entourage is gathered by the menacing insectile servant, whose goal is to also reach the equator for the purpose of power. Each pilgrimage is composed of diverse phenotypes and their respective trek to the equator takes them through terrain which is equally as diverse as their physical composition. Nathan, having been given human body, thought himself lucky... until he was transformed into an antelope, a circumstance which proved have its benefits and its drawbacks.------------The start of the novel was exciting with a strong start in the fiction universe portrayed by Chalker. Of minor interest was the human universe of Confederate genetic engineering, its complacent members of society, and the erroneous supposition that even the leaders are aligned to their genetic vocational disposition. The brief coverage of the archaeological excavation of the alien culture was pivotal in introducing the reader to the mysteries which lie deeper inside Midnight at the Well of Souls, but soon the focus is taken off the aliens and spotted onto the diversity within the portal.Even the transition to the exotic hexagonal-plated planet was momentous, but eventually the randomness of metamorphoses and diversity become more about quantity than quality. Too many ideas can be a bad thing, especially when the science fiction element begins to accrue a Tolkien fantasy element with centaurs, Faeries, magic spells, and instant transformations. Chalker does a weak job of convincing the reader of the science basis behind such magic, but then again Arthur C. Clarke's third law of \\"Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic\\" comes to mind. This is hard to digest when the border region between fantasy and science fiction is so slim, yet it's completely up to the author to bridge the gap between technology and magic. Unfortunately, it feels like Chalker's love of fantasy got the best of him.Chalker tries to build a romance story out of Nathan's natural superiority and Wu Julee's forced inferiority. I understand Julee's desire to be drawn to the man of power, but Nathan's sympathetic attachment to Julee adopts more perversity than it does love. If Julee is such a victim of lust and power, why would Nathan want to project the same attributes of lust and power on his idea of a victim-cum-lover? The situation becomes increasing odd when the Julee's centaur manifestation coincides with Nathan's ascent to his antelope state... their mutual quadapedal bodily configuration quickly invites another rather convenient state of arousal--an altogether rather bizarre sex scene.As stated above, the Chalker's inclusion of Faeries and magic is a very quick turn off for someone who dislikes Tolkien fantasy, like myself. Right then, the book hovered around the 2.5-star mark as I waited for a decent attempt at explaining the lame inclusion. Coming to the conclusion, enough evidence was given to partly convince me of the technological prowess of the hexagonal-plated planet but I thought that simply excluding the fantasy-like elements would have proved to be a stronger mention.The ultimate plot conclusion is too grand, too exploitive to feel satisfactory, almost as if the single sweep of the conclusions finality can provide all the answers to life, the universe, and everything. As for the personal conclusions for each character, the wishes granted seem fitting yet reflect some sexism on Chalker's part. Where the women were once forcibly docile, their \\"magic\\" freedom comes at the cost of shrugging off their former burdens for the convenience of their newly found metamorphosis... it's cheap to see their docility change simply because their bodily form had changed.------------So, Midnight at the Well of Souls was rather well done but failed to really entice me to read any of the sequels. I mean, this novel was pretty well nip and tuck at the conclusion that I'd hate to see any of it complicated or deteriorated or buffed to a shine with any sequel. I don't think the Well of Souls series was actually meant to be a series like the obvious Rings of the Master initiation in the first book,Lords of the Middle Dark(1986). Just taking a look at the covers of the proceeding novels in the series is enough to turn me off to them. I may be turned off of Chalker for a while unless something honestly strikes me as something non-formulaic to the characters-on-a-quest paint-by-numbers plot."},{"Title":"Midnight at the Well of Souls","review":"This book has it all!!!!

The beginning of a five book series, Midnight tells of a man named Nathan Brazil, and how he and his strange life fit into the center of the universe and its history.Nathan is a typically tough-as-nails starship captain who is carried through events set off by his own interference with a criminal syndicate, but it's where he goes that defines the entire series: The Well World.The Well World is the generator of all modern reality. Billions of years in the past, a race of beings developed the ultimate in technology, computers that could read their minds, and then with matter/energy transforming systems would translate those thoughts, whatever they were, into reality. After a long time, they did everything, and became bored. They wondered if that could really be all there was to life, but could envision no more than they had, and decided that somehow they had reached an evolutionary dead end because to them it was obvious that there _had_ to be more to life. Any other decision would have meant that their lives had been meaningless. They took their computer-reality technology and built a computer the size of a planet, one so large that it could generate an entire universe. Upon its surface were hexagonal zones of a few thousand square kilometers [I can't remember the exact size], each one an enviromental enclousure where the ancient race designed and tested for viability every possible intelligent race they could think of. The designs of those that proved suitable were stored away, and the enclosure would be used again and again. Eventually they used the planet to create an entirely new universe, overlaying the original one (which had far fewer worlds and stars). The early evolution of the universe was forced through at incredible speed until most of the intelligent species emerged, and then, well, it's not exactly clear. The race that did all of it vanished, and although a variety of ideas about what happened to them were put forward in the book, none of them were convincing.Meanwhile, in current time on The Well World, the last set of races to be tested out in the enclosures were left to their own devices. They formed odd societies and inter-society relations, given that each enclosure was often radically different from its neighbors.Onto The Well World comes Nathan Brazil, and the passengers of his tramp freighter. Strange things begin to happen on The Well (short for The Well World). They are all told that they will be put through another gate, this one teleporting them to one of the enclosures, where they will be transformed into one of the native intelligent species.And with that simple act, Chaos breaks out across The Well.That sounded like the whole story, didn't it? Trust me, that's just the backfill, and spoils very little that isn't told right at the beginning of the book. And _then_ there are the next four books.Enjoy.Vol. 1: Midnight at the Well of SoulsVol. 2: Exiles at the Well of Souls (Part 1: War of the Well World)Vol. 3: Quest for the Well of Souls (Part 2: War of the Well World)Vol. 4: The Return of Nathan BrazilVol. 5: Twilight at the Well of Souls"},{"Title":"Midnight at the Well of Souls","review":"A short while ago, someone emailed me asking for a ordered list of the books in this series (they got my email address from an earlier review).Here it is for everyone else.1-Midnight at the Well of Souls2-Exiles at the Well of Souls3-Quest for the Well of Souls4-The Return of Nathan Brazil5-Twilight at the Well of SoulsRemember, books 2 and 3 originally were one book called The War of the Well World, and are a single story, broken into two novels by the publishing requirements of the time."},{"Title":"Midnight at the Well of Souls","review":"Jack Chalker's \\"Midnight at the Well of Souls\\" is a science fiction adventure tale that one could describe as an ambitious epic, yet written with an often whimsical sense of fun. The novel is full of colorful characters, weird locales, and imaginatively conceived alien species.The story's hero is freighter captain Nathan Brazil, a human male who is noted to be a maverick and a loner in \\"an age of extreme conformity.\\" While carrying a motley collection of passengers on his ship, Brazil answers a distress call. Soon he finds himself on the Well World, a bizarre planet divided up into hundreds of biospheres and home to hundreds of different civilizations. Oh, and each newcomer to the planet can expect to find him- or herself transformed into a different species! \\"Midnight\\" charts the odyssey of Brazil, his allies, and his enemies across this strange and wondrous world as they seek the answer to an ancient mystery.\\"Midnight\\" is a novel of ideas as well as a fun and exciting adventure; Chalker deals with such issues as history, drug addiction, crime, social organization, literacy, and more as the story unfolds. Chalker cleverly delves into the life cycles and sexual behaviors of the various Well World species, which include intelligent plants, a centaur-like race, and many more. The motif of transformation, including gender-changing, is intriguingly handled throughout the story.Chalker makes reference to \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" at one point in the book, but the book, curiously, reminds me more of L. Frank Baum's classic Oz tales. And Chalker's vision of science, civilization, and history reminds me a bit of a less horrific, more light-hearted H.P. Lovecraft. Overall, a lot of fun, and written in a very engaging prose style. If you like this book, try \\"Lord Valentine's Castle,\\" by Robert Silverberg."},{"Title":"Midnight at the Well of Souls","review":"I don't know why, but some unfortunate reason Midnight at the Well of Souls seems familiar to Simak's Goblin Reservation. I don't know why. They share very little.There is a planet in space that was created aeons ago by a long-gone race that achieved the ultimate in technology. Its area is precisely delineated into 1460 hexagonal biomes, each home to a separate intelligent species, half of which (the entire northern hemisphere to be exact) are non-carbon-based and non-humanoid in both mental and physical faculties. It's rather like going to the zoo - as the characters make their way through hex after hex of alien terrain your heart is filled with awe of the next big surprise civilization that Chalker has prepaired for you.And although in the beginning the book may seem to be the average blood-and-guts-and-sex romance set on another planet, you are soon enveloped in an enourmous mistery (that easily dwarfs that of Card's Speaker for the Dead) of interspecies proportions. Touched upon is the eternal question of what makes us human (and Chalker's human civilization of genderless drug-controlled clones is most certainly not human), and, finally, for the big finale, the characters are allowed to alter anything in the universe and the reader gets a brief glimpse of God.The plot is original and the characters are quite believable.

I simply want to recommend Chalker the writer. I've read pretty much everything he's published and I always look forward to his new books. This, though, is certainly one of his greatest. It's a great shame that mainstream SF critics have ignored or impugned his work because it's as good or better than a lot of the dross that's out there (and I include some of the so-called masterworks that have been swathed in awards). Thankfully he has a loyal legion of fans that have followed his career.And this is also a great prequel to the War of the Well which is told the four volumes that followed this one. You don't have to read them all, as this a stand alone novel, but if you enjoy this one as much as so many others have then you'll certainly want to read more about Well World and the War of the Well novels are also superior entertainment on a large scale.Basically, try anything of Jack Chalker's. He's an underrated master of the fantasy/sf genre.Look also for The Four Lords of the Diamond series, The Rings of the Master series, the Dancing Gods novels and his lone short story collection, Dance Band on the Titanic.The War of the Well is told in Exiles at the Well of Souls, Quest for the Well of Souls, The Return of Nathan Brazil and Twilight at the Well of Souls.Dont wait.

There are also a few characters from the first book that eventually (some sooner than others) make another appearance.If you want to tackle the list, here's the order to do it in (since it isn't really obvious):Midnight at the Well of SoulsExiles at the Well of SoulsQuest for the Well of SoulsThe Return of Nathan BrazilTwilight at the Well of Souls"},{"Title":"Midnight at the Well of Souls","review":"Mystery man transformation adventure.Unashamed SF light adventure as Nathan Brazil returns to the Well World, a sort of zoo of small sections of many different races and societies.Once there and transforming across the place he begins to get his memory back and realise who and what he is and the bad things that just might happen.Fun."},{"Title":"Midnight at the Well of Souls","review":"For those of us who enjoy alternatives to the standard views of life and history or just looking for something new to roll over in your mind this is it.Not only are the characters strong and likable the story flows quickly and evenly."},{"Title":"Blank Book Autumn Shadow","review":"Lovely cover for tree lovers.

If you look closely you can see the kind of *heart* that would characterize Steinbeck's humanity in later works. His sensitivity, if you will. But that kind of sensitivity is at its best when balanced with Steinbeck's wit and satirical edge. Here, though, in Cup of Gold was a young Steinbeck without the momentum -- nor the boldness -- to balance a sense of humanity with cutting satire, and the novel ultimately sounds too sentimental and limp. In my opinion, Steinbeck really came into his own with Tortilla Flat (1935). Pastures of Gold (1932) and To a God Unknown (1933) were both closer to Cup of Gold in their romantic tendancies. But Tortilla Flat is the first novel where Steinbeck really enjoyed writing a novel, and the result was a comedy. Cup of Gold provides a window into a young writer's mind (Steinbeck published it at 27) -- a writer trying to find his calling -- and ultimately, a writer who would go on the write better novels with maturity and the development of his craft."},{"Title":"Cup Of Gold","review":"Like most first time authors, Steinbeck looked for inspiration in his imagination. Fascinated with the swashbuckling pirates, he tests the literary waters with his first work. While it is lengthy and overly flowering in parts, it is a wonderful starting point to tracing his lengthy career. Strangely enough, in his later years, he once again turned to childhood inspiration when he penned his &quot;King Arthur&quot; stories. A study of the two also provides an intriguing subject."},{"Title":"Cup Of Gold","review":"Steinbeck did not wish to be referred to as an &quot;author.&quot; He has shown from this work through to the last (Winter of Our Discontent) what it takes to answer the demand of a talented and dedicated&quot;writer.&quot; Here, an exciting tale carries the reader off on high sea adventures. One is catapulted into circumstances of an historical era which take on the aura of reality. Giving , in the bargin, a new value system for the&quot; trade&quot; of piracy. Read this and then read on through this author's multi-faceted offerings!"},{"Title":"Cup Of Gold","review":"This was John Steinbeck's first novel and it explores the idea of the great man who is unconvinced of his own greatness. The story is about pirate Henry Morgan who, through perseverance, pluck, intelligence, and bravery becomes the most feared pirate in the Caribbean, eventually capturing \\"The Cup of Gold\\" - Panama. He hopes, along with this prize, to gain the love of the beautiful La Santa Roja. But she spurns him and out of bitterness Morgan ransoms her to her husband for 20,000 pieces of eight. Now he begins to doubt himself and his accomplishments and goes into a funk that even being knighted and being made the governor of Jamaica can't cure. He dies a mysterious death in his sleep.Shakespeare wrote, \\"Many men have died and worms have eaten them, but not for love,\\" but Morgan never got the message. He loses La Santa Roja and he's a goner. Unfortunately, Steinbeck hadn't developed the means yet to really capture what was going on with his characters. His writing seems unnatural and affected by the 17th century setting than anything real. The historical novel was not his forte, and he never attempted another one. This initial effort was not a good indication of what talented work lay ahead."},{"Title":"Cup Of Gold","review":"Sing, goddess, of the passion and plight of the First Novel! Where a budding writer tests his wings, catches a breeze, and discovers the joy of flight-sailing on the current of the imagination to undiscovered lands, a private Elysium of vine and fertile soil. Unfortunately, the first book is often like a first child: hope and wonder rest side by side with flaw and inexperience; very rarely does one get it right the first time out.Stienbeck was no exception in this, \`Cup of Gold,' the first of many for this Nobel-Prize laureate, this undisputable master of the craft. The writing itself is for the most part superb, though a bit didactic and superfluous in passages, but certainly better than any number of the current Bestsellers of this modern era. The main problem, in my opinion, lies in the structure of the novel. Stienbeck devotes the first third of \`Cup of Gold' to Henry Morgan's upbringing, from desolate Wales to luxuriant slavery in Barbados, then glosses over probably the most interesting portion of Morgan's life, his initiation and rise to power as a pirate, King o' the Seas, bloodythirsty God of swashbucklers and scurvy-hounds...the reader goes from a mere boy to a world-weary husk of dissipated passions within three pages. Thus, the supposed anguish and character-transformation that Stienbeck *tells* us occurs during the sack of Panama come off stilted and wan, for the reader has not been given the opportunity to sympathize with Morgan-he's just a stranger given to philosophic fits and embodied with archetypical male angst. If Stienbeck had devoted, say, a hundred pages to Morgan's development from boy to captain, the themes would be substantiated and the assault on Panama would gain tragic import for not only its citizens, but for the dominator as well.Alas, \`Cup of Gold' never recovers from this fragmentation of plot and character, and though it is an interesting read and overall written well, in the end one mourns for possibilities undeveloped. Certainly useful for a student of writing, though. Three stars."},{"Title":"Cup Of Gold","review":"This is a romanticized telling and not something that would make you try Steinbeck -- if you want him writing non-fiction I think his best is Log From the Sea Of Cortez, and otherwise, I like his Cannery Row books the best for light reading."},{"Title":"Cup Of Gold","review":"Dear Reader,I like to imagine that you're bit like me. Somewhat tired of the modern prose, somewhat weary of the loud noises that bestseller titles make, somewhat afraid of the immense number of classics you haven't yet read (either you didn't have time, or you didn't care that much). Maybe you like to imagine a different world, one with much slower pace of living, one without a constant stream of (usually unwanted) information, one in which you can actually afford to sit back and relax and let your mind wonder inside the universe that someone else's mind created. It's a strange and wonderful experience - reading that is - one which goes beyond the mere digesting of information, one for which is harder and harder to actually find time. Steinbeck's \\"Cup of gold\\", however poorly it might have been written (when compared to the rest of his work, and having in mind that this is Steinbeck's first novel), is one of those books that present you with an opportunity to experience a reading like that.You're reading this in the second decade of 21st century and, as you might have guessed, world is much different than it was hundred years ago. It's just an illusion though - there are differences but much of it is just the same as it was back then. Politics, power games, game of appearances, games of control - rules haven't changed; only the discourse did. \\"Cup of gold\\" works within archaic language, using style that has long ago gone out of fashion (though you might be careful with this - real literature, no matter the style, never goes out of fashion) and one has to accustom himself to this. Though I must be honest; I'm having a hard time imagining something more \\"appropriate\\" for something that is essentially a pirate novel. There are modern authors which do write about pirates (this topic will never get old though it might grow more and more obscure), but modern language and modern understanding of the novel somehow just doesn't cut it. This is probably my own fantasy, mere imagining of things, though you might share similar sentiments.Whilst reading this book, you can almost picture Steinbeck, a youth of twenty-something writing about pirates and distant past in a world that will soon be hit with a market crash. Depression will come, prohibition is already there, and amongst all of this Steinbeck writes about enchanted, dreamy places like Panama, about mysterious women whose name rolls out of your tongue and then, just before it hits that [h], curls it and make it tremble with desire. He writes about windswept heights of British island and half-druidic bards called Merlin evoking an Arthurian cycle in a world of pragmatism and harsh realities. He writes about Henry Morgan in a larger-than-life manner of speech, he parades him around (just like they used to parade stars in early Hollywood) and makes him erratic, passionate, brutish and a figure from some fantasy so distant and unreal that one cannot but laugh. He writes about history which never existed (or never did in a manner in which is it presented) but it somehow seems that it must have existed; that there was a time in which robbers and murderers where something like romantic warrior poets which people adored (especially the ones that weren't on the wrong side of a cutlass). He writes about it and you savor it, taking your time, because you know that once you're done you'll be back in a different world; in a world that hasn't these kinds of stories anymore.So dear Reader, be aware that \\"Cup of gold\\" isn't really a good book. Or at least, isn't really a good literature by any standards. But - it is an enchanting book and you might do far worse than spend some time with it. Who knows, it just might be what you were looking for all this time."},{"Title":"Cup Of Gold","review":"I'd been looking forward to this book for years because it was John Steinbeck's first novel and was just hard to find. Then one of my AP Literature students bought a copy for me. (No, it didn't help his grade.) This was, well, and interesting read. There were flashes here and there of the great author Steinbeck was to become, but overall it was kind of overwritten with some stilted and archaic dialogue. Also, the buildup to the capture of the Red Saint, as given in the introduction and the back cover, made it seem like she was going to be an important part of the story, when in truth she wasn't that important. Probably the most irritating thing about the story was that the ending seemed very passive. Possibly a stylistic choice by the young author, but not one I liked very much.This one is primarily for die-hard Steinbeck fans or those with a passion for pirate stories. It has a few beautifully written passages, but it isn't one I'll be returning to anytime soon."},{"Title":"Cup Of Gold","review":"A book like this is not written these days.

Although it is not as well-written as his more famous novels--\\"East of Eden\\" or \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\"--it is still an entertaining tale with some interesting life lessons woven into the narrative."},{"Title":"Cup Of Gold","review":"A number of reviewers have given this novel single stars, and I am truly at a loss as to the reason. \\"Cup Of Gold\\" is not vintage Steinbeck. The characters are more flat and less motivated than in his classic novels, and there always seems to be an underlying question of \\"where is this book taking us, and why should we care?\\"However, bearing all that in mind, \\"COG\\" is a fairly well-written novel about two things: how greatness arises from childish ambition, and how even the most lauded of conquerers are laden with insecurities and doubts. Despite some of the callowness of the characters (mainly Morgan), I found myself enjoying this novel, and seeing a lot of depth within...but a detached depth. In fact, I likened it to Kubrick's fine film \\"Barry Lyndon\\" which is more focused on observing a character's traits than drawing any conclusions about him. Steinbeck never tries to beat you over the head with the fact that Morgan is / was a deceitful, ambitious and insecure zealot who cares far more about his reputation and how he is perceived than any of his actual accomplishments. Instead, the reader is left to absorb all this and shake one's head with a grim smile at the commonality of truth regarding people such as Morgan.I contend that this book is well-written, despite some obvious foibles of a first-time novelist. Certain words were used too frequently (\\"cried\\" as a synonym of \\"said\\" was annoyingly common) and it lacks the gentle flow that many of Steinbeck's novels offer, but there is certainly a depth here that forms the basis of many of his later themes. So before you judge this book by other reviews here, consider the power of a few early sentences in this novel: \\"Why do men like me want sons?...it must be because they hope in their poor beaten souls that these new men, who are their blood, will do the things they were not strong enough nor wise enough nor brave enough to do. It is rather like another chance with life; like a new bag of coins at a table of luck after your fortune is gone.\\""},{"Title":"Cup Of Gold","review":"The blurb on the cover says this was Steinbeck's one and only effort at an historical novel so I picked it up at once, being, myself, a lover of the historical tale. And frankly I like swashbucklers, to boot, so that promised an added kick.Well, it read smoothly enough and yet it was a rather odd offering, all in all, since it proved to be a somewhat lyrical rendering of the life of the infamous pirate Henry Morgan, making him out to be an idealistic dreamer-knight, driven to do cruel and heartless things only because of his hard-to-outgrow boyishness, a condition which, in the end, entraps him in a never-never fantasy land of his own making. Certainly pirates weren't like this, all poets and romantics, not really, and it is very unlikely that Morgan, the rapacious scoundrel we know from history was.And yet, there is something endearing and entrancing in this magical interior fantasy of a boy who sets out to find adventure and grows into the rapscallion Morgan, scourge of the seas, of the Spaniards and, in the end, of his fellow buccaneers. This tale tracks Morgan from his run-away Welsh boyhood to inadvertent slavery in the Carribbean to young manhood in the English colony of Jamaica, and on to his long dreamed of career of piracy and beyond. Growing into a fearless and clever strategist of the seas, Morgan hurts those he passes by on his life's journey, from parents to father figure in old Jamaica, to the women he abandons, all because of his own self-absorption and personal dreams. But the lure of the rich Spanish colony in Panama, known as the Cup of Gold, and of a reputed woman of unexcelled loveliness who resides there, the Red Saint, combine to draw him on to his greatest adventure of all. There in Panama Morgan meets his dream's end, never to be quite the same thereafter. There Morgan will shed his boyish cloak of fantasy and, in doing so, seal his fate as an ordinary mortal like the rest of us, doomed to labor and grow old and die in the shadow of his shattered dreams.There is much that is surrealistic in this little novel although the portrayal of the time and place of the tale rings true enough, albeit as though seen through an oddly refracted psychological lense. The facts seem solid to, as Steinbeck describes many of the events of the time. But in the end, I found the dream-like quality of this tale less edifying than distracting and so, though it was an easy book to read, it did not completely win me.SWMauthor of The King of Vinland's Saga"},{"Title":"Cup Of Gold","review":"I love just about everything Steinbeck wrote. I rated it against his other novels, not just in general. Four stars because Grapes of Wrath, Cannery Row, etc are 5 stars... This is his only historical novel (I believe). It's an easy read and forshadows his common themes like disalutionment (sp?) or like the U2 song &quot;I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For.&quot; It reminded me a lot of his later novel, East of Eden, and the whole &quot;thou mayest&quot; theme. It's not a pirate/adventure story. Yes, Henry Morgan was a pirate, but if you're looking for &quot;ahoy matey, walk the plank,&quot; try &quot;Treasure Island&quot; or even &quot;Peter Pan.&quot; This book was very enjoyable to read."},{"Title":"Cup Of Gold","review":"\\"Cup of Gold\\" is described as being the tale of Sir Henry Morgan with occasional references to history. Being unfamiliar with pirate folklore, I am not certain what aspects of the book are fact. I am certain that this book is divergent from Steinbeck's usual path of storytelling. This is a play of the morals and the values of society as Steinbeck usually discusses. However, the story is set far away from Steinbeck's familiar California backdrop.When Henry Morgan leaves home to explore the Indies in search of riches, he leaves behind a loving family and his young love Elizabeth. After several interruptions including being sold into slavery, Henry has the opportunity to reach for success. Using money he has earned, he leases a pirate ship to begin his conquests. Using his unorthodox methods, he expands his fleet to respectability. However, one thing still alludes him, love. He tries to gain love through friendship, but longs for the love of La Santa Roja. Henry conquers the ultimate prize in Panama with the explicit goal of finding La Santa Roja. However, Henry is devastated to find that this fiery woman is beyond his control. Realizing his failure, he abandons the pirate life and attempts to return to a life of legitimacy. Even through this path and his marriage to his cousin, he finds he still lacks love. On his deathbed he realizes the love his wife has for him, but his lack of love during his life makes him feel like a failure. In death, he realizes he never really had anything.\\"Cup of Gold\\" explores the ultimate conflict that exists between love and power. The lust for power is so insatiable that it can make one unable to be loved or to give love. While in the story it applies to a wealthy man, it is a reality for the common man as well. While using a pirate's life as a device to present this moral may seem to alienate some readers, I would suggest this book is on par with Steinbeck's other work. It is a masterpiece."},{"Title":"Cup Of Gold","review":"It is very interesting to see a great author evolve. In this book, we have the chance to see Steinbeck &quot;in the rough&quot;. This first published work of Steinbeck gives the reader the chance to see how a good author becomes a great author."},{"Title":"Cup Of Gold","review":"Cup of Gold is the first novel by John Steinbeck and shows it. The dialogue and description are mawkish and show the influences of Donn Byrne and James Cabell who Steinbeck admired in his youth.Steinbeck becomes more restrained in his prose later on and he wrote about hings he was better at writing about but Cup of Gold is worth reading it shows glimpses of his skill in the characterization and the way Steinbeck is efficient in moving his story and getting you involved"},{"Title":"Cup Of Gold","review":"Recently, I read a burst of six Steinbecks in seven weeks. I then decided to do things right and proper and read the rest of his works in chronological order. This, of course, meant starting with _The Cup of Gold_, a 1929 \`buccaneer' novel. The story loosely follows the historical career of the Welsh pirate Henry Morgan.To be blunt, unless you are some mission to read all of Steinbeck, this one can be skipped. The first half is basically a boy's adventure novel of the sort particularly popular at the time: violent yet innocent, dangerous but fun, with easy emotions and an absentminded but proud certainty in the superiority of Anglo-American men. In short, good clean fun.But from the perspective of an adult, this novel feels awfully slight. One reads it to find glimmers of the later of Steinbeck, but there isn't much. The pacing feels off (or rather simplistic). The characters are generally one-dimensional; the dialogue, trite. The thing tastes like flat Coke. Those inspired moments are rare: a sentence here and there. The longest \`nice touch' is a third of a page in which a woman frets that the new nervous curate is too young to provide enough gravity for the baptism of her son, whom she is certain is destined for greatness.The second half of the novel feels very different. It jumps forward abruptly ten years and has Morgan in what amounts to a midlife crisis that he attempts to address by winning the love of a reputed beauty who may not even exist. (She supposedly lives in Spanish Panama, the \`cup of gold' in the title.) What happens when Morgan is on the verge of getting what he thought he wanted undoubtedly baffled contemporary readers. The tone goes from the Hardy Boys to an intense -- but ultimately half-baked -- psychological realism that is in part dependent upon what feminists now call a \`rape myth' [cringe]. There's a kind of daring to what Steinbeck attempted, but it doesn't really work. Morgan's desires are unclear (even to himself); the novel repeatedly jumps past what seem like the most interesting events. If there's any pleasure in it today, it's like that of listening to a symphony warm-up: anticipation of what's to come next, for this curious book was published little more than half a dozen years before Steinbeck became one of the most brightly shining American literary flames.One cool gesture in all of this: the book begins and ends with references to Merlin and Steinbeck's final published piece was his unfinished updating of Malory's legends of King Arthur, meaning the Steinbeck's career nicely started where it ended."},{"Title":"Cup Of Gold","review":"I thought this book was verry exciting towards the middle/end. I'm not a reader who can stand reading slow parts describing how people loved each other back in the 1800's. But what this book did is is also put action in it. So while he kept saying he loved this girl, he also had to make a decision to put her in jail or not. So overall i give it and 8 out of 10. It would have been better but the beggining is alittle slow. But all books are like that."},{"Title":"Cup Of Gold","review":"Another reader-reviewer refers to Cup of Gold as &quot;Steinbeck in the rough&quot;. That's accurate. I love Steinbeck's humor-as developed in later novels-here if falls flat on its face, and there is nothing else about it to recommend. There is none of the marvelous psychological/philosophical insight of later Steinbeck. The characters are uninteresting, the plot is without intrigue or interest. The best I can say about Cup of Gold, is it is at least free of the immature political ideology of some Steinbeck novels (the lesser ones in my view). However, I take cheer from Cup of Gold, and recommend it to all of my friends who are struggling with first novels. If Cup of Gold could be published, and the author went one to become one of the greatest writers ever-then there is hope for those of use who are struggling with first novels."},{"Title":"The Origin of Social Dysfunction: The Pathology of Cultural Delusion","review":"&quot;R.S.

I was lucky enough to meet both author and subject at a book signing and one of the first points Jonathan brought attention to was that if Uri had managed to fool the world for over two decades he was a more successful man than if he was just using psychic powers that he had been given, either way he is a very special guy. Jonathan takes us through his experiences and does a couple of year's worth of research. He compiles it methodically and without prejudiceAs with Jonathan, I am not utterly convinced by Uri Geller, but I personally have psychic experiences to a small degree and, the evidence offered is very, very compelling, and even if ultimately I'm not totally swayed, it pushed me further in the believing direction on many levels .The book is such a fantastic read and it tells of more than the powers that Uri possesses but also completes the picture giving some insight of his amazing character and enthusiastic nature and how he has achieved his wealth, how he started out, how he likes to spend his time. It flows beautifully along through his life to present day examining with the help of mountains of expert opinions of the various angles to controversial happenings, drawing a logical conclusion from a score of different sources. Uri Geller does not make any efforts to influence the outcome or rubbish the other side, but this but could give credence to his knowledge of the truth of his abilities. I think he is at a stage in his life when he has stopped bothering to try and prove his abilities, which he as done many times over the years under libratory conditions. From what I have read of Uri he as matured into the man who knows him self and he spends his time using his powers to heal and encourage others rather than try to prove to skeptics what he knows about himself I had one of the most entertaining and interesting evenings of my life at the Uri Geller book promotion in the UK December 1998. Things started with Jonathan Margolis who is a journalist for the London Evening Standard and the Guardian and had written Uri's biography and the subject of the book promotion called &quot;Uri Geller Magician or Mystic?\\" Jonathan basically told us that he had not been particularly interested in Uri, in fact quite the opposite as he was a quite skeptical by nature and did not see the good of spoon bending? It was his son that had brought the subject up of the paranormal expressing a particular interest in Uri, much to the surprise and annoyance of Jonathan as his son David was only 14 at the time in 1996. The subject had escalated between father and son to the point of a challenge been issued from Jonathans son to his father to prove that Uri Geller was a fake. This got the journalist out in Jonathan who set out to damn Uri to his son. At the this time Jonathan was researching a story for the Sunday Times and his son accompanied him to meeting with a millionaire scientist called John Knopp (seemingly a genius at observational physics who sadly died a year later) who was researching a possible electrical cure for cancer, who as chance would have it he actually brought the subject of Uri Geller again with David, expressing the fact that he thought they had physical similarities. It turned out that the scientist was a friend of Uri's, and basically to make the story short he arranged for David to speak to Uri on the phone that lead to Uri offering the whole family around for tea at his mansion. After a rather impressive display of Uri's abilities that day Jonathan became interested in Uri as a subject, and asked if he could write a serious objective biography, hence the book. One statement Jonathan said that I thought was very accurate was that if Uri is a fake, and has fooled the world and its experts for over two decades, he is more successful than if he is just using genuine talents! Then Uri with an audience of maybe 500 people a sell out, signed books and drew a personal picture for any person that wanted one, regardless of you actually buying a book that evening at the book store, e.g. you could just produce your own paper if you wanted ly enjoyed the highly entertaining speech and mini biography, it was one of the most entertaining evenings I can remember and all for the price of 1.50, which no doubt only paid for the premises that evening. My personal impression of Uri was of a very sincere and nice person, and although I am not a total believer I am very intrigued and interested with an open mind and I tend to believe Uri has a talent, maybe he is not sure how he does it?"},{"Title":"Uri Geller: Magician or Mystic?","review":"If anything this book is more strangely beautiful and provocative than Margolis' other books. It is truly another world foreign enough to make us suspend judgement, and Margolis' achievement is that he makes it tangible for us.

It points out that reality is always a bit, or a lot, beyond our attempts to pin it down. Both the hard-core Skeptics and the True Believers should be baffled by this man. Geller is a trickster for sure, but I don't know if that makes him a fake. That's the beauty of this very readable, almost compulsively page-turning book- it pulls the rug out from our tendency to nail down reality with our beliefs- and I think it has the ability to make the hopelessly rational become a bit more open minded, and the hopelessly magical become a bit more skeptical. A tall order, but this book, like Uri Geller, surfs borders."},{"Title":"Uri Geller: Magician or Mystic?","review":"I have the great pleasure of reading this Incredible book about Uri Geller. This is excellent book full of mysteries, adventure and power. There is also some insight into Uri's feelings and how his journey related back to his paranormal experiences in the future; these are interesting and enlightening. Overall, a delightful book; a rich combination of normal and paranormal. Well worth a read."},{"Title":"Uri Geller: Magician or Mystic?","review":"After reading a few chapters of this book, I can see now why Geller recommends it so much. It is so balanced and goes over a lot of what both skeptics and believers say and answers a lot of questions that people have about him. It is even better than I expected! Let me list the reasons why this is a very good book that I would recommend.1. First of all, like I said, it presents a balanced objective journalistic view of Geller and presents all the arguments for and against Geller that have been presented in the last 3 decades. Interviews with believers and critics are presented in the book. In fact, about 75 interviews were conducted as part of his research.2. It is written by a journalist and skeptic who in the past has written articles debunking various paranormal phenomenon including psychics and hauntings. Jonathan Margolis makes it clear to us at the beginning of the book that he is not a paranormalist pretending to be a skeptic by citing articles and investigations he did where he debunked UFO's, fortune tellers, and hauntings. Skeptics, wouldn't you say that a proven skeptic, demonstrated by his past debunking articles, who concludes that there is a good possibility that Geller may have paranormal powers, is a much more remarkable testimony than from someone who is already a paranormalist believer?3. It goes over what Randi says about Geller and even includes an interview with James Randi. It also discusses what happened on the Tonight Show with Johnny Carson back in 1973 and points out something that you guys probably didn't know. When Geller failed the tests on the Carson show, (and Randi never bothered to mention this) there was one incident that was worth noting, which is described on page 262 of the book (UK version). Ricardo Montalban (the guy from the series &quot;Fantasy Island&quot; and who played Khan in Star Trek 2) who was sitting next to Geller on the show, says that the spoon in his hand (Ricardo's) did bend ON ITS OWN while Geller was trying to bend the spoons on the table.In addition, the book also points out that the same controls that Johnny Carson used on Geller that evening were also used on Geller at the SRI tests, but Geller succeeded there and was able to do his feats despite being under the SAME controls.Anyway, there are a lot of other interesting things in the book that you Skeptics probably don't know. I would love to share a lot more things I discovered in this book, but there are too many and it would take way too long. Therefore, I would recommend reading this book yourselves.The book is a real eye opener. It just might make some of you guys rethink your position. A couple of other readers on the amazon.com book review said they started out as hardened skeptics but changed their mind after reading this book. And remember, this book was written by a Skeptic who has debunked paranormal phenomenon in the past, too!Oh and one final thing. The book also lists some magicians who STILL believe in Geller as of 1998. So the skeptics were wrong when they said that pretty much all magicians who believed in Geller have changed their minds. For example, magicians like David Blaine, who is a celebrity magician and a close friend of Leonardo DiCaprio, still believes in Geller and says that Geller was always his childhood idol.Anyway, that's all I'll say for now. The author of this book doesn't conclude that Geller is a proven psychic, but merely states that based on his years of investigation and exhaustive interviews, Geller is not the fraud that people like Randi made him out to be, and that there is a good possibility that Geller may have paranormal powers after all.Thanks, Winston"},{"Title":"Uri Geller: Magician or Mystic?","review":"Uri's piercing thoughts and eyes can bend metal, move objects and sprout seeds. Jonathan Margolis's new biography Uri Geller: Magician or Mystic? explores these mysteries. Did you know Andrija Puharich discovered Uri in Israel and brought him over to the United States? He claimed that Uri had encounters with aliens. Believe it or not Uri himself claimed to had a strange experience with aliens at 4 or 5 years of age that changed his life. What makes David Blaine levitate outside? It can not be magnets. Can it be an alien force that he has tapped into? John Lennon also claimed to have encounters with aliens. What we are not alone? Margolis spent two years of intense research weighing the pros and cons of Uri Geller's past and present. He interviewed 75 people including friends and skeptics. This book has marvelous pictures and is so fascinating that you will want to share it with your friends and neighbors over a cup of tea. A must read for people that are inquisitive about the life and future dreams of Uri, one of the most controversial men of our times.

Buy this extraordinary book, it will certainly astonish and amaze you."},{"Title":"Uri Geller: Magician or Mystic?","review":"Our family and I has enjoyed this book. I am Interested in learning more about Jonathan Margolis. He seems to understand Geller's phenomenal powers and has fun way of Inviting the reader to share amazing biography. I reall feel much more aware and knowledgable about paranormal. Eye opener."},{"Title":"Uri Geller: Magician or Mystic?","review":"It is sad that so many people say &quot;It's great! buy it!&quot; without actually saying WHY! I am weary of this work because I have been interested in this subject for a while. It is written fluently and it is interesting, but...[i]t is clear to me that Margolis is not the converted sceptic he claims to be. Sceptics who have dealt in Parapsychology for a lot longer than Margolis are either ignored or dealt with in a disparaging, patronising tone. Of course Sceptical authors also fall in to this trap too, but eventually it is logical evidence that must tell, and Uri Geller fanatics can offer little. I would love Margolis to contact me and explain why Gellers countless failed soccer predictions (English soccer fans find him hilarious) his failure on a certain TV show, his promises to stop Big Ben (ridiculous? Of course. So why did he say it?) and his superb episode with the Brazilian cash ( ask someone) have been ignored or glossed over while his supposed achievements receive so much hype. As I have said before, I have nothing against strongly sceptical or pro arguments as long as the author is honest about his views. Margolis claims to be a converted sceptic. You will note that before we reach halfway in the book, Margolis mentions &quot;a strong liking&quot; of Uri. He also mentions that he went for a morning walk with him every day for so many months! Yet sceptics like Randi and Hutchinson get one visit each! The work of a converted sceptic? That is why I resent this work."},{"Title":"Uri Geller: Magician or Mystic?","review":"A really enjoyable read from a brilliant author. A must for every one interested in the facts and history of the famous &quot;Mind Bender&quot;. Very entertaining reading."},{"Title":"Uri Geller: Magician or Mystic?","review":"Margolis' book is just the latest example of the decline in objectivity in journalism. Had he prepared himself by researching his subject before meeting Geller and being \\"dazzled\\" by claimed \\"mystical powers\\" (like, say, reading \\"The Truth About Uri Geller\\" by James Randi) he would have found that every illusion that Geller performs has been used by magicians for years. The only difference between Geller and a stage mentalist is that Geller claims supernatural powers -- putting him squarely in league with faith-healing televangalists and other charlatans.The JREF Foundation has offered Geller $1 million if he will subject his mystical gifts to scientific analysis. Geller has steadfastly refused -- as has every other psychic. When Geller was invited on to the Tonight Show, he failed every single attempt at a paranormal event. Every one! Why? Because James Randi was invited by Carson to ensure that none of the keys, cylinders, or spoons were tampered with prior to Gellers arrival on stage. Why didn't Margolis mention any of this in his book?"},{"Title":"Uri Geller: Magician or Mystic?","review":"What a refreshing biography!!! I have to say that it's been a long time since I read something this good. I couldn't put it down. For years I had waited for this book with anticipation. Mr Margolis book of Uri Geller's life is an extraordinary honest and fair biography of the greatest psychic of the last half-century. I would suggest you READ the book, and not just the coments what the other people say about it. Keep up the good work Jonathan.Robin Ofman"},{"Title":"Uri Geller: Magician or Mystic?","review":"Margolis did a splendid job investigating the life story of one of the most controversial figures of this century. Its a great read, full of new and exciting revelations, in my opinion if you are into reading biographies, you will love this one."},{"Title":"Uri Geller: Magician or Mystic?","review":"I am a physician on vacation in London from Montreal, Canada, and bought this book in a spirit of open-mindedness, although I have to admit, in reality, I dearly wanted to hate it and its subject, Mr Geller. Instead, I ended up losing two days of my trip, because it proved impossible to put down! Like the author, I am too nervous, conservative, whatever, to be utterly convinced by Geller, but as a scientist by training, the evidence offered is very, very compelling, and even if ultimately I'm not quite swayed, the book is such a fantastic, closely argued, yet un-putdownable work that, finding myself in a cool Internet cafe off Portobello Road, I just had to see what was being said about the book on Amazon. I'm delighted by most of the comments, as they accord with my view, reached in the isolation on a hotel room. All I can say is, buy this book! And especially if, like me, you regard youself as a skeptic. The only reason I've given it four stars, not five, is good old Canadian parsimony. It's worth five really."},{"Title":"Uri Geller: Magician or Mystic?","review":"Although the author states in the Introduction that this work will be &quot;partly investigative journalism&quot; and &quot;partly a biography&quot;, the majority of the narrative is pure hearsay, one-sided, pro-Geller. The lack of bibliographical references attests to that same point. But no matter, this man still makes a fascinating study. If he is for real, then he's one of the most curious insights into the powers of the human mind. If he's a phony, then he's one of the great magicians of our time. Either way, he's just plain interesting, and the reader is drawn to the next wierd story about Geller and his feats. For me, the bottom line was not so much &quot;Can he really do these things?&quot; but rather &quot;Why do people react so violently against the thought that he can?&quot;"},{"Title":"Uri Geller: Magician or Mystic?","review":"The dispute over the authenticity of Uri Geller is one over thirty years old. Everywhere he goes is a massive sell-out, he works closely with people like the Spice Girls and the England Coach (though these are today rather bad examples!) and whilst he was helping they met success. His opinions on all things paranormal are valued. A bent spoon will fetch hundreds of pounds at auction. His books are all best-sellers and he has been proven to have powers in scientific conditions. But he has been caught cheating, and magicians can duplicate nearly exactly what he does. We could say that the Spice Girls and England's coach were doing well anyway, and they like his team Reading all met a nasty end. People like the charismatic James Randi will have you believe he is a magician. I thought so myself. This book takes people like myself who are against Uri or indecisive and show all the facts. The writer Jonathan Margolis, a highly credible and competent biographer and excellent journalist, takes us through his experiences and does a couple of years worth of research. He compiles it methodically and without prejudice, which has helped me in my various presentations on the paranormal in two languages, and saves his conclusion for the end. No half-truths are in the book and ALL OPINIONS ARE VOICED EXHAUSTIVELY. Anybody who wonders on the issue of whether there is more than the planet we live on to be discovered will find this thought provoking and gripping, not to mention as informative as a study course at Oxford. The evidence presented could go towards a conclusion against Geller if not for the holes that have appeared over time, such as all the replicating magicians being found out, metal-bending being taught by hundreds of people and the millions of effects that Uri has created in peoples own homes and scientific laboratories. Geller has given consent to this conclusive volume, but has not influenced its content or conclusion as we can expect from two credible people as themselves, as did James Randi who is Uri's main thorn-in-the-side until he found the conclusion reached. This is well worth a look and ranks as the best book I have read in years."},{"Title":"Uri Geller: Magician or Mystic?","review":"Jonathan Margolis has once again amazed all critics with his sensationally professional work, this time having his subject as world renowned psychic Uri Geller. The subject is a controversial one, the biographer a difficult one to please, and the material needed for research would occupy a team of researchers for years. It is therefore obvious that this will be the conclusive article that decides whether Uri Geller is, as the title suggests, a magician or a mystic or whether there is a balance in between the two. It tells of more than the powers that Uri possesses. It also tells something of his amazing character and how he has achieved his wealth, how he started out, what it was like to be a subject rather than a person and how he likes to spend his time. It flows beautifully and is as rich as Bisto, drawing a logical conclusion from a score of different sources. It is surprising that Geller does not make any efforts to influence the outcome or rubbish the other side, but not surprising that CSICOPS try to get the credible journalist to say otherwise. The head of the organisation spent hours in the company of Jonathan Margolis, then rubbishes the book he fell in love with as soon as the 'ending' is made known to him. This comes widely recommended by many people, and I am no exception."},{"Title":"Uri Geller: Magician or Mystic?","review":"I read this book when it came out in the UK. This is Johnathan Margolis' greatest book. His treatment of the life of Uri Geller creates a feeling of almost intimate knowledge about one of the most controversial and interesting men of this century. The reader is additionaly treated to the story of how the author began with his assumption that Geller was just a magician and struggled during his research with the possiblity that Geller really could do scientifically unexplainable things, finally coming the the conclusion that what Geller does are not magic tricks. It was obviously not an easy journey. The book has all the ingredients to make it fascinating: intrigue, humor, pathos, controversy, and (most of all) an intimate look inside not just the life of Uri Geller, but his family and many of his friends and enemies. I could hardly put the book down to eat and sleep until I had finished it."},{"Title":"The year without a summer: A story of 1816","review":"I had heard of this weather anomily before and was always curious as to why and how it was to go through time period.

I am somewhat of a newcomer when it comes to Ms. Byrd's books, but this one kept me laughing. It's a wonderful story of love and getting over betrayal. But it's simply not a book by Ms. Byrd, if she didn't have some comedy mixed up in there. I have recommened this book to friends and they have all went to get it after reading my copy of it.

Just one more thing to add, I recommend all books by this author and Niobia Bryant!"},{"Title":"Measure of a Man (Arabesque)","review":"I think 'hate' is a very strong word for what I felt about this book, but it comes close. First of all, the description on the back of the book is very misleading. It isn't an E. Lynn Harris style, bisexual love triangle. That wasn't my real beef with the book, though. The ending is what truly made this book a terrible read for me. There's a lot of deceit and lies flying throughout this story, and by the end, the deceivers seem to be the ones placing all the blame on the deceived.There is very scant romance interspersed, and not a lot of steamy loves scenes to hang your hat on either. True, die-hard romance fans won't enjoy this book. Usually, Adrianne Byrd makes love stories come to life, but I must disagree with the other reviewers who liked this book and say it was a swing and a miss for Miss Byrd."},{"Title":"Measure of a Man (Arabesque)","review":"I thought it was very respectful how Byrd lightly touched on the homosexual world w/o being dramatic or over the top w/it.

Lincoln is a handsome and witty firefighter who is looking for new thrills in his personal and professional life. His coworker and friend Flex has a major crush on Lincoln, who is none-the-wiser about Flex's designs on him. Flex is recovering from a heartbreaking 10-year long romance and the opportunity to be with someone as fascinating and caring as Lincoln intrigues him - even though he's not sure Lincoln swings his way.When Lincoln meets Flex's sister Peyton completely independently of his acquaintance with Flex, the self-proclaimed ladies man Lincoln falls for her hook, line, and sinker. Peyton, who is gun shy of relationships due to past failures and abuses, is less sure that embarking on a journey with Lincoln is in her immediate future.The interesting departure from the normal \\"boy-meets-girl\\" routine comes when Flex is invited to a family gather both by the hopeful Flex and the quickly reconsidering Peyton. At times humorous, blatantly romantic and full of family drama thanks to Peyton and Flex's four other sisters, this book sucked me in for a thrilling ride from page 1!

Well, someone's done it for you.From self-development (learning about the arts, reading more, eating better) to improved relationships (making friends, dating) to personal introspection (challenging beliefs, understanging religion), this book offers simple yet insightful advice toward a more deliberate, purposeful...examined life.At $..., it's a great investment in yourself and makes a thoughtful gift to someone you care about! Everyone should have a copy. I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"The Examined Life: Thoughts and Advice for the Independently Minded","review":"This book is a well executed collection of the type of quotes and phrases that you ran across while reading in college which caused you to lift your head up and think late into the night. On one hand it is a good collection of classic ideas and on the other it is an assembly of all new ideas, most of which bring the classic into the present."},{"Title":"The Examined Life: Thoughts and Advice for the Independently Minded","review":"Even though, I have been living abroad for about a year, I still have those moments that are difficult. I call them the &quot;what the hell am I doing here moments&quot; don't get me wrong it isn't the place, it is living abroad away from loved ones and among cultural things that are very different from home.There have been two books that I consistently go to when I need to regather my thoughts... this one, and Alain De Botton's Consolations of Philosophy. I will need to order another Examined Life, as I just gave my copy to a friend in need."},{"Title":"The Examined Life: Thoughts and Advice for the Independently Minded","review":"This was an excellent and inspiring read!

Great gift ideas for friends."},{"Title":"The Examined Life: Thoughts and Advice for the Independently Minded","review":"I have been chanting \\"have a reward system not based on consumerism\\" and \\"write your own horoscope\\" to myself ever since reading this book. Dahr has a way of reaching every reader - his words will resound differently for everyone. Picking up this book will have you trying to examine and improve your life."},{"Title":"The Examined Life: Thoughts and Advice for the Independently Minded","review":"Mr. Dahr's brief, readable collection of his own thoughts and selected quotes from various well-known thinkers and artists provides sound advice and insightful observations. The Examined Life is not an instruction manual for those looking for easy answers; instead it helps get like-minded readers pointed in the right direction. A useful book both for readers who are already thinking while living and people who have yet to give self-awareness a try."},{"Title":"Early Buddhist Discourses","review":"One can't say enough good things about this first-class introduction to early Buddhist writings. The editor and translator John J. Holder has done an absolutely splendid job of selecting the most important writings of the early Buddhist canon and translating them into very clear, modern English.The book has the single best brief overview of Buddhism that I've ever encountered and each selection from the early discourses also carries a terrific introduction that explains the meaning of the discourse and its overall importance in Buddhist philosophy.This far and away bests the many other good introductions to Buddhist scriptures currently available (e.g. from Penguin, Oxford Classics, etc) and is a great bargain for the price.For many years now Hackett Publishing has lead the way in translations of Western philosophical classics and literature and they are now doing the same splendid job for the philosophies and literature of Asia.If you have any interest in Buddhism and it's primary texts this is the best place to start!"},{"Title":"Early Buddhist Discourses","review":"This book is very well written and highly recommended as an introduction to Buddhism for college students and fans of philosophy. You can also download questions that help you understand the basic ideas of each chapter from the publisher's website. The focus of this book is for a scholarly setup rather than that of a Buddhist practitioner but still it is a great book regardless. You can also purchase \\"In the Buddha's words\\" from Bikkhu Bodhi, \\"Sayings of the Buddha\\" from Rupert Gethin, \\"Dhammapada\\" from Gil Fronsdal or \\"Dhammapada\\" from the Oxford Classics as complements to this book."},{"Title":"Early Buddhist Discourses","review":"I like this book a lot. John Holder has chosen 16 suttas to translate, with short commentary at the beginning of each. This is a great book if you're new to Buddhism, just starting to read suttas, or if like me, you want a translator other than Bhikku Bodi.John does a great job of introducing each sutta, and then translating the sutta's themselves. The book is concise, and shares Buddha's most important teachings.I recommend this book for everyone, no matter what your experience is with Buddhism."},{"Title":"Early Buddhist Discourses","review":"These sixteen discourses from the Pali canon are a great introduction to Theravada Buddhism, one of the great creations of the human mind. The discourses cover basic Buddhist metaphysics, philosophy of mind, and ethics. I can't judge the accuracy of the translations from Pali, but the English is quite clear. Beginners looking to read primary Buddhist texts should start here. That said, I gave the book four stars instead of five because the editorial apparatus is a bit light. The editor, John Holder, introduces each discourse with a helpful summary of the key points, but many obscure or nuanced points within the texts are not explained."},{"Title":"Early Buddhist Discourses","review":"This is an extremely well-edited text. The introductions are lucid and penetrating. And the edior eliminated the painfully repetitive parts of the primary source texts, which is very much appreciated. One comes away with a better understanding of Buddhism than one could ever get from a secondary source like, say, Hagen's &#34;Buddhism Is not What You Think&#34; or even Penguin Classic's &#34;Buddhist Scriptures.&#34; This is one source I'm sure to consult many times."},{"Title":"Early Buddhist Discourses","review":"I bought the book for my son Quentin.

She called and said that it's really good. She will be using it for the Prayer ministry - they had just finished building a Prayer Tower called \\"Heaven's Portals\\" - so nice - it's overlooking the whole city of Metro Manila.

The four letter name and a Whole sentence name of God originate from the forgotten written formula. The \\"I am\\" then became an interpretation for theologies and religious beliefs that favor mysteries.

The Presence of God pervaded the atmosphere. Hundreds of people were deeply moved by the Presence of the Holy Spirit. I could do nothing other than fall to my knees and weep. I will never forget it.When I learned that the book was available, I could hardly wait to read it. I regularly walk through my home, reading the names of God. As I do, I am aware that He comes to fill the spaces of my daily life as personally and powerfully as He did that Saturday night in Chicago.I love to meditate on the names of God, because I am aware that as I do so, He is smiling and keeping a record of it. It is such a simple way to bring joy to the heart of my Heavenly Father. For me, it brings an immense awareness of His love, strength to my spirit, focus for my mind, and an increase of faith.The author has identified 365 names of God and suggests that the reader meditate on a different one each day. When I pick up the book and begin to read, I cannot stop with just one. I usually do not put the book down, until I have read them all.Five stars seem too few to rate how highly I esteem this author and I AM."},{"Title":"I AM: 365 Names of God Book","review":"The title is a bit of a misnomer. It's really a devotional on the names, attributes and characteristics of God. It's a great devotional help for people like me who are out of the house so early that we don't have time for a long devotion. The artwork and acrostics are breath-taking. It's lavished with a beautiful cover sleeve thus also making a great coffee-table book.And yet it's such a simple book. I simply ask the Lord for clarity, read the bible passage and the associated godly name/attribute/characteristic and soak it in for a bit, and then ask and hope-expect that God will manifest his name/attribute/characteristic in my life. I can't say that I walk around the house reciting the names, but reading let's say a month's worth of names (i.e. a chapter) can be quite awe-inpsiring.There's also a companion book called \\"Inheriting the Fullness of God's Names\\" which has some fine teaching on how self-revelating God's names are, and a companion cd available called \\"An Experience In Worship\\" on which JPJ recites the names of God from the book, backed by a powerful score led by Graham Ord. JPJ's been bashed around the web a bit. Just check reviews of his other books. He's like black licorice: those who don't like him, don't like him a lot. But this is all good edifying stuff, albeit a bit pricey."},{"Title":"I AM: 365 Names of God Book","review":"I don't know why or how but when I read out loud any 5-10 names of God, I feel God's presence. May be it was just me I thought. So I let my friend borrow it and told him to read it out loud during his devotion and he felt the presence of God as well.It is a simple book, on one page it has a name of God such as &quot;I am the friend of sinners&quot; and one bible quote to back up the name, yet so powerful. I must be invoking something spiritual when I verbalize the names of God. I don't get it, but who cares, I simply delight in the presence of God."},{"Title":"I AM: 365 Names of God Book","review":"The quality of this book is just fantastic. But more importantly, what's inside is even better, because it's filled with Scriptures that focus on God's attributes. When you go through this book and take time to really think about the characteristics of each of God's names, you start to realize just how awesome He is. Great book to help deepen your understanding of God and enrich your walk with Him."},{"Title":"I AM: 365 Names of God Book","review":"There is power in the name of God. As you meditate on the names of God you will draw closer to Him. Certain names of God will stir you, touch you and even move you to tears or give you goosebumps! When you hear His name the Holy Spirit within you responds. You'll receive wisdom, understanding and insight. You will be given creative ideas and solutions to issues in your life. The music on the Cd is soul stirring and is like a healing balm. I listen to it or at least have it on in the background every day. At the name of God you are healed, moved and blessed. At the name of God, demons run. I would also recommend playing the CD while you are out; when you return you'll enter into a home where peace and the manifest presence and power God dwells!"},{"Title":"I AM: 365 Names of God Book","review":"What a unique worship experience this is! If you love the names of God, you will love this. This worship CD features a narrator (John Paul Jackson) declaring names and characteristics of God based on Biblical truths and events. The narration is a deep, reassuring voice paced to a background of steady percussion which at times sounds like a heartbeat. Sets of attributes are divided into categories such as \\"God, the Rewarder\\" and \\"God, the Ancient One.\\" Each proclamation is preceded by the words \\"I AM.\\" Different sounds chime in occasionally, such as the sound of the shofar, to enhance one of the proclamations about God. I recommend this for meditation on God, for a deepening worship experience, and for worship in dance. This CD will take you deeper into the spiritual realm."},{"Title":"I AM: 365 Names of God Book","review":"This is an important, anointed worship weapon for every believer!!

These examples are not to be used as \\"cut &amp; paste\\" into your own application, but designed to turn theory into reality easy to grasp! The last part consists of standalone chapters covering essential subjects related to database theory and design, like: Normalization, SQL, Queries and Codd's RulesYou will not find another computer book on Access and relational database theory and design, or any other subject for that matter, which makes use of such clear language. I have read the book cover to cover several times, and I am still impressed. Which makes me ask if we, the readers and buyers of computer books, quietly and wrongly accept badly written books filled with errors and poor language?If I were asked to make a list of suggested readings for Access and database developers, this would be No. 1."},{"Title":"Inside Relational Databases","review":"I have had countless hours of training in several versions of Access. It was never the using of Access that I had a problem with. What always mystified me was the design of the actual database. I would sit and ponder whether I needed one table, multiple tables, what should be the primary key, which relationships to use, etc. As a result, I never really was comfortable with or deeply into using Access. All of this has changed with this book. This book is written in a simple straightforward manner that explains all of these details. They carefully and not too slowly show you how to properly design your databases. Their examples are primarily in Access (97 &amp; 2000 formats). Access 2000 is used for all of the screenshots. You learn by reading their instruction and then opening Access to view the related sample database located on the accompanying CDROM. This book is only 345 pages long. It is NOT the gigantic volume of so many books. As a result it is something you can get thru in managable bites and not feel overwhelmed. This book was really written for beginners. I don't think it would hurt an intermediate person to read it, but I think advanced developers can probably skip it. Having said all this, I wholeheartedly recommend this book. It is one of those rare books that had a (good) career-impacting effect on me. I hope it is as helpful for you!"},{"Title":"Inside Relational Databases","review":"After searching through dozens of books about databases, I found Mr. Whitehorn's elegant, witty and kind book. As a new database student, changing careers midlife, I was struggling for days to understand concepts that Mr. Whitehorn cleared up in a hour's enjoyable read. (He's the kind of writer who could write about paperclips for 200 pages and hold the reader's attention.) His PhD put firmly aside, he demystifies the relational database with humor (the book is peppered with occasional asides telling one how to bluff and impress database purists), clarity and common sense. Back in school for a midlife career change, this book kept me firmly planted in my program when I was teetering on the edge of dropping out. SELECT GreatBook FROM Amazon WHERE Whitehead = Author"},{"Title":"Inside Relational Databases","review":"This book is excellent! At the time I read this book I had been working with Access, Sybase, &amp; Oracle for 7 years. However all of my database knowledge was product-oriented and I did not have a really firm grasp of general database concepts and principles: primary &amp; foreign keys, tables, joins, and other basic concepts were never explained thoroughly. Sure you can read about these concepts in the documentation for whatever database product you're using, but everyone glosses over these important basic concepts and assumes that &quot;someone else covered it&quot;, when in fact no one has. This book changes all that. Although it is written for beginners, I suspect that even intermediate administrators and developers will get a lot out of this book; it's the kind of book where just when you think you already know the material, you come upon some nugget of information that clears up a concept you'd always had trouble understanding. That's what makes this book valuable. The fact that the author is british doesn't surprise me; I've noticed lately that when it comes to technical writing, English authors do an excellent job of covering the basics before going on to the more technical material, whereas American authors tend to focus more on writing books and articles that are product-specific. Now that Mark Whitehorn has covered the basics in this book, I hope he will consider writing an Oracle book."},{"Title":"Inside Relational Databases","review":"Could someone who has read this book please write a review and indicate whether or not the new edition uses all examples in Microsoft Access (as the old edition did) or not? Thanks.Yeah, all of the original examples from the first edition are still based on Access - the sample files are provided in Access 7 and Access 200 format. What has been added to the second edition of the book is a section that covers topics like triggers, transaction logs, ER modelling etc. Those are more relevant to client-server database engines like SQL Server, DB2 and Oracle and to tools like Visio and ErWin; so the new section uses some screen shots from those tools.If you are an Access user this book is still as appropriate to you as the first edition was. And, if you use one of the more complex database engines, the second edition has just become even better than it was because there is information about the addition features that those tools use."},{"Title":"Inside Relational Databases","review":"If you want to learn the essentials of relational database theory, this is the book. The authors did a superb job of explaining the concepts and avoiding jargon that muddles up clear understanding, especially for beginners. I admit that I flinched at the price tag for a small paperback book, but I read other reader's praise of the book and I am extremely happy that I purchased and digested the material. I read it an hour or two every day for 2 weeks. Believe it or not it bordered on being &quot;light fun reading&quot;. Don't know too many useful computer books that I would describe as such. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED !!!!"},{"Title":"Inside Relational Databases","review":"Thankyou, thankyou, thankyou, thankyou Mr Whitehorn. I had developed a very saleable piece of database software. After reading your book I looked at my program and cried with laughter. BIG tables full of unrelated data, covoluted queries to unleash even the simplest of reports, you name it I had done it wrong. I re-wrote the program in a tenth of the time it took me first time around and now I can make it do anything. Don't EVEN THINK about writing a database until you have read this book. You have been warned.Thankyou once againMike Herberts."},{"Title":"Inside Relational Databases","review":"This is probably the only computer book that I have read that has been worth the money. The writing style is concise, clear, and to the point. Unlike most programming books that are filled with jargon, Whitehorn &amp; Marklyn refrain from blatant attempts to impress the reader with &quot;computer speak&quot;. Instead, they intelligently explain the history and benefits of relational database design. I have been creating databases for 2 years and I found this book to be a great resource."},{"Title":"Inside Relational Databases","review":"This very readable book is meant as a companion to Access but is useful as a reference when working with any relational database. It provides a brief 252-page statement of the principles of Codd's relational model, including normalization, keys, relationships, referential integrity, and SQL. It has many fine examples, which are also included on a CD.Without close attention to relational rules, most new database architects will find implementation and maintenance problems down the road, since Access itself can be used to easily create tables that do not follow the relational model. The common Access how-to books often only briefly discuss the grammar of the relational model.One author teaches relational theory; the other is a former Microsoft top gun for the development of Access.This book is indispensable for the new database architect and a useful quick review for the more experienced. I handed out two copies to staff programmers and kept one for my own desk."},{"Title":"Inside Relational Databases","review":"Although this book is about relational databases in general, and not specifically a Microsoft Access book, it will teach you (using examples in Access), in plain English, HOW a relational database works. After initially trying to learn Access (and getting confused by the concepts), I stopped my studies in order to read this book. It made all the difference in the world. When I returned to my studies, I made tremendous progress. You must read this book if you are even thinking of creating a relational database. Finally, it is a very easy (and fun) to read book. The author's sense of humor keeps things light and lively (but this is no lightweight book; you will learn very important and useful concepts)."},{"Title":"Inside Relational Databases","review":"This book was a disappointment. Based on other reviews, I thought it would be the happy middle between a &quot;nuts-and-bolts&quot; type of book and a textbook with a lot of theoretical discussion. This book was neither, and weak in almost all respects.The book read somewhat like an undergraduate term paper, with overuse of &quot;witty&quot; commentary. Based on the large font size, large figures, lots of white space, and way too much extraneous commentary, this book is really much &quot;thinner&quot; than its 300+ pages suggest - not a good value.In short, there is not much meat here. I would advise looking elsewhere - compromises are often bad choices."},{"Title":"Inside Relational Databases","review":"Could someone who has read this book please write a review and indicate whether or not the new edition uses all examples in Microsoft Access (as the old edition did) or not?

I should have picked up \\"Grover Park George ON ACCESS\\" and avoided this one.However, even if I only had only wanted to learn the basics of relational databases, I should not have bought this book. It has about 25% of the substance that I would expect from a book of its length. The author explains every little thing over and over, and explains why he's explaining things, then provides more examples than necessary. To me, this book was an unfortunate waste of time."},{"Title":"Inside Relational Databases","review":"This is for beginners and has little substancebeyond the obvious.

If you have been working with Access and you're not comfortable with the design of your database then this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Inside Relational Databases","review":"This is one of the best books I've read to get someone started in the world of relational databases. As a former software trainer, I've recommeded several database books to students. But I wish I had known about this one for my beginning students. Sure, there are the 800 page monsters out there, but if you want information that is straight to the point, well-written and user-friendly, this is the book to use.

With this in mind, I felt this book talks to a scientific mind, and yet in a very nice and enjoyable language. It is a joy to read in both senses, entertainment and subject mastering.Many books show you how to create a database. This book insists on making you properly UNDERSTAND what it's all about.Buy this book if you are REALLY serious about understanding Relational Database phylosophy and designing relational databases the right way.One thing about this book that made me feel bad, though. It's too cheap for what it's really worth."},{"Title":"Inside Relational Databases","review":"The books seems expensisve for its size, but sometimes good things come in small packages. The book is great! Full of examples and practical information. It covers all the key stuff, relational theory, Codd's rules, normalization, and SQL.

One of the better technical books I purchased recently."},{"Title":"Inside Relational Databases","review":"Whew. This is an outstanding book. It is simple and straightforward and explains complex concepts in an accessible way.If you want an excellent overview of databases, this is the place to start.Some examples:The chapter on Integrity (Chapter 16) instantly and lucidly gets the point across. I was a convert after reading the first 4 paragraphs.The exceedingly-simple (\\"yet-so-few-others-do-it\\") chapter breakout of Tables, Forms, Queries and Reports. Each chapter is its own \\"little-world\\" untouched with non-related ideas. The authors tie them together later. Extremely well executed.Excellent and I mean *excellent* typography and layout.

It's amazing. Here is the story.Xibalba, is hell.It is torture for men like Cayetano Rodriguez, Chema Ortegon, Bob Calver and Max Gorzten, who arrive from all over the world to pursue their objectives, to purge their sins, or to atone their guiltiness.In Xibalba, also arrive women like Baroness Olga Scheuermann, Max's wife, to rouse men's concupiscence; or like Rosenda, whose sensuality provides the bait to lure those guilty of unpunished crimes.Xibalba is the remote tropical forest. The gum trees that render the much-coveted resin grow overtly in the jungle, out reach from the claws that seek to strip them from their precious sap. However, man, ruthless as he is, finds a way to pilfer it out of the jungle by airplane. Despite the risks they confront, Cayetano, Chema, Bob and Max, fly daily in their old battered airplanes tons of the sought-after resin while, also continually, they seek sexual favor from Olga who, yearning to be taken away from Xibalba, seduces then and makes them confront each other to the point of murder. In the process, her insatiable lasciviousness surrenders and abuses even Rosenda's simple core.Kindness, friendship, courage and dignity, are overpowered by the passions unleashed within these men's essence, compelling them to lapse into a collective frenzy that lodges them to the roots of the jungle, until the demons that dwell Xibalba reap their souls from their bodies, setting them free once their penance time is up."},{"Title":"Wrath of the Gods-xibalba","review":"\\"This is a wonderful and powerful tale of the Ancient Gods of Mexico.

Its five hundred pages are spent not so much in depth of developing this thesis, but in breadth of applying it to a variety of topics.Starting from Kantian and Hickian questions of how to locate the question of warrant with respect to truth, or whether there is a question, Plantinga goes on to tackle, in due course, considerations of justification, deontology, rationality, and such. Following that is a tour of classical Christian conceptions of faith, and discussions of how to locate Plantinga's notion of warrant within the concepts inherited from past thinkers such as Aquinas and Calvin. Finally, some common philosophical and other objections to Christian faith are addressed in light of the preceding.It is the breadth of the topics addressed that makes this book most useful, rather than its depth in argumentation, in which I found a certain amount of repetition in the kinds of defenses Plantinga offers to a variety of criticisms: something along the lines of \\"But why think *that*?\\" seemed to crop up most often. In this, as well as other of Plantinga's works, he seems to leave himself open to the charge (that I have in fact heard made) that he's making his job a bit too easy for himself.In particular, what Plantinga leaves out is an explanation of just how *Christian* belief, in particular, is warranted over and above other species of religious belief. What kept coming up in my mind is what I call \\"The Mormon Problem\\"--the fact that a subjectively-based defense essentially just like Plantinga's could be given by, say, Mormons, who typically appeal to purely subjective (viz. \\"a burning in my bosom\\") considerations in their epistemology. Plantinga does go on to say that a Christian who goes on to consider objections and find them unconvincing retains warrant, but what I'd like to know is just what such objection-meeting considerations have to do with warrant, specifically. Plantinga is consistently vague on what, if any, connection there is. Here's the problem more explicitly: isn't a Mormon who does not admit of the relevance of what might, without too much exaggeration, be called historical and archeological disproofs of The Book of Mormon to their religious epistemology still in qualitatively the same position as a Christian vis-a-vis their faith: \\"warranted *if* true\\"? It seems that without begging the question for or against one or the other, a warrant-based account per se doesn't tell us what's different from the two. In other words, I don't see how you can't admit of a certain degree of evidentialism into your religious epistemology without falling into this problem. And whatever intrinsic connection that has with warrant per se, if there is one, needs to be spelled out. That said, I think Plantinga's warrant-based account of faith is probably correct so far as it goes.Finally, I notice a very interesting connection between one of Plantinga's central themes here (if not *the* central theme): that the _de jure_ objection is not, in the end, distinct from the _de facto_ objection. When I hear the way that the crop of militant \\"New Atheists\\" like Richard Dawkins (well, he's not so new, just increasingly vociferous) and Sam Harris talk about religious belief, they seem to be coming to basically the same conclusion, in a way, albeit from the opposite direction, as it were. To be sure, these paragons of reason don't so much present arguments as inveigh, pontificate, and bloviate, so they don't state their position as such, but it seems as though they also are saying the same thing, except taking the _de facto_ question as primitive and assumed answered, and then naturally going on to answer the _de jure_ question in like fashion. This would certainly seem to explain their extreme intolerance. In fact, in not explicitly distinguishing between the two, one's dialectic, such as it is, can easily consist in whipping back and forth between the two in a very tight circle. Plantinga's distinction is thus a useful one that can be used to diagnose such argumentative problems in the midst of shrill voices and strongly-worded rhetoric."},{"Title":"Warranted Christian Belief","review":"\\"Teddy Roosevelt a century ago ... waded into a fight over violence in football and possibly saved the game--if not from extinction, then at least from relegation to second-tier status in the world of athletics. Consider the situation in 1905, when 18 people died on the gridiron. Back then, foes likened the game to gladiatorial combat in Roman amphitheaters and launched a crusade. Led by Harvard President Charles Eliot and joined by the Nation magazine and muckraking journalists, Progressive-era prohibitionists wanted to sack the increasingly popular sport. At one point, Harvard actually quit playing the game. So did Columbia, Northwestern, Stanford, the University of California and several smaller colleges. Following the 1897 death of Richard Von Gammon, a fullback at the University of Georgia, the Georgia state legislature voted to ban football. The governor vetoed the bill, but only after hearing from Gammon's mother, who urged him not to outlaw a sport that her son had loved. Without dictating solutions, Roosevelt urged the men to take a critical look at their sport. That winter, with a little additional nudging from the president, they formed the organization that would become the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). They also passed a series of rule changes, such as increasing the number of yards needed for a first down to 10 from five and creating a neutral zone at the line of scrimmage. But the most important was legalizing the forward pass. Up to that point, quarterbacks couldn't toss the ball downfield. It took a few years to perfect the new rules, but the forward pass changed the way the sport was played. Deaths and injuries subsided as football abandoned its rugby-like origins and became a distinctively American game (John Miller, WSJ). Thus Roosevelt helped save FB, and today, those who love philosophy can thank Alvin Plantinga for helping save philosophy.Plantinga almost single handedly brought philosophy from the brink of a sure demise through his ingenious discoveries and fresh insights; from Warrant to Refuting Naturalism, Plantinga has brought a new surge of interest in philosophy, both popular and academic.Herein Plantinga offers his last volume in his trilogy of Warrant. Plantinga scrutinizes numerous aspects of the role of warrant and JTB in one's affirmation of theism while he argues that Christian Theistic beliefs are warranted when shaped within the \\"properly function\\" of men's cognitive facilities. Thus Christians can and do arrive at properly warranted beliefs concerning God, Christ, and intelligibility.- Sundry assumed beliefs in our world are not irrational even if one lacks complete epistemic rights.- Christian Theism is not irrational- A critique of Naturalism- Warrant and proper functionThe prose is quite precise, but perhaps not accessible to the layman, so there is a bit of pedantry but this work is loaded with precision. I found that this book was quite a pleasure to study even though it is substantial and significant.After reading this volume, I hope that even men who remain unconvinced about their need for the Christian Theism will acknowledge that Plantinga clearly demonstrates that Christian Theism has been effectively and articulately defended against the highest level of opposing arguments aimed at it. Christianity is a Worldview that more than stands on its own intellectually, and Plantinga demonstrates and that its competitors in the world of philosophy have long since been overtaken; an excellent epistemic resource.Also see:Truth, Knowledge and the Reason for God: The Defense of the Rational Assurance of Christianity"},{"Title":"Warranted Christian Belief","review":"Alvin Plantinga, \\"America's leading orthodox Protestant philosopher of God\\", earns the aforementioned worthy title all over again with this formidable scholarly masterstroke. In Warranted Christian Belief, the author takes 21st century Christian apologetics from the rarified realm of the academic philosopher, and into the living room of the earnest layperson, effectively re-contextualizing the entire aegri somnia within the framework of a teleologically bifurcated weltanschauung. Specifically, he posits a virtual ad vitam aut culpam, if you will, using J.L. Mackie's loose definition of theodicy (as it applies to the popular axiomatic understanding of naturalism) to establish a starting point for subsequent Kantian deconstructions. While some have argued in this forum for an acknowledgment of certain \\"saltus in demonstrando\\" logical flaws in Plantinga's attempt to contextualize causation/induction without first completing his explication of Hume's posthumously published four principals of ontological depersonalization, I beg to differ. Not to put too fine a point on it, but in light of the recent dubious rise of the annus terribilis of the so-called \\"new atheism\\", Plantinga's application of the free will defense leveraged against the epistemological fulcrum of a Goldmanian bona officia, so to speak, elicits from the reader (as well it should) an \\"in statu nascendi\\" conception of the multifarious strains of modal logic necessary for the truly effective unfolding of a series of personal epistemic refutations that may prove potent against this rampant reductive (and, indeed, quasi-reductive) materialism.All this is not to suggest that Plantinga's work here is by any means \\"dry\\" or \\"ponderous\\". Alvin's touches of irony mixed with occasional bittersweet tragicomedy, especially when applied to the brief biographical touches, are a serendipitous treasure. For example, the anecdote about his father, Cornelius A. Plantinga, having suffered a near breakdown while trying to philosophically synergize Calvinism, Arminianism, and his own nascent Rastafarianism is at once side-splittingly funny and relentlessly bleak.Where the author succeeds most admirably is in his ad fundum exploration of the divergent strands of post-Hergenrotherian thought that have interpenetrated (some would say vivified) the reputedly inevitable flowering of ostensible neo-Bonaventurianism in both literary and academic strata, producing a long overdue per ardua ad alta around the thorny subject of reliabilist assertions regarding the origins of the belief paradigm that are at once seemingly contradictory while at the same time teeter on the edge of an ad hoc rectal prolapsy unprecedented in the realm of quasi-preterist neologistic Biblical scholarship. Yet this very same reductionist mechanism of belief/non-belief and warranted/unwarranted faith dichotomies ultimately emerges in the final chapter's summation as being indispensible to Alvin's startlingly original thesis. And therein is the stunning, incandescent triumph of this landmark work, this conceptually monolithic \\"a capite ad calcem\\", one might say, that will surely stand the test of time and survive the ubiquitous hammer-blows of misinformed cynicism and heretical post-modernism that, if past experience is any indication, we can confidently predict shall forever rain upon the mighty anvil of reasoned, intellectual Christian faith.I can say with confidence that no educated Christian will be able to complete this highly rewarding yet accessible work without being stimulated into a state of ardent theological arousal."},{"Title":"Warranted Christian Belief","review":"Plantinga goes right into the justification of everything and makes a great case for why Christian belief is Warranted.It basically comes down to this, there is no empirical or scientific evidence that states evidence must be scientific or empirical.His refutation towards Christian criticisms are stellar, and I enjoyed every part of this book. Alvin Plantinga is arguably the best Christian philosopher right now, and this book definitely helps his cause!!!!"},{"Title":"Warranted Christian Belief","review":"This can be a very difficult book to read; used as a text book.

If you have the same confidence in your belief in God as you do in your sense-perceptions and memmories, then you will agree with what Plantinga says. But if you are like the other 99.99999% of humanity, you will find his arguments strange and unconvincing."},{"Title":"Warranted Christian Belief","review":"I gave this book one star. I think it is all but mandatory to read it (that would suggest five), but not for the purpose of agreeing with it. I would rate its salvational value as negative three. That gives an average of one star, below which is out of Amazon's range.To the good, Plantinga discusses the relation between warranted belief and true belief, which would tend to go together. Unwarranted and false beliefs are likewise a natural pair. However, the opposite pairings are also possible. The best of current evidence might suggest that a belief is true, in which case it would be warranted, even if later evidence ran otherwise and it were actually false. Similarly, one might hold a true belief by blind luck, say, in which case it would not be warranted.In toto, the book is an argument that Christian belief is warranted, even though it might not be easily proven. The overall effect is to give Christians an *out* when their apologetics are unconvincing to others.Long story short, I don't buy this. One might be wowed (or just buffaloed) by all the conditional probability notation. But just as pure logic cannot prove even the existence of giraffes, it is also the wrong tool for trying to prove God. Probability theory fares no better. Indeed, religious belief in general is replete with internal discrepancies, contradictions of observable reality, and primitive--even obnoxious--moralities. Matching behavior, too. In short, it is unbefitting of any genuine Divinity, and hence almost surely false. And unwarranted.Inculcating defenseless children in superstition is a grave sin. Perpetuating adults in it is almost as bad. Hence the negative three salvational stars."},{"Title":"Warranted Christian Belief","review":"Plantinga's third book is an extension of his general account of warrant applied to Christian belief. It reads, in many places, like a retread of the earlier work. And one feels let down by how much work hasn't been done. Honestly, the book is a shallow substitute for heartening religious scholarship. There is nothing in Platinga's work here that is original, truly insightful, or spiritual. Rather, it reads like a manual for debating atheists. Even a philosopher in the Analytic tradition has to despair at the lack of substance, at the repetitive nature of the material, and at the almost trivial conclusion that Christian beliefs can and do have warrant. But we Christians should wonder whether warrant isn't found elsewhere -- in the mystical, the mysterious, and the patently non-logical. Then the atheist's threat can be seen as a debater's threat, to be set aside while the truly important work is done. That work is not even broached here . . ."},{"Title":"Warranted Christian Belief","review":"There are two different types of criticism commonly given against Christian belief - one type is what Alvin Plantinga calls the De facto objection, which says that Christian belief is false because the evidence has proven it so - the other type (that is becoming more and more popular) is the De jure objection (the subject of this book) which claims that Christian belief is irrational, intellectually unacceptable, or morally suspect - irrespective of whether it is true or false. The beginning of the book discusses the difference between the De facto and De jure objections, and like the whole book it is very clear and illuminating -- The exact opposite of what you will read in this review --Part 1 (Is there a question) begins by discussing (or searching for) some of Kants arguments concerning the impossibility of referring to anything beyond the world of experience -phenomena. Many others have taken up this 'argument' claiming that Kant proved that the language we use when speaking about the phenomenal world can not speak about the transcendent. Apparently, when the Christian speaks about God, ascribing properties to him -like infinite, ultimate- he is talking nonsense.Part 2 (what is the question) deals with what is meant by an objector when he says that Christian belief is irrational. After much consideration the most plausible answer is found in Marx &amp; Fraud -the same basic type of objection can be found in Nietzsche and Durkheim too.In Part 3 Plantinga further develops his model for warranted Christian Belief (even if you have never read the other two books in the series - or God and other minds - you'll still be able to understand). This part of the book is the main response to the masters of suspicion (M&amp;F), showing the futility of their objections. There is also a real good critique of naturalism found here (updated from warrant and proper function).The final part of the book deals with potential defeaters for Christian belief -- different kinds of scripture scholarship, postmodernism &amp; pluralism, suffering &amp; evil. This book is clear and intelligent (with humor mixed in) it's definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"Warranted Christian Belief","review":"Plantinga has devoted his scholarly life to answer the question whether the Christian faith can be justified, and this book is the fruit of forty years of excellent work. How can the Christian faith be justified? The usual answer is to give arguments for the truth of Christian convictions (from popular writers like Josh McDowell to first rate philosophers such as Richard Swinburne). Plantinga took a different route by asking: what is justification (or warrant for knowledge)? Why must Christians prove his convictions based on principles accepted by non-Christians? The first part of the book review and refute different theories about how Christian faith may be justified (e.g. evidentialism) or dismissed (e.g. Marx and Freud). The second part argues that experience of faith of an ordinary Christian is a perfect justification for the Christian faith, unless one can show that the Christian faith is likely to be false. The third part looks at reasons for arguing Christian faith is likely to be false (biblical criticism, pluralism, evil and suffering). Plantinga think that the truth of Christian faith cannot be demonstrated or proven, but he provides coherent and compelling reasons that faith is a sufficient justification for Christian belief. The arguments sometimes get very complicated, but Plantinga is exceptionally clear and precise and this work is more accesible to non-philosophers than his previous works."},{"Title":"Warranted Christian Belief","review":"In WCB, Plantinga repeatedly refers to Alston's PERCEIVING GOD as \\"magisterial.\\" Alston's book is indeed that. But Plantinga's own work in this volume is that and more.WCB is a philosophically sophisticated defense of even the simplest (and least sophisticated) faith. He challenges a very common objection to Christian belief: \\"I am not in a position to say whether Christian theism is true or false (who could know a thing like that?), but one thing I do know is that it is not warranted.\\" Plantinga argues, successfully, I think, that this position itself is without warrant. Why? For the simple fact that *if* Christian theism is true, then believers probably *are* warranted even in simple faith. A serious challenge to warrant must therefore include a serious challenge to the truth of the belief.Warrant is whatever, when added to true belief, yields knowledge. And Plantinga carries into the WCB discussion the results of the prior two volumes. A belief is warranted when it is the product of a belief-producing mechanism that is (a)functioning properly (b) truth-aimed, and (c) functioning in the epistemic environment for which it was designed to acquire truth.This account seems to do the best job of making sense of those sorts of basic beliefs that all of us hold without having inferred them from other beliefs. I remember that it rained yesterday. What is my evidence that this memory is reliable? From what more basic and certainly known belief may I infer this? Nothing, really. Indeed, it is logically possible that I was brought into existence by a malevolent cartesian deceiver only five seconds ago, equipped with merely *apparent* memories of yesterday's rain, a particularly happy childhood, and even of having actually typed the beginning of this review (this, too, came into existence partially finished and entrusted to me to complete it). Of course, if I am the victim of such a ploy, then my memory belief is *not* the result of a properly functioning, belief-producing mechanism, and I am not warranted.But I take it that I am warranted in remembering yesterday's rain. In fact, I am not at all on thin ice in saying that I *know* that it rained yesterday. Assuming that (a) it really did rain and (b) my recalling it now is due to the fact that I saw it (or was told about it by my truthful wife, or some other reliable way of knowing) then my memory belief is indeed warranted and counts as knowledge.Suppose that God *does* exist just as believers maintain and that, further, God's presence is experienced in some immediate way. Calvin spoke of a *sensus divinitatus*--a sense of the divine--that was a part of the original cognitive equipment of all humans (and which was damaged when we were collectively dropped on our heads in the Fall). Suppose that faith amounts to a sort of restoration of this faculty. I take in the summer night sky in the South Dakota Badlands and this occasions spontaneous thoughts about God's creative activity. Or I commit some shameful deed and am impressed with the thought that God disapproves of what I am doing. Are such beliefs warranted? According to Plantinga, they are warranted in precisely the way that my memory belief is warranted **IF** they are true.Beyond the notion of the *sensus divinitatus,* biblical Christians believe that the Holy Spirit bears a kind of internal witness, engendering love for God and bearing witness to the Scriptures that they are true.A critic may challenge all such beliefs by alleging that (a) they are held in the absence of anything that looks like evidence and (b) they are readily explained away on some social science explanation. The Freudian explanation of religious belief, for instance, is that it is natural but it is the result of a belief-producing mechanism that is not truth-aimed: wish-fulfillment. But the critic is in a position to know this *only* if he already knows either that God does not exist (which would certainly get in the way of his doing things like creating, disapproving, or bearing witness) or, at least, that God is not, in fact, making his presence known in these immediate ways.In short, the de jure objection that the belief is not warranted cannot be offered apart from the de facto objection that the belief is false. Such criticisms thus beg the question against the believer.In the film, Field of Dreams, Kevin Costner's character, Ray, built a baseball diamond in his cornfield, and ballplayers from the past, including Shoeless Joe Jackson, emerged out of the corn to play. Ray, his wife and their daughter could not only see the players, but carried on conversations with them. Ray's brother-in-law saw nothing and, further, was convinced that Ray and his family had either gone crazy or were pulling some sort of hoax.Suppose, with the plot, that the ballplayers *really were* there, and Ray believed that they were because he perceived them directly, say, through some additional and extraordinary faculty. Given the story and Plantinga's account, Ray is warranted in believing that he is talking to ballplayers. Indeed, he knows that he is. Can he *prove* to his brother-in-law, on the basis of whatever evidence is available to his brotherf-in-law's ordinary faculties? No. But how does this affect the question of whether his belief is warranted? Can I *prove* my memory belief to be true on the basis of some other faculty, such as perception or reason? Maybe not. But must I be able to do so in order to be warranted? Of course not.Why, then, should anyone suppose that Christian believers are warranted in their beliefs only if they are able to infer those beliefs from evidence that is available to ordinary faculties?Plantinga argues along such lines that Christian belief is warranted. Along the way, he takes up discussions of potential challenges to his account. The book opens with a discussion of a view that is prevalent at many divinity schools: that Kant established once and for all that human language cannot refer to God. Gordon Kaufmann offers a rehashed version of this, followed by a rehashed version of his rehashed version. Plantinga's interaction with Kaufmann's work is sheer delight. So is his discussion of John Hick's view of Religious Pluralism, which, as Keith Yandell once quipped, is \\"in danger of becoming canonical\\" in religious studies departments.The book concludes with several potential \\"defeaters\\" to Plantinga's model for warranted Christian belief. Some argue that the sheer fact of religious diversity strikes a blow. Others press various arguments from evil. Plantinga's discussion of Paul Draper's version is a gem (as is Draper's version itself, to be honest).He also takes on a version of the Great Pumpkin Objection, calling it \\"Son of Great Pumpkin.\\" The basic GPO is what may well have occurred to you as you reflected on Plantinga's model: *anyone* from *any* perspective can claim that her beliefs are warranted. Even Linus could claim that his belief in the Great Pumpkin is properly basic and warranted without appeal to evidence. You'll have to read Plantinga for yourself to decide whether this objection sticks.This is a rewarding read, very much worth the effort of 500+ pages. It is also highly entertaining, as Plantinga is a sprightly writer--even when in the midst of the most rigorous argument.I've only recently completed a careful reading of WCB and, as you can probably tell, am still in a sort of \\"honeymoon period\\" with the book. Plantinga has persuaded me--a former dyed-in-the-wool evidentialist--that his account of warrant is the correct one. If I think of any telling objections you'll be the first to know."},{"Title":"Warranted Christian Belief","review":"After a month of mulling over this book I'm still not sure if I've digested it enough to give it a sufficient review, but I'll give it a try. Alvin Plantinga is the most important and influential evangelical philosopher of the last half-century, and Warranted Christian Belief (hereafter WCB) will probably end up being seen as his most important work, especially when taken along with the two earlier works in his \\"Warrant\\" trilogy, \\"Warrant and Proper Function\\" and \\"Warrant: The Current Debate.\\" But WCB is important not because it is some sort of magnum opus of proof that Christian belief is true (these would fall under what Plantinga calls the \\"de facto question\\") but because it provides a defense of Christian belief as being rational, justified, and warranted (the \\"de jure question\\"). Plantinga goes to great pains to define these terms. What does it mean, for example, when someone says a belief is irrational? Here he is at his best, as he is essentially defining the terms of the debate. Plantinga is an epistemologist, and thus his primary task as a philosopher has been the study of knowledge: what it is and how we get it. The Warrant trilogy has dealt with the idea of what actually constitutes a justified belief. In other words, it has dealt with the question of under what conditions an individual has an epistemic right to hold a certain belief or belief system. Thus you will find no defenses of the empty tomb here, nor any complex argument for God's existence. These are answers to the de facto question, but not the de jure question.The main tenets of WCB are two: (1) the sort of claims that Christianity makes are candidates for real knowledge on the basis of the fact that they are no more irrational, or unjustified, or unwarranted than many other types of beliefs we hold, such as the reality of other minds and (2) if Christianity is true, then there is a way in which such beliefs could be warranted for an individual, even in the face of a lack of hard proof. Indeed, one of Plantinga's main goals is to show that Christian belief is warranted without such proofs. He goes about this task with humor and wit, and I think he largely succeeds. He also tackles the difficult corollary questions of whether finite beings can even have real knowledge of an infinite, personal God and whether or not higher biblical criticism and the existence of evil constitute defeaters for classical Christian theism.Although this book is aimed at an intellectual audience and is written in many areas using the tools of the analytic philosopher, there is something else here of great value for Christian believers: a proposal for how Christian beliefs are actually developed. This was a great help to me. I was powerfully converted to Christ at age 19, but since then I have struggled much with whether or not Christian belief (and the Bible, in particular) are true. According to evidence, I may be able to form a strong belief based on probability that, for example, the Easter tomb was really empty and the disciples really did believe that Jesus Christ had risen from the dead since they were willing to die for that belief. Then, based on that knowledge, I could come to a belief that it would then be probable that Jesus was who He said He was, the Son of God, and then by that knowledge to come to a belief that it would then be probable that the Christian doctrines of the Trinity, justification by faith, the exclusivity of salvation through Christ, the baptism of the Holy Spirit, etc. are all true. But all of this is based only on probability and not certainty, and Plantinga shows (using the probability calculus) that it wouldn't make much sense to form beliefs in this way since a probable belief based upon another probable belief based upon yet another probable belief (and ad infinitum...) does not constitute a belief system that, in the end, is very probable at all.Thus Christian belief, if true, is most likely formed in another way. This is not to say that evidentialism (the view that Christianity can be proven based on evidence) does not have value, because it certainly does. But we all know that those who adhere to classical Christianity never came to believe those tenets in this way. Plantinga posits something called the \\"A/C Model\\" for the way in which Christian belief is formed. \\"A\\" stands for Aquinas and \\"C\\" stands for Calvin. The model begins with the sensus divinitatis of Aquinas and Calvin, the idea that God built in a sort of spiritual sixth sense that alerts us to His presence and significance. The sensus divinitatis exerts itself when we see a sunset over the mountains, for example, or when we ponder the vastness of the cosmos. But according to the A/C model, the sensus divinitatis is only a beginning point, a starter, for Christian belief. The real work is done by the Holy Spirit, who affects the mind of the believer (overcoming the damaging effects of human sin on the mind), causing him or her to believe the great doctrines of the faith.Plantinga's point is that the classical Christian view does provide a way in which knowledge of God and the plan of salvation can be communicated to man, and it is not a way which necessarily involves proof or evidence.\\"But wait a minute,\\" says the critic, \\"what if I don't believe in the Holy Spirit or the sensus divinitatis? That wrecks the whole system, doesn't it?\\" If someone asks that question, then he does not understand what Plantinga is claiming. His claim is not that his model is some sort of proof of Christian theism, but that the de facto question can not be separated from the de jure question. In other words, you can't claim that you're agnostic to whether Christian belief is actually true but that you know it isn't rational, or justified, or warranted.Taken as it is, WCB is very effective. Plantinga is essentially providing the supreme negative apologetic for Christian belief - in other words, a defense of believing in Christianity against intellectual attack - instead of a positive apologetic that attempts to prove that Christianity is true."},{"Title":"Warranted Christian Belief","review":"_Warranted Christian Belief_ by analytic philosopher Alvin Plantinga is the third book in Plantinga's trilogy on warrant and is perhaps the most important. Plantinga (a theist, Calvinist, and member of the Reformed Church) is perhaps one of the most important analytic philosophers of religion today and is definitely one of the most important theistic philosophers. While this book is the third book in a trilogy, unlike the other books in the trilogy it is longer and more detailed in scope. Further, Plantinga notes that he tries to make the discussion in this book independent of that presented in the previous two books (_Warrant: The Current Debate_ and _Warrant and Proper Function_), but the book obviously follows in the sequence (and also may be considered a sequel to Plantinga's _God and Other Minds_). Thus, this book may be read independently. Plantinga makes the point that this is a work of both apologetics and philosophy, but it is also a work of philosophy of religion, and in particular Christian philosophy. Thus, it will include reference to Christian belief in the same way that a philosophy of physics book would include reference to physics.To begin with it is necessary for Plantinga to explain what he means by Christian belief. Plantinga maintains that Christian belief (or \\"mere Christian belief\\") includes two components: the theistic component (that God exists, is a person, and has certain attributes) and the Christian component (that human beings are mired in sin and require salvation, that this was attained through the suffering, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ, and that Christ is the Second Person of the Trinity). In this book, Plantinga will consider two types of objections to Christian belief - the de facto objections (that Christian belief is false) and the de jure objections (that Christian belief is unwarranted). The de jure objection, \\"I do not know whether Christian belief is true or not, but I do know that it is unwarranted given modern understandings, etc.\\", is a common one, but as Plantinga will show there are no de jure objections independent of the de facto objections.An objection that is commonly made to Christian belief is that there is no question at all (that is that the certain attributes of God make Christian belief impossible). This is the objection of Kant (that our concepts do not apply to God), in one interpretation of his thought. It is also the objection of other more modern theologians such as Kaufman and Hick. Plantinga begins by showing that the objection of Kant fails because of certain problems in the so-called antinomies that he presents. Plantinga then turns his attention to claims made by Gordon Kaufman and John Hick, showing the weakness of their claims (and the essential worthlessness of their \\"theologies\\"). The question is then concerned as to exactly what is the question of Christian belief. Here, Plantinga begins by considering \\"Justification and the Classical Picture\\". Plantinga explains classical foundationalism and evidentialism in the work of John Locke. Plantinga notes how Locke distinguished between opinion and reason and maintained that one should try to live by reason. This implies a deontological understanding; in which, we have a duty to conform our beliefs to reason. Among other things, it is also maintained that certain of our beliefs are \\"properly basic\\" and that every belief is either properly basic or derived from beliefs which are. However, the classical pictures runs into difficulties; in particular, it encounters the problem of self-reference, in that there is no easily apparent way for it to justify itself. Plantinga considers some variations on the classical picture (in particular, he notes that Christian belief may be justified in a properly basic manner). Plantinga next considers rationality, and he devotes a considerable amount of space to a discussion regarding William Alston, Christian Mystical Practice (CMP), and rationality (as seen in Alston's important book _Perceiving God_). Plantinga also considers the notion of warrant and the \\"complaints\\" of Freud and Marx (others such as Nietzsche are not considered because their \\"complaints\\" are regarded as falling into the same category and as being over-the-top and less than rational). The discussion of Freud revolves around the central idea that Christian belief involves the process of \\"wish-fulfillment\\". This discussion is particularly funny when the actual theories of Freud are presented (because Freud made some rather absurd claims regarding patricide, among others). The discussion of Marx revolves around the idea that Christian belief results from an unjust society (and is the \\"opiate of the people\\"). Plantinga shows how both of these ideas are problematic and how neither of them shows that Christian belief is without warrant. In the next section of this book, Plantinga considers the fact of warranted Christian belief. In particular, he presents what he calls the Aquinas/Calvin model (A/C model) which argues that Christian belief may be properly basic (and relies on a \\"sensus divinitatis\\"). Plantinga considers various ways in which knowledge of God may be possible, and his discussion here is heavily indebted to William Alston. Plantinga also notes the role of sin and natural knowledge of God (sin interferes with our knowledge of God). Plantinga also shows that the de jure question is not independent of the de facto question. Following this, Plantinga considers the cognitive consequences of sin. In particular, he shows that sin has noetic effects (in that it may cause the sensus divinitatis to malfunction). Plantinga also considers the case of sin and skepticism (this is the radical skepticism of a David Hume for example) and sin and naturalism. In the case of naturalism, Plantinga provides a powerful probabilistic argument showing that given naturalism and evolution it is unlikely that sense perception will be reliable. Plantinga also considers a rejoinder of this to the effect that the same applies to the theist (the \\"tu quoque\\" objection), but he shows that this is not the case provided Christian belief is assumed. In the next section, Plantinga extends the A/C model by showing how faith leads to cognitive renewal (and thus the proper functioning of the sensus divinitatis). Plantinga also emphasizes the role of Scripture in the attainment of faith. Plantinga presents a probabilistic argument for Christian belief (relying no the fact of Christ's resurrection), but ultimately rejects this argument, concluding that he does not know a good argument for Christian belief and that such things must be known through faith. Plantinga next considers the testimonial model as well as various objections presented to his model. In particular, Plantinga makes the point that Christian belief is not like a scientific hypothesis (which is the claim of many atheists including the late John Mackie). In the final section of this book, Plantinga considers the possibility of various defeaters for Christian belief (facts we know now which may make Christian belief unwarranted). Plantinga concludes that while none of these defeaters actually defeat Christian belief, that it is possible that such defeaters exist, though they are extremely unlikely. Plantinga considers such defeaters as those presented in modernistic Scripture scholarship (distinguishing between traditional biblical criticism and historical biblical criticism - which may be one of three types: Troelschian, Duhemian, or Spinozistic). Plantinga shows how all of these forms of historical criticism fail to provide a defeater because they disregard the sensus divinitatis. Platinga also considers arguments making use of postmodernism and pluralism. In particular, Plantinga finds that postmodernist claims about truth would provide a defeater for Christian belief if they were true, but that they are in fact self-refuting (Plantinga considers for example Rorty in this respect). Plantinga also shows how claims to epistemic arrogance are also found in pluralism and agnosticism, making the fact of a plurality of religions fail as a defeater for Christian belief. Finally, Plantinga considers the so-called problem of evil (or \\"problem of suffering\\"). Plantinga considers both the logical question (does evil contradict the existence of God) and evidential arguments, but he finds all of these to be problematic. The only argument that appears to carry any weight in this respect is a brute appeal to emotion. But, Plantinga shows how this may also be resolved within theism (bringing up in particular the trials of Job). Finally, Plantinga concludes that such objections to Christian belief do not provide defeaters and that there is good reason to believe that Christian belief has warrant. He ends by noting that Christian belief also appears to be true.This book is one of the most important works in modern analytic theistic philosophy. Plantinga's arguments are well-presented and logically rigorous. For those who claim that Christian belief is irrational or lacks warrant given our current knowledge, these arguments presented here are sure to challenge them."},{"Title":"Warranted Christian Belief","review":"This book is excellent. Plantinga systematically reviews current objections to the fundamental Christian faith providing a intense review of these possible defeaters. People such as Freud, Hick, Kaufmann (Gordon), and Kant are all discussed. This book provides an excellent defense of orthodox Christianity and the ability to still accept such beliefs in the 21st century. However, this book does not provide any offensive attacks which would strenghten Christianity, which left me somewhat disappointed. Nonetheless I am just being hyper-critical. This book is a must read for any serious Christian apologist or defender of the faith."},{"Title":"Warranted Christian Belief","review":"I've had this book for several years but never got around to reading it. There was always a commentary or a systematic theology or something that demanded my attention. But I got involved in reading this book while trying to minister to a young guy who was very much romanced by German romanticism (especially Schopenhauer). Plantinga's systematic dismantling of Kant and his followers' position on whether one can know God enabled me to meet his objections.After the first two chapters, the book became a very easy read - in fact, I didn't read much of anything else until it was finished. Analytic philosophy can be horribly dry, but Plantinga has a great sense of humor in this work. It's hilarious in places (see the 'son of Great Pumpkin' argument, his discussion of what the word 'fundamentalist' really means), but well-argued everywhere. I am no philosopher, but having read and understood Plantinga's work, I feel competent to at least present a cogent alternative to some of the most common objectives to the Christian faith. This book is a steal at $30."},{"Title":"Warranted Christian Belief","review":"Because so many others have acclaimed the work Plantinga provides the reader I will only add to the reviewers the following:The book uses two font sizes to aid the reader in distinguishing the technical arguments from the less technical or summary arguments. Plantinga, as is expected, provides keen insight into the problem with the atheistic claim that Christian belief is irrational. Just as JL Mackie's evil argument was destroyed by Plantinga's Freewill Defense, so too is the accusation that Christian beliefs are irrational. This book is easily read by the trained philosopher and by the casual reader."},{"Title":"Warranted Christian Belief","review":"Alvin Plantinga's Warranted Christian Belief (WCB) examines the rationality of religious (particularly Christian) belief. WCB is the third and final instalment in the author's trilogy on the issue of warrant. Plantinga is a highly respected philosopher within the realms of epistemology and the philosophy of religion - he is also arguably one of the most significant philosophers of the late Twentieth century.Traditionally, the philosophy of religion has dealt with two broad arguments against religious belief; the evidentiary argument (de facto) and the rational argument (de jure). The de facto approach examines the various arguments (e.g. ontological, cosmological, teleological, revelation and the existence of evil) and makes a probabilistic assessment with regard to the likelihood of a theistic worldview. The de jure approach focuses on the question of whether the existence of an omnipotent, omniscient and wholly good God is in itself irrational.For those familiar with Plantinga WCB is similar to his other writings - characterized by uncommon analytical rigour, moments of clear brilliance and the occasional meander. On the latter point, the author's digression into the views of Jonathon Edwards while well handled added little (from my perspective) except to make a dense tome even more daunting (others may find more value in this aspect). WCB's significance, however, lays it its rigorous examination and counter to the various de jure arguments against Christianity. Indeed, in my view, Plantinga is successful in arguing that there is no compelling de jure argument that is independent of the de facto argument.Several decades ago Plantinga played a leading role in putting to rest the argument that the existence of evil and God were logically incompatible (this argument is now largely centered on a less compelling evidentiary / probabilistic tact). Only time will tell if he is as successful with regard to addressing the de jure argument against Christian belief. All to say that it is a powerful and important work within the field of religion.Overall, I highly recommend the book. Without exaggeration, it is one of the most powerful books I have read (what that says about me I'm not sure). In fairness it is probably of most interest to students of philosophy and theology, however as other reviewers have noted the educated lay reader (especially Christians) can also find great value in it.Note: Some print problems in the book I purchased from Amazon - alternating pages at the back of the book were blank."},{"Title":"Warranted Christian Belief","review":"A very excellent book in Christian epistemology. It's written in a very clear, lucid, and sometimes humorous language. Although it's the last three of Plantinga's Warrant series, without the knowledge of the other two, someone will still get the comprehensive message of the book. If you're a Christian of any sort, you'll find it strengthening. If you're not, you'll find it challenging.Just small caution, though, when one read this book, always keep in mind the distinction between the de jure objection and the de facto objection. Notwithstanding that both are inseparable, Plantinga's main purpose is to address the de jure objection. Failure to keep it in mind will cause someone to easily misunderstand the primary content of the book."},{"Title":"Forever for All: Moral Philosophy, Cryonics, and the Scientific Prospects for Immortality","review":"One of the most information-rich books ever published on an obscure subject. A subject that has normally dealt with by mystics, or cast aside by cynics. A splendid companion to Frank Tipler's Physics of Immortality, David Deutsch's Fabric of Reality, and Hans Moravec's Mind Children, and Robot, and Julian Barbour's &quot;The End of Time&quot;, and also the papers of Max Tegmark.The work deals with the subject of post mortem survival from two basic angles. The first is his involvement with cryo-preservation as a pssible means of medical restoration of life. The other, and in my opinion, more profound avenue; is Perry's investigation of the Cosmological potentiallities that exist in physics and the burgeoning capabilities of computation.Also, R. Michael Perry examines what many thinkers from different disciplines regard as what is being preserved or reconstitued; what is your identity, what is your personality, what is the sense of self, that we all seem to know, but find difficult to precisely, define? Perry also focuses on the works of several physicists who dwell upon the possibilities of Multiple Universes-what the author calls &quot;Unboundedness&quot;. This is just like Physicist, Julian Barbor's Platonia, in which all logically possible universes may indeed occur!Perry continues with and examination of Good and Evil and what is preserved, and what is remidied. My only caveat, for this book is to those of religious bent who require &quot;scripture&quot; for their emotional needs. R. Michael Perry is a logical positivist, and is atheistic in direction. Yet, I for one, can see this as a plus, because if the author can explore and define possibilities for post-mortem survival; then &quot;God&quot; as the ultimate Mind in existence is practically a given--providing enormous amounts of time for the development of minds and mind that are trans-universal!As I mentioned before, Perry works at one of the few cryo-preservation labs in the world, do if you need more information on cryo-preservation; or Biostasis, as the author terms it, this is an excellent source of data regarding this. I myself find the &quot;cosmological&quot; areas of the book much more compelling; since much of the biostatsis work seems at this point, in need of much greater research.The work is a work of an essay into philosophy as much as it is a work of science and sdvocacy. I am glad I purchased it, because good news, even as a bit of purely materialist, good news, this is not a thing to turn down (you can't anyway!). The old phrase; &quot;all this and Heaven too&quot;, comes to mind. Worth the bucks, in this reader's opinion."},{"Title":"Forever for All: Moral Philosophy, Cryonics, and the Scientific Prospects for Immortality","review":"Large part of this book is an argument, that present human beings may already be immortal by their very nature. Two basic assumtions are made, which the Author calls unboundedness and interchangeability. They amount to a many worlds multiverse (Everett Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics) and a pattern theory of identity, which should lead to abundance of all patterns and thus immortality of all persons without further saying. Yet somewhat half of the book is focused on working out the details.For myself, being a more down-to-earth immortalist, this part was quite hard to get through and I must admit that I even left out some pages. The assumtion of personal interchangeability I find especially hard to accept. For an argument how it leads itself astray see John Perry's short but comprehensive &quot;Dialogue on Personal Identity and Immortality&quot; (Hackett).It must be mentioned to the author's favor that he keeps on reminding us that his basic assumtions are to be regarded as working hypothesis, which need reconsidering when more information will be available.Thus I was mainly interested in the second part which, after considering our motives to strife for eternal life, provides an extensive investigation of today's scientific prospects for immortality. Discussion ranges from such technical topics as cryonics, biochemical anti-aging research, nanotechnology, computer science and brain-computer interfacing to ethical and psychological ones the like free will, personal responsibility, gaming theory, dangers of Nietzschean eternal return, personal identity, memory problems, theology and more.For the widespread opposition or indifference towards immortalism, a powerful memetic/genetic explanation is provided and possible counterstrategies are pointed at. The book helps the already convinced immortalist to develop his own moral standpoint, as well as it may introduce and fascinate the skeptic. We are called for an active stance in bringing about what many do not dare dream of.All in all, overlooking the lengthy and not always really productive discussions in the first half, for the most comprehensive summary of today's immortalist thought and a beautiful read: Five Stars !"},{"Title":"Forever for All: Moral Philosophy, Cryonics, and the Scientific Prospects for Immortality","review":"Forever For All is one of the most important philosophy and religion texts ever written.

And life can be rightly lived, I will maintain-which involves much more than a simple release from pain or burdens. Rightly lived, life must offer positive value, a preponderance of satisfaction over dissatisfaction,[1] a meaningful experience that calls for something beyond immediate interests. There must be a growth process in which the prospect of constructive change and the mysteries to be solved are inducements to continue and progress. Living can then become an end in itself, as it should be, and we can shape our philosophy accordingly: Life is fundamentally good, and death, consequently, is a detriment. We can look forward, with joy, to a future with joy. Ongoing developments lend support to this position and call for a reassessment of life's deeper issues.\\"To say Dr. Perry's book expands your mind is an understatement. As one who has been an atheist almost all my life, from early childhood, this is one of those rare intelligent, scientific journeys into such basic, human questions as \\"Who are We?\\", \\"Where we are going?\\", and \\"What we must accomplish before we get there\\"?

Most guides are decorated with tons of artwork to take up space. Well not this one! This guide has text virtually EVERYWHERE and its really helpful too. Nice BIG and clear screenshots with helpful captions. That's not all, the guide has a good sense of humor and doesn't take itself so seriously. It's always nice when a guide reads more like a companion as opposed to reading like a computer. In all essence: The guide speaks to you.

Powerful stuff."},{"Title":"What Woman Want Men to Know: The Ultimate Book About Love, Sex, and Relationships for You--and the Man You Love","review":"Please read all of the other 2 or 1 star reviews to get a real summary of the book.

However, that can be said about any book that makes sweeping generalizations about either sex as a whole. However, it does have some very pertinent info that she explains much more clearly than most women are able to do. It's written for me, of course, but as a woman it was nice to hear that some of the issues my boyfriend and I deal with are not limited to us alone. I read it and marked the pages I thought were important for him to read :) But I wouldn't give any man the book and tell him to live his life by it."},{"Title":"What Woman Want Men to Know: The Ultimate Book About Love, Sex, and Relationships for You--and the Man You Love","review":"In this book, the author wrote about the way women FEEL, then act. They in general act according to their heart and, most of the time, without any logic or reason. This book is about women's feelings, impressions,and fears but, not about hard scientific data. It, however, offers invaluable insight into the &quot;thinking process&quot; of women. The French scientist Pascal once wrote:&quot;The heart has its reason,that reason does not understand.&quot;The author, however, does not discuss the &quot;give and take&quot; situation in a relationship. Men who are goal oriented, need women to be loving, understanding, and realistic. They have different and sometimes contradicting priorities in their lives: spouse, children, work, religion, social and political interest/ambitions, but not necessarily in that order. And women should learn that they could not be number ONE all the time within this context, if they want the relationship to last for a long time."},{"Title":"What Woman Want Men to Know: The Ultimate Book About Love, Sex, and Relationships for You--and the Man You Love","review":"Guys, if you take away nothing else from this book, take the section on making love to a woman as good advice."},{"Title":"What Woman Want Men to Know: The Ultimate Book About Love, Sex, and Relationships for You--and the Man You Love","review":"Barbara De Angelis has done it again! Her latest book is just what I have been waiting for. Finally, a book that I can not only read to better understand myself and what makes me respond the way I do, but also one that I can share with my husband to help our relationship! I always had such a hard time trying to express myself clearly or in a way that he could understand or other times I would react so strongly and later think to myself, &quot;Why am I being this way? I am not usually so crazed.&quot; This book explains to me in an easy, straight forward way why I am the way I am, and I know once I pass it along to my husband, he will begin to further understand me too.

It is thinly disguised book to help men understand women; rather it points out all the flaws of men and their inability to understand woman and continually states that woman have no flaws and are not responsible for any problems that typically happen in relationships. Furthermore, I came away with the feeling that the writer expects men to bend to every demand and become whipping boys or slaves to their women. Never does it address the fact that men are complex creatures, that we are capable of multitasking, and have the need for love just like woman. The writer describes men as idiots who are unable to create and love, and that woman are superior beings that are reponsible for everything that is good in the world while men are resonsible for all that is bad. It also spends a lot of time on how to please a woman in bed, but it never address how woman could please their men better. A BIG DISAPPOINTMENT"},{"Title":"What Woman Want Men to Know: The Ultimate Book About Love, Sex, and Relationships for You--and the Man You Love","review":"A friend let me borrow this book after they finished it and I have to say that this book was probably the most sexist thing I have encountered that aimed directly at men. The author obviously has had several bad relationships and has failed at each one. At one point she defended her own views by saying that making plans, scheduling and planning events without considering the man's opinion at all was not being controlling but \\"creating\\" and \\"caring\\". The author seems to be a control fiend with a superiority complex. I especially enjoied how she went on a long rant about how men don't know where the clitoris is or how to use it and went into great detail about how (she likes) to have it stimulated.While this book did have a few good points to consider, the rest of it was just male bashing and a huge rant that would be better suited on a livejournal or myspace blog."},{"Title":"What Woman Want Men to Know: The Ultimate Book About Love, Sex, and Relationships for You--and the Man You Love","review":"The book read like a collection of COSMO articles on insecure, needy, emotionally fragile women. I find it difficult to believe women are like what was presented in the book, and if they are, would you really want others, including men, to know about it?Maybe there was some substance, but the writing style ruined \\"the message\\"."},{"Title":"What Woman Want Men to Know: The Ultimate Book About Love, Sex, and Relationships for You--and the Man You Love","review":"Well, the front cover says this is the ultimate book about love, sex and relationships for you and the man you love. That's a big statement. So, what did I think of this book?Insightful is the word that comes to mind concerning this. Many times men and women don't communicate their feelings very clearly to one another and I think this book breaks some of those barriers down. It definitely explains how each member thinks concerning many various issues including myths, communication and techniques for being the perfect lover.Personally, I wish this book had been around a few years back. I would encourage men and women alike who want a greater understanding of the opposite sex to read this book."},{"Title":"What Woman Want Men to Know: The Ultimate Book About Love, Sex, and Relationships for You--and the Man You Love","review":"The book should be entitled What Western women want men to know.Thank you barbara. All I have to do is marry a woman from a non Western culture"},{"Title":"What Woman Want Men to Know: The Ultimate Book About Love, Sex, and Relationships for You--and the Man You Love","review":"Dr. De Angelis has written a passionate appeal to men that is designed to help them improve their relationships with women. This book will probably be given as a gift by wives to husbands and girl friends to their boy friends. If someone gives you this book, see it as an act of love that will help you.While some books about what men need to know totally take the woman's perspective, this book is well balanced. Dr. De Angelis seems to understand male psychology almost as well as she understands her own. Years ago she wrote a parallel book on what men want women to know that demonstrates that understanding. In this book she is careful to keep that balance. For example, the beginning sections include separate messages to women and men for how to give and receive this book, and work with it in loving ways. She also states at several points in bold type, &quot;I love men.&quot; She also doesn't seem to be trying to turn men into women.The book's premise is based on thousands of contacts Dr. De Angelis has had with women and a questionnaire that she distributed. She points out that what she has to say doesn't describe every woman. Each is unique. Men are encouraged to discuss the points in the book to find out which of them do fit the women they care about. This kind of conversation will be an important and valuable use of the book.The fundamental divide between men and women in relationships is that women put love first and it fills and colors every part of what they do and think about. Men put achievement first, and compartmentalize love into a small portion of their lives. A real eye-opener for me was one woman's love diary about her loving thoughts concerning her man. He was seldom out of her mind for more than ten minutes at a time. Few men would think about a woman as often, except during the most extreme times of early infatuation.I found it mentally exhausting to think about all of the things suggested here to be more loving. The good news is that no one needs to do all of these things unless they want to and it feels terrific to do so.The most useful advice in the book comes in terms of &quot;reframing&quot; or seeing what a woman does in a new light. Being asked where you were isn't &quot;checking up on you&quot; or &quot;over control.&quot; You are encouraged to see this as a sign of deep commitment and caring. You also learn to make an occasional telephone call to remove these anxious cross-examinations that most men despise.Realizing that most women do put love first, want to improve things creatively (not because they are bad, but just for fun), and are focused on time allows men the opportunity to connect to that reality with less effort and with less disruption to their own lives. On the time point, time expands for men (which is why we sometimes lose track of time) while it contracts for women (filling their minds with all kinds of awful thoughts about what could be going wrong).The book's many suggestions for how to be viewed as a better husband will undoubtedly improve many relationships. I especially liked the section on things not to say. I was impressed to realize that my wife had asked me to say one of these things to her when I thought it was true (in a loving way) because she so much did not want to have that particular problem. This was a valuable insight to me.For younger men, the section on what is pleasing to women about sex will probably be very helpful in making that part of the relationship better for both. My favorite example here was a woman who described sex as a &quot;three&quot; on a scale of one to ten with ten being the highest. The man said it as a &quot;nine.&quot; Dr. De Angelis asked the man to describe why it was a &quot;nine.&quot; As he told what he had been thinking, his wife was thrilled and she described hearing his thoughts about her as a &quot;ten.&quot; Sexual pleasure begins and ends in the mind, and it is easy for men to lose sight of that.As you can see, the examples and quotes in the book are very revealing and take the masses of lists and verbiage and make them practical and easy-to-understand.After you have finished considering this helpful book, do take the time to discuss it with your wife or girl friend. Just reading about these ideas is not enough. You have to talk about them, and then follow up on the ones that feel right for you both. By the way, it's okay to suggest a duration for the first part of this conversation in advance.Enjoy the happiness and serenity of a better relationship!"},{"Title":"What Woman Want Men to Know: The Ultimate Book About Love, Sex, and Relationships for You--and the Man You Love","review":"I like this author's writing style and the easy, comfortable manner in which she graps the reader's attention. Barbara has, once again, separated the men from the women in her new book which looks at the communication gap between the sexes.As a counsellor, I cannot tell you the number of times a man has sat across from me and said, &quot;My wife does not understand me&quot; or the number of times a woman has said, &quot;My husband doesn't understand what I need from our relationship.&quot; This book will definitely help bridge the communication gap and open the doors to a fuller, enriched and more loving relationship. First of all, husbands and wives are not mind-readers, and the best solution to improving relationships is always a heart-to-heart talk to discover just what does please your partner, and what really ticks him or her off. Secondly, according to the author, &quot;women put love first.&quot; I know of several men who also put &quot;love first&quot; but may show their love in an entirely different manner. Sometimes actions speak louder than words; words mean nothing, no matter how endearing or how many &quot;I love you's are spoken,&quot; if actions contradict the words.The only negative aspects encountered in the book were (1) the author's tendancy to stereotype men and woman, and categorize their needs into nice, neat little compartments, and (2) the author's somewhat flowery, mundane cliches. For those reasons, the book lost a star in the rating. In reality, based on years of experience in the field, it is a known fact not everyone fits into a common mold. Not all women have the same behavioural traits, nor do men. In regard to the list presented in the book which prioritizes the &quot;top ten male habits which drive woman crazy&quot;, many of the habits would also drive men crazy. What man would appreciate being &quot;bossed around&quot;, enjoy &quot;emotional withdrawal&quot; or would willingly accept &quot;lying to avoid unpleasantness&quot;? These are not habits that either gender would welcome.Overall, the book does contain some very helpful advice in improving gender communication and is certainly a book worth reading... and contemplating. If one sees himself or herself among the pages it might serve as a red-alert, wake up call to smell the coffee before your partner finds someone else who IS ready and willing to provide what is lacking in the relationship. Hopefully, men will not view the book as &quot;male bashing&quot; and will share the same appreciation for the book as the throngs of women who anxiously await each and every one of the author's upcoming books."},{"Title":"What Woman Want Men to Know: The Ultimate Book About Love, Sex, and Relationships for You--and the Man You Love","review":"I was looking for a book to give me tips or ideas on how to improve my relationship. I am a guy and I need a list and I have a goal. This book does that, but you do have to read a little too. It is an easy read though. It also explains why women are the way they are. Strange but true. Guys-why do girls need to know where I went, who I talked to, how was my day, why I didn't check in. They have to be spying on me, right? It is a hard concept to accept and I still am having a hard time with it but this book helps explain why. How many times have we heard \\"let's have more quality time\\"? Well I have given out more details about my day like the people who came in, some problems I had, solutions I found,... at dinner instead of \\"fine\\" or \\"ok\\" and this was accepted as quality time. Granted she wants more, but I can do the quality time and eat at the same time. The book explains the telephone phenomenon which why my conversations last under a minute and hers are why they have \\"unlimited nights and weekends\\". Last example, I went to my wife and told her that \\"I appreciated all her hard work in her planning of making sure the kids and myself were happy.\\" this was in the morning and when I got back home at the end of the day she was beaming and had a great day and the nice comment I said had made her day. Wow, that was kind of easy to do, even though I felt like a dork saying it that morning. Only draw back of the book was that I felt like my side of the story was not told and felt overwhelmed that this is a 2way street and what about how to make me happy? Granted, its usually quite simple and obvious but none the less needed. Well I have ordered her other book about what secrets guys want girls to know and that will probably do a good job doing just that. It should be here today. Good luck."},{"Title":"What Woman Want Men to Know: The Ultimate Book About Love, Sex, and Relationships for You--and the Man You Love","review":"This is a very good book, in a field filled with mediocrity. It is very well written and very easy to read. Some of the prose is in fact excellent for this type of book. And there is much less fluff and filler material than you find in most relationship books. I think it is superior to anything in the Mars/Venus series.Interestingly, the book could be titled &quot;How to date a high-maintenance, overly emotional witch/princess.&quot; Of course many of the best looking women are high maintenance princess types (apparently the author is as well), so if you are dating one of those (or want to), this book is for you. But reading through it, I can't help feeling that if you need more than 25% of the information in this book, maybe you need a new girlfriend instead. The tone of the book is that all problems in the relationship occur because the man doesn't understand something about women. But then that is what the book is about. The author has already written books for the women to understand men.That mild criticism being said, almost all the information is useful and if you apply it, it will make your life easier and your relationship better. Even the best relationships have rough times and this will help you guys get through them, and maybe even save the relationship. And don't just jump to the end to the chapters on sex. Read the whole thing."},{"Title":"What Woman Want Men to Know: The Ultimate Book About Love, Sex, and Relationships for You--and the Man You Love","review":"I found myself offended by this book and its constant &quot;bribe&quot; of &quot;hey, guys, if you do this, your wife will have sex with you!&quot;While there are a few good points, this book seems to be written about barbarian men that are stuck in the stone age.I do need to remember that this is supposed to be from a woman's point of view, but this book is really written for women. Ladies, as a guy, I can honestly tell you that this book may alienate your husband. I do not recommend this book as one that you could expect your husband to finish. You may enjoy it, and may be able to point out some of the great points that this book makes to your mate, but don't expect them to eat this book up the way you might.The great points about this book focus mainly on communicating with one's wife, but at the same time, many of the points are obvious and could be summarized simply as:Pay more attention to your wife, listen closely, open up and tell her what you're thinking and, when she annoys you, just remember that she is doing it because she loves you.Much of this book is cliched (i.e: men are easy to please, women require mental stimulation first, etc.) and stereotyped. I would recommend several other marriage books that a husband could actually read before this one.Oh and, by the way, the first 25% of the book keeps talking about how great this book is and how great it will be for you when you get to the meat of the text. I found myself constantly annoyed with, &quot;When I tell you this secret later, you'll be amazed,&quot; etc. Why waste all this time? Because, as she says, women enjoy talking just for talking and men like to get to the point (take your own advice, Doc)."},{"Title":"What Woman Want Men to Know: The Ultimate Book About Love, Sex, and Relationships for You--and the Man You Love","review":"This book is based on the author's very stereotypical views of both the male and female genders. She continually describes all women as being essentially emotional creatures who need constant support and affirmation from men. Similarily, she depicts all men as being analytical and goal orientated people who place less value on romance and relationships. Obviously, men and women are different in certain ways and De Angelis does occasionally make some valid points about communication styles and how to better understand your significant other. But her comments are so exaggerated and generalized that she really destroys her own credibility.Most people that are more open-minded about gender roles and don't fit into her extreme stereotypes will feel this book doesn't apply to them. She is also very insulting towards those who don't fit her gender stereotypes. For example, she describes a certain more analytical and less emotional woman she once knew, Abby, as being disconnected to her true \\"womanhood\\" because of bad past experiences. Maybe the reality is that people are just more complex and intricate than the simple stereotypes De Angelis would like to portray."},{"Title":"What Woman Want Men to Know: The Ultimate Book About Love, Sex, and Relationships for You--and the Man You Love","review":"This book makes you long for the days when men lived in longhouses separate from women, and occasionally got prettied up to go visit the girls.The underlying message, repeated over and over again, is that male behavior is basically deficient or wrong, and that if men would just realize how women really work--the truth as represented by the author--we would all get along.In fact, problems in relationships generally stem from deep family psychodramas, and an inability on the part of both partners to perceive accept the other as he or she is. Projection is a very difficult problem to overcome--but this book basically says to men, your partner's projections reflect her creativity, emotional nature, sensitivity to time, need to be wanted, etc., etc., but your projections are flat out wrong.Peter Kramer's &quot;Should you leave?&quot; gives A far more nuanced and helpful discussion of the dynamics of relationships--I highly recommend that book."},{"Title":"What Woman Want Men to Know: The Ultimate Book About Love, Sex, and Relationships for You--and the Man You Love","review":"I'm a typical guy that has been out of the relationship loop for a while. Most of my friends are women with a few close male friends. I read sections of this book online and decided to buy it looking for insights into how women think about relationships and how to communicate more effectively. I found this book clearly written and well formatted with the stories lending a personal touch to the analysis that Deangelis makes in each section. My one caveat is that men especially are portrayed as a lot more clueless and insensitive than I believe us to be. However I need to remember that most people call on Deangelis for help when things are going badly not when they are going well, so her representative sample is probably on the negative side of the bell curve.Overall I found this book quite funny especially the rebel section and the sloppy sex section. Then again I have no issues with my mother to sort out and I happen to enjoy watermelon . . . I noticed that as I read I found certain sections dealing with commitment and scheduling time/remembering events to be uncomfortable for me. Basically if I can't fit something in a date book I won't remember it. This discomfort is therefore a valuable feeback tool. I learned about \\"spiraling\\" on my own as well as the idea that women just want to bounce feelings off their partners (or close male friends) without expecting us to be Mr. Fix it. It was nice to see insights like these explained in more detail. Ultimately I enjoyed the book and I'll be bouncing it off my female friends for a while before I get through all my projects and back into another relationship."},{"Title":"What Woman Want Men to Know: The Ultimate Book About Love, Sex, and Relationships for You--and the Man You Love","review":"Dr. De Angelis has written a book that will appeal to both men and women, although she does rely on stereotypical perpectives rather than providing more insightful and original suggestions.

I also recommend Men in Marriage: Straight Talk For Men About Marriage: What Men Need to Know About Marriage (And What Women Need to Know About Men)by Marty Friedman.

Sometimes it's an emotional response, sometimes it's intellectual. But it should show you something that you had not noticed or felt or thought of before. Good photography books should do the same. To often we look at landscape photographs as documentation or keepsakes and not as a form for expression. This book reminds us of how expressive landscape photography can be when the right person is behind the camera. It also reminds us how revealing a photography book can be when the right author is behind the word. Mr. Protzman knows a lot about looking. But most importantly he knows a lot about revealing. This is truly a book worth looking at and reading."},{"Title":"Landscape: Photographs of Time and Place","review":"Of all the landscape books I ordered in 2004 this was the the biggest disappointment.

Why is it that in a \\"Musical\\" the instrumentalists are always the first to be cut (or reduced) but last to be considered?

A fascinating and frank look at Al Pacino in an article and essays, but mostly through interviews with one of his most cherished friends. Lawrence Grobel is an award-winning author and longtime trusted Pacino associate. Even so, he is a probing, persistent journalist who asks the tough questions. In the foreword, Al \\"forgives\\" him for this book. The introduction reveals Alfredo James (Sonny) Pacino as I would have never imagined him. Although this book is totally Pacino-centric, frank questions fly both ways in the series of interviews covering a period of over 25 years. Pacino's questions reveal as much about himself and the depth of their friendship as his answers. Full of personal insights and professional tidbits that heretofore were unknown, unless you read the articles and interviews in a previously published form over the decades, this is one book that ALL Pacino fans will want to read. After all, Al Pacino is a private person who usually keeps it that way.In this book, we learn the impact of Charlie Laughton, among others, on Pacino. The inside scoop on plays, movies, and roles that could have happened but didn't. His saddest professional experience. The best young actor he ever saw. We also learn the true meaning of 'the show must go on' as Al shows incredible inner resolve during the Broadway run of the play \\"American Buffalo\\". I couldn't have done it, but I understand why he did it and he was right! He carves out some protective space regarding his women, while acknowledging them. And again what he won't divulge about them says alot about his character. But there is much more that he will discuss and it makes this book worth every penny of it's cost. Not a lot of verbal fat herein, this book is trenchant and to the point. Also included are 8 pages of photos from the almost obligatory baby picture to family photos to professional associates with Pacino and an ad announcing something that every Pacino fan will want when it's available. This is a deep look at the life and psyche of one of the world's greatest actors and it is very engrossing. Highly recommended!!

His book on Al Pacino gives an insight into one ofAmerica's finest actors who is so private and removed from the public that, up until now, we haveknown very little about him. The compilation of interviews are done over several periods of time(usually a film between each interview)and Mr. Grobel's questions show a transformation andgrowth in the actor as his career and life progress. Mr. Grobel has let the actor talk with hisguard \\"up\\" and his guard \\"down\\" and go at his own pace, and the reveal is one of intense depth andan interesting look inside the life and career of Al Pacino. One of the most fascinating revelationsis hearing of his humor and vision of himself. One is particularly astonished to find the comedichumor of the legendary actor because it is so very different from how we associate him through his films. The book makes you yearn to sit down and engage in a wonderful conversation with the authorand the actor and know it will be a treat and time well spent.

For anyone interested in his films or the movie industry this is an excellent choice.Beginning in 1979 and running through 2005 the interviews capture some of Pacino's thinking at different stages of his career and there is a richness derived from this approach that might be missed in a retrospective biography."},{"Title":"Al Pacino","review":"Excellent book in interview form which delves deep into the fascinating and complex psyche of one of the most accomplished and gifted actors in cinema history.

This fantastic and thorough book explains in great depth the complex and brilliant acting career of Al Pacino. If you love Pacino's work like I do you will love this book. Highly recommended and entertaining. Al is widely known not only for his remarkable work on film and in the theater but for his passion for his craft. He is passionate about acting and is a very serious actor but who would of thought that this dark and intense actor would have a sense of humor. Some of the answers that he gives to Lawrence Grobel are actually quite funny. He can be serious when he needs to be and quite amusing when he feels the need. Get this book and you will not be disappointed. He discusses in great detail his entire career from his humble beginnings when he was a homeless struggling actor to his defining status as an icon of American cinema."},{"Title":"Al Pacino","review":"As close to autobiography as we're likely to get from Al Pacino, this series of interviews with Lawrence Grobel begins in 1979 and ends in 2005. For some reason, Pacino and Grobel struck up a real friendship. Through that friendship, Grobel was able to get a decent insight into Pacino and actually get him to answer some questions.Let's be clear, however. Those looking to find insight into Pacino's personal life are going to be disappointed. There's some dancing around Pacino's relationships with his mother & father, and some less than telling information about his relationships with the opposite sex. Even his comments in later years about fatherhood seem less than revealing.On the other hand, Grobel does seem to be very good and getting Pacino to talk about his work. There's a lot of good stuff about how Pacino views his work and the characters he's created. He's not afraid to say when he thinks he failed or when a movie in which he's participated misses the mark. And he's not afraid to speculate on the reasons why. There's also a lot of talk about Pacino's theatre work which is quite interesting. If there's also a lot of talk about the movies Pacino has produced which, up until recently, few have seen...well, that's the prerogative of close friendship.All in all, it's an interesting look at a powerful actor and his craft. Anyone who's ever been moved by a Pacino performance or is fascinated by the craft of acting would enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Al Pacino","review":"Al Pacino: one of the greatest actors of this generation (along side with De Niro of course!)If anyone follows my reviews on Amazon, might have noticed I have very few book reviews. Sadly over the past few years all my books have been around tech and the self improving categories.I bought this book @ the Dubai duty free airport shops. I may sound like a little boy who rediscovered reading and books again! This book totally took me into the mind and heart of this amazing man. I think I will now consider reading more stuff like this and change my reading material. In this story like bio the reader (especially the fans) will completely get an idea of how and where and when and what this actor was going through.Best bio book I ever picked up!"},{"Title":"Al Pacino","review":"I'm a huge Al Pacino fan and I bought 'Al Pacino: The authorized Biography' thinking it was, well, his biography, since I already own a book named 'Conversations with Al Pacino', by Lawrence Grobel, the same author from his biography, that is entirely made out of interviews. In my country neither one of the books are sold and there are no reviews on this one in Amazon, so I bought it. I was shocked to find out, when it arrived, that his 'Biography' is actually the same book with a different title. Now, the interviews are amazing - they're about nine or ten and range from his first interview, in the seventies until the most recent years. I definitely recommend Al's fans buying either one of them. Just don't buy both. It's a waste of money."},{"Title":"Al Pacino","review":"This is a good group of interviews and conversations done with Al Pacino. It isn't a biography, although it has bigraphical information. What it does is give the reader a small glimpse of a man who normally stays well hidden. If you like Al Pacino it is a good read, and gives insight into the behind the curtain reasons for some of his \\"quirks\\". The Kindle editon is formatted without problems. The only complaint is the pictures are small, but that is a kindle limitation. The words carry the book. So this isn't an issue for me. I have looked for the print edition and it was out a few days, sold out in book stores, and I haven't seen it since. It may be available on Amazon, I was checking when I found this edition. And didn't continue to look, the pictures aren't that important to me - I know what Pacino looks like."},{"Title":"Al Pacino","review":"Mr. Grobel's relationship with Al Pacino grows throughout this book. The book consists of numerous interviews by the author as well as magazine articles. Pacino talks about his many successful films, actors he admires, the Godfather III disaster, and his obsession with Richard III. This was a great read and allowed me to see inside the mind of one of my favorite actors."},{"Title":"Al Pacino","review":"This is a great book for several reasons:1. Pacino gives insight on many of his movies, discussing why he feels they were hit or miss.2. Pacino talks about off-the-camera stuff, such as his childhood, his struggles in trying to become an accomplished actor and much more.3. Pacino elaborates on his true passion and where he returns when his career is in a slump.The introduction is very strong and interesting because it summarizes his career work. If you like Al Pacino, you gotta have this book."},{"Title":"Al Pacino","review":"Great insight about the worlds greatest actor! Recomended to all who likes Big Al's work! Awesome at the screen and on the stage, Alfredo James Pacino deserves all the credit for his work, a shame that he won just one Oscar, after been nominated eight times."},{"Title":"Al Pacino","review":"Reading, \\"Al Pacino\\" was a very rewarding experience for me. Learning about the man from his own words was enligtening and enjoyable. The interview format worked well in that Pacino could answer the sometimes difficult questions in a spontaneous way. Grobel asked some particularly personal questions that Al had to own up to (most of the time). I especially liked finding out that Pacino is quite a learned man. His understanding and love of Shakespeare is wonderful. He is full of quotes from Dante to Di Niro. Also because of the format, the book is full of interesting and fun anecdotal material. Getting Pacino's take on the ways of Hollywood, Broadway, and the entertainment industry in general again was very informative. Most of all, it was great to see (sometimes between the lines)this man of passionate living, zeal in sharing his craft with people because he thought that the story was important and had merit in and of itself. It doesn't matter to him first of all if the movie/play is commericial, but if it says something significant. Now that says something about the man in and of itself."},{"Title":"Al Pacino","review":"Lawrence Grobel is a master interviewer and get some original and surprising answers of Al Pacino. There is no flattery for the celebrity here and if there's some is only in small doses. Pacino reveals himself as a down to earth guy who caresa lot about his craft and about doing his job well(no more,no less) and shows an amazing sense of humour at times.This is the portrait of a true artist who loves his art.Lawrence Grobel many times insist in questions that Mr. Pacino does not want to answer and many times out of insistence get an answer from the actor.I truly find this book entertaining ,didactic and intelligent."},{"Title":"Al Pacino","review":"Bought as gift for relative who is a tremendous Al Pacino fan. Paged through it myself, briefly, and realized it to be a interesting way to understand Pacino, the man, in a series of interviews dating back to 1979. Sure to be an easy and entertaining read."},{"Title":"Al Pacino","review":"This is a must have for any Al Pacino fan. Grobel gets the normally shy Pacino to open up. Now I just can't wait for the Al Pacino DVD Collection to be released."},{"Title":"Al Pacino","review":"I am very pleased with my purchase. I received it on the last day, but still within the time given."},{"Title":"Al Pacino","review":"This book was invaluable in my own writing and interviewing.Grobel's interviewing techniques uncover and present this acting legend, commanding your interest until the last page.Grobel's extensive research on his friend (friendship which is crucial to outstanding interviewing) gives credibility to his process and confidence to the reader.I can say nothing more than read the book, get to know a legend and watch a master at work."},{"Title":"Al Pacino","review":"was reading this book in the bookstore, thought of ordering it thru Amazon and nevver received it.

It is a MUST for every MW/RF Engineer's library - at home and at work."},{"Title":"Joy Unspeakable","review":"This is the best treatment of the person and work of the Holy Spirit in a Christians life. i found it to be extremely refreshing and i thought his exegesis followed by the testimonies of the great men of Christendom were inspiring. Martin's thesis is that the baptism of the Holy Spirit is not about santification(what he calls the normal work of the HS) but to uphold the name of Jesus and give a supernatural desire to know him, to love him, and to spread his name. Lloyed-Jones knew this book would be controversial, but his exegesis along with his history of the early church since Pentecost makes a powerful case. Overall, i recommend this book to any seminary student who wants to add to his knowledge of the person and work of God the Holy Spirit. We really do have a supernatural faith."},{"Title":"Joy Unspeakable","review":"This is the clearest and most convincing expostition of the baptism/infilling of the Holy Spirit as a second work of grace that I have ever read. Lloyd-Jones is very articulate, and presents his arguments with great clarity. Be warned - after reading this book, you will find it difficult to disagree with him!"},{"Title":"Joy Unspeakable","review":"For a reformed author, D. Martyn Lloyd Jones has a unique view of the Holy Spirit. Unlike most Baptist and Reformed authors he holds that a believer may not initially be baptized by the Holy Spirit on conversion. His view is similar in some ways to that of many charismatics. However, Jones emphasizes the sovereignty of the Holy Spirit and sees the signs of his baptism as a new power to bear witness to Christ accompanied by assurance and &quot;joy unspeakable&quot;. It is good reading and should make the reader rethink his view of the baptism of the Holy Spirit."},{"Title":"Joy Unspeakable","review":"I am extremely happy that I bought and own this book. It's a good buy, with over 450 pages, and it seems to consist of twenty four sermons that Lloyd-Jones preached on the subject of The Baptism with the Holy Spirit. I say this because Lloyd-Jones died in 1981, but this book is copyrighted in 1984 by Lloyd-Jones' wife. Also, his grandson is the editor, and he also wrote an introduction.In spite of the fact that this may be transcripts of sermons, it is very well written and easy to read and understand. So either the editor did a marvelous job, or Lloyd-Jones wrote out his sermons in addition to preaching them.Now to content. I was for many years a member of a traditional Pentecostal church, and we were taught that the Baptism with the Holy Spirit was an event separate and usually subsequent to salvation and was always accompanied by speaking in tongues. After many years under this teaching, and being very well schooled in the arguments to back up the traditional Pentecostal teaching, a series of events of a very negative nature shook my faith in this type of church and caused me to almost \\"start over\\" in my Christian education. Through this journey, I studied the teachings of many non-Pentecostal preachers, teachers, and authors. One of my favorite teachers and authors is John MacArthur of Grace Community Church in California, who radio ministry is called \\"Grace to You.\\" He is extremely prolific and a wonderful, thorough, and uncompromisingly scriptural teacher of the Bible.Well John MacArthur wrote a book entitled \\"Charismatic Chaos\\" in which he gives a very good presentation of his positions: 1) that \\"miracle gifts,\\" [speaking in tongues, interpretation of tongues, miracles, healings] ceased even before the end of the Apostle Paul's ministry and life and 2) that the Baptism with the Holy Spirit occurs now concurrent with salvation. In the early church, it came it stages, but MacArthur gives his reasons for that, and he does a really good job. Based on his book, I stopped praying in tongues, and became even more suspicious of people who say \\"The Lord told me . . . .\\" and who want to give me prophesies or operate in other \\"spiritual gifts.\\" Still, I was not convinced that John MacArthur had the whole story, because I have not seen anything in the church during my lifetime that has come close to the Book of Acts. And I don't see anything in the Bible that says the church today should be different from then.Now MacArthur also claims that Martin Lloyd-Jones is one of his \\"heroes.\\" He uses quotes from him in his MacArthur commentaries. So when I discovered that Lloyd-Jones was a Calvinist (or Reformed) theologian, AND he believes that the Baptism with the Holy Spirit occurs separate and generally subsequent to salvation and that all the gifts of the Spirit can occur today, well this book was for me a \\"must.\\"And I am not disappointed. Lloyd-Jones gives his exegesis that the Baptism with the Holy Spirit occurs separate from salvation, it does not require speaking with tongues, it does not require accompaniment by any manifestation of the Spirit or any particular gift, it is not equivalent with sanctification, that gifts of the spirit or \\"manifestations\\" can be counterfeited, that there are many reasons to be cautious about manifestations, and much, much more. There are twenty-four chapters and twenty-four topics, and I have enjoyed them all. I especially appreciate the chapters showing that we have to be cautious when people claim that they have gifts of the Spirit.Do I now have all the answers? No, not at all. In fact, I may have more questions than ever, but I believe that my love for, and knowledge of, Scripture is greater than ever. And so I'll keep on studying and searching and reading and researching, and I believe I'll get the answers eventually.Finally, I am asking God to grant me the Baptism with the Holy Spirit as Lloyd-Jones defines and describes it, so I would have to say I found his presentation very persuasive."},{"Title":"Joy Unspeakable","review":"There are chapters in this book that make you yearn to draw closer to the Lord, parts that will warm your spirit and long to have more of Him!You will stop mid-sentence and say \\"wow!\\"."},{"Title":"Joy Unspeakable","review":"Of a personal Biblical library of more than 5,000 volumes, I consider this work on the baptism of the Holy Spirit the finest I've found. Martyn Lloyd-Jones here combines biblical and historical insights and examples to create a precise treatment of the Baptism. While few will probably agree with every deduction, much that is here said is very convincing, if not indisputable. Classic Pentecostals will find the work different than the norm that simply and unfortunately emphasize \\"tongues\\" as the essence of the gift. Non-Pentecostals who, with prejudice, reject a \\"Baptism\\" experience as possible subsequent to salvation may find the premise objectionable.I commend this book wholeheartedly to ALL who with an open heart and mind are willing to search the scripture and history of the church in hopes of a greater understanding of God's precious promise of His Presence.It alarms me that this excellent work has such little popularity among readers of \\"The Doctor\\". Hopefully Amazon will soon carry this text again. I cannot find it anywhere else in the States!"},{"Title":"Joy Unspeakable","review":"Once in a lifetime comes a man truly gifted of God, who brings the genuine excitement of truth of the Holy Spirit to his writing and understanding. That man was Martin Lloyd Jones. A man of very high intellect and knowledge of the Bible, and the fallen nature of man!

I continually thanked God for giving this man such discernment and width of understanding on these sometimes controversial subjects, especially in these days when such gifts are so abused by the Charismatic and Pentecostal Churches. When Bibles are given out in these churches, this book should also be issued at the same time!

Extremely well documented, the book contains a number of startling statistics. Did you know that in California's Central Valley, the 1,600 dairies there generate more waste than a city of 21 million people? Did you know that in 1997, growers applied more than 985 million pounds of pesticides and herbicides to crops? Can you conceive of a farm subsidy system that has people like Scottie Pippin and Sam Donaldson receiving farm program monies?There is a lot to ponder in this book and some excellent ideas and suggestions as to what we as consumers can do to make changes in our lives and our communities to help bring farming back to the people and out of the hands of the giant corporations."},{"Title":"Diet For A Dead Planet: How The Food Industry Is Killing Us","review":"This is a well-written and well-researched description of the economic problems ailing contemporary American agriculture, and of the deleterious effects mammoth-scale corporate farming is having on the environment. The author is an experienced investigative reporter and an unashamed proponent of sustainable agriculture and the ever-dwindling \\"family\\" farmer representative of traditional crop cultivation in the United States. As such, Diet For A Dead Planet is a bit of a polemic and firmly in the camp of other books critical of the relationship between agricultural economics and modern food production, such as Eric Schlosser's Fast Food Nation. Needless to say, Cargill and Archer-Daniels Midland executives are not going to be enamored of Diet, but any citizen concerned about the state of farming in the US, and its effects on public health and environmental well-being, would do well to read this book.Cook organizes his topic into three sections, dealing with food quality and safety; the business and economic aspects of modern agriculture; and environmental consequences of profligate pesticide use and \\"factory\\" farm effluents. Each section contains several chapters with extensive footnotes. The chapters are obviously targeted for a general audience, and as a consequence are very readable without overwhelming the reader with statistics and technical jargon. In particular, I found the chapters on the evolving history of American agriculture offered a concise but informative account of a complex and often tumultuous subject. Other chapters on such diverse subjects as the \\"mad cow\\" crisis, the continuous deposition of toxic pesticides in water supplies, and the travails of workers in high-throughput slaughterhouse operations, are all eye-opening to one degree or another.Cook ends the book with a admonition to the public: unless we actively choose to support organic / sustainable farm operations, our health and the welfare of the environment we live in are not going to improve. Rather than simple hectoring, however, in the last segment of the book he provides an extensive listing of whole-food organizations and advocacy groups dedicated to helping us change the way we eat and consume natural resources. There is of course an element of \\"better to light one candle\\" rhetoric here; even Cook is not so nave as to think that tomorrow will see the US converted to any kind of enormous vegan commune. But his hope is that after reading Diet some of us will devote a bit of thought to the hows and whys of our eating habits, and in this, I think he is as realistic as any \\"muckraker\\" can be."},{"Title":"Diet For A Dead Planet: How The Food Industry Is Killing Us","review":"Hey people, the situation with how we get our food is not OK. I love steak and all the good eats but I am a new parent, I don't want to poison my kid. Reading this book pissed me off. Our food is full of toxins and the big companies that produce most of it are a bunch of welfare grubbing polluters. I am telling you, it's socialism for the big companies when you read the fine print of the agro bills as Cook, the author of this book, did. Sadly the little farmers have been mostly put out of business. Agro biz is not only poisoning us but are raping the American environment as well. Mr. Cook (yes, it's a funny name for a guy who writes about food) reveals some really freaky bad stuff from the heartland. How do lagoons of hog doo doo spoiling rivers strike you? Cows eating cows? Yummy. It's really crazy that the topics covered in the very well written and intensely researched book are not more of an issue. It'd be easy to get really down when looking too closely at where our vitals come from but Cook also takes a realistic look at some remedies; all of which involve producing and then eating good food. If you care about your health and about the planet read this book."},{"Title":"Diet For A Dead Planet: How The Food Industry Is Killing Us","review":"I thought I knew a lot about how dangerous our food is, but this book put all the pieces together in a way that gives me a whole new understanding of the nature and gravity of the problem. Anyone who thinks buying organic food will solve the problem needs to read this book--the whole system of subsidies, price supports and food retailing necessarily means more huge corporate farms and slaughterhouses, more pesticides, more food contamination. By humanizing and sympathizing with the players (and by writing with consummate skill), Cook manages to make agricultural history and policy highly readable, and his portrayal of the conditions in the meatpacking industry is downright gruesome. Cook shows how the interests of consumers in healthy, fresh food and the interests of small family farmers and meatpacking workers coincide. Now it's up to the rest of us to see that the nation's agricultural and food safety policies are rewritten from the bottom up."},{"Title":"Diet For A Dead Planet: How The Food Industry Is Killing Us","review":"Christopher D. Cook's latest book Diet for a Dead Planet offers the American public with a wake up call view of the food industry today. As an investigative journalist, he gives a complete overview of the socioeconomic and political ills facing food production. He begins the supermarkets and ends with the global agricultural market.Cook inspects the multifaceted complexities which have arisen due to cheap labor, often exploited and without healthcare. He also depicts the plight of migrant workers, processed food, and pesticides manipulatively spread over crops with the able assistance of government subsidies. The findings are thorough, compelling, and difficult to ingest at times. However, they are warranted as he introduces authorities to backup his claims.The statistics Cook presents are real, yet harsh. Yearly, 75 million Americans are sickened by the food they eat, while an estimated 67 million birds are killed by the millions of pounds of toxic agricultural pesticides sprayed on crops. Meanwhile, farmers that remain take home only about 19 cents per food dollar spent by the average consumer (this is in comparison to 37 cents in 1980 and 47 cents in 1952) according to Cook.Cook closely examines every branch of the food industry. In doing so, he reaches a necessary reason for change. The socioeconomic, environmental, and political injustices currently practiced weigh heavily on America's well being. Within each chapter, he goes into great detail explaining, expanding, and scoping the historical difficulties and how they adversely impact today's food industry. Beyond that conclusion, Cook explains that unless a new solution, specifically changing how food is \\"made\\", Americans will continue to spiral downward.Cook clearly maps out the issues beleaguering and tormenting many workers in the food industry from farmers, supermarket employees to higher up executives. All problems such as exploited migrant workers, sickened Americans, corporate control, and government subsidies carry negative consequences for the future if nothing is done soon. In Cook's last chapter, he outlines a solution which focuses on changing the role of the food industry in the future. This book is powerful in its own right. However, more pages need to be devoted to envisioning that solution than one final chapter. I hope to see more works from Christopher Cook. I recommend this book as a read for anyone who eats. This is also a book for anyone who wants to learn the truth about a topic in urgent need of active change and tired of complacency."},{"Title":"Diet For A Dead Planet: How The Food Industry Is Killing Us","review":"This book will open your eyes to the American food industry...from poor quality to bad business practices, Cook covers it all. I knew that quality and mega-chain stores were a concern, but I never considered the demise of our communities and food culture as a by-product of these issues. This book won't help you to sleep easier at night, but it will make you think before you purchase your next carton of milk or loaf of bread."},{"Title":"Diet For A Dead Planet: How The Food Industry Is Killing Us","review":"Diet for a Dead Planet totally opened up my eyes about the the mess of our food system. Read this book!I knew about fast food from Fast Food Nation, but Christopher Cook really digs in to the entire food system -- from corporate business strategies to the impacts of pesticides on the land and on our health.It's a very broad book, so i think it's great as a primer on a bunch of related issues. For people like me, who know about this stuff in a general way, Cook's book is a great way to absorb really good detailed research on food system problems. He talks about mad cow, agribusiness, obesity, pesticides, the insane things workers go through to get us our meats (losing fingers, and a lot worse), and does it in a really engaging way.Also, he ends on a positive note, with ideas about political organizing and ways people can make change, which i really appreciated. His writing style is very rich and layered, and packed with information. This book is an essential contribution to the literature on food politics."},{"Title":"Diet For A Dead Planet: How The Food Industry Is Killing Us","review":"The current world has a large number of diet problems. Obesity and other diet related medical problems are becoming among the biggest health problems facing the world today.In this book Chris Cook discusses not only the dietary problems associated with obesity but with the entire food system. He talks of the corporate control of farms and supermarkets, unsustainable forces that demand ever higher production levels of productivity and profits, mistaken subsidies for exports, and corporate friendly regulations.Food has become a political issue while at the same time, the growth of organic farming has surprised the corporations and is growing faster than anyone ever expected."},{"Title":"Diet For A Dead Planet: How The Food Industry Is Killing Us","review":"The author does such a good job of showing what utter rats agribusiness/chain grocery stores/pesticide companies are I have to give this a five star rating. Environmental damage, exploitive labor practices, factory farms, unhealthy and at times out and out toxic food supply, destruction of the family farms, the FDA/USDA being there more to see to it that big food gets what they want instead of protecting the public. All of this is covered in Diet for a Dead Planet. Even the farm subsidies, which the average American probably thinks goes to prop up family farms is more a welfare program for the super wealthy who get paid for land they own that they don't farm. David Rockefeller and Ted Turner, along with corporations like Chevron and Dupont rake in the dough from these programs, not to mention big agribusiness firms.Probably the only annoyance in this book is he treads politically correct waters when talking about the exploitive labor practices used on illegal (and legal) immigrants by agribusiness. Its also very Americentric. I am really grateful to live in a country that while it is far from perfect, has higher food standards and doesn't allow all this toxic stuff into the food supply like America does and about a third of the fruits, vegetables, meats and dairy products on the shelves in Denmark are organic."},{"Title":"Diet For A Dead Planet: How The Food Industry Is Killing Us","review":"Millions of Americans are sickening from the food they eat, last year 5,000 died, and obesity and diet-related diseases are on the rise: so Christopher Cook's examination of the food industry in America in Diet For A Dead Planet: How The Food Industry Is Killing Us provides much food for thought.

Simon,its' editor.The recordingsfrom this January,1939 session were also out of print for many years and never sawthe light of day until the late '50s when Simon induced RCA to release all of theMetronome All Star Band sessions between 1939 and 1950.All in all,this is a very worthy addition for Berigan fans everywhere,whetheryou just disovered his playing or,like me,a veteran big band fan for nearly 50 ye-ars.By all means,add this set to your collection-Berigan recordings are very hardto come by as his work was obscured by releases of RCA's more successful bandslike Tommy Dorsey,Benny Goodman and Glenn Miller.I give this collection a rating offive stars."},{"Title":"The Dictionary of Medical Folklore","review":"First published in 1979, Carol Ann Rinzler's &quot;Dictionary of Medical Folklore&quot; provides a nearly complete collection of our medical myths, beliefs, and delusions, from acne to zinc oxide. Often, they are fascinating. For instance, most people have read a mystery in which a corpse's nails keep growing after death; according to Rinzler, that's absolutely false: the cuticles shrink, making the nails merely look longer. I was also pleased to learn that chocolate does not cause acne, which would have made my adolescence a little less argumentative. There are a few items that have become outdated as medical research rolls on, but on the whole, this is a worthwhile book to have in your library, to help answer trivia questions or do research for stories."},{"Title":"The Dictionary of Medical Folklore","review":"I remember this book from high school and it is excatly as I remeber from 25 years ago!

A winner!"},{"Title":"Thomas Gray in Copenhagen: In Which the Philosopher Cat Meets the Ghost of Hans Christian Andersen","review":"I found this a very charming book. The mild scholar Lucas Fysst goes on a researchtrip to Copenhagen and is joined by his companion, the philosopher cat, Thomas Grey. Together they explore various libraries and archives in order to unearth a story by H C Andersen dealing positively with cats.The local colour is very good, I know as I happen to live in Copenhagen! And as I work at the Royal Library I find the descriptions of the house and its personel very amusing - and quite accurate...The author mixes fact, fiction and detective story elements in an entertaining way, he is a very witty and learned person who spices his concoction with bemused commentaries on this science and that philosopher... The illustrations are absolutely congenial and as a whole it is a very good-looking volume.I'd like to warmly recommend this book to anyone who is fond of cats, H C Andersen, Copenhagen and philosophising!"},{"Title":"The Myths of the North American Indians (Native American)","review":"This book was first published in 1914, and is one of the works of the eminent Scottish folklorist, Lewis Spence (1874-1955). In this book, Mr. Spence attempts to give the reader an understanding of the customs and religious thoughts of the North American Indians, presenting them as a unified system, but with variations among the various \\"nations,\\" including the Algonquians, Iroquois, Sioux, Pawnee, and Northern and Northwestern Indians. The book is broad in its reach, discussing everything from shamanism, through the various stories of gods and heroes.Now, I must admit to being of two minds about this book. On the positive side, it does discuss a lot of interesting stories, and puts them in an easy-to-understand style. On the negative side, in attempting to make the North American stories easily understood, he often makes references to European myths. The problem with this is that, with his numerous references to such things as \\"faerie women,\\" I could not help but wonder if I was getting a good understand of how the North American natives themselves understood these stories, or if I was getting a distorted view of how they understood them. Indeed, on page 75, he reports one female spirit as saying, \\"Look at me, Indian.\\" Would an Indian really have said that, or would he have said, \\"Look at me, young man,\\" or something similar? The difference is a matter of trust in the material.So, while this book is interested, and crammed full of stories from the North American natives, I do not feel like I really trust it. As such, I cannot bring myself to recommend it."},{"Title":"Government Marketing - Best Practices","review":"I have a hard time finding anything useful for Busines Development or good practices for Government marketing in this book."},{"Title":"Government Marketing - Best Practices","review":"If you want to learn how to use marketing to help get your company's share of the billions that the Federal, state and Local government spends every year, this book is a must read.Having known him professionally for a number of years, I consider the author, Mark Amtower, to be the leading business-to-government marketing consultant in the USA.This just released book is based on Amtower's hands-on experience and popular workshop series on marketing to the government. Its pages are loaded with useful resources, tips and suggestions for making the most of your government marketing dollars.In the book, Amtower pops the myths associated with marketing to the government and replaces them with practical, tactical ideas on how to reach and influence government buyers.He gives sage advice on everything from making your website government-friendly to using direct mail, email, space advertising, trade shows and public relations to target the important government influencers and buyers.He also gives important tips on how to get your share of the projected $17.1 billion in \\"off schedule\\" sales represented by government employees with SmartPay credit cards.I think the appendix alone is worth the cost of the book, giving you the short list of important resources needed to effectively market to the government.Yes, I admit mark writes like he speaks; often in incomplete sentences and jumping from thought to thought and back again. But if you, like I, judge the success of a book by being able to take away a few good ideas that you can implement right away, I think you'll find this book is well worth reading.\\""},{"Title":"Government Marketing - Best Practices","review":"THis was a good read, but in terms of useful texts I would probably opt for it as a second or third text.Author clearly knows his stuff, but probably not as structured in working frameworks as other texts on the subject."},{"Title":"Government Marketing - Best Practices","review":"The book has very little information that you can use, its more like a Forbes article expanded into a book.

Mark is one of the top experts in B2G (business-to-government) marketing, and no one explains the rules of selling to the government more clearly.

This book has a lot of humorous and entertaining facts about the show, but it doesn't really make you think about the show in new ways. One of the great things about LOST is the way it invites viewers to create meanings of their own as they watch. From visiting a couple of the fan sites for the show, I know that most of the fans for LOST are incredibly intelligent, creative people who want a read that will stimulate their thinking about the characters in the show, the meanings of the \\"ancestor texts\\" in the show, etc. And for me, this book here just didn't cut it. I think it's pretty cool that the show is generating so much interest now in books about the show, but if I had to choose only one book, I'd pick Porter and Lavery's book.

Some sentences are almost incomprehensible (unless you want to spent the time figuring out which letters are missing or tacked onto the wrong word). Incorrect character names are aplenty. The authors and editors of this book should be ashamed! Did they read this book before they sent it to the printer? Huge print, double spaced - this book is actually about 100 pages, not 300. And all this at $24.95. This is so obviously a ruse to make money by piggybacking off the success of this show. Spent your money wisely - buy \\"The Lost Chronicles : The Official Companion Book\\" - a far superior book."},{"Title":"LOST: The Ultimate Unofficial Guide to ABC's Hit Series LOST News, Analysis, and Interpretation","review":"This book is an insult. Sure, there are some facts about this television series, but the book seems directed at people whose IQ would never permit them to understand what is going on on-screen. The print is large with huge margins and wide spaces between lines of print. Had they printed it in regular format, the 300 pages could have neem accomodated in 200, which seems a blessing when one thinks of wasted trees. The language is on a 6th-grade level. This is bad enough, but why didn't the publishers provide even minimal proof-reading services? The book is chock-full of typos and grammatical errors that would embarrass anyone. There are even sentences that simply stop in the middle and hang there on the page looking like a bloody limb hanging off one of the palm trees on the beach of the survivors' island.This book is a true embarrassment and shame. The writing is all right - no better - but the quality control is simply non-existent. How can anyone be this uncaring?There are other Lost books on the market. Any of them would be better than this one."},{"Title":"LOST: The Ultimate Unofficial Guide to ABC's Hit Series LOST News, Analysis, and Interpretation","review":"I have never been so disappointed in a book. I love books and can almost always find some saving grace for any book. However, this book has so many typos, is double spaced (thus making it about 100 pages rather than 300), and, in my opinion, really doesn't come up with any new insights or ideas about the TV series. Another unauthorized guide, Unlocking the Meaning of Lost: An Unauthorized Guide, by Lynette Porter and David Lavery, is far superior.

They refer to Jack as \\"Jake\\" and even \\"Nack\\", have mismatched verb tenses, forget to finish sentences. I don't think there was a single page without an error on it. Each chapter starts with a plot synopsis that is basically the same as you can read on a million web sites. That's followed by a few quotes, a theory from the fans - again which you can find everywhere online, a \\"Sawyerism\\" - which is a list of nicknames he uses for other characters in that episode, and then the \\"Seven Degrees of Lost\\" which reminds us of really important things like \\"Rose and Jack sat next to each other on the plane\\".

This book has so many typos and flat out mistakes that I was embarrassed to read it sometimes. I'm not saying I'm the best speller but come on, if you're publishing a book at least have the foresight to proof-read it. There is even a point when the book names the same character, even though they are clearly talking about two different people. Aside from the apparent 3 mistake per page minimum the authors must have imposed, the book offers barely more than information that can be found in most any other Lost book or on the internet. Overall, this book is a waste, and should not have been allowed to be published."},{"Title":"LOST: The Ultimate Unofficial Guide to ABC's Hit Series LOST News, Analysis, and Interpretation","review":"Well, I finally took the plunge and ordered this book last week. My reason was a simple one- I've read all the other books about \\"Lost\\" and was curious if this book was as bad as the reviews claim it is. Well- is it as bad? Yes and no. Whoever edited this book should lose his/her job. For a professional publication the mistakes are horrible. Bad spelling, incorrect use of commas, periods, etc. The double spacing of lines is okay with me except it makes all the other mistakes stand out like a sore thumb. With all that being said, the actual material presented in the book is pretty good. No new revelations are revealed here, but it gives a pretty detailed synopsis of all the action from season one. Each \\"chapter\\" represents a first season episode and includes the following- episode summary, analyze this, signs and symbols, Listen to what the fans say, truth and speculation, quotable quips, Sawyerisms and seven degrees of Lost. Quotable quips and Sawyerisms are the best of the material as they take some of the best one-liners from each episode and Sawyer's use of nicknames. The bottom line with this book is that it's a decent one. The editing problems can be bothersome and at $24.95 it is one of (if not the)the most expensive books about Lost on the market. Several other titles listed on Amazon are just as good, if not better, and are available at much better prices. If your looking to collect everything you can about your favorite show go ahead and buy this book. If your only a casual fan, or just looking to catch up with something you may have missed, look to some of the other books available. As a sidenote, the same publisher (Equity Press) has just released the \\"Ultimate Season II Guide\\". I have it but haven't read it yet. At first glance the differences between the two books is glaring. The new book is a smaller size, not double spaced and written by a different author. Not sure yet about grammar and editing.

They really enjoy it!"},{"Title":"En El Nombre De Salome (Spanish Edition)","review":"I struggled to finish this book simply because of the way the story of the two protagonists was written. Salome (the mother) and Camila (the daughter) never met each other because Salome died when Camila was very young.Salome was a famous poet in the Dominican Republic and lived during a difficult historical period in her country. On the other hand we see the life of Camila, a retired schoolteacher who is about to leave the US to live in Cuba and play a role in the Cuban Revolution.Salome is by far the more interesting character and her poetry was pivotal in the Dominican revolutionary period. Out from her writings the reader learns more about the DR during the 16th century. Camila seems more disoriented, unsure of herself and did not live the life that she wanted to and being more active in the Cuban political sphere did not change her life at all.The book is interesting from the point of view that it relates the story of two people's life, mother and daughter in two distinct time frames but it would have been more interesting if I had known more about Dominican political history because the book is heavily oriented around their history. I think this one of those books that will either captivate you or not interest you at all but I say it the reader's choice if you are curious and if you like Julia Alvarez as a writer."},{"Title":"Great Editorials: Masterpieces of Opinion Writing","review":"Aside from the editorials included, the writing is dry and often convoluted. The briefs on the historical periods during which these editorials were written could be improved with a little clarity on the author's part.Though this book was compiled in 1997, women are absent from this collection. Thus, this book perpetuates a subtle stereotype that women have worked for years to destroy: that &quot;greatness&quot; can only be achieved by or associated with men.Look to this book for a one-sided interpretation of editorial writers and history."},{"Title":"Great Editorials: Masterpieces of Opinion Writing","review":"Editorial and opinion examples (and backgroundon their authors) from Revolutionary,Constitutional, Abolitionist through Civil Rightsperiods are teriffic for teaching andstudent learning in graduate and undergraduatecourses in editorial and opinion writing.The examples are good for study, analysisand for oral reading.The interwoven material on the developmentof the newspaper and the editorialwriting form and purpose fromearly U.S. to comtempory times is alsoinstructive.

The illustrations are bright and colorful and he loves to lift the flaps."},{"Title":"Elmo's World: Balls! (Sesame Street) (Sesame Street(R) Elmos World(TM))","review":"We might start by talking about what you already know about Elmo and his ideas. He's one of the most important thinkers of the twentieth century, if only because versions of his ideas have permeated popular culture; it's unlikely that anyone in this class has never heard of, or used, a Elmodian idea--such as a Elmodian slip, dream analysis, or even the word &quot;unconscious.&quot;When Elmo looks at balls (which he does in Balls!: Elmo's World), he sees two fundamental principles at work, which he calls the &quot;pleasure principle&quot; and the &quot;reality principle.&quot; The pleasure principle tells us to do whatever feels good; the reality principle tells us to subordinate pleasure to what needs to be done, to work. Subordinating the pleasure principle to the reality principle is done through a psychological process Elmo calls SUBLIMATION, where you take desires that can't be fulfilled, or shouldn't be fulfilled, and turn their energy into something useful and productive.This analysis is taken to multiple levels with the examination of the beach ball, baseball and in a stroke of genius, the Basketball. I have followed Elmo and his writings since the &quot;early&quot; years when he published &quot;Kitty, Kitty, Warm and Pretty&quot; and &quot;See Me Go Potty&quot;. Balls! is by far his best work and should reside on anyone's shelf who respects fine writing."},{"Title":"Elmo's World: Balls!

Then the cardboard pages came loose from the binding. I tried salvaging the pages for her to use to make stacks or just to gather up and put into drawers, etc. since she likes Elmo. Then the paper started peeling away from the cardboard. By that point, it was just garbage.I've had similar problems with the construction of other Sesame Street board books, especially very small ones (usually seasonal, like Halloween books). I've never had a Sesame Street board book last more than a couple of months.

After all, this book by Donald Dale Jackson and the Editors of Time-Life Books does not talk about battles or generals, politicians or issues. What it does do is look at what things were like for the common folks back home (a similar volume, &quot;Confederate Ordeal&quot; looks at the Southern side of the equation). Chapter 1, &quot;Fissures of Dissent,&quot; looks at the political divisions that existed in the North, personified by men such as New York &quot;Tribune&quot; publisher and self-appointed gadfly Horace Greeley and Ohio Congressman Clement Vallandigham, hero of the Peace Democrats. Chapter 2, &quot;The Enterprising Union,&quot; covers the economic machine that fueled the Union war effort. Chapter 3, &quot;Mustering the Legions,&quot; details how recruitment eventually gave way to the first military drafts. Chapter 4, &quot;An Artery of Love,&quot; focuses on the Sanitary Commission that was established to support the soldiers in the field. Chapter 5, &quot;The Political Battles,&quot; covers the Presidential election of 1864 in which Lincoln defeated former general McClellan. The book ends with several full-page photographs of Lincoln showing how he changed over the course of the war. &quot;Twenty Million Yankees&quot; has the virtue of covering in more depth topics that are normally not part of the record when reading about the great battles of the Civil War. Consequently, a lot of what you read in here will be new information, even for the serious Civil War buff."},{"Title":"The Inflammation Cure","review":"Dr. Meggs is professor and chief of the division of toxicology at the Brody School of Medicine at East Carolina University in Greenville, North Carolina. He has been instrumental in the development of the theory of neurogenic switching, which is related to the study of inflammation. As such, he is definitely an expert on the subject of this book.Dr. Meggs states that a growing body of medical research points to the process of inflammation in the body as a primary contributor to (if not an actual cause of) the major killer diseases: heart disease, stroke, diabetes and cancer (in particular, colon, stomach, esophageal, lung, breast and ovarian cancer). Inflammation is also implicated in chronic fatigue, fibromyalgia, obesity and sleep disorders. It plays a major part in the bodily degeneration of aging, especially Alzheimer's and osteoporosis, and it is strongly implicated in the progression of autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, asthma, dermatitis, lupus, and scleroderma.Dr. Meggs provides clear, easily understood explanations of what inflammation is, how we get it, and how to avoid it. He also offers an inflammation quiz to allow you to self-screen for inflammation. His writing (and that of his co-author Carol Svec, an award-winning health writer) is accessible throughout the book, and the flow from subject to subject is so smooth, it invites the reader to study every word. In addition, the book contains a detailed table of contents, an index, and 21 pages of references for those who wish to pursue this subject further.I found it extremely helpful that after making an extensive, well-documented case for the ravages of inflammation in the body, Dr. Meggs proceeded to list, in a non-overwhelming fashion, lifestyle changes that anyone can make which will lessen the personal health impact of inflammation. He also includes important information on non-prescription and prescription anti-inflammatory medications.I would strongly recommend this book to anyone interested in learning more about inflammation. It is written in such a straightforward fashion that the lay public will have no trouble understanding it, and the information in it is so crucial and up-to-date, many healthcare professionals could benefit from reading it as well.I was particularly interested in this book on a personal level, because within my immediate and extended family, all of the following diseases indicated by Dr. Meggs to be implicated in inflammation exist (and in some cases, abound): heart disease, stroke, diabetes, various cancers, chronic fatigue, fibromyalgia, obesity, sleep disorders, osteoporosis, rheumatoid arthritis, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, and dermatitis. I plan to immediately implement many of this book's practical suggestions and discuss with my doctor at my upcoming annual physical what it has taught me about inflammation."},{"Title":"The Inflammation Cure","review":"The Inflammation Cure by Meggs and Svec, and The Inflammation Syndrome by Challem, both appeared in 2003 and both discuss the role of inflammation in the major diseases of our time, and the things that one can do to limit the risk of diseases related to inflammation. Both books are easy to read. Which to choose? According to the prestigious Library Journal, \\"While Jack Challem's The Inflammation Syndrome covers similar ground [to the Inflammation Cure], his approach leans toward the faddish and sensationalist, while Meggs takes a more levelheaded approach, weaving the latest research on various diseases into a broad picture.\\" The thing I most prefer about Meggs' book is that it takes a comprehensive approach (including diet) to the things that affect inflammation, rather than spending the whole book just discussing the role of diet as is done in Challem's book. Challem is a health reporter who writes and publishes The Nutrition Reporter newsletter; it is natural that he would stress diet and its consequences. But diseases are caused and controlled by much more than our diet. Meggs is a practicing physician who has a great deal of clinical experience with all aspects of inflammation, and who has woven many real-life cases into the book as illustrations. So, which book should you buy? I have little doubt that you will find The Inflammation Cure by Meggs and Svec more informative and much more useful as a reference on your shelf."},{"Title":"The Inflammation Cure","review":"This is a good book. It's an easy read and the author clearly understands the connection between inflammation and lifestyle choices. His advice is interesting and helpful.I agree with the reviewer below; this book is broad-based and really doesn't address specific inflammatory issues. The point of the book is to recognize how pervasive inflammation is among various health issues and to learn to make beneficial changes in our lives.My one criticism is: the author states, &quot;There is no need to take supplements for vitamins B6 or B12&quot;. I absolutely disagree. As many vegetarians (especially vegans) have learned the hard way, sometimes vitamin B12 supplements are essential. The author recommends a vegetarian diet, yet apparently doesn't recognize that one of the most common risks of a vegetarian diet is insufficient vitamin B12 intake. The author is potentially putting people at risk by not recognizing the possible need for vitamin B12 supplements (totally supported by research on vegetarians and vegetarian diets)."},{"Title":"The Inflammation Cure","review":"This book is &quot;all right&quot;...but I much prefer &quot;The Inflammation Syndrome, by Jack Challem, which came out first. Both books cover much the same material, but I think The Inflammation Syndrome does a better job of connecting the dots between dietary imbalances (caused by eating too many junk foods) and inflammation. It also recommends a very clear anti-inflammation diet plan, with easy to follow guidelines and recipes, as well as a number of well-documented anti-inflammatory supplements, such as the omega-3 fish oils, gamma-linolenic acid, antioxidant vitamins, and B vitamins. In addition to describing the big picture of inflammation, The Inflammation Syndrome also focuses on the top 20 or so inflammatory diseases, including heart disease, cancer, and arthritis, as well as inflammatory athletic injuries -- each with specific recommendations for eating habits and supplements. At the very least, you might consider getting both books and synthesizing their advice to suit your needs."},{"Title":"The Inflammation Cure","review":"&quot;The Inflammation Cure&quot;, by Dr. William Meggs, M.D., Ph.D., Professor and Chief of Toxicology at the School of Medicine of East Carolina University, with Carol Svec, an award-winning health writer. Dr. Meggs is a physician and has conducted research related to the study of inflammation.As a medical doctor, I had long understood that inflammation is a key component of the body's defense system - when appropriately activated, inflammation is meant to protect and repair the body after insult or injury. Too little inflammation can lower the immune function and result in disease, whereas too much inflammation can result in and contribute to certain specific diseases.But in this fascinating, easy-to-understand synthesis of cutting-edge medical research, the authors show how recent medical science is revealing an &quot;inflammation connection&quot; in many of today's common diseases and conditions - cardiovascular disease, autoimmune diseases, asthma, obesity, allergies, fatigue, and others, even aging. They pull together the latest research across medical specialties, and in lay language, explain the functions of inflammation, its scientific basis, and the problems that can arise when there is uncontrolled (severe or long-term) inflammation. Selected scientific references are provided for each chapter.Most important, the authors give simple lifestyle steps aimed at helping to lower the inflammation risk, reduce hidden sources of inappropriate inflammation, and help the body keep inflammation and anti-inflammation in proper balance. There are informative and lively chapters on dietary measures, lifestyle, mind-body connection, medications and medical tests.I strongly recommend this timely, easy-to-read book for both lay and medically-trained readers. I believe it is a valuable resource for understanding recent scientific information on inflammation, and in helping make healthy, positive choices."},{"Title":"The Inflammation Cure","review":"This is a clear and well-written discourse on what inflammation is, and the role it plays in a multitude of problems;it is convincing and sincere. It does not, however, offer much in the way of guidelines for how to address the problem, beyond offering some basic \\"good health\\" prinicples. In all fairness, there may be no clear \\"cure\\" for the condition -- but if so, the title is a tad misleading."},{"Title":"The Inflammation Cure","review":"The book has inflammation as its central focus, and Dr. Meggs convincingly describes inflammation related connections amongst an amazingly broad spectrum of conditions, diseases, nutrients, attitudes, and other factors. As a non-medical lay person, my impression in reading the book was that the title is a bit inadequate. While the straightforward, lucid style in which facts and ideas are presented makes the book's inflammation related advice accessable in a pragmatic fashion, Meggs seems to cover so much territory with his recommendations that this work could almost be understood as a broad guidebook for living a healthy and happy life in general, albeit with inflammation as the book's raison d'etre.Certainly I have wondered how and why various drugs functioned in my body, and I have learned a great deal on that subject here. The same can be said about foods, moods, and the air we breathe; it all gets clearly mentioned. Looking at the back portion of the book reveals the depth of research that went into the writing of it, and Dr. Meggs has not speculated with much of what he says - it's all backed up with facts that can be verified.I enjoyed the book (it's a fun and easy read) and I highly recommend it. I was left with the impression that I was reading solid medical advice, not romantic fantasy. Buy this book."},{"Title":"The Inflammation Cure","review":"This is not a good book. People who are seeking real insight into their problems will be let down. We generally know that inflammation is involved in diseases. What is needed is a broader framework for making sense out the multiple inflammation phenomena which we observe in disease states. This book fails to bring together the massive amount of scientific and medical data which is currnetly available about toxicology infection and oncology. The title of the book offered such a possible explanation. It failed to deliver. There is no cure in this book.A much better book is \\"Oxygen; the molecule that made the world\\" by Nick Lane which is a thought provoking book full of useful insights. The \\"inflammation cure\\" makes Outragious Generalisations without any reference.(readers are asked to make the connections themselves to references at the back of the book). In many instances dietary recomendations clash with knowledgable opinion and strike me as misleading and wrong. Another book with much better credenitials is called \\"The Cholesterol Myths\\" by Uffe Ravnskov."},{"Title":"The Inflammation Cure","review":"I know very well what inflammation is and how it adversely affects one's life.

I'm on Zyrtec 365 days a year to eliminate allergies. But even this does not lessen my joint inflammation at the young age of 43, thin, active and non-smoking.I anxiously purchased this book to see what potential cures the author had to offer sufferers. None. Don't smoke, don't overeat, eliminition diets, exercise... all the usual stuff found in every health pamphlet. Nothing new here at all.

The book should be on the reference shelf of every policy maker and used as a basic book on government and political science. Her personal struggles are shared by many women and men who face the devastating effects of inequality and the abuse of liberty by others who seek the \\"four creatures of greed and power: fame, fortune, lust, and luxury\\".

The ideals that Ms, Gillman put forward are clear and honest, the steps needed to make women and men equal economically, most of which have happened, just not in the social and communal way she invisioned them, have as a testament to her brilliance come to pass and as each one did women and men have started to converge economically.I could not recommend this book more. Note this version is a photo copy of the original so does have the original layout and is very readable, the pages are not sized to fit the page very well but still better then some relayed out version I have seen."},{"Title":"Women and economics;: A study of the economic relation between men and women as a factor in social evolution,","review":"Charlotte Perkins Gilman (1860-1935) was a prominent American sociologist, novelist, writer of short stories, poetry, and nonfiction, lecturer for social reform, and utopian feminist; her most famous book isThe Yellow Wall-Paper, Herland, and Selected Writings (Penguin Classics).She wrote in the Preface to this 1898 book, \\"This book is written to offer a simple and natural explanation of one of the most common and most perplexing problems of human life... To show how some of the worst evils under which we suffer, evils long supposed to be inherent and ineradicable in our natures, are but the result of certain arbitrary conditions of our own adoption, and how, by removing those conditions, we may remove the evils resultant... To reach in especial the thinking women of to-day, and urge upon them a new sense, not only of their social responsibility as individuals, but of their measureless racial importance as makers of men.\\"Here are some additional quotations from the book:\\"Although not producers of wealth, women serve in the final processes of preparation and distribution. Their labor in the household has a genuine economic value.\\" (Pg. 13)\\"...whatever the economic value of the domestic industry of women is, they do not get it. The women who do the most work get the least money, and the women who have the most money do the least work.\\" (Pg. 14-15)\\"Because of the economic dependence of the human female on her mate, she is modified to sex to an excessive degree. This excessive modification she transmits to her children...\\" (Pg. 38-39)\\"Where young boys plan for what they will achieve and attain, young girls plan for whom they will achieve and attain.\\" (Pg. 86-87)\\"The mercenary marriage is a perfectly natural consequence of the economic dependence of women.\\" (Pg. 93)\\"The women's movement rests not alone on her larger personality, with its tingling sense of revolt against justice, but on the wide, deep sympathy of women for one another.\\" (Pg. 139)\\"There is no female mind. The brain is not an organ of sex. As well speak of a female liver.\\" (Pg. 149)\\"Simply to bear children is a personal matter---an animal function.

Thus it represents an disentangled view of the subject that benefits from an historical perspective. I also consider the presentation to be intermediate in that the principle concepts are communicated with text and the theory summarized. There are no comprehensive derivations in the book! It is also not a classic from the point of view that the author, Present, is an original developer of the theory. Rather, Present had to assimulate (and sometimes redevelop) the theory to support his work on moment transfer at the Columbia University SAM Laboratory during WWII. Present acknowledges that he draws heavily on Chapman and Enscog; Herzfeld; Hirschfeld, Curtiss, and Bird; and Kennard. I have come across many references to this book during my research on ion mobility spectrometry. For that reason, it is an invaluable resource to have on one's book shelf."},{"Title":"Secrets of the Vine for Little Ones","review":"Secrets of the Vine for Little Ones is a precious little book. We bought it for our daughter when she was five months old. Hey, it's never too early to start laying the foundation!The book is constructed of study board pages - they have held up very well to six months from our baby. The artwork is superb - every page seems captivating for our baby. The simplification of Wilkinson's \\"Secrets of the Vine\\" is masterfully accomplished - every line rhymes. The first page of text gives the reader the New King James Version of John 15:1-2, 5, 8, and 16.The thing I like best about this book is that every time I read it to my little girl I get a refresher of the Secrets of the Vine myself.

This book helped me to accomplish that.This book stressed how important it is that we stay connected with the creator and bear fruit in our lives for the glory of God. It lets us know that we have a purpose and mission-driven life to live. It spoke in practical terms with regard to John 15. The language used captured my daughter's attention and had her asking me to keeping reading. I have now purchased the devotional and will also look into The Prayer of Jabez for her.At the age of eight, she is so ready for more than bible stories at bed time and me fumbling through life explainations as best I can.

There was no one available to me to ask questions of. I would hate to think what would have happened if I hadn't read it. And for the record I leveraged my closing cost with the mortgage broker and the seller to come up with a zero down and zero out of pocket closing with an interest rate of 5.5% on a 15 year.

Bush : Portrait of a Compassionate Conservative","review":"Dr. Ide should be given credit for his very easy-to-understand writing style. However, if you're looking for a fair and balanced portrait of Bush, you won't find it here. I was disappointed that Dr. Ide was apparently unable to look past his political views. What a pity he should conduct what seems to be very expansive research but chooses to litter his writing with personal sentiments.

Bush : Portrait of a Compassionate Conservative","review":"This is a very well written book made up of short, well-researched, topic-based chapters. These chapters cover a broad range of public policy issues (environment, education, tax cuts, religious right), which Mr. Bush acted on during his short but turbulent career in Texas. For anyone stunned by recent ultra-conservative administration policies that seem at odds with Bush's 2000 campaign rhetoric, this source illuminates the historical origins of America's most recent resident of the White House. It may also suggest that the most dramatic policies are yet to come.

This is a satire, so Menen has some wonderful philosophy that I feel requires several readings of the book for a true understanding of his ideas and what he was trying to tell us. It is also very funny indeed.I read it the first time and it was a slow, dreamy book about good, honest people in a remote village. The second time, it became an important social satire with deeper meaning for me.One of my favorite books of all time and highly recommended; no matter what your reading preference, you should enjoy this one."},{"Title":"The Prevalence of Witches","review":"It is worth going to any effort to get a copy of this book.

(Illustrated History of Movies Through Posters, Volume 16) (Vol 16)","review":"There is surprisingly little overlap between this book's contentsand the contents of the previous (and sold out) SERIAL MOVIEPOSTERS. One reason is that this new book is based on anincredible collection assembled by Frank Gutierrez.What we have are posters from sound serials dating from about 1931 to about 1954, the end of the serial era.The best of the serial posters are reminiscent of the best pulp magazine covers from the 1920s to the 1950s, and oftenare rendered in somewhat the same style. My favorites in thepresent volume tend to use a subdued palette, such as5, for THE GALLOPING GHOST, which is a striking study ingrey, orange and red, or 28, for the orginal FLASH GORDON,chapter 4, which uses shades of grey, orange, and a few touchesof red. Also lovely is the poster for TIM TYLER'S LUCK, whichuses reds, flesh tones, olive grey and cream shades.As the 30s wear into the 40s the painted artwork becomes increasingly crudeand amateurish. An exception is 107,for BRENDA STARR, REPORTER. Artwork tends to become a framefor a tinted still from the film, and the frames get thinnerand thinner. Still, there are points of interest. The posterfor BRICK BRADFORD (112) is almost as wild as this wildest ofall movie serials.Serial posters are far rarer than movie posters in general, andthis is a very worthy compilation of images most of us havenever seen, and will never see any other way!"},{"Title":"The Practice of Chinese Medicine: The Treatment of Diseases with Acupuncture and Chinese Herbs, 1e","review":"This book is huge, even though it's only about 34 diseases. It's filled with case studies that easily transform into CA state board test questions.My study partner went through and pulled every one of these case studies out to memorize them. I found myself doing the same, since I disagreed with Giovanni's diagnosis about 25% of the time... I had to memorize his diagnosis anyway. In one case, he got no result, and consulted with a Chinese doctor, who diagnosed the patient the way I had when I firsted saw the signs and symptoms!What's really infuriating is when he uses a rationale to diagnose something one way in one place, but then doesn't consistently apply that in other cases.So, we are required to know Giovanni's opinions and diagnosis style even if they may be wrong. It would have been nice to see - in a reference book - a separation between mistaken treatments and ideal/accurate treatments.Also, there are short sections on western diagnosis in some diseases... but be careful, because biomedicine frequently revises its understandings. This is NOT your source for clinical biomedical info. It may be easy to understand, but may not be up to date or accurate.There is an interesting section on distal points and their target areas.As with Giovanni's book, the Foundations of Chinese Medicine, it's not always clear if his ideas come from classical CM or from his own mind. I'd caution the reader to balance their understanding with the works of Wiseman, Deadman, and Sionneau."},{"Title":"The Practice of Chinese Medicine: The Treatment of Diseases with Acupuncture and Chinese Herbs, 1e","review":"I initially dove into this book, very well laid out and attractive but don't be deceived it's not the be all of diagnosis despite it's mammoth number of pages.

His appendix pages on western differentiation are very welcomed, but are quite basic. Many people in TCM are not so interested in Western meds. but they are very important so thumbs up on the inclusion.It's not a bad book, but it's not so great as the Chinese texts I have in my library who give you the same info at a fraction of the cost, less room on your shelf and a lot less speculation.Thanks to Maciocia we have a solid intro to TCM, for that I think we are all indebted ... but his factory of TCM books are a bit much considering you can get the real info from the source in Chinese Textbooks with both Chinese and English in them.Yours,Hastings"},{"Title":"The Practice of Chinese Medicine: The Treatment of Diseases with Acupuncture and Chinese Herbs, 1e","review":"This book blends, technically yet accesibly, Oriental and Western Medicine.

They might reassure children that no monsters lurk in dark shadows beneath their bed, or that going to school for the first time can be scary but fun. But there's a really basic worry that children feel even if they may not always be able to vocalize it. It's the worry that one's parents no longer love them because they've been naughty or bad in some way. And if yesterday you had stopped me on the street, point blank, to ask me to name a picture book, just off the top of my head, that confronted this fear, I would've been up a tree. Maybe I would've babbled something about the end of \\"No, David\\" by David Shannon. No longer. Now when someone asks me to name such a book, I have \\"Don't Forget I Love You\\" to back me up. A sweet tale of a mother-son relationship that is ever-so briefly tested and survives intact.From the moment Billy wakes up in the morning the day gets off to a slow start. In Billy's own words, \\"Rabbit's being naughty\\". Billy's stuffed rabbit is the cause of a lot of delay as both boy and mother get ready for the day. When Billy's supposed to wash his hands, Rabbit won't \\"eat\\" his egg. When Billy's supposed to get dressed for the day, Rabbit has a stomach ache (according to Billy). And when Billy's supposed to brush his teeth, Rabbit's buttons are all askew. By the time Billy drops both Rabbit and his lunchbox in the mud on the way to school (in the midst of blustery rainy weather), Mama's had enough. So Billy gets dropped off to school, late, without Rabbit (forgotten in Mama's bag) and without Mama remembering to say she loves him. This is nearly enough to set Billy off into a truly miserable tantrum. Fortunately, all is resolved in the end when Mama returns apologetic and gives Billy both his beloved stuffed toy and his much needed, \\"I love you\\"There's not much of a plot to this remarkably simple story. And the book could've stood a little more clarification when it comes to whether or not this is actually a book about childhood fears of not being loved. Still, it's awfully sweet. Author Miriam Moss has a whole heaping helpful of books of this nature already under her belt as it is. Fortunately, she's been paired here with illustrator Anna Currey. And while the pictures aren't exactly going to blow you away, they fit the text nicely. Parents looking for books that support single mother homes might also appreciate Mama's position in this tale. Not only must she get her kid out the door and herself off to work but she must battle raging winds, an unruly stuffed pet, and a laconic tot to boot.This is not the first, second, or even third title that I'd recommend if someone were to ask for a good picture book. But when it comes to the specific fears it confronts, should someone want a book of this nature, \\"Don't Forget I Love You\\" would be a first choice. A truly nice tale in a neat little package."},{"Title":"Don't Forget I Love You","review":"i love this book, and the concept is great, a good read, but short enough that i can read as a short bedtime story... great for every child"},{"Title":"Don't Forget I Love You","review":"This is a heartwarming book, lovely story line and beautifully illustrated.

It deserves the honor. A Dangerous Friend is utterly original in its portrait of the early years of American intervention in Vietnam. Ward Just perfectly captures the innocence, avarice, hubris, ignorance, and paranoia of the time. He liberates a genre that is, perhaps, exhausted, and at the very least, well-defined. A war novel without the physical violence (although there's plenty of the emotional kind), A Dangerous Friend captures the fine (sometimes irrelevent) distinctions between military and civilian, colonist and native, hero and villain. Simply, powerfully superb."},{"Title":"A Dangerous Friend","review":"A subtle, perfectly nuanced depiction of the early days of the Vietnam war. The tension of combat lingers through the book, but the bombings and firefights are largely kept to the background. What Ward Just creates is an authentic story of the civilians, soldiers and bureaucrats who laid the foundation for a war that would eventually become a catastrophic failure for the United States.Just does an excellent job of showing the complexity of Vietnam; the bureaucrats vs the military, the new American imperialists vs the old French colonialists, nation-building vs firebombing.The book centers around Sydney Parade, a sociologist sent to Vietnam to work with a somewhat mysterious government agency, the Llewellyn group, which is charged with collecting information and winning the hearts and minds of the Vietnamese though community projects. He is tasked with winning the cooperation of a French rubber planter and his American wife, relics of French colonialism who are living &quot;between the lines&quot; in an effort to avoid choosing sides and therefore becoming involved.&quot;We went to Vietnam because we wanted to.&quot; Explains the narrator. &quot;We were not drafted. We were encouraged to volunteer and if our applications were denied, we applied again.&quot; Just captures the optimism, confusion, bureacracy, and overconfidence of America's early days in Vietnam, and we soon get a glimpse of the impending disillusionment.Just covered the Vietnam war as a correspondent, and his first-hand familiarity with the conflict shows. An excellent novel."},{"Title":"A Dangerous Friend","review":"&quot;A Dangerous Friend&quot; is the second best novel of its type, but that is high praise indeed, since it is only edged out by Graham Greene's &quot;The Quiet American.&quot; Just's prose is a joy to read. He was a first-rate journalist in his younger days, and it shows. His economy with words and syntax is a marvel. Not a word is wasted, not a sentence tortured. Beyond that, the story is gripping and poignant. Just, like Greene before him, re-creates Vietnam on the page in a way that makes it startlingly real. The characters not only fulfill their symbolic function but also engage the reader on a human level. Finally, this is the book that makes you really feel what America did in Vietnam, as the U.S. is clearly the &quot;Dangerous Friend&quot; of the title."},{"Title":"A Dangerous Friend","review":"The beauty of this novel is the understated way in which it is told.I'd been meaning to read this book since it first came out last year and finally sat down with it over the weekend ... and couldn't put it down. In just a spare 256 pages, Ward Just recreates the fallen splendor of colonial Vietnam at the start of the conflict and examines the opposing philosophies of those caught in the gathering maelstrom - the American government presence there to provide &quot;humanitarian&quot; aid and support the rapidly diminishing infrastructure and the expatriate colonials who have lived there for years in relative calm and peace who are unwilling to give up what they call home for the sake of political interventionists who, they believe, have little relevance on their lives.It's a delicate book but one that gives you pause to think. Ward Just is an verbal wizard at providing descriptions of climate and landscape. His characters are finely drawn and subtle (one might almost say understated) and the plot, while not particularly dramatic in the more traditional sense, evolves in such a way the reader knows something terrible is going to happen because the inevitability is there.In some ways, this book reminded me of the French film done several years ago, &quot;Indochine&quot;, with Catherine Deneuve. While the film is set in the 30's and chronicles the start of the Communist conflict in Vietnam, it portrays a similar crisis of conscience between the old established colonial point of view and the rapidly changing tides of modern history."},{"Title":"A Dangerous Friend","review":"One of the exciting things about reading --and I guess this applies to many cultural endeavors, is discovering a new author --as I did when I recently read Ward Just's latest book \\"Forgetfulness\\" a book that I enjoyed very much. As a result of that experience I next read \\"A Dangerous Friend\\" and was even more impressed with Just's writing style and ability to engage the reader in a most compelling way. This book reminded me somewhat of \\"The Quiet American\\" by Graham Greene and several other books (one by a writer named Tyler that had a title like \\"The Saigon House\\" and \\"Rumors of War\\" by Philip Caputo. In short, I would totally recommend this book and now look forward to reading other earlier books by this author that are available."},{"Title":"A Dangerous Friend","review":"Just's book is beautifully written and organized. You know what happens to the principle characters within the initial pages, while the rest of the book is dedicated to telling us why those people we've just met are important. Sydney Parade, with the best of all intentions, inadvertently causes a horrible chain of events, making him the title character, the &quot;dangerous friend.&quot; Comparisons must be made to Greene's &quot;The Quiet American,&quot; another book which focuses upon the innocence of a single character to illustrate the overall naivete of a nation's efforts. We Americans love to believe that simple optimism, confidence and determination will win the day. As Parade -- and America -- learned, there are several more factors involved."},{"Title":"A Dangerous Friend","review":"The characters in this little novel are types more than they are real people: the head of a quasi-governmental assistance agency; an idealistic American who comes to win the hearts and minds of the Vietnamese; an American who can't handle the freedoms and temptations of being away from home; an expatriate old-timer immersed in the country; and finally, and perhaps adding the most unusual touch, a plantation manager representing the shadowy presence of the French, who had long been in Vietnam, who would remain, and for whom America's war was just a brief disruption to business as usual.Although all these carry with them their own attitudes and emotional baggage, they are seen too briefly and superficially to evoke emotion in the reader. Rather, the author uses them to give a general idea of the kind of people who propelled this early stage of America's involvement, when civilians were in control and programs were still gathering momentum.The can-do attitude that America somehow will save Vietnam wears away rapidly from the main protagonist, the idealistic American through whose narration most of the action is seen, and who becomes indeed &quot;a dangerous friend,&quot; not only to the French, but also ironically to the Vietnamese as well. His disillusionment is completed when, in a moment of betrayal, his agency, in order to demonstrate America's power to save Vietnam, must wreak destruction on it too.That a Frenchman would risk certain retribution in such a setting to help an American runs counter to most notions, but author Ward Just, with his experience, must be assumed to know whereof he speaks. This is not a story of the armed conflict most readers associate with Vietnam, but a look at America's early, and even then awkward and misguided, intervention in a complex situation which it little understood and for which it was ill prepared. As such, this work is an interesting footnote to the literature on America's presence in Vietnam."},{"Title":"A Dangerous Friend","review":"What a terrific writer Ward Just is. I have read all his books, and this is one of the very best. Even though I have disagreed with him over the years about the rightness of our country's cause in Vietnam, I enjoy his writing. The previous reviews focus on the subject of this book. I'd like to put in a good word for the quality of this book as fiction -- good plot, prose, characters and themes. It is great and if you don't know Mr. Just I hope you will buy this one, read it and enjoy it, and that it will lead you to his other works -- especially The Translator."},{"Title":"A Dangerous Friend","review":"read an author who clearly is writing for readers and not with an eye cocked toward Hollywood. At one point before an important meeting among the main characters, Just goes into pages of description of the location of the meeting, the neighborhood, the house, the landscaping. None of it wasted on this reader, all important and contributing to the sense of what would be said in this meeting. Most writers never learned this lesson. I also think this novel has as much to say to us about Vietnam as it does about the mindsets of those charged with winning (or not) the peace in Iraq. We can't change our thinking to adjust for the context.I thought it interesting to begin the story with an unnamed narrator who simply starts the ball rolling on this story. I find it effective but I haven't figured out why. Ward Just is like a very good restaurant off the beaten track in a place known for tourist attractions. The locals visit often but the tourists never quite seem to find it."},{"Title":"A Dangerous Friend","review":"I rate this as one of the better novels I've read. It presents an interesting look at civilian/government involvement in Vietnam. Tension, intrigue, good and bad guys and lessons to be learned can all be found in this book.A well constructed story presented by a gifted author elevates this book to literature class. Just has an elegant, simple way of writing that I found quite appealing. If you have any interest in the range of America's involvement in Vietnam or simply would enjoy a well written book and a good story, I'd recommend you give this book a look."},{"Title":"A Dangerous Friend","review":"I liked this book and liked seeing the civilian side of the war revealed. What a crock these people must have been about in the early days of the war. As an Army helicopter pilot, we viewed their efforts and flew them around on their missions to improve this country. Watching their seriousness and intrigue was amusing and quizical at best. We flew a lot of single ship missions in support of MACV and USAID; thank God our seriousness was about flying the Huey.Read further about our side of the war with OUTLAWS IN VIETNAM; my book on flying UH-1D's out of Vinh Long in the Delta. Ward Just's book shows a very interesting story of what it must have been like to be French as this American involvement unfolds."},{"Title":"A Dangerous Friend","review":"I got two things from this novel; That the author likes A) France, and B) Anonymity. The narrator never emerges, but chronicles the activities of the protagonist beautifully. And that's the crux of the problem. Greene's (IMHO much better) novel, The Quiet American, did not allow for neutrality or pacivity on the part of the characters, or the reader. Just's novel allows for a certain level of detatchment that does not fit. This novel never surfaces any issues in any way that makes the reader question what they'd have done differently. And this detatchment is far too safe for the subject matter."},{"Title":"A Dangerous Friend","review":"I loved this book! Ward Just's writing is, as usual, some of the best around (the first page is one of the most beautiful pieces of prose I've ever read), and his topic couldn't be more timely: the slow but inextricable involvement of the U.S. in Vietnam, as seen through the eyes of a quasi-civilian, who has come to the country in 1965 as an idealistic &quot;nation builder.&quot; As he becomes more deeply involved in his mission, he realizes that the country and its people are more complex than they first seemed - as is his purpose there. These realizations come late, and at some cost. The descriptions of Vietnam and its people are hypnotic and allegoric; I found myself enjoying the story on several levels. For every Ward Just fan, for anyone who wants to know what it was like to be an American in Vietnam in 1965, and for anyone who wants to know how our country's best intentions can turn into quagmires (a very timely question!) I highly recommend this novel."},{"Title":"A Dangerous Friend","review":"My husband and I both read this book and enjoyed it immensely, and we don't usually enjoy the same type of book. It is extremely well written in a sophisticated style. The history of the early days of intervention in Viet Nam give the reader a window into a culture that we know little about. This book is also reminiscent of our involvement in Iraq, insofar as Americans (including the government), keep trying to predict how a different culture will react, without taking into consideration that we HAVE NO IDEA what fuels their bahvior or whether it is even possible to \\"change\\" it more to our liking. Consequently, we keep getting it wrong."},{"Title":"A Dangerous Friend","review":"Comparisons of Ward Just's &quot;Dangerous Friend&quot; with Graham Greene's &quot;Quiet American&quot; are inevitable, not just because of context and setting, but because of the gauzy style in which the lyrics of both stories are told. But there are important differences. Greene evokes a tropical melancholy, a vague portent of things to come. Ward Just picks up about where Greene leaves off and leads us slowly into the vortex of senseless American arrogance that came to typify our war in Vietnam. It's mostly a gentle journey with a solar plexus punch at the end. Just's insight is unerring, crystal clear, and his language is a model of simple eloquence. &quot;A Dangerous Friend&quot; reminds us vividly of much we would like to forget."},{"Title":"A Dangerous Friend","review":"As a Vietnam Vet, avid reader on the subject of Vietnam and collector of same books, \\"A Dangerous Friend\\" is in my five star category (top).

A stunning book."},{"Title":"A Dangerous Friend","review":"The Vietnamese gardeners stand quietly in the American civilian compound and wait for a leaf to fall from a tree. When one does fall a gardener picks it up and disposes of it. Sydney Parade is sitting in a meeting of American nation builders, and watches the slow leaf dance of the gardeners. His wife told him that if he went to Vietnam she would divorce him. Sydney was idealistic. He went to Vietnam anyway. This is a slow moving yet engrossing tale that struggles through the Vietnamese heat.Sydney really wants to make a difference, but finds that ideals don't get you very far. The Vietnamese don't care about his dreams, and the Americans don't much care either. When Sydney reaches out to help someone he suffers betrayal. Everyone, Vietnamese, civilians, and the army all have their own self interests. Wars aren't about nation building. That's a lesson we learn here, and it is a lesson that we are still having a hard time learning today.There is no glory in this novel, but it is a fascinating, unusual book about how men try to muddle through, yet don't quite make it to the prize. Highly recommended"},{"Title":"A Dangerous Friend","review":"There were some interesting aspects to this book, most especially the decision by the author to focus on the early days of the Vietnam War--a topic not discussed nearly enough. That being said, I nonetheless felt that the characters and storyline were underdeveloped. He could have gone so much deeper with this. I never felt I fully understood the characters, that is the deeper complexities undoubtedly harbored being in such a unique situation. In fact, I could not believe it when I realized I had only 50 pages left to read. It seemed like the story was just beginning to develop."},{"Title":"A Dangerous Friend","review":"The reader (at least this reader) is left amazed, ashamed, angry and very moved.

This is one title for the permanent collection, but it doesn't bear too much thinking about."},{"Title":"A Dangerous Friend","review":"Only The Triumph and the Glory affected me as profoundly as A Dangerous Friend. I was very moved by it, it is a terrific novel, one that you would do well to read."},{"Title":"Nature and Man's Fate","review":"This is a great book if you like Garrett Hardin and the way he thinks. It begins with a brief history of Darwin and the contemporary reactions to his theory of evolution. It is followed by a lengthy summary of what evolution is (according to scientific standards in 1959), comparing Darwinian evolution to Lamarckian evolution and he explains extensively why Lamarck was wrong. Hardin then introduces Mendel and genetics while simultaneously acknowledging that genetic research was still in its infancy at the time. Hardin thoroughly covers the topic of Eugenics towards the end of the book and explains why it is wrong headed thinking (most of the time). He examines positive and negative eugenics and examines each in depth. Clearly, Hardin favors population control measures yet, doesn't out an out condone the practice. This is a good book even though it is outdated; it is worth it just to get a flavor of Hardin's thought processes at work and also as a lead in to,Living within Limits: Ecology, Economics, and Population Taboos, which I highly recommend (5 stars)."},{"Title":"Nature and Man's Fate","review":"I recommend this book for a few different good reasons; other reviewers have noted some of these. Hardin's comments about the Soviet imposition of dialectical materialism upon biology in general and genetics in particular I found very interesting. For over 30 years I've wanted to revisit this subject and Hardin made it clear in a few brief pages.Finding a metaphysical explanation for the development of life within the borders of a materialist, secularist state strikes me as one of the great ironies of all time. I thought Marxist ideology insists upon concrete conditions and a ruthless criticism of everything under the Sun?And to kill biological scientists for explaining the evolutionary process through natural selection over against a kind of Lamarckism in Marxist Biology is barbaric, to say the least.More, Harden shows how attacks on natural selection were \\"provoked by a man who, it is all to clear . . . was a charlatan, an uneducated opportunist named Tyofim Lysenko.\\" That this one man under the banner of Stalin's form of socialism could destroy decades of valuable genetic research, taking the Soviet Union back at least a century, reminds me of threats to our own scientific research. We need look no farther then setbacks in stem-cell research; Reagan's denial of an HIV pandemic for several years, and now a 13th century scholasticism hoisted upon biology classes by demands for \\"equal time\\" between creationism and natural selection in biology classes.Will humanity ever learn to criticize science and not stifle science?Hardin's reference to the practice of squashing academic debate among biologist when it came to evolution by natural selection should be discussed often in polite and not so polite circles. These issues echo today in our time and society as more dogma threatens academic freedom and research. Hardin points to Man's Fate by recalling our history of denial and mystification of fact. Yes, read and know this book by taking notes and talking about it with friends and enemies.eddie evanseddie@eddieevans.com"},{"Title":"Nature and Man's Fate","review":"I could not put this book down. What an interesting time Darwin lived in. Hardin reveals the most fascinating details about Darwin and his times. Most bizarre is the part about Lysenko, the crackpot Russian pseudo-scientist who set Russian agriculture back decades and caused the deaths (and murders) of so many people.I saw that this book is listed as a \\"mass-market paperback\\" published in 1961, and I was amazed that back then there were masses of Americans who could read such a fine, literary and scientific work. Every statement is documented, making this a solid book of history and science, suitable for a high-school textbook. Even a fundamentalist church could use it to understand how Darwin developed and tested his hypotheses, even before people knew about DNA and genes."},{"Title":"Discovering Algebra: An Investigative Approach (Discovering Mathematics)","review":"This is an easy textbook to recommend because it made me feel excited about learning math. I studied first year Algebra a long time ago, but sometimes, like when I see a textbook such as this one, I wish I could re-live the first experience all over again and this time do it right. If I had the chance to do that then this is the book I would want to have in my hands.There are a lot of algebra textbooks out there. A lot of them seem to be stuck back in the 1980's or worse. It's not just using color graphics such as is done in the Discovering Algebra book, but using color graphics well. It's not just building learning around a project, but designing a project around which to learn. I think anyone can come up with a project, but designing projects to get the maximum learning out of each project is what I think the authors of this textbook accomplished.This is the textbook I would like to see translated and adopted for use in Israeli schools. It is exciting to read through and I think it would take away one of the key barriers to learning math for many students; that is that they don't see how any of what they learn in class relates to life outside of the math classroom. With this book I think they could."},{"Title":"Discovering Algebra: An Investigative Approach (Discovering Mathematics)","review":"As the sole math teacher in a small school that adopted the \\"Discovering\\" textbooks (Algebra 1, Geometry & Algebra 2), I have a lot of experience with the entire curriculum. The authors have good intentions and their aim was to create an effective textbook that focuses on Discovery learning. The Common Core Standards mandate mathematics to be taught this way. The problem with these textbooks is they focus too much on the means and not enough on the end.Most lessons are structured around an \\"investigation\\" where the students complete an activity ultimately leading them to a new conjecture, formula, or theorem. Next, one or two difficult examples in the form of a word problem is explained to illustrate the new concept. Finally, a challenging problem follows. My biggest issue is the textbook does not explicitly state the new content to be learned. If students are absent, they cannot stay caught up in class by reading the textbook unless they complete the investigation. The examples in the book are too difficult for students to comprehend without doing easier problems first, which do not exist. The textbook also emphasizes the use of calculators and frequently asks questions in terms of calculator lingo which detracts from actual learning occurring.The discovering series does its best to get students interested and excited about math, but it ultimately leaves them confused and frustrated. The textbooks do not prepare students for standardized tests or college math. Look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Discovering Algebra: An Investigative Approach (Discovering Mathematics)","review":"The book doesn't necessarily explain in depth the why's of algebra; however, it does break it down into very small and simple steps with many examples to help your understanding.

Wonderful for learning and implenting in a classroom for students!"},{"Title":"Discovering Algebra: An Investigative Approach (Discovering Mathematics)","review":"I had to use this book when I taught a large class of high school Algebra students.

That is the trend for learning/teaching nowadays. In fact, this book teaches math concepts like every other math book, it just has little activities to reinforce the concepts. I wasn't that impressed by the activities, either.What I want and can't find is a math book of discovery learning activities that help students uncover the ideas by connecting previous knowledge in a new way. I also want a book that provides meaningful, real-world applications to the concepts learned. This book isn't it."},{"Title":"Discovering Algebra: An Investigative Approach (Discovering Mathematics)","review":"I strive to instill a love of learning in my students.

But an argument erupted, and Sharon Barker left Carleton, who slept it off before he left for home. But a Deputy DA was murdered that night, and the police are looking for those who were at that motel! This may affect his wife, his social position, and his job. So Carleton wants Donald Lam to return and pretend he was there that night, since Carleton would have in-law trouble if he went to the police. This red-herring act could be dangerous, but money and the promise of future business wins in the end. Deputy DA Fisher had been prosecuting a murder case, and the police investigation was red-hot. So the meeting occurs, but the detectives recognize Donald Lam, and the security officer knows it wasn't Lam that night. Another plan that goes awry due to an overlooked detail?Donald Lam soon finds out that the police were watching his act, and knew everything except who hired him. Keeping the client's name secret is now a very hot potato (Chapter 6)! Lam returns to the motel room to try to identify the previous occupants (Chapter 8). But more complications and problems arise to advance the plot, and bring in other suspects. Chapter 14 tells what its like to spend the night in a drunk tank. The continuing investigation leads to the solution of Deputy DA Fisher's death, and conviction in the murder case. Cool & Lam keep their license and the monies.Erle Stanley Gardner escaped the formula of the Perry Mason series here. This novel is rawer and grittier, but unlike some short stories of Hammett. The fame and wealth of \\"The Saturday Evening Post\\" required a certain style in the Perry Mason stories.

It will open the young readers mind to new thoughts, expanding their imagination and vocabulary. The only two reasons I didn't give the book all five stars was because; the summary in the front of the book gives the story away (not the fault of the author), and I felt Jess made peace with the sadness too soon. Not that I wanted him to suffer longer, I just didn't get the feeling of him going through the process in the normal way. He did go through; denial, anger, grief, and acceptance.

Then on Lesley's birthday, Jesse gave her a puppy, Lesley named the puppy Prince Terrain (or P.T.).I liked the book because it was a mix. It was a thriller, mystery, and adventure book. I like the book because some of it is funny, like the time when Brenda lost her Twinkie to a boy and screamed \\"TWINKIE!!!\\", and some of its scary when Lesley talked about giants and at school it seems like three kids is the giants.The theme of this book is \\"friends are the best thing to have\\".

Even at eleven, I found it a great read and a powerful story. A young boy becomes infatuated with a girl despite the fact that she seems to outshine him at the one thing he holds dear...running. Despite this, they become friends and build their own secret kingdom on the other side of a creek and name it Terabithia. Sound corny? Yes, definitely, but it's still a great book and a very good one to introduce childrem to the concept of coping with death which they all will have to experience sooner or later.I just recently in the last few weeks discovered that a movie adaptation is coming out and I'm very excited about it. The only thing i know is that Robim Williams son from the movie \\"RV\\" is playing Jesse."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"Bridge to Terabathia is a story of friendship, integrity, and a everlasting memory. Jesse is a fifth grade boy who does not get along well with his family, is quite a loner, and at the same time wanting to become the fastest runner in fifth grade. When a new girl came to his community named Leslie, they were first hostile to each other but soon became the best friends as they discover that they have many things in common. They began to play in the woods and carved out the imaginery kingdom of Terabathia, where they reign as kings and queens. But when a tragedy struck Leslie, Jesse realized that one does not know what a true friendship is until it's gone. As a result a bridge is being built where Leslie's memory lies to give Jesse a reminder of what he once had.Simple yet beautiful, this book brings back the memories of that innocent stage of life called the childhood. Depicting the nature of friendship and an endless imagination. Ms. Patterson wrote this book based on a true thing experienced by her son. Overall, this was a fantastic book and a great read for people between the age of 10-13."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"After Jesse has spent his entire summer practicing to become the fastest runner in the fifth grade, he expects to win the race. However, to Jesse's surprise, he loses the race to a girl! The girl, Leslie, pays no attention to the fact that she has beaten every fifth grade boy. Then, Jesse and Leslie become the best of friends. The two of them create a fantasy kingdom, Terabithia. This fantasy kingdom is far away from all of their troubles. While Jesse and Leslie are in their fanatsy land, they read stories, share their secrets, and deepen their friendship.

Jesse Aarons, the main character, lives in a small town near Washington D.C. One day, he met Leslie Baker, his new next-door neighbor.

I loved this book because it had a great moral about friendship. It made me think a lot and inspired me to write my own book. Bridge To Terabithia is for people age nine and up due to some bad language. I hope you will read it and love it too."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"Bridge to Terabithia is the beloved classic by Katherine Patterson.

He realizes how much Leslie has opened the world to him. He realizes what a true friend he had in Leslie.This is a good book written for teenagers, but is good reading for any one. This book teaches the reader to look beyond what is right in front of them and encourages the use of imagination."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"This wasn't the best book I've ever read...but it did make me cry.Bridge to Terabithia is a nice book, despite some of the reviews.

In 5th grade I had to read this book for a lit study, and boy that was enough. The book's plot is so idiotic, and NOT SAD just stupid. I can't tell you the plot though, because that will give away the ending, but I can't do that. This book will also never have the word isn't in it just the word ain't. I know it's good to have good voice in the story, but it over uses it. It would be different if it was in 1st person, but is in third, and they all talk like hillbillies. If the story took place in a swamp in Louisiana that would be different, but it doesn't, plus it's in the 1970's when the English was more developed. Please do me a favor, and don't read it.

Why has it endured, why have teachers been assigning it since I was a little kid? There are SO many better written books about friendship and loss, or whatever the \\"lesson\\" is supposed to be here. I got to the end of the book and said \\"that's IT?\\" You know what it reminded me of was that movie with Macauley Culkin, \\"My Girl\\" ... he and Anna Chlumsky have this budding friendship and then, before they've even had a chance to delve into the relationship, he's dead. I expected more from that movie, and much more from this book."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"I bought this book for my nine year old son to read before the movie comes out in theaters and have some warnings for parents interested in preserving and protecting their young child's innocence. Although the two main characters, Jess and Leslie, are in the 5th grade, much of the language and some of the scenes are not, in my opinion, appropriate for children under 12 years old. I am glad I read the book before handing it to my nine year old son to read for himself. We are friends of Narnia and easily caught the allusions to that magical land; but while C.S. Lewis uses \\"language\\" judiciously and, therefore, unoffensive to the younger reader, Paterson freely sprinkles these words much too excessively for the younger reader. Also, there are many scenes that, while exist unfortunately in our real world, are left too bare and stark for children whose innoncence is still intact such as the chapter dealing with Christmas. I decided to read the book to my son editting objectional words and scenes. I am glad I did. My son was able to enjoy the magical story of Terebithia and to experience the book's main theme of friendship without having a layer of his childhood stripped."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"Dear Reader, my 6th grade class and I had to read this book.

Also I felt the book didn't have a good plot summary.If you are looking for a great book to read, I wouldn't recommend this book.I didn't like the book because I didn't like the country type speech that was used through out the book. Another reason I didn't enjoy it was, it was a story of tragedy in people's lives, and with all the real tragedy in the world today I would have rather read something non fiction. I felt the characters didn't connect with me. I thought this book was a huge waste of my time. Although one reason I may not have enjoyed this book was it was under me.

The 2 main characters are Jessie and Leslie.The problem is Leslie wants to be bestfriends with Jessie but he does'nt like her because she can out run her but all out of nowhere they are the greatest friends.\\\\The rising action is Jessie and leslie become teh greatest friends.The Climax is actually depressing but different Jessie drowns. But shes a great swimmer so how that is we will never know.The falling action is jessie finally realizes he loved jessie and now shes left him.The resolution is Jessie relizes Leslies not coming back and he cant go on with out loving something so he gets a dog to love.So this book is a basic love tale where the person doesnt relize love at first site intil there dead.

Together they create a hideaway called Terabithia. Then one day when Jess was away, something tragic happens to Leslie. This book, a realistic fiction book, is great for people who like sad endings and realistic fiction books. The author, Katherine Paterson, was born in China. She was educated in both China and the United States. Katherine Paterson spent four years in Japan, but she now lives in Tacoma Park, Maryland. One reason why readers like this book is because it had a dog in it. A really good scene is when Jess gives Prince Terrain to Leslie for a Christmas present. Another reason why readers like this book is because of how creative Leslie was in creating Terabithia."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"Jess has his heart set on being the fastest runner in 5th grade. He practiced all during the summer and every morning before school. He thinks nobody can defeat him, but not only is he defeated, a girl beats him. It happens to be the girl who just moved into the house next door to him. This young girl's name is Leslie Burke. Jess and Leslie start off on the wrong foot, but as time goes on, the two become best friends. Their friendship grows stronger throughout everything they do. Racing each other, sticking up for each other when they are being ridiculed by their schoolmates, and everything else they encounter together. Leslie and Jess set an example that any best friends should follow. Their love for each other becomes so great; the two become inseparable as time passes. Their imaginations grow wild, and they invent a magical kingdom that only they know about. This magical kingdom in the woods called Terabithia provides Leslie and Jess a place to come here for as long as time allows them to, but in this case, their time in Teribithia ends sooner than expected. Jess is soon left to rule the magical kingdom alone.I feel this book shows how important friendship is and how much you can learn from other people as long as you have an open mind. Jess and Leslie are extremely different people with totally different attitudes about everything. They work through their differences and build a bond that only death could separate. As I was reading this book, it made me realize how important it is to have someone with whom you can share so much of your life. Having a best friend is something that you cannot buy, but friendship is something everyone needs and is much more important than.This book was challenged at the sixth grade reading level. The book includes profanity, including \\"Oh Lord\\" and \\"Lord\\" used as expletives, and the book also contains \\"references to witchcraft.\\" The book is said to set bad examples and give students negative views of life. It was challenged 9 times by 9 different schools and areas. The book was banned in 1986.Although this book was banned, I feel that the significance of the book still remains. Meaningful lessons can be learned from reading this book. After reading this book I realized the importance of having someone in your life that you can rely on. Jess and Leslie had just that."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"I read this book when I was 11 years old, and 25 years later it still haunts me. I make this statement both as a recommendation and a warning. It is very well written. The author brings you into the main character's mind and emotional world so completely, that when tragedy strikes, you feel it like a punch in the gut.As an adult, I recognize the power of the writing, but I remember the child-me feeling completely blindsided and betrayed by the author. I cried the whole way through the end of the book, and was depressed for days afterward. I hated this book with a passion, and part of me still does. I honestly couldn't decide whether I wanted to give it one star or five. In the end, I decided to reward the skill of the author, but to knock of a star for the little hole in my soul that has never quite healed from the trauma of having read this book. ;-) (O.K. Maybe, I'm being just a little melodramatic.)IN CONCLUSION: Before you rush out and get this book, consider your reader carefully. This is a great book for those who enjoy a tearjerker. I DO NOT, however, recommend it as a class assignment, or for a kid you don't know very well. Some kids just can't handle the emotional impact of it. I know, because I was one of those kids."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"Bridge to Terabithiaby Katherine PatersonReview by Katie Brothers and Megan WorleyKatherine Paterson, the author of The Bridge to Terabithia made us feel as if we were actually in Lovettsville, Virginia.

She continues to keep the reader hooked by using her vivid imagination and ability with words. We felt as if we were apart of the characters life. For example, Jess is described as a sensitive, all American boy who loves to run and wear \\"no shoes because the bottoms of his feet were by now as tough as worn out sneakers.\\"The Bridge to Terabithia is filled with exciting characters. We loved how the author uses animated words to describe Jess and Leslie. These two ambitious fifth grade students at Lark Creek Elementary School love using their imaginations to take them on adventures. There times together created memories that will never cease.Predicting what the kids were going to do next really kept us intrigued. We couldn't put the book down! Our imaginations were running away with us as we were anticipating was what to come.This book carries the story line of two young adventurous children who meet and become the best of friends. They are the support system for each other with school and with life. This book profiles what the life of young children was like in the 1970's. It takes you through full school days and events through the eyes of the children in this time. Outside of school the imaginations of Jess and Leslie continue to run wild! They cross a creek most every day and transform into the king and queen of \\"Terabithia\\", an imaginary city created in their exploring minds.This book shows the importance of childhood friendships and how they impact the life of the children in this book. Also, the book addresses the impact school has on the social lives of children. Jess and Leslie gained trust in one another that they did not have with anyone else.The town of Lovettsville is much like the town we live in here, Cullowhee. It is a small, rural, and very tight knit community where everyone knows everyone, outsiders are awkwardly welcomed, and people rely on each other as a way of life. This is another aspect of the book that kept us intrigued the entire time.We loved the writing style of the book! It really captivated our interests and imaginations. When it wasn't the characters voices talking in the story, we imagined a \\"Mr. Rogers\\" kind of guy reading the story to us. The dialect of the book was very realistic and comforting to us as the readers.The genre of this book is adventure for children and young adults. The story line can be suitable for children, but the use of language throughout the book would prove to be a good study for young adults. This is a Newberry Medal Award Winning Book that can be described as brilliant, and a true classic in children's literature.To truly understand our perspective of the book and how wonderful it is you have to read it for yourself!"},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"There are some pretty heavy subject matters within this beautiful work of fiction. Yet, they are subjects that need to be dealt with, and what better conversation starter than a response to something you've read together? This is the story of Jess and Leslie, two outcasts of their 5th grade class (although I found both to be interesting). They become neighbors and fast friends, and make up an imaginary kingdom deep in the forest, called Terabithia. There, they have the confidence and control which eludes them in the real world. But an amazing thing happens in that they begin to see the world in a different, more favorable light. They find that people are not who they seem, and this makes them better and more compassionate individuals. The first time I read this, I was absolutely stunned by the tragedy that takes place. Even still, after several times rereading it, it tears at my emotions. I commend Katherine Paterson for bravely venturing into such sensitive matters, ones that will make children better capable of dealing head-on with their own emotions."}]`),H={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:C},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:x,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(s=>setTimeout(s,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},M={class:"card-container"},L=["disabled"],B={key:0},E={key:1};function W(s,e,n,c,r,i){const m=g("PoemCard");return t(),a("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=o("div",{class:"top-banner"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),o("div",M,[(t(!0),a(y,null,w(i.visiblePoems,(h,f)=>(t(),b(m,{key:f,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),a("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(t(),a("span",E,"Loading...")):(t(),a("span",B,"See more"))],8,L)):p("",!0)])}const j=u(H,[["render",W],["__scopeId","data-v-29c74d8c"]]),O=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"drive/48.md","filePath":"drive/48.md"}'),q={name:"drive/48.md"},P=Object.assign(q,{setup(s){return(e,n)=>(t(),a("div",null,[v(j)]))}});export{O as __pageData,P as default};
