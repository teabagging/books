Then, I'm not kidding you, they burn all the extra gifts. There is no mention of gratitude, giving to others - anything! There is obviously no mention of the true meaning of Christmas - God forbid! But even in a purely secular rendition of Christmas, the lack of anything meaningful, heart warming or kind was appalling. And the way the girl speaks is incomprehensible.

Dictionary-like without being dry, the guide is an alphabetical list of people, places, and events in Greco-Roman mythology. Some entries are short, referring the reader to a longer one. The long entries are summaries of important epics or stories.While the format of the book makes it clearly a reference book instead of an exploration of mythology, this makes it a convenient and quick tool for students or teachers studying Classics, or simply for anyone unfamiliar with Classical Mythology. As seen by the numerous references to more modern authors and poets such as Voltaire and Dante, mythological references are everywhere in literature, and those who may not have been steeped in this tradition in class would find this book extremely helpful. Unlike other mythology books, such as Edith Hamilton's &quot;Mythology&quot; or D'Aulaires' &quot;Book of Greek Myths,&quot; this book is truly a &quot;short guide&quot; that does not require the reader to look up a person in the index and then read all the way through a story to find out about them. Already alphabetical, Kirkwood's book gives a short description of the person, and anyone who wishes to read more can go to the story referenced. This book is a great guide for readers with any level of interest in mythology."},{"Title":"A short guide to classical mythology (Rinehart English pamphlets)","review":"This little tiny book, barely over a hundred pages long, is the one single book out of all reference books on classical mythology that I'd recommend over any and all others. I began using it when I got to college in 1959, and I used it heavily through the next ten or fifteen years, when I began teaching literature courses and had to learn the classical texts as I went along, often hardly a step ahead of the students. I use it still, from time to time, but back then, Kirkwood saw me through difficult times, again and again and again. The entries in his book are clear and concise, and the cross-referencing is superb. From this little book, a person can gradually--especially if using it in conjunction with the actual reading of ancient texts--become easily and naturally familiar with the great and seemingly complicated myths underlying Homer, Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides. Kirkwood makes all clear, all accessible, and all useful, and he does it without the least bit of unnecessary simplifying or taking of shortcuts. You get the real stuff and in the real way, all in barely a hundred pages.

Twenty-seven books of the Bible and the Ten Commandments are listed in the index, along with the poems of major poets compared to Dylan's work. The Sins, Virtues, and Heavenly Graces used to list the Contents of the book are classical concepts that are not explicit subjects like adultery, death, friendship, war, and race, hardships which are so popular in modern psychological studies. On Charity, most people don't get interested until the topic is Love, and that concluding chapter starts with a song called \`Watered-Down Love' from the album \`Shot of Love' which was \\"unlovingly shot down by the reviewers.\\" (p. 468). I know what song he means, but I'm not sure I can figure out what happened when it was recorded:\`The studio out-take (which is the performance that was released but with a final verse that was edited out when released) ends its assurances not with the rising delight felt in the confidence that love that's pure \\"Never needs to be proud, loud, or restlessly yearning\\", but with a further verse that would have demeaned the song into the self-serving, the self-pitying, and the self-praising:Love that's pure is not what you teach meI've got to go where it can reach meI've got to flee toward patience and meeknessYou miscalculate me, mistake my kindness for weakness\`I don't mean that we would have had to take this as autobiographical; not that it would . . . Whereas the song as released, and as blessedly released from its final verse, does not have even once any of the words \\"I\\", \\"me\\", or \\"my\\" . . .' (p. 469).\\"The studio out-take\\" is four lines longer than the song we already knew. The personal is assumed to be stupid for hundreds of fans who might be unfamiliar with the psychological standards which allow Ricks as critic to proclaim, \\"For the move out from the large love that is charity to a love-affair about which one of the parties now feels uncharitable, this move is in itself a false move artistically.\\" (p. 469). Such theological judgments are likely to be unfamiliar to those people who are most familiar with Dylan's songs, limiting the appeal of this book to a narrow segment of the educated reading public. Intellectual fanatics with a philosophical interest in religious issues might marvel at how well a modern professor can combine promoting religious interests in a pop culture without offending any readers except those who expected a book about Bob Dylan to be easy to understand.The Index of Dylan's Songs and Writings for this book is on pages 508-511, but it only lists a few pages for most songs. Which Album a Song is on (pp. 512-517) is inclined to list just the first time a song appeared. The exception which proves the rule is \\"Positively 4th Street: Greatest Hits [1], Biograph, and The Essential Bob Dylan.\\" That list does not include \\"Man of Peace,\\" a song mentioned on pages 158 and 449, (where the first line is quoted without mentioning the song) according to the Index of Songs, but which is also quoted much earlier, \\"You know Satan sometimes comes as a man of peace.\\" (p. 43). It is from the album Infidels, but according to the words I have, the final line of each verse starts with:You know, sometimes Satan . . .You know that sometimes Satan . . .I hear that sometimes Satan comes as a man of peace.People who have learned the song well enough to sing it without having to look for the words of any of the eight verses might wonder how tired an author would have to be to write the words down in the wrong order when writing about songs by someone who is as popular as Bob Dylan, but this kind of thing is an occupational hazard for professors who write books and philosophers who wonder if the error was beneficial in any way. Knowing Satan might be an approach that could draw on a lot more of our culture than just Dylan's songs, and the great song \\"Sympathy for the Devil\\" by the Rolling Stones could be a wonderful start for that project.Christopher Ricks is extremely knowledgeable about critics, and those readers who are looking for new literary angles ought to gain a lot from his insight into the Dylan interviews that are also discussed in this work. In a song with an \`I -- You' framework, any mention of \`he' is likely to apply more to the critic than to the singer or an audience, particularly in the lines:With the one who tries to hideWhat he don't know to begin with (p. 66).This makes more sense in the song it's in, and in the section about envy:I know the reasonThat you talk behind my backI used to be among the crowdYou're in withDo you take me for such a foolTo think I'd make contactWith the one who tries to hideWhat he don't know to begin with (p. 66).This is \`Positively 4th Street.' The most positive thing this book has to say is about rhymes. In another song, \\"And the rhyme in this refrain is beautifully metaphorical, because it's a rhyme of the word \`end' with the word \`again':Oh, Mama, can this really be the endTo be stuck inside of MobileWith the Memphis Blues again? (p. 31)\\"\`End' and \`again' are metaphorically a rhyme because every rhyme is both an endness and an againness.\\" (p. 32)."},{"Title":"Dylan's Visions of Sin","review":"The books that will be written about Bob Dylan! About when he released _Empire Burlesque_ critics such as Christopher Ricks were prepared to give him equal status with Shakespeare. Now many albums later who is Dylan's compeer? -- the sky is the limit. _Dylan's Visions of Sin_, setting Dylan in the tradition of English poetry (Keats, Wordsworth, Eliot), as well as adverting to other cultural influences on Dylan, bravely begins to give him the status he deserves. Using the seven deadly sins, the four cardinal virtues and the three heavenly graces, Ricks demonstrates how Dylan (from the beginning of his career the consummate artist) resists the sins while abiding by the virtues and the graces. His close-in reading of Dylan's songs results in much exuberant word-play, and, although other reviewers seem united in their condemnation of Ricks's style in this regard, the critical acrobatics which Ricks performs are requisite, I feel, to conveying a full sense of Dylan's meaning. Ricks is flush with good authority for his judgements and observations and continually astounds with his adducing of literary and musical allusions which are illuminating and apt. For an example of his brilliance as a critic see his criticism of &#34;The Lonesome Death of Hattie Carroll&#34;, where he explains via Wordsworth Dylan's use of feminine endings.I saw Ricks lecture on Dylan in 1985 and people merely laughed at his quoting of poets such as Shelley and Marvell to illustrate Dylan's technique. Such is the power of popular culture. Ricks is brave in sticking to his guns: _Dylan's Visions of Sin_ is a worthwhile work on a figure who fully deserves serious attention."},{"Title":"Dylan's Visions of Sin","review":"Bob Dylan really should get a Nobel Prize for literature.

His continuing popularity is a testament both to the timelessness of his art, as well as to his uncanny ability to remake himself and his music, year after year. Dubbed the \\"poet laureate of rock-n-roll,\\" Dylan's work has received more serious academic attention than any other folk/folk-rock musician out there, and for very good reason. Now comes Christopher Ricks, a well-known poetry scholar, to compare Dylan to some of the greatest poets ever: Wordsworth, Donne, Tennyson. The result is fascinating. I find it hard to believe that anyone could read this book and walk away from it without a renewed admiration for Bob Dylan and his music.The book's structure has Ricks analyzing Dylan's songs according to the seven deadly sins, the four virtues and the three graces. This somewhat arbitrary classification feels sometimes strained, as Ricks struggles to pigeon-hole songs into one category or another. But far more fascinating than this academic chore is Ricks' exploration of the deep poetic and Biblical roots of some of Dylan's most popular tunes. With obvious love for his subject (and subject matter), Ricks shows, time and again, how Dylan makes use of the Great Poets in fashioning his unique and often haunted lyrics. Revealed is a musician who is not only a poet in his own right, but a well-read and thoughtful writer, who somehow accomplished the impossible: fashioning intelligent, thought-provoking music for a world obsessed with vapid vocals and meaningless \\"pop\\" standards.Two minor flaws with the book. First: Ricks neglects a number of Bob's best songs--songs with fantastic lyrics and rhyme, songs that would seem to fit into his sin/virtue/grace framework perfectly (i.e., \\"Visions of Johanna,\\" \\"Where Are You Tonight?\\", \\"Foot of Pride,\\" \\"Black Diamond Bay,\\" \\"Jokerman\\"). Of course, with over 500 songs to choose from, I suppose it's inevitable that some will be neglected. Still...Second: Ricks is a fan of wordplay. Every page of the book is pregnant with puns, to the point where it becomes annoying. Too often, one is distracted from Dylan's brilliance by Ricks' literary showboating. Clearly a follower of the Vladimir Nabokov School of Alliterative Prose, Ricks struggles mightily for the appearance of cleverness, but his textual twists and turns frequently fall flat.All in all, however, a wonderful (and serious) analysis of our greatest poet/songwriter, by a well-respected scholar. May Ricks' book be a launching pad for further serious studies of Dylan's work."},{"Title":"Dylan's Visions of Sin","review":"You'll be a little jealous, of course, wishing you had the literary storehouse of information and insight that Christopher Ricks has at his disposal from which to gather literary parallels, borrowings, and coincidences. I have never been more impressed by ANY book of criticism written about a modern writer or musician. To be honest, I have not yet finished &quot;Dylan's Visions of Sin,&quot; but I couldn't wait to comment here after reading the detailed comparison of &quot;Not Dark Yet&quot; and Ode to a Nightingale (yes, KEATS' Ode to a Nightingale) on pages 359-374. Sound ridiculous? It won't after you've spent the first 350 pages getting to this tour de force reading of a deceptively simple song from Time Out of Mind. But not only is the close reading of these lyrics/poems (the distinction won't matter after awhile in the author's pleasant company) impressive, but this is also a very funny and very warm book. There's nothing cold or academic about it. And there's no psychobiography, or any biography at all. This is Bob Dylan stripped to his most essential gift, his words. It's an absolute joy to read and I recommend it unreservedly, even to those of you (or especially to those of you) who may have been put off by the singer's voice, or his associations with Christianity, Victoria's Secret, and the Traveling Wilburys. I'm finding myself pulling out all my old LPs, even the scratchy bootlegs in their plain white sleeves, and listening to them with brand new ears."},{"Title":"Dylan's Visions of Sin","review":"Christopher Ricks is very well known for taking Dylan seriously as a poet and this is the long awaited product of many years of reflection. The basic idea of dealing with Dylan's corpus in terms of sins, virtues and graces is imaginative and promises a well structured and coherent work. Ricks' approach is clever and almost obsessive in searching for hidden meanings. It is the sort of obsession that Dylan himself finds futile and at which he frequently gets angry in interviews. There is great emphasis upon word-play and word association, and a great deal of reference to what a particular line in a song reminds the writer of in a poet like Shelley or Wordsworth. His approach, while very like that of Gray's, is much more sophisticated, but nevertheless slightly irritating at times because it says more about the cleverness of the author than it does about the subject of the book. The interpretations are idiosyncratic and largely imaginery, but nevertheless executed with grace and charm. I found Dylan and Cohen: Poets of Rock and Roll very clear in its criticism of this type of approach, which I think the author of it calls the concordance approach to literary criticism. Boucher explains why you just don't ask of some songs what they mean, such as Losing my Religion by REM or Whiter Shade of Pale by Procul Harem, you just 'delight' in the images. Nevertheless Ricks' book is a must for Dylan fans and well worth reading."},{"Title":"Dylan's Visions of Sin","review":"As a die-hard Dylan fan, I tend to try and get my hands on new stuff as soon as it appears. As a lover of English lit. I thought this book would be right up my alley. And it is...sort of. The content is solid, an interesting take, even if I disagree with Prof. Ricks that the concept of sin is the best way to \\"get hold of the bundle\\" of Dylan's songs. The book is an interesting read nonetheless, although of course what we have here is Chris Ricks' vision of Dylan's vision of sin, and the seven deadly sin grid we have here, while interesting, reveals little of Dylan's vision of sin. The biggest qualm I have with the book is Ricks' language. As if to prove he knows all the songs, even though many seemingly appropriate ones are omitted, he frequently includes song titles in descriptive sentences about other songs. The language is all too frequently all too clever and obfuscates rather than illuminates the point being made. The book would be much more enjoyable were it written in a more straightforward manner. The good Dr. covers interesting territory with a wealth of background knowledge, especially revealing are the connections to Keats and Melville...yet you can open up to almost any page and cringe at the unnecessarily \\"clever\\" passages and excessive parenthetical asides (and no, I am not wearing Boots of Spanish Leather as I write this review).

That deeply perceptive study placed Dylan's work in the myth and paradox laden context of American folk and country and blues, especially its most obscure corners. This one looks at its literary context, noting echoes of Blake and Keats and the rest. And most of those echoes are really there.Better yet, it examines Dylan's entire body of work as poetry. And it does that out of the most worthwhile tradition of poetic criticism, the \\"close reading\\" of Helen Vendler and others. What close readings do is to take each poem entirely on its own internal terms, without getting bogged down in biography and gossip and the psychosocial picking-apart of presumed ideologies which constitutes the Higher Gossip of much of academe. It looks at the poem line by line, word by word, asks how the words and images connect to other words and images within the same work, why the poet made the choices (s)he made, and by what technical means the poem acheives its effects on the reader.That may sound dry, but it's the liveliest way of approaching a poem, because it assumes the poem is alive in its own right, and doesn't need extraneous issues dragged into it to bring it to life. In this spirit, Ricks examines songs from every stage of Dylan's career, always assuming the songwriter, consciously or by instinct, knew what he was doing.Ricks has a habit of free-associating on particular snippets from the songs, in pyrotechnic wordplay aimed at divining what Dylan's own associations may have or must have been. It's annoying, but it also seems to be inseparable from his method of taking a loose step back from the lyrics in order to find tight connections that really do lie in their heart.The results are worth that cost. The method foreordains that he will find genius in every piece he looks at, so that he seems to give the same weight to minor works like \\"If Not For You\\" and the whole Slow Train Coming period as he gives to the masterpieces. That's okay; much of the minor work deserved some of that rehabilitation. When it comes to the big stuff, his insights are deep and dead on. You'll never listen to \\"Lonesome Death of Hattie Carroll\\" again without being aware of how Bob used feminine half-rhymes to create its sense of sober understatement, nor fail to hear in \\"Lay Down Your Weary Tune\\" its yearning for humility as a refuge.After the songs themselves, Marcus, Chronicles Volume I, and Scorsese's \\"No Direction Home\\" are the core necessities for the Zimmerman collection. Ricks is a good bet for the next acquisition after those."},{"Title":"Dylan's Visions of Sin","review":"Christopher Ricks' enthusiam for Dylan and the English language mirrors Dylan's enthusiasm for his music. Other reviewers have complained about Ricks' punny style getting in the way of the reading. All it showed me was that he was having a good time writing about his subject. Reading the book brought me back to the Dylan songbook and I found myself wishing that Ricks had covered this song or that song along with the many ones he did analyze. If you don't know or don't care about a particular song, or find yourself getting bogged down, you can always skip the discussion of that one and start again somewhere else in the book. I found myself not agreeing with every one of his interpretations, but what the heck, isn't that what the interpretation of complex work is all about?

At others it is remarkably blind to the real tone of the songs - for example, in its abject failure to see that Most of the Time is a classic portrayal of 'I get along without you very well' attempts at self-delusion.Much too often the author is self-indulgent; and his obsession with [often self-focussed] punning is almost too irritating for words. For all Ricks' close-reading skills and his awesome knowledge of literature, the book frequently fails to convince in its connections. Where two writers both resort to common-usage terms or forms of words it surely need not mean the latter user is necessarily quoting, referring or alluding to the former. Ricks does not seem to acknowledge that ideas and phrases pass down through many hands. Latter-day useage is just as likely to reflect the 55th user as the original [if original use can ever be determined]. Ricks over-eggs the pudding. As Dylan correctly said of Greil Marcus, he 'over-intellectualises'.Above all, Rick's study is diminished by its clear lack of musical context. This is a shortcoming made all the more significant by the subject's immense skills in interpretation and phrasing in performance. Primarily, it is this absence of the music that makes the book a disappointment.If comparisons must be made, Ricks' effort does not match up to the work of Michael Gray or Paul Williams, both of whom consistently demonstrate a precise understanding of what Dylan's art form actually is: the writing and PERFORMING of wonderful songs.Phil TeeceWANNIASSAAustralia"},{"Title":"Dylan's Visions of Sin","review":"Do not get this book if you want to read about Bob Dylan the musician.DO get this book if you love ananlyzing literature and want to read literary criticism by one of the best, Christopher Ricks.

OK so \\"Sin\\" on the title page was attractive. So was the author's pedigree: he was the editor of the \\"Oxford Book of English Verse\\" a book I have owned since university and a professor at Oxford University. People steal my OBEV and I buy another. He has also written on some of my fave poets like T S Elliot, Keats, Tennyson, and A E Houseman. Why is he writing about Bob Dylan?Let's get past the canard that you like his songs but he can't sing, or you like his singing but his looks stink, or he isn't a poet, etc. ad nauseum. Bob Dylan is the single most influential singer/songwriter to hit this planet ever. He copied everyone before him and added to it his own genius. What kind of a genius steals from the Bible, Shakespeare, Milton and TS Elliot with impunity?Without Dylan there would be no Bruce Springsteen (a pale imitation), John Prine, Neil Young, no anybody who is doing what music is about today - relevant songs that the singer wrote himself. When I listen to his progeny it's painfully clear they think Dylan authorized guitar accompanied introspection. Most of their lyrics are mundane, prosaic, and forgettable.He has written 500 plus songs over 5 decades many of which define how we have felt along the way. If you want to see an artist in the middle of self-recreation, check out one of his concerts. It's like Picasso re-painting his paintings over and over.OK so what about the book? Ricks is a proponent of the \\"close reading\\" of poetry. How close? Very close - you will go on wonderful trips where he compares \\"Not Dark Yet\\" from \\"Time Out of Mind\\" to Keats' \\"Ode to a Nightingale\\" line for line. After you digest that he points out how Keats was inspired by Shakespeare's \\"Sonnet 73.\\" I would love to have his grasp of poetry and literature for he also brings in Becket and others. Word for word, line by line he draws out the beauty and significance of Dylan's work.The popular press and pundits are constantly judging Dylan: such is the lot of an artist. It reminds me of the people who critiqued Van Gogh (too much yellow and blue) or Gauguin (who are those naked natives). You can tell Ricks is impressed by Dylan during every period of his artistic career.Ricks makes you appreciate Dylan, even in his missteps, as the great artist he is.This book is not an easy read. I guarantee if you like poetry, are a poet, or songwriter it will make interest you. My songwriting has improved from a single read. I've got to read it, no study it song by song, instead of trying read to get to the end.There are other scholarly books on Bob Dylan: this one is my favourite for its emphasis of poetry and song structure independent of the music. Next: \\"Song and Dance Man\\" by Michael Gray."},{"Title":"Dylan's Visions of Sin","review":"The first and most important thing to know about this book is that it will interest only truly hard-core Bob Dylan fans. It is not enough to have most or all of his many albums. One must also have to know his lyrics well, own many bootlegs, have attended multiple shows, and perhaps most importantly, read several other Dylan books. Others should start with a more accessible, general book like Michael Gray's The Bob Dylan Encyclopedia.As for those who qualify, this book is certainly not for everyone but may well be nearly everything for someone. Dylan fans and critics have of course long attested that his lyrics constitute true poetry. An increasing number of literary critics and other highbrow judges have come to agree, but there are always snobs who refuse to admit the increasingly obvious. The many who are passionate about this have long desired a book about Dylan's lyrics by a mainstream literary critic to further \\"legitimize\\" Dylan the poet. Christopher Ricks - professor at Oxford and elsewhere; one of the leading critics of recent decades; author of books about the works of John Milton, John Keats, Alfred Tennyson, and other prestigious poets; and editor of the highly influential Oxford Book of English Verse among many other collections - had long seemed the ideal person to write it. His status aside, he has been a fan and expert for decades, working Dylan into numerous writings, speeches, interviews, etc. He soon promised a Dylan book, but it took about two decades to materialize.Dylan's Visions of Sin was thus met with high expectations when it finally came in 2003. Many were overjoyed, thinking it worth the wait, but more than a few were disappointed. It is easy to see why. Ricks' distinctive style and some of his content choices mean the book is likely to provoke varying and often extreme reactions. Even true hard-cores who wanted it for years might not find it to their taste, while others may think it the definitive Dylan critical work. It has many pros and cons, and while some may think the latter predominate, the former are numerous and significant enough that all serious fans should at least give the book a try.The book has many undeniable merits. The most obvious and perhaps biggest is Ricks' sheer critical skill. Extremely well-read and able to deftly command the most important critical tools, he is the kind of critic many writers dream of having analyze their work. His readings of various songs are fascinating for hard-cores; nearly always insightful and often simply revelatory, they add a different angle to long-held views and offer many new ones. I have studied Dylan's lyrics for years and read a great number of evaluations, but Ricks' fresh approach pointed out many things I had never seen or thought of and made me think of the songs in new ways. This is the highest praise any critic can get - the rare example that shows criticism can be truly worthwhile despite its often parasitic reputation. Even those who dislike Ricks' style must admit that some of the best critical Dylan writing is here. Ricks also avoids most of the pits into which so many Dylan critics fall. Most importantly, he is never preachy and refrains from forcing a pre-conceived ideological analysis onto Dylan's often ambiguous songs. He also knows to stay out of the often petty debates about which songs are best and Dylan's merits relative to other artists as well as squabbles over other minutia that account for such a sickeningly large percentage of Dylan writing. Finally, though Ricks uses many interview quotes and works in biography when relevant, he wisely refuses to participate in the obsession with biographical readings that Dylan has always decried. Those who have read a lot about Dylan will find all this very refreshing.The more subjective Ricks characteristics will determine how much one likes the book. Most Dylan writing comes from the music world, but Ricks is a literary critic, which inevitably affects his writing. To a large degree, this is undeniably to the good; rather than relying on the same tired Woody Guthrie and Robert Johnson comparisons, Ricks analyzes Dylan in an essentially literary context. He cites a large number of English poets from various centuries, comparing and contrasting with Dylan. (Ironically, some may think he does not go far enough, as he relies almost entirely on the \\"dead white men\\" who have traditionally made up English literature curricula but whom it is now not politically correct to idealize. Whatever one's view, it is certainly true that Dylan's literary influences, like his musical ones, range far beyond this. Even so, it is somewhat silly to criticize Ricks for not going far enough when few have gone as far.) Many analogies are very insightful, shedding new light by focusing on neglected areas, while some seem near-random. The latter may lead the cynical to think Ricks is simply showing off, but they are clearly worth it for the rest even if so. It was high time that Dylan was put in such company, which not only opens new critical doors but also goes some way toward raising his conventional critical status. Some may wish to thank Ricks for putting Dylan there, but the fact is that Dylan puts himself there, though Ricks should be credited for noticing what so many have somehow failed to see. Ricks' use of literary terminology and techniques also makes him stand out from most Dylan writers, again opening previously undertraveled paths and giving an air of seriousness sometimes lacking in Dylan criticism. On the other hand, that he often uses these terms with little or no explanation may alienate some.The literary angle may also disappoint for other reasons. Nearly all Dylan criticism inevitably focuses on lyrics, but Ricks is sometimes criticized for virtually ignoring the vocal, musical, and other aspects that are an integral part of Dylan. It should be emphasized that this is somewhat unfair; he often mentions the vocals and brings up music surprisingly often while giving weight to other performance aspects. Indeed, his frequent comments about the differences between reading the words on paper and hearing them sung are some of the best and most valuable parts of the book. That said, some may still think his focus too narrow.Similarly, the book's structure, while novel, ambitious, and interesting, will inevitably split readers. Dylan's canon is so large and varied that it is almost impossible to write about it meaningfully without some kind of overarching framework. Ricks' structure - categorizing and analyzing the songs according to the seven deadly sins, four cardinal virtues, and three heavenly graces - is very relevant, and its uniqueness leads to much freshness and insight, but inherent limitations keep the book from being all it could be. Anyone familiar with Dylan will immediately see how relevant the divisions are - and not just to gospel songs -, and Ricks makes a good case for his scheme. Yet it is undeniable that much of Dylan does not fit. Ricks is the first to see this, which means he leaves many songs unmentioned - more on this later. He also struggles to fill several categories, giving up on Greed almost entirely. Perhaps more disturbingly, some of his choices - e.g., \\"Only a Pawn in Their Game\\" under Anger - are highly questionable. Most sections begin with some general comments relating the heading to Dylan's work before preceding to specific songs. They make a good case for Ricks' perspective and provide some of the most interesting material. However, some of the song-specific entries commit the sin that Edgar Allan dubbed the \\"Procrustean bed\\" - stretching a pre-conceived idea to fit ambiguous material to the extent that it can easily become all but unrecognizable and even absurd. All schemes are of course limited, and nothing but a truly comprehensive, song-by-song approach could ever even hope to do full justice to a corpus like Dylan's, but this structure's limitations sometimes become so obvious that one wishes Ricks had not restricted himself so overtly. Using multiple schemes or being fully comprehensive would of course have made the book far longer - arguably beyond manageable length -, but some would say Dylan deserves no less. Even so, the book at its best shows the idea has much merit, and we can perhaps hope for another Ricks book that looks at Dylan more broadly. The forty-page \\"Songs, Poems, Rhymes\\" section preceding the scheme is also a sort of compensation. Perhaps the best part of the book, it shows just how good Ricks can be when writing about Dylan free of thematic shackles.Song selection is the most debatable issue and will probably be the biggest problem for many. The book is about five hundred pages and, though mentioning many songs in passing, has a close reading of only a few dozen out of Dylan's more than five hundred. Ricks of course does not claim all-inclusiveness, but it is easy to question his picks. Unavoidable subjective issues make it nearly impossible to satisfy all, but Ricks notably excludes most of Dylan's best and best known songs - most cuts on his Greatest Hits albums as well as fan favorites like \\"Desolation Row\\" and \\"Visions of Johanna.\\" This is one of he main reasons the book is not for casuals, but many hard-cores will also be disappointed. Some may even see his selection as a virtue; one can legitimately argue that some songs have been discussed so often and long that little else can be said. Ricks mentions this in regard to the few famous works that he tackles, but the ease with which he disproves it makes us wish he had used more.Relatedly, Ricks seems to go out of his proverbial way to pick obscure songs - e.g., \\"Clothes Line Saga\\" - and even further to choose some of Dylan's worst and least significant: \\"All the Tired Horses,\\" \\"Disease of Conceit,\\" etc. Again, some may find this refreshing, especially those who think such works are overlooked. I agree to a certain extent; Ricks shines much-needed light on some unfairly neglected songs, and much of his most revelatory comments come here. His analysis of \\"The Lonesome Death of Hattie Carroll,\\" one of Dylan's best songs in many ways but not one of his most famous, is near-legendary - a great example of what he can do in this area and perhaps the best critical writing on a single Dylan song. He never quite makes an obscure work seem great but comes tantalizingly close on \\"Do Right to Me Baby.\\" Indeed, much of the book's best writing, especially on overlooked songs, is for the much-derided gospel work. Ricks makes a great argument for these songs as major works, painstakingly detailing merits and clearing up many misconceptions. Perhaps most notably, content to take them on their own terms, he avoids the highly emotional, heavy-handed partisanship that almost always sinks discussion of these songs. Nearly all Dylan writers - including most of the best - could learn much from him here. This is all the more remarkable in that Ricks is an admitted atheist. He is also strong when writing about the much-maligned Under the Red Sky album. Even so, the strength and clarity with which he writes about lesser known works only makes us wish all the more that he tackled more famous ones. On the other side, Ricks also sometimes goes too far by any reasonable standard in trying to make great works out of songs that do not even pretend to greatness; his \\"Lay Lady Lay\\" entry is particularly overreaching. Unconventionality saves him from the dreaded pretentiousness charge, but one does with he had more restraint at times.Finally, we come to the most subjective element of all - Ricks' writing style, a curious and unique mix of literary formalism and a sort of high-brow silliness. Ricks delights in wordplay, puns, self-deprecating jokes, and plays on song titles and other Dylan minutia. Readers will probably find this either unexpectedly hilarious or tediously annoying and distracting. I was amused by quite a few of these instances, especially early on, but soon found them tiresome; well before book's end I wished they would cease, though I was still occasionally amused. Some may think they add liveliness and variety, and they certainly keep the book from being dry or overly academic, which might pacify some who know Ricks' pedigree. However, they also make the book longer than it had to be and arguably distract from the real purpose. Even most of those annoyed by this will be able to overlook it, but Ricks hammers so hard that it might even come close to ruining the book for a few readers.All serious fans should give this book a try because of its undeniably invaluable material, and those whose taste it suits may even be enthralled. A good number may not be able to finish - or may even throw the book away in disgust -, but its nature is such that all must find out for themselves."},{"Title":"America Over The Water: A Musical Journey With Alan Lomax","review":"I'd never heard of Shirley Collins before hearing her interviewed about this book on the radio - what a fabulous, fabulous discovery. I wish I'd known of her before. This book lives and breathes the tensions of the American South and is rich with its melodies and voices. Shirley Collins comes across as immensely likeable and lovely person and as fantastic as the music she writes about is, the thing that makes this glow is the personal story of her relationship with Alan Lomax."},{"Title":"America Over The Water: A Musical Journey With Alan Lomax","review":"This is an absolutely amazing must-read account of Shirley Collins' journey with Alan Lomax throughout the 1950s American South. Great description of the country and atmosphere by a foreign and interested comrade. This is by all accounts a not-to-miss story of the blues, folk, and country music that existed at the time. If you are interested in ANY of these genres in any way, shape, or form, or the way this trip inspired Shirley to re-examine the traditional music of her own homeland (southern England, namely Sussex), this book is an ABSOLUTE must-read!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I definitely read this whole book in two days. That is a testament to its greatness. Buy it NOW!"},{"Title":"America Over The Water: A Musical Journey With Alan Lomax","review":"Shirley Collins was one of the most important players in the English Folk Revival of the 1960s and 1970s, and her memoir provides some insight into the influence of American folk music upon her repertoire. However, as the introduction announces, her modesty severely limits her ability to flesh out the events of the year she spent in the company of Alan Lomax recording U.S. performers from the Georgia Sea Islands to the Ozarks. The sketchy nature of the narrative makes it more tantalizing than fulfilling. The editor, to fill out the book, provides a list of all the tracks Collins and Lomax recorded on their 1959 trip. This information is of very limited appeal, making it unclear whether the publishers intend the book to reach a general or a scholarly audience. With that reservation, what little Collins does have to say about her early life and her romance with Lomax is charming."},{"Title":"Dead Dog Cafe (Dead Dog Cafe Comedy Hour)","review":"I drove across Canada in the summer of '98. It was a great trip, but sometimes the driving got boring, I got sick of all the CDs I'd brought along, and there was no good music on the radio. However, CBC was everywhere, and generally kept me amused. Dead Dog Cafe Comedy Hour was the highlight. I thought it was hilarious, and I'm not even Canadian."},{"Title":"Dead Dog Cafe (Dead Dog Cafe Comedy Hour)","review":"You know them by now - Jasper Friendly Bear (who takes advantage of Tom's gullibility on 'Fireside Friendly Bear'), Gracie Heavy Hand (who makes a mean cup of coffee and somehow manages to get Tom to pay every time) and Tom King himself - the 'voice of reason'?.

In \\"Pursuit of Love\\", we are reintroduced to Danielle Olivia, the bratty supermodel sister of Tanya Kennedy from \\"Can't Deny Love.\\" Danielle has lived a selfish life in which she burned many bridges to get to the top of her suprmodel career. Along the way Danielle hurt her family, friends, and the love of her life Xavier. Danielle now has no career, no money and no where to go. She sets out on a journey of revelation and must face the people of her past who she once hurt and prove to them that she is not the same woman as she used to be, but it is no easy task considering that no one believes her.Xavier once loved Danielle but when one of her selfish stunts almost ruins his career, their relationship ends and he is set to ruin her career. With revenge on his mind, Xavier sets out to ruin the already rock bottom model and show her that he has the upper hand, but love finds him regretting his revenge and finding that revenge is not always so sweet.I liked this story because it showed Danielle in a different light compared to how she was in \\"Foundation of Love\\" and \\"Can't Deny Love.\\" I actually felt sorry for her and found myself angry that the people she hurt could not see that she had actually changed. The love between Danielle and Xavier was sweet. The only drawback, was that fans of Christine and Damian Ware from \\"Foundation of Love\\" and Tanya Kennedy and Brandon Ware from \\"Can't Deny Love\\" did not get to see these couples interact together. It was more centered around the women from the stories. Overall, I liked it."},{"Title":"Blush of Winter Moon","review":"I've read this book over and over, and I find something new each time. For readers unfamiliar with Haiku, this would be a wonderful beginning. But these Haiku poems are not just beginner material. The most experienced enthusiast will fully enjoy and treasure this work. Written in the traditional 5-7-5 form, the poems are sensitive and simple expressions of delight, sadness, love and beauty. Ms. Machmiller's work is complemented by a sprinkling of calligraphy and art throughout. If you've forgotten how beautiful the world can be, read this book. Also a great gift idea."},{"Title":"Blush of Winter Moon","review":"Patricia Machmiller is one of the foremost English-language writers of traditional-form haiku. Each of her poems contains a reference to a season and is written in three lines of 5, 7, and 5 syllables. Ms. Machmiller deftly uses the seasonal reference to underpin the mood of a poem. Each haiku in this beautifully produced book invites the reader to share the author's deeply felt experience. This book will bring joy to experienced and inexperienced haiku readers alike. A few examples from the book follow:just looking at ityou wouldn't guess there is adark side -- winter mooncloset of white clotheswhiter in summer moonlightwhiter than a vowlate night eatery --neon lights give the waiterthe look of winter"},{"Title":"Blush of Winter Moon","review":"Patricia Machmiller has a command of the traditional Haiku form that is both unusual and delightful. Her knowledge of its requiremnts makes each poem seasonally aware. Her words do more than describe the beauty and color of nature; they also join movement and imagination.

Don't wait - beg, borrow or steal a copy. It is an especially good read on these cold winter nights when you see a &quot;Blush of Winter Moon&quot;.blushing winter moonrevealed by floating cloudsawakens my interestThis haiku is not from the book.

From the aesthetics of the arrangement of the poems on the page with the versions of the Japanese of these simple, yet wonderful haiku as illustrations to the perfect images of nature in these haiku, even a non-Japanese speaking, non-expert haiku reader, as I am, can experience deep satisfaction and even joy from reading it. Some of the haiku made me teary eyed in fact. Her family life, humorous modern references, and her interior life are all here. I encourage you to try it as your first haiku book, as it was mine, and I encourage Patricia Machmiller to give us another subtle delicacy."},{"Title":"Blush of Winter Moon","review":"The first reading was great.

I know it sounds crazy but it yet again Patterson has produced another book that is very hard to put down. Cross as usual has many things going on. First is to stop the killings that are taking place in America. He is also have women problems, nothing out of the ordinary, in which he does not want another partner to meet their end at the hands of his rival, the Mastermind. Even though this book gets kind of vulgar in some spots it is hard to put it down and that is one theme that occurs throughout all of James Patterson's works."},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"J. Patterson will never cease to amaze me with his writing and chapter structure. Every book that I have read from him has been a page-turner, no matter if the story lacked or not. In this case, it was on the lacking side for an Alex Cross novel. It has been said that Patterson sailed into uncharted waters with 'Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas', and that he had no business doing so(they wrong, it is a very good book and heavily recommended by me), but it was this book where he strayed. I think the limited research into vampires and the 'Goth' sub-culture was a bad beginning to this book. The parts spent on the 'Vampire' aspect of the book really took away from the 'Mastermind' part of the storyline that really should have taken precedence. For such a big blow delivered at the end of Roses are Red, the follow up was very minimal and over shadowed by the bland vampire plot.Definitely not one of his best, but it is not a total loss. It does setup an interesting start to the next book, which after a short break from Patterson, I will hopefully enjoy."},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"Our hero Alex Cross never ceases to fascinate but the plots are wearing thin in this James Patterson book.

I can usually plow through his books in a weekend, and I have had this one on my nightstand for well over a month. I read only a few chapters at a clip. This means I am BORED!

In both I perservered and finished reading to the conclusion. However, in ROSES ARE RED, the epilogue salvaged the book. Not the case with VIOLETS ARE BLUE. Nothing can save it. There are two disconnected storylines in VIOLETS..., the hunt for vampire killers and the search, confrontation, and identification of Mastermind, Alex Cross' nemesis in several of Patterson's books. Neither storyline was very thrilling or suspenseful. Instead, hunting the vampires seemed like a series of killings described to gross the reader out with brutality, blood and guts. The interactions and final encounter with the Mastermind was also a disappointment. His identity was no surprise and the only question (and hope) is that he will remain dead.Patterson has shown ability in the past, as exemplified by THE MIDNIGHT CLUB. I only wish he would return to the quality of that work rather than the quantity of his recent work. As much as it feels uncomfortable I really cannot recommend VIOLETS ARE BLUE."},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"Would someone just shoot Alex Cross and put him out of our misery!?

I could not put it down, I read it in one day. It was great, one page after another. It keeps you wondering and on the edge of you seat. I did not know the Mastermind was after reading Roses are Red, so I was very edger to find out. I thought it was a crazy family or John Sampson(Alex's childhood friend), but the end proved me wrong. James Patterson is a great writer and his books are execllent. The bad thing is we have to wait to long to read another great book. And then some times he don't write a book about Alex. So its a while before we could read about him. He need to write a litter faster. Maybe write two books about Alex then write one about something else. This would keep his fans intersted and happy.

But I happened to scroll down a bit too far, and the first entry in the review section mentioned that the NY Times says James Patterson can't write. I found that interesting. This is the first James Patterson novel I've read. I realized that this author also wrote the novels on which the movies Kiss the Girls and Along Came a Spider were based. And I found the movies quite entertaining. I figured &quot;How bad can his books be?&quot;. Anyway, enough of my ramblings and onto my impressions of the book.I found the book to be an easy read. Several chapters are only 2-3 pages long. It starts off with one murder, then another one. And another. And, oh, did i mention there was another one? I'm actually not trying to be funny. He writes in a lot of deaths into this book to establish the cold-bloodedness of Michael and William who are vampires who love to kill. Yeah, you got that right... VAMPIRES. I had to do a double take when I saw what the plot was about to lead to (&quot;Is this an X-File?&quot;). I almost instantly thought I had made a mistake picking up the book. Thankfully, there's a brief introduction that vampirism itself is like an underground cult, nothing more supernatural than that. I just turned on my suspension of disbelief for a while. And that got me through the novel.Naturally, since this novel is meant to be the sequel to Roses Are Red the Mastermind plays a major role in this story. He taunts and annoys Alex Cross by calling him every day on his cell phone and at the most coincidential of times (when a death has occured). Later on in the novel, it's revealed that the Mastermind is someone Alex Cross knows (I wouldn't want to completely spoil it for you.)Throughout the novel, Alex thinks about his relationship with his past partners and his current one, Jamilla. He obviously doesn't have time to fool around with Jamilla, although there's a lot of flirting going on. There are times when I found myself saying &quot;Dammit, just get it on!&quot; But he never got it on.As to whether the reader should buy this novel or not. I would say you should PASS.FLAP rating:F:1.5 (He give it a try on the female victims.)L:3.5 (Simple safe dialogue that doesn't sound too fake, but doesn't emote any feelings.)A:3.0 (What can i say?

After reading \\"Roses are Red\\", I thought that James Patterson had some explaining to do regarding the identity of the Mastermind. Who cares if we already knew who the Mastermind was.(FYI: For those who did not read Roses are Rd, it's a good idea to read it first.) After reading Violets are Blue, the stroy behind the mastermind makes sense, if you stop and think about it. Just look back at the entire Alex Cross series and you will see subtitle hints that clue into the mind of the Mastermind. I am looking forward to what happens next."},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"I made the mistake of reading Violets are Blue before reading Roses are Red. But no matter. I could not put this book down from page one. That is a rarity for me. The only problem is that every other Patterson book I've read since pales in comparison.

This whole series is great! Keeps you hooked from start to finnish. I have not been disappointed yet with Paterson..."},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"Do NOT read this book if you haven't read his earlier books. Not only are there lots of confusing references to his earlier books, but also lots of spoilers. Much of this book did not make sense. Also the 'sidekick' Sampson is always wasted in these books. It's like he's just waiting around to help Cross or console him and doesn't have much to do. Big disappointment compared to Spenser and Hawk (I recommend Robert Parker novels BY FAR over these.)"},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"I think there are two themes in the reviews to this book.1. The book doesn't come up to those in the rest of the Alex Cross series. Its not a *bad* book, but its just a weak effort in the series.2. The two stories in the book -- the vampires plus the mastermind, just really don't mesh. I understand what Patterson is trying to do here, in a theme within a theme, but even given that the connection between the two should be a little more evident.I would add another piece that I thought the vampires piece wasn't a strong story in and of itself. It had the set-up to be a good story, but ultimately in my mind it just didn't all fully hang together for me logically. Without going too deeply into spoilers, I was left asking is it supernatural, or is it not?Finally while I bashed this a little in this review, its not a bad book. Its a decent page turning thriller and if you grab the book in a used book store or otherwise need something to occupy your time on a long flight, you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"I actually received this book by accident several months ago from a book club I am a member of. A few weeks ago,I decided to pick it up and try to read it- since I had never read anything by Mr. Patterson before. I am so glad I did. Now I want ALL of Mr. Patterson's books.

I don't have to read them in order if I don't want to. I did like this book, don't get me wrong, but the two cases in one sort of made me a little confused throughout the whole ordeal. With that said, I can still picture Morgan Freeman in every story!"},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"Of all the James Patterson books, this was my least favorite. It was written just fine but the vampire theme didn't appeal to me personally. I was reading it to see if Dr. Cross determined who the Mastermind was. It just took a while to get to that point. I'm not disappointed that I purchased it. It just wasn't one of my favorites."},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"The beginning of this book was boring. It was about vampire murders and did not have the intensity associated with James Patterson. The second part of the book was much better. Alex Cross finds out the identity of the mastermind which got the pages turning again."},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"I came upon JP a few months ago while looking for something to get me across the country on a plane. I started with Jack &amp; Jill, figuring that I had seen the first two on film. It was a fine place to begin, but were I to do it over, I would start at the beginning with Along Came a Spider. Both of the movie-books are sufficiently different from their Hollywood counterparts to merit a read, especially Spider, which reaffirmed the old cliche about books being better . . .In any event, Violets is entertaining. It isn't my favorite of the Cross novels, but it is still worth reading. I was confused by the bait and switch other reviewers mention with regard to the ending of Roses are Red, but that didn't detract from the novel too much. The vampire narrative is the primary plot line, and I didn't find it especially gruesome, certainly no more than any other crime novels, I've read.All in all, if you like JP and the Alex Cross series, keep going with this one. If you haven't read any oher novels in the series, this is not a good starting point. It stands alone, but you'll appreciate it more with the full history of the characters."},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"I have read all of the Alex Cross novels except Roses are Red -- and I guessed almost immediately the identity of the Mastermind. This book was not worthy of the talent of Mr. Patterson. As I was reading the book, I kept wondering if someone else had written this book, like Mr. Patterson's teenaged child (if he has a teenaged child). Don't waste your time on this book -- and let's keep our fingers crossed that the style that we loved in Along Came A Spider comes back in the next James Patterson novel"},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"I am of the opinion that James Patterson should let the Alex Cross series end with one more book. When I first started reading the cross novels, I could not put them down, one after the other I read and enjoyed. Now I look forward to the Cross novels as a quick read that requires little thinking.It might be that I am growing tired of the same old story lines with hardly anything new showing up in the personal life of Alex Cross. Or maybe I just am starting to find it really hard to believe that this detective would not ever make a mistake. I really enjoyed 1st to Die and I think that it was because it was Patterson's same style but new and refreshing characters.All in all this was a fair book. Easy to read and fast. If you like the Alex Cross series you will like this book. But I think that it is time for Dr. Cross to retire."},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"While I agree that is not the best of the Alex Cross series, I Dont feel it is &quot;the worst book of 2001!&quot; What makes this novel a difficult read for Cross fans is that we found out the identity of the Mastermind in &quot;Roses Are Red,&quot; so that suspense is missing in this novel. (Also, what happened to Geoffrey Shafer? He hasn't resurfaced yet?).However, Patterson's style is still engrossing, and I like the short chapters. It makes it easy to read when you have other things to do.The vampire killings are a little gory and the resolution is a little &quot;forced,&quot; but it still maintained my interest.I think Alex's continuous failures in love is getting too unbelievable. I like Alex, but he falls in love with any woman he meets. Jamilla Hughes seems like a nice woman, but her characterization isn't fully fleshed out, and doesn't seem to be the right person for Cross. They're too much alike.And what about Christine Johnson? Is that who he's falling in love with at the end of the book?The finale to this book doesn't give us a real exciting sequel possibility. He says he's going to resign and that he's fallen in love. So, if Patterson's planning on finishing the series, I would be sad, but if he feels it's necessary, I have certainly enjoyed the series! And his &quot;First to Die&quot; sequel is coming soon. Thank you, James, for giving us such pleasure in the Alex Cross series!"},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"A fantastic book! I completely disagree with many of the negative reviews of this book; this works because we DO know who The Mastermind is. It's a game of cat and mouse. If we were not aware of his identity then this tension would be lost.When I read the ending of Roses Are Red, I wondered how a sequel could possibly work. But Patterson has demonstrated the breadth of his storytelling ability once again. The sub plots are also engrossing. So, my advice is to read Roses Are Red first, including the last page. Then get set for a rollercoaster of torment in Violets Are Blue."},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"I love the new Alex Cross book, so much so that I've finished it in one sitting! The sheer number of chapters - 116 - did not put me off at all, because the chapters are short and to the point, and you can feel the excitement - almost like watching the movie.(I will not go into plot details, for obvious reasons!).The only slightly negative comment I might have is that the scene where Alex finally figures out who Mastermind is (and we've known since Roses are Red) a bit lukewarm and an anticlimax."},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"I enjoyed some of Patterson's early Alex Cross novels. He was never up there with Sandford or Connelly but they were fun and quick reads. At some point I lost interest. I saw this one at a library sale for 25 cents and thought, &quot;How could I go wrong for 25 cents?&quot; Turns out I got ripped off. This book is ludicrous. It seems thrown together and coming off reading one of Connelly's best, it seems like a high school fiction project. Vampires?! Oh my God!!!"},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"I have been a voracious fan of James Patterson ever since I read the back of a copy of 'Kiss The Girls' while waiting in line at the grocery store, and took a gamble and bought it out of sheer boredom. I have been thoroughly entertained (for the most part) with the exploits of Dectective Alex Cross over the past 6 years, my favorites being 'Kiss The Girls' & 'Jack & Jill'. I must admit that the Mastermind in 'Roses Are Red' was a great adversary for Alex, especially his partially hidden agenda and identity, which was totally revealed at the end of the book -- meaning, if you have already read that particular novel, you already KNOW virtually HALF of 'Violets Are Blue'. Sure, you may not know ALL of the events, but guessing the WHO will certainly NOT be a challenge whatsoever. This alone virtually ruined a good chunk of an otherwise ambitious novel.The other half is the bizarre and morbid underground world of Vampires in this country. Yes, you read that right: VAMPIRES. Not in the 'undead' sense with Bela Lugosi turning into a bat and flying off after his latest assault, but an honest-to-goodness REAL (and growing) world of people who drink blood and actually create fangs for themselves to complete the transformation into this dark persona. Weird? ABSOLUTELY. Is it real? Unfortunately, yes. Patterson takes this complex society of people and fabricates a story that certainly doesn't seem nearly as outrageous as you might think -- at first. Again, no secret as to the WHO is pulling off murder after grisly murder by draining the victims of their blood and leave them hanging, literally. The murders seem to be localized in California, but shortly after Alex becomes involved, they begin to spread to other parts, and suddenly a theory hits Alex as he conducts his investigation with the help of a beautiful California law enforcement official: could these murders have been caused not just by the same people, but by different GROUPS of these so-called Vampires who inhabit virtually ALL parts of the country...?? It's a VERY disturbing thought, one that Alex delves into entirely. Chapter-per-chapter, 'Violets Are Blue' has the largest body-count of ANY previous Alex Cross novel, and as we all know, Patterson piles on the chapters (usually a hundred or more per novel). Normally this wouldn't bother me, but add in the fact that I already know the identity of the Mastermind revealed at the very end of 'Rose Are Red', therefore the annoying phone calls that Alex keeps getting throughout his Vampire investigation are pretty much just that: ANNOYING. ALL of the mystery is GONE. All I wondered was when the next call would come, and how would the Mastermind attempt to bother Cross this time. I found this particular outing for Patterson my least favorite novel of his in the Alex Cross series thus far, and a big change from 'Roses Are Red' which although not the best in the series, I did however manage to finish in one single day (which I haven't done in YEARS). I can't say that I won't ever pick up another future Alex Cross novel, but this one just left me flat and ultimately unfulfilled."},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"James Patterson apparently knows when enough is enough. This seeming conclusion to the career of Alex Cross as we have come to know him keeps the reader glued to his or her chair as the crimes keep twisting and turning.Patterson's best accomplishment in this novel is making the reader want to know the conclusion and is it going to be what itseems most likely to be. This is an extremely difficult feat inasmuch as the true Alex Cross fan has already been told the identity of the Criminal genius known as the Mastermind at the conclusion of Roses Are Red.I found the various locales, new characters, and hideous crimes were more than ample to tantaliize the viewer on the road to analmost foregone conclusion.I hope the series is now put to rest at least for a while and James Patterson concentrates on winning our attention to the slick group of crime fighting gals he introduced us to in First To Die."},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"Violets are Blue was definately a great read. I completed the book in one day! Yes, one day! I could not put it down. James Patterson picks up Violets are Blue immediately after the ending of Roses are Red, unlike some of the other books that have time gaps between them. I found that very refreshing and it made it easier to keep the pace up.Alex Cross is still facing many ghosts in Violets are Blue, the Mastermind is still continuing to terrorize him on a daily basis. Although he remains in the background for the majority of the book, that battle comes full scale in a tremendous way.Alex Cross really meets his match when his good ole' pal Kyle Craig gets him involved in one of the toughest case he has ever had to deal with. Do you believe in Vampires? Well, Alex Cross gets his dose in the underworld while trying to figure out this case.There were some surprise characters that made a special appearance in the book, such as Kate McTiernan. I really enjoyed the book."},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"I've only read a handfull of James Patterson's books and have to say that none of them strike me as &quot;can't put them&quot; down reads. This one takes the cake though!!! What a waste of time...."},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"It's good, it's fun, you enjoy it, but it's never quite as good as you wish it were. James Patterson, as always, has come up with a good, fun mystery and lots of interesting characters. Although, hopefully the next time we see Alex Cross, he'll be on to something slightly less bizarre. I just wish Patterson could write a little better. Not that I require fine literature--I like a good beach read as much as the next person. But Patterson feels compelled to spell out what's happening right in front of our faces, and he's got major issues with putting every other sentence in italics (why hasn't his editor done something about that one?). So...like the vanilla, when I finsihed this book (like most of Patterson's) my reaction was &quot;yep, that was good,&quot; ...then promptly forgot about it and moved on to the next thing."},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"I will take people's word for it that James Patterson, once upon a time, wrote good books. I just might not have found them, because &quot;Violets Are Blue&quot; is the fourth lousy Patterson novel I've read, the others being &quot;See How They Run,&quot; &quot;When The Wind Blows&quot; and &quot;Roses Are Red.&quot; The premise is simple--people are being killed in slasher-flick fashion (described by Patterson with obvious enjoyment in the bloody details), and DC detective/psychologist Alex Cross is being tormented by the &quot;Mastermind&quot;, who's behind the crimes. In the meantime, he's attracted to the perky female San Francisco cop who's on the case and pining for the FBI agent who got killed in this book's prequel, &quot;Roses Are Red.&quot; Sure, the chapters are short, but except when it comes to people booting off Patterson goes into zero character detail, his plotting is highly predictible, and his dialogue is atrocious. Occasionally, he'll descend into hilarious namedropping to prove how &quot;hip&quot; he is (yeah, I can really envision a man in his late forties jamming to Nine Inch Nails, as Alex supposedly does). Judging by the inexplicable success of his books, one can only assume that James Patterson made the same deal with Lucifer that was also made by Danielle Steel and David Balducci. For absolute diehards only."},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"I believe that the majority of this book was cut &amp; pasted from his previous novels. It reads like an advertisement for all his prior works."},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"Been a fan for a long time, but I think this was the end for me. I cannot believe how bad this novel was. NO plot, characterizations were non-existant and what a waste of my lovely birthday and Christmas gift certificates.

He THEN spends the last quarter of the novel &quot;re-revealing&quot; the Mastermind's identity with subsequent results. What was he thinking?Not since Thomas Harris pandered to the studios by re-inventing Claris Starling for &quot;Hannibal&quot;, have I experienced an author so cavalier about his characters or disrespectful of his readers. Shame on you James Patterson!"},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"Readers who became Alex Cross fans after reading the first few books in this series would be well-advised to avoid this one. Mr. Patterson has reduced this formerly well-developed and likable character, along with his family and associates, to the literary equivalent of stick figures. What with the &quot;Masterminds,&quot; &quot;Sires,&quot; one-dimensional characters, pseudo-vampires, banal dialogue and substandard writing and plot that characterize this book, it is more like a comic book than a New York Times best-selling mystery (and this comparison is a disservice to some comic books--sorry!). The musical name-dropping is offensive, too--somehow I can't picture Mr. Patterson kicking back and enjoying the sounds of Trent Reznor and Erykah Badu. They should charge him a fat fee for using their names. Patterson used to be an excellent writer. The real mystery here is what happened to him? Hope someone can solve this one--in the meantime, I won't be spending any more time or money on his books."},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"I was sort of a Patterson fan, but no more. This book is silly. No plot, no suspense, no mystery, no nothing. Vampires and the &quot;Mastermind&quot; (who we already knew)? Please. He must have got a huge advance from the movie people for this piece of junk."},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"OK, so we already knew the identity of the Mastermind...but we do experience Alex Cross's crisis regarding his increasing dissatisfaction with his work / family balance. While many of us can identify with that, it is not why I read Patterson's books! The vampire storyline is poorly developed, and lacks the great Alex Cross analysis into the minds of the killers. I missed the keep-you-on-the-edge-of-your-seat thriller that we've experienced with other Cross story lines. No surprises, no waiting to see what unexpected turn you'll face in the next chapter. This is not anywhere close to Patterson's best effort, but it does provide a mindless escape for a few hours. I feel bad for any new readers who mistakenly pick up &quot;Violets&quot; first; this is definitely not the place to start with the Alex Cross series! Here's hoping Patterson can breathe new life into the next one, and bring back the intuitive detective we know &amp; love!"},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"I agree 100% with Roz.

Caucasions write with a certain style and African Americans do the same. Patterson is presumably (from the jacket cover) a caucasion male. In reading this book, I had the distinct feeling that a black female wrote the book.No man worth his salt would refer to a male character over six feet tall and \\"in perfect physical shape (sic) etc.\\" being 180 pounds. A man of that height at that weight would be a string bean. And yet that is just what the villains in this piece are described to look like.Then there is the lead character: how wimpy is he?!!!!! He simply moons after the female detective in L.A. and acts like a curr dog throughout. I got so disgusted with this poorly written book that I threw it down several times before I returned it to the store and was successful in getting my money back.Don't bother reading this. Not only does it insult my intelligence by its very existence, but it is such a shoddy piece of writing that most high school freshmen could do far better.P.U. it stinks!!!"},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"James Patterson follows up on &quot;Roses are Red&quot; with a novel about serial killing packed with violence and gore.Some things to praise:Alex Cross is truly at the crossroads of career, and it seems certain that he will make some changes in his life based on how much he realizes that the path he has chosen in career hurts the path of the life he wants to lead as a man and a parent.Violets are Blue is hard to set down. The action is cross-country, and the Mastermind plot is woven in with a horrendous series of serial murders that seem to be driven by vampires.The conclusion of the vampire segment is surprising and satisfying.Some things that hurt the novel:Another new female interest....it seems too soon after his last two relationships, and the introduction of Jamilla seems as though she will be a character in books to come. She is not very interesting here, so hopefully Patterson will be able to grow the character in the future.The answer to the Mastermind plot is far too obvious, and you keep hoping that it will be a last-minute surprise. Too out of character for Alex to not sense the evil in the person who is revealed as the Mastermind.I love the crispness and shortness of Patterson's chapters, but, in this book, he gets carried away, turning his style into choppiness instead of the effect of the technique in earlier books.I can't say I didn't enjoy reading Violets are Blue, but, the novel pales next to the earlier Alex Cross offerings. Will there be a &quot;Sugar is Sweet&quot;? Most likely, and hopefully Patterson will put more into his plot line and his characterization, to revive the Cross franchise."},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"James Patterson once again controls us with the MASTERMIND, If you read Roses Are Red then you know all about the MASTERMIND.

But I cannot say the same for this one. The vampire trend lead nowhere and was more of blood than of substance. His new series with 3 friends seem to be more engaging and fulfilling.

Although, I'll admit, this started out to be a page-turner. Which was fast-paced, gory, gruesome, and very intriguing. Just the way I like em, so I thought. But, it didn't seem to want to slowdown, it kept right on going and going, leaving the ending rushed and lacking drama. The story completely dies. No suspense, what so ever, not a typical Patterson novel. And, furthermore, to make things worse, in an effort to pick it back up, which, should've been another story altogether, we discover who's the Mastermind. And, that also is a disappointment."},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"\\"Nothing ever starts where we think it does.\\" (JP) This haunting sentence begins a tale that drags Alex Cross into a dark world of macabre murder as he becomes the puppet of The Mastermind.Cross arrives at Betsey Cavalierre's home when she is found murdered. She is Cross' second partner in two years to die - her death is vile. Then the phone rings, and Cross hears the voice of the mad mind that will turn his world into a nightmare filled with evil images, events, threats, and fear. The Mastermind knows Alex's every movement, or so it seems. That conversation is in the bloody room of a mutilated friend; The Mastermind tells Cross that he is next - and perhaps he will go and kill Alex's three children and his partner.Alex is in a fast paced thriller with the constant knowledge that at any time The Mastermind can go after those he cares for. Still with the Police, he is borrowed for a particularly grisly double homicide in San Francisco by the FBI. Two athletic sweethearts had been running in Golden Gate Park; they died by exsanguination, their bodies hung in a tree. And so the chase begins.The savagery spreads across the United States. Alex chases the bodies across the country with the luscious SFPD Detective Jamilla Hughes. The grisly world of vampires is a constant threat as they strive to get ahead of the killer(s) to end the carnage. Always along for the ride on this horrendous journey is The Mastermind and his disturbing phone messages.This is fast paced, intriguing, unique, and compelling. Read it with a friend, during the daylight hours, and watch your back if you travel the gothic world.Victoria Tarrani"},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"Don't waste your time with this one.

He is the master of short chapters in the design of novels. I have favored his structural approach so much so that I chose to incorporate that reading convenience into my own novel, EVIL, BE GONE (available on Amazon.com). I was, however, not nearly as entertained and intrigued by VIOLETS ARE BLUE as I have been by other Patterson works. Although the story does grab you at the onset, three-fourths of the book are spent on an entangled plot that seems to have little to do with the arch-villain, Mastermind, and ultimately descends to a rather anticlimactic conclusion. The novel might have been salvaged with the suspense of unmasking the Mastermind, but the nasty character's identity becomes all too clear far too early in the story. I will continue to read James Patterson's novels, considering this book an anomaly in an otherwise strong stream of winners. - Robert John Estko, the author of the suspense thriller, EVIL, BE GONE"},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"As his other books, this one was one you had to finish, now.

If you've read any of Patterson's books, you'll know that his books are not great literature and his characters are not particularly well-developed -- BUT they are very fast-paced, suspenseful, thrilling and filled with surprises. Violets Are Blue is no exception. It is pure escape reading, and if you're in the mood to escape, I think this book will more than satisfy this mood. Enjoy! I'm looking to forward reading Patterson's latest, Four Blind Mice."},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"As I've said in my other Alex Cross series reviews, this thing is played out and I'm tiring of Patterson's half-assed attention to this series. Although I must say, that this book was far more interesting than the previous two in the series; Pop Goes the Weasel, followed by Roses are Red. I'm sure I'll read the next installment, Four Blind Mice, but I've got low expectations for it and I won't be reading it until my library has it. I'd suggest you do the same, borrow any books from this series as they're really not something you'll read several times and aren't worth the money. I think Patterson has long rode out the good reputation of this series, and it's gone sour. The &quot;mastermind&quot; has been a weak villain (and I thought the weasel was bad) that was basically strung along for the entire novel, and really played no part at all (sort of like the fate of a certain character in &quot;Pop Goes the Weasel&quot;, who ended up being thrown even further on the back burner for these two novels) and the ending of this book felt rushed and really fell flat, not near as exhilerating as it should have been, considering I had to read through two books to get to it. The series is starting to read like a really bad soap opera. I can't imagine starting out in the series anywhere prior to Roses are Red and wanting to read any of the rest of the series. If you like this book, you'll LOVE the rest of the series, you'll have to, because as of this point in the series, it's damn near hit rock bottom."},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"I've read all of the Alex Cross books, and I should have stoped after the last one. The cliff hanger left at the end of the last book is ended here in Violets are blue, but it contrived and very very disappointing. I feel cheated. It seems the book was pushed out to hit the Christmas book buying season. I'll be very leary about buying another James Patterson novel."},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"Violets are Blue is no different than the last few Alex Cross novels. It is an exciting page turner with thrills and chills but needs so much work to compare with Kiss the Girls and Along Came a Spider.Patterson is obviously a great writer. He shows the talent in this story, creating truly evil characters who committ horrible crimes and keeping me turning the pages wanting to find out if they were going to be caught. Patterson definitely has the skills to keep the reader entertained and on the edge of his seat, but he also leaves you with so many questions. Many times I read a book and have questions about the plot, but usually the author gives you the answers in the story, you just have to look. I have so many questions about Violets are Blue, but none of them are answered in the story.This novel has two storylines: murderous vampires on the loose and the Mastermind from the last novel. The vampire cult is the main case the Cross travels throughout the country trying to solve. The Mastermind is always there, always on Cross's mind, and always part of the story.William and Michael are two killers travelling throughout the country killing people and drinking their blood. Cross and the FBI are hot on their tail, arriving at each murder scene and analyzing it to death. This is Patterson's weakness. Cross is basically an idiot. Cross never discovers or deduces anything. At each crime scene Cross asks questions like \\"what are the killers trying to tell us?\\" and \\"what are their reasons?\\". But Cross and the police never discover any clues or solve any mysteries. A good author would allow Cross to make a discovery that makes the reader think he has accomplished something, then throw in plot twist. But here it is just murder after murder after murder. Also, it seems like Cross spends hours upon hours \\"jotting down notes\\" or \\"working on the computer\\". What kind of notes are these. Obviously not notes geared to solve the case. It appears Cross may be on to something, and he jots down notes and questions, but the reader never sees them and therefore there is no suspense.The vampire killers comment on how their is a method to their killing and it is leading to a purpose. See if you can figure it out. At first I couldn't but now I think I did, and boy what a let down. Cross never figures it out either.Then there is the Mastermind. If you read Roses are Red, you know who it is. Throughout the novel, Cross notices suspicious things about the Mastermind, but never really acts on them. Then at the climax it all makes sense to Cross. But it never made since to me.Patterson covers this plotline from Cross and the Mastermind's point of view. It seems the Mastermind has always been out to get Cross, and his actions have been going on through quite a few Cross novels. The Mastermind reveals and Cross discovers that the Mastermind has been committing murders for years and has even been in cohorts with some bad guys from some other novels. This isn't a spoiler because this is just stated as fact. There is no moment of revelation or discovery. Patterson just comes right out and says it. It's like Patterson is jus treading on the surface with this novel. There is so much more to be seen, to be revealed, to be discovered. Patterson prefers to keep it a secret, or as I believe, he doesn't even know its there.Patterson is a good thriller writer who could use a lot of work on the supsense part. He starts out with vampires with grand schemes of killing. But what are the schemes. No one ever discovers them. The mastermind has been committing murders for years and after Cross for years. But why, how, when, where? This book needs a lot more detail to be satisfying."},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"James Patterson continues to be one of my favorite authors, whether he's writing in the Alex Cross series or when he branches out to write books with different characters and subject matter. Many of the negative reviews point to the fact that the identity of the Mastermind was revealed in Roses are Red. I may be in the minority, but I definitely believed that it was an advantage to know who it was. Knowing this information, you kept waiting for the shoe to drop and being dangled until the very end. As far as the short chapters, what's wrong with that? The book grabbed you from the beginning, and the short chapters made it an easy read without sacrifing quality. Believe me, I've read other books that took me forever to read because the plot development was a little too long. That's OK when you have nothing else to do, but when you live a fast paced lifestyle, you appreciate this writing style. The only negative was that there were a couple of loose ends left from the vampire plot. Sorry naysayers, this is a great book."},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"This book was the worst one yet. Normallly I like Patterson's books.

Having enjoyed the last novel so much I have been eagerly awaiting this book for a long time. I love vampire lore, but this pathetic poorly displayed attempt at the &quot;modern&quot; vampire theme is pooly written and way beneath Patterson's previously written novels. It's predictable and boring. And Alex Cross has turned into a wimp. He rambled and whined and didn't come up with a crime solving idea in the entire story. For the detective who has gotten involved with his female partners or characters in every other book, the idea of just staying friends with his female partner to soothe his wounded ego is way out of character. As for the Master Mind's identity. Patterson insulted all of his fans by telling on the last page of the last book and thinking no one would remember it. Maybe the author has run out of gas and if this is all he could come up with, it's time for him to throw in the towel. For those who are put off by this weak plot and flat character novel; the earlier Alex Cross novels were excellent and I would definitely recommend them to anyone who loves a good murder mystery series. I will miss Alex Cross, but I guess he's all dried out."},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"Alex Cross is back and in excellent form!

Roses Are Red ended with the revelation of the identity of arch-criminal mastermind and with a final horrific crime that left long-time detective Cross shaken to the core and primed for vengeance. But unfortunately, this follow-up really isn't a direct sequel. It follows two separate storylines - one is the hunt for the still-at-large Mastermind (whose identity, I should point out, was revealed to the Reader but not to Cross or the other characters) who continues to taunt Cross from afar; this story is the smaller of the two main plots though. Occupying the lion's share of the book is a tale about a decades-long series of ritual killings involving either vampires or people who think they're vampires. The idea of introducing a potentially supernatural antagonist into an established series of detective novels is actually a good one; unfortunately, while it didn't fall flat on its face it doesn't turn out to be an especially Good vampire story either.The sections of the story that deal with the Cross/Mastermind vendetta are better - especially as the Mastermind begins to threaten all those close to Cross - but don't entirely deliver on the potential from Roses's cliffhanger. Violets Are Blue opens up on the same scene Roses Are Red ended on, and right off the bat seems to be setting the stage for something diifferent, less intense, than those last pages of Roses indicated we'd be getting. The sections of the book focusing on this plot line are still the better part of the novel, but its not what it could have been, and the finale came off anti-climatic. The two threads - the Mastermind and the vampires (whether they turn out to be real or just vampirically-inclined killers is something that doesn't get resolved until later in the book) - do eventually tie in, but I was left with the idea that they should have each had a novel to themselves.As for the pluses - the book is well written, parts of the Mastermind sections do deliver on their potential (and show perhaps what the book could have been like if the vampires had been left for another novel, and the vendetta angle had been allowed to grow), and perhaps most importantly, Patterson excels at writing his core characters - Cross, his family, the other law enforcement agents he works with. It's enough to lift the book up a ways, and it's certainly readable, but it's not on par with either Roses Are Red or with the better vampire novels out there, likeThe Historian.Bottom line though, still a good book - I may have liked it more if my expectations going in weren't so high - and one that Cross fans should give a try."},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"Having read every Patterson book, including the non-Cross stories, and in general a pretty avid Patterson/Cross fan, I feel this book is neither as bad as the one-star people say or as good as the 5-star people say. Therefore, I gave it a three. My logic is that Alex is back and in fairly good form, though we start to hear much career doubt in this one and fear his days are numbered. On the other hand, the plot and story-telling are nowhere near as tight and suspenseful as in his earlier tales; plus the amount of gore just about put us over the top. I'd wrap it up this way -- if you're a dedicated fan, you don't want to skip this one, but be ready for not the best of the line. If you're new to Patterson and Cross, start just about anywhere else for a better first impression. On balance, guess that's not so good!"},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"This is a good addition to the Dr. Alex Cross series.

And coupled with the fact that a year's worth of expectation has built up after the climax of Roses are Red, this book comes packed full of expectation.It is ultimately expectation that remains unrealised. Apart from the abismal Pop Goes the Weasle, this is his worst book yet.Which is a shame, because the actual ideas he has a great. \\"Alex Cross is drawnm into his most bizarre investigation yet. two San Franciso joggers are found dead - bitten and hung by their necks to drain the blood. Further murders in California, and then on the East Coast as well, completely baffle Alex and the FBI. Is this the work of a cult, of role players, or even of modern-day vampires? DFesperate to stop te deaths, Alex teams up with savvy San Francisco detective Jamilla Hughes, and the FBI's Kyle Craig. But Alex has never been closer to defeat, or in greater danger. (...)To be honest, i thought it would be great. Another brilliant addition to the Cross saga.How wrong could i be? The premise is great, the vampire killings and the cult. But that is all tha tis great. in James Patterson's hands it just falls to pieces.There are several things niggling me about this book.1. The book was a mess. The killings were a mess and the plot was a mess. For every single book thus far Patterson has decided that all the killings must have been going on for year and years, reaping many victims, and that they are only coming to light now. I'm sick of it. I do not want to constantly read of murders going back decades and many many victims. His body count is far too high. and because of that the plot strands all fall apart. It's a mess. He doesn't really seem to know where the book's going, and he just chucks and event in to keep the book going. The killings are to random, with no motive at all. I know that it is meant to be like this, hence adding to the toughness of solving the case, but it just doesn't work. The book is just a mess, an utter mess.2. This book is just Cat and Mouse mark 2. Anyone spot the similarities? A killer from a previous book comes back to haunt Cross, whilst another spate of horrible killings begins. In Cat and Mouse it was Gary Soneji back, and the new kiling being \\"Mr Smith\\". Here it is (???) who comes back, and the vampire killings. Same plot, just a slightly different take. I am not willing to keep re-reading the same book.3. Patterson just seems to chuck in death's whenever he feels like it. In this book there was a death about every ten pages. it was awful. I do not want to read about constant descriptions of scenes of death. I want some investigation, some tension, some POINT to the plot. He just killed someone whenever he felt the book needed another kick, just to keep it going. He was wrong, there are far too many deaths, and it he had kept the deaths to a lower level, the book would have been much better. But we get absolutely no time to feel for the victims at all, which is something you definitely did in the early Cross books. Her eit is just like they are pieces of meat. There is no sympathy in it at all, Patterson is just revelling in the gore. There is no time for anythign else, and it spoils the book.4. Cross is definitely no James Bond. and i am now fed up of his partnering off with every female lead. If Patterson wants to write love stories, then WRITE love stories (not just one). Don't keep stretching the bounds of credibility. It would be more acceptable if Cross were a James Bond type character, just using them for sex, but he isn't. He actually is distrubed enough to claim he is in love with every single one of them.5. Your books are too short. this one is only 300 pages. make them longer, spend more time on them. dont churn them out like a rabbit churns out offspring.6. And WHAT was the ending about? The \\"confrontation\\" as mentioned on the book Jacket lasted about a page. (...) It was like an express train going at a hundred miles an hour suddenly hitting an impossibly thick tungsten wall. Talk about anti-climax. i had been expectin a \\"pistols at dawn\\" type showdown, but what i got was definitely nothing like it.In short, this book is just bad. Bad bad bad. I shall seriously think about whether or not to buy the next Alex cross. (and i haven't even mentioned the appaling grasp of language Patterson has)Something that makes this book all the more disappointing is how much Samspson is left out, and the fact that the first 50 pages were actually really good. But from there it was downhill all the way. it wasn't even a pageturner, which is his usual trademark."},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"I am very disappointed with this latest novel of James Patterson.

However, Detective Cross is not privy to this information just yet.VIOLETS ARE BLUE continues where the last book left off. In this case, Cross is investigating a rash of brutal killings involving wild tigers and \`vampires' while the Mastermind keeps taunting him with harassing phone calls. It is not necessary to know whom the Mastermind is in order to enjoy the book but I would recommend one read ROSES ARE RED before jumping to this book.Unfortunately, I cannot say that I loved this book. The \`vampire' subplot reads more like filler before the showdown between Cross and Mastermind. I was having trouble making sense of the vampire story. I could not empathize with the characters involved, what their motives were and the reasons for their actions.

Perhaps the fact that the novel lacked suspense was inevitable given that Patterson gave away the mastermind's identity at the end of Roses. That said, however, even apart from that there just wasn't nearly the same level of suspense as in the other Cross books. I actually could hav lived with Alex ending after Roses, but this book was so average that he better write another, because such a great character deserves to go out on a much higher note than this. Maybe Jamilla can become part of the club in the other Patterson series and then Alex can work with them to solve the next serial killings in SF."},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"The case is difficult enough for Washington DC police detective Alex Cross because the alleged victim was a good friend. The case turns frightening for Alex when the brilliant but amoral criminal the Mastermind threatens Alex's children. Alex immediately leaves the crime scene to return home, but the Mastermind reminds the cop you can run, but you can't hide.Even while he panics over the safety of his children, FBI Agent Kyle Craig calls Alex while he dines with a special date. Someone killed two military joggers in Golden Gate Park in which bite marks are all over the victims, much of their blood was drained, and they were left hanging upside down from a tree. The case reads identical to one that they failed to solve in DC fourteen months ago so Alex immediately flies to San Francisco. Joined by SFPD Jamilla Hughes, Alex begins to find clues that take the duo into a deadly role-playing underground. However, his children are irate that his work comes first especially with the Mastermind stalking them like a tiger after its quarry.The \\"vampire\\" slayings make for a clever police procedural that takes the audience on a unique tour of the Bay area as well as other areas of the country. The Mastermind subplot seems to interfere with the other tale though it enables the audience to observe a depressed and panicked Alex using work to escape his plight.

I enjoy the challenge of attempting to figure out \\"who done it\\" before the protagonist does, but with this Alex Cross mystery, like its predecessor, Roses Are Red, Patterson drops a bomb on his readers at the novel's end, and once the dust has settled, leaves oner with little more than a shred of interest in the outcome."},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"&quot;Eating at a diner in Woodland Hills, just off the 5 freeway&quot;?The 5 is nowhere near Woodland Hills.

There is some twist that Patterson always uses.&quot; But after about 90 pages, I realized that the only thing that was strange about this book was that it was so predictable. I could tell what was goign to happen at every point in this book. The book synopsis told all that the book was about. In fact, I could right a novel about this in my sleep. Litterally, I think for the most part this book was a dream.But, I cannot say that it was all bad. Around the end of the book, (The last 150 pages)Patterson through in the patented twist I had hoped for at the beginning of the book and I could not put it down.

Keep this one close at hand; you'll need it!"},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"In the past, I've looked forward to James Patterson. His last two books seem, to me, to be more and more violent. It also seems like there's a lot of filler that has to do with his life and family. I also believe that this book is not very well written. I find myself skimming over the boring parts (and there are a lot) to try to find some substance. I've toyed with the idea of just putting it down and I may still do it. I'm not a writer but I am an avid reader and this book doesn't even come close to being good. I can't recommend it."},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"I had read James Patterson's 1st to Die (which was good, but sad) and then went on to other authors for a while. Then I saw the blurb/excerpt for Violets are Blue. The name Jamilla Hughes jumped out at me and I decided to be pick up the book to see if Alex Cross was indeed an African American detective. To my delight he was!(But not blatantly, it's written so that he could be any ethnicity)Due to the author's short chapters I find myself flying through the book. It's very good and I can't wait to finish it and go backwards to the beginning!! I recommend starting at the beginning to anyone.Good book~"},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"The Alex Cross books are the reason to read Patterson. In Violets are Blue, Alex returns along with wise old grandmother and children who worry about him as he leaves them behind to solve a murder that seems to be the worst yet. The investigation this time seems to be the work of vampires...victims all have bite marks, and their blood has been drained out of their bodies. Alex finds himself investigating vampire cults in California even as the MASTERMIND contiues to stalk him in Washington. There are plenty of hints about the identity of the Mastermind as the book unfolds.The pace is fast and the suspense is good. It is apparent early in the book that we will finally know who the Mastermind that has known Alex's every move is. With his identity revealed, that is the end of the mastermind, but Violets are Blue introduces a new girlfriend for Alex who will hopefully return in the next Alex Cross book."},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"This book is great. James Patterson is the best crime writer out there now. All his books, including this one, move extremely fast. Violets are Blue is another example of his dominance in this genre."},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"Alway enjoyy Alex Cross and his wonderful family. Wish for more of his side pal. This book was very gruesome and bloody. Some of it I could hardly read. The plot was very original and entertaining. However, I could not understand why, with all of this blood, there was no mention of Aids. That was constantly on my mind. Has anyone else thought of this? On the whole, this was a great read. My granddaughter ask me to stop reading and pay her some attention."},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"I've read most of the Alex Cross series and each one has gotten worse and worse. This one starts out with a bang and is a real page-turner for the first half of the book, but peters out with a disappointing middle and abrupt ending. Very unsatisfyingThis is one of the few mysteries where I guessed the culprit which took a lot of the fun out of the book. It was an obvious choice but didn't really make sense.It's clear James Patterson doesn't think much of his readers. This is the last James Patterson book for me."},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"I had read all the other books about Alex Cross and liked every one of them. Then along came Violets are Blue. It is the one of the worst books I have tried to read. I quit after 125 pages. I just gave up. Person after person is killed and the blood sucked out of them. All done by vampires no less. It is so bad. No real story except Alex trying to catch them. Just killing after killing. I really hate this. I liked James Patterson so much. I don't know if I will ever buy another one or not, wish I had not bought this one."},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"After having read Roses are Red and finding out at the end who the Mastermind was I eagerly anticipated Violets are Blue to see how and when Alex Cross would realise his identity. I knew that Patterson could not just let Alex Cross find out the identity of the Mastermind at the beginning of the novel and that there would have to be some suspence or something to lead up to the revelation. However the vampire thing was absolutely of on a tangent. I never found a link to the vampire killings and the Mastermind. I had expected to have read that the Mastermind had been a part of the cult as a kid or at some point in his life or even currently. When the book started of with the vampire killings I thought oh wow James Patterson is going to give this Mastermind mystery a interesting unexpected sick twist and I anticipated the link to the Mastermind to the vampire killers.I was extremely disappointed by the end of the novel. I felt that after such anticipation for a book to have it be such a letdown was terrible.However I will still encourage people to read James Patterson novels, since generally they are gripping page turners. If you are a first time reader of James Patterson though I recommend that you begin with Kiss the girls, Jack and Jill, Roses are Red or any of his other Alex Cross books since they are much better."},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"This book is a continuation of ROSES ARE RED, in which the identity of the villain is revealed in the last sentence. Still, I was kind of hoping that the ending of the last book was a red herring and that it would really turn out to be somebody else.The first part of the book Patterson's hero, Alex Cross, goes into Kay Scarpetta territory to solve some murders committed by a group of people who role-play at being vampires. I am not a fan of vampire stories and did not for a second think that the killers were anything more than a cult of wannabees. There was no supernatural or occult stuff in this story, just a bunch of freaks who like to dress in black, with lots of tattoos and piercings. Since the identity of the killers is also revealed to the reader early on in the book, it became rather tedious to follow Alex Cross solving clues, while trying to spend time with his kids and grandma. I was also expecting the \\"Mastermind\\" to be linked to the vampire gang, possibly as a parent of the killers, but the two plots did not tie together.If you have never read anything by James Patterson, don't read this book first. Read BLACK FRIDAY, which is an eerie scenario that predicts the events of Sept. 11. It is one of his best, along with Along Came a Spider."},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"Okay, not everyone liked this rather atypical excursion in the Alex Cross series. While you wait for the next ones, try the fine books: Just Killing Time by D. VanArman, Cross-killer by M. Montecino, Valentine by Tom Savage, Killer by James PattINSON, and the works of Bayer, Diehl and D. Wiltse!"},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"The last two Cross novels are a clear disappointment. While &quot;Roses Are Red&quot; seemed contrived and artificial at the end. &quot;Violets Are Blue&quot; is clearly a sequel that extends the absurdities of &quot;Roses...&quot;. I hope Patterson reconnects with Cross and soon. A sequel to a bad book only makes it a worse book."},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"...Maybe Pattereson did not live up to his name with this novel but really, it was still a good read. The only thing I didn't like about this book was the fact that we were given the name of the mastermind in the last book (roses are red) and had to wait until the end of this one before he revealed it again. It was a big build up to what we already knew.Other than that though the story was every bit Patterson at his best. Between large Tigers and Blood Hungry Vampire-Wannabes to a criminal Master-mind you couldn't ask for or expect much more. I don't think this is going to be the last we see of Alex Cross and I hope it isn't."},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"While I thoroughly enjoyed his previos Alex Cross stories,this one seemed written without any character development or a reasonable plot.It seemed Mr. Patterson was forcing a conclusion.Unfortunately,it was telegraphed quite clearly and unconvincingly."},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"Violets Are Blue is probably the poorest James Patterson mystery I have read. Yet, when all is said and done, he has a great character in Alex Cross. Cross is a fully realized character who has become familiar in many of Patterson's other novels.I feel that the shortcoming in Violets Are Blue is the effort to reuse previous &quot;bad guys&quot; again and again even when the faithful reader is pretty likely to know &quot;who done it.&quot;. In addition, Violets is fairly unbelieveable as stories go, as well as bloodly and gruesome.While I remain faithful to Alex Cross, I would like to see this character get some better attention in the future."},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"I was sitting in my car yesterday trying to finish the book so that I could give the book back to my mother. My wife got out of the car to buy the children some food from McDonalds. I was eading so intently that I didn't even notice my wife had come back to the car, and was tapping on the window. To see her standing at the window kind of startled me. I'm going to finish the book some time tonight. It was scary, sick, funny, mind boggling, etc. I recommend this book to anyone who is a fan of James Patterson's Alex Cross. Bravo, Mr Patterson, Bravo!"},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"Alex Cross is back. He meets beautiful women, spars verbally and mentally with master criminal/homicidal maniacs and chases down some of hte most violent murderers in the vampire killers. I like the series. I got what I expected: short chapters, fast paced action and good versus evil, but I have to wonder if the formula is not getting a bit ragged with time."},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"The &quot;vampire&quot; slayings make for a clever police procedural that takes the audience on a unique tour of the Bay area as well as other areas of the country. The Mastermind subplot seems to interfere with the other tale though it enables the audience to observe a depressed and panicked Alex using work to escape his plight. In his latest Cross thriller, VIOLETS ARE BLUE, James Patterson keenly blends his hero's personal and professional lives as each aspect clash leaving the audience with another complete tale. A novel I also have read recently and like very much is Paul Omeziri's Descent into Illusions. Both deal eloquently with dark and mysterious themes."},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"This was not one of Patterson's best books. It was a little strange and not very satisfying. He is a great author, but this book does not reflect it."},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"There was very little of the real suspense here that I've come to expect from Patterson's novels. It started off promisingly enough, but quickly deteriorated so that before I was 1/3 through the book, I felt as if he must have written it during the commercials of Survivor. The Mastermind is pretty easy to pinpoint -- Patterson is not subtle in his clues this time around. And really, Cross' women-and-dating dilemmas are getting stale. I recommend this only as a part of the Cross series, but it's disappointing on its own merit."},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"'Violets are Blue', by James Patterson, picks up where the previous novel, 'Roses are Red', in the Alex Cross series leaves off: Cross is visiting the murder scene of a close friend. From there, Cross is drawn into a bizarre case engrossing dozens of murders around the country. On top of that, Cross continues to be hounded by the self-proclaimed Mastermind, who continues to threaten Cross and everyone who is dear to him.The bizarre case mentioned earlier is a string of murders in which the victims have been bitten by humans, and sometimes, apparently tigers. The bodies then appear to have been drained of all blood. The conclusion of the authorities is that some demented people are taking their vampire fantasies a little too far.'Violets are Blue' faces a serious challenge. This novel is the follow up to 'Roses are Red', in which the identity of the Mastermind has been revealed. In addition, the identity of the killers in the vampire murder spree is identified early on. So, there is no real suspense generated as Cross tries to discern the identity of the killers.However, the 'real vampires' aren't like anything that has appeared in an Alex Cross novel yet. I found them more creepy than suspenseful, but there were times when I was on the edge of my chair waiting to see what happened next. Tackling the occult was an interesting choice for Patterson. It was a nice change from every murderer being a super-genius though.In my opinion, the best part of the novel was the last fourth, when Cross really gets to work on bringing down the Mastermind. For fans that have read the Cross series up to this point, some interesting revelations about the series are made. The pursuit of the Mastermind here, in a third of the space, is at least as entertaining as the pursuit of the vampires in the rest of the novel.One change I would like to see for future Alex Cross novels: nearly every novel involves a villain that is either a copy of works for the federal government, isn't this motiff getting tired? How surprised can the characters, or the readers be to find out that someone on the inside has betrayed them at this point?After 'Roses are Red', I felt that this novel was a bit of a let down. Patterson has become a victim of his own success. The earlier novels in the series were done so well, that anything that doesn't meet that high standard appears sub-par, even if it is a good novel in its own right. Patterson teases the reader with some changes to come in the series at the end of the novel, that if implemented, could breathe new life into the series. I'd recommend this novel to any fan of the Cross series. For those that aren't familiar with the series, I would suggest picking up the earlier novels first and catching up before tackling this one. I'd like to give this novel 3 and 1/2 stars, but since that isn't possible, I'll give it four."},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"I thought this was a great book. I liked the story line and I thought the chacters were very interesting.This book kept me glued to the story and reading with need to find out what was going to happen next, isn't what we all want in a good book?"},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"The author is at least back on track with his writing,after a real failure or two, but &quot;Violets are Blue&quot;is below the standard for Patterson. Those who haveread his previous Cross novels will come away feelinghe has knocked this one out a little too quickly, andthat maybe he was just following his own formula,rather than developing new ground.This story is believeable only if you buy into theauthor's thesis that his hero Alex Cross is the best,brightest and hardest-working detective in the country,and that, furthermore, the criminals he searches for are,likewise, the absolute worst, most intelligent, butdemented, criminals in the country.It is a lot to expect readers to accept, but, of course,many do.But, despite being derivative of his own work, this is adecent-paced story that is entertaining and worth a read."},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"Patterson used to be pretty good at writing an entertaining novel. No more. This is a silly book, feebly plotted, and full of gore instead of plot and character development.

Familiar with his work, I was surprised that I was listening to a vampire story, I thought that was saved only for Ann Rice. I did find the plot a little silly, but I like Alex Cross so much I could get into his head and try and figure out the story. I can tell you that the end twist makes the book totally worth while. I can see from the reviews that this book wasn't a favorite read; however, I find that all of the Patterson books and the narrators chosen are fantastic for a short or long car ride."},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"Tom Clancy was a top novelist. His writing quality has gone decidedly downhill over the past few years. He probably believes &quot;If you write it, they will buy&quot;. I see James Patterson going the same route. This was to be the sequel to Roses are Red and the pursuit of the mastermind. What it ended up being is a romp through vampire rituals and very little regarding the mastermind. While there may be &quot;vampires&quot; in modern day, the book simply didn't cut it for me. Too far out of the realm for my tastes."},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"After managing to finish Robin Cook's stupid book, &quot;Shock,&quot; I had hoped to find something much better.

Seems like I heard that he has a contract to produce 3 or 4 books a year right now, and it shows with Violets are Blue. It's as though he was rushing to get a book out in a week or two.

I've read first-time authors who did a much superior job - including Patterson himself."},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"I was thoroughly disappointed with James Patterson's newest book. There was almost no substance to the story. The book was doubled-spaced with a couple of paragraphs becoming a chapter and tons and tons of white space to get the book to size.Patterson seems to be grinding out books that are absolutely nothing like his earliest ones (which were quite good!)

The book was disgusting and a tremendous piece of garbage. I only read it because I had bought and paid for it. It is my opinion that he will sell many copies of this book because of name recognition only. Please don't waste your money unless you are hung up on many murders replete with horrible details. When he writes his next book, I will have to go to a book store to read more of a description of his book. This one is the worst I have ever read."},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"James Patterson has gotten lazy in his writing. Both Roses are Red and Violets are Blue were disappointments. This latest disappointment will ensure that Patterson does not get any more of my money."},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"It may be true that when an author becomes enormously popular while writing a suspenseful series, they're under some sort of pressure to keep writing more and more covoluted or even more and more bizarre plots to keep readers interested. Enter James Patterson not entirely unknown for some strange plots in his stand aloen books or even bizarre premises i.e., his older title When the Wind Blows where children are gnetically altered in the womb so they are born with wings and can fly. Once again in his latest Alex Cross book, Patterson introduces several more bizarre elemnts to a case Alex tries to solve.In the novel, Violets are Blue, two brothers are featured as grisly serial killers whose murders at times either resemble the work of vampires or tigers. Now thousands of readers favorite psychology/detective is on a mission to find the killer when his partner is found dead. And if this isn't enough, almost immediately in another part of the country another murder occurs which almost mimcs Alex's partners death. As Alex crisscrosses the nation investigating these bizarre murders and some other very weird folks, somebody known as the Mastermind is keeping track of Alex's every move. Its as if this individual, who some readers may remember from the previous book Roses are Red, is always one step in front of Alex taunting him with warning phone calls and threats agaisnt his family. Alex spends the majority of the book preplexed, confused, overworked and overwrought. By the end, Patterson ties up at least two parts of the plots neatly but leaves one danglgnthread. And it is this thread which left this reader perplexed, confused and overwrought. For it seems that this may be the end of Alex Cross or is it?Fear not Patterson fans if this is the end for dear Alex. We can eagerly wait for the second book featuring the Womens Murder Club from 1st to Die and perhaps another romance goodie like Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas. But this reader still can't help but remember how much I enjoyed Along Came a Spider when Alex Cross burst onto the literary scene and had me holding my breath till the next book was published."},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"I was getting very bored with Alex Cross, and the number of Alex Cross books James Patterson was putting out.

James Patterson is still on top..............."},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"Violets Are Blue is almost two completely separate tales in one book. One involves gruesome murders where the blood has been drained from the victims. This series of gorey murders leads into the world of modern vampires. This is frightening and intriguing and draws the reader into the dark world of fact and fiction surrounding this cult-like existence. It is both fascinating and repelling at the same time. When the Mastermind, the bad guy from Roses Are Red, turns out to be involved, then it begins to feel like two separate stories that never quite seem to fit themselves together. This would have been far better had the Mastermind not been a part of this. That part feels forced. You never feel like &quot;Oh yeah, now I see who it was!&quot; more like &quot;Oh, him........well, I guess so.&quot;It just kind of fizzles in the finale."},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"People are dying brutally and it appears that they are being ravaged by animals and covered with bites. Detective Alex Cross of KISS THE GIRLS fame is on the case again and things are just not adding up. He is being pulled into this twisted, murderous, rampage while receiving calls from the Mastermind who is stalking him, and undoubtedly wants him dead.Patterson leads the reader on a merry chase all over the country while uncovering murders that go back as far as 15 years. His spunky sidekick Jamilla, one of only two female detectives in her department helps him to mix and mingle with the Goth crowd suspected to be at the bottom of it all.The last part of the book is the culmination of the sadistic \\"Mastermind\\" and his plans, now set in motion for the destruction of Cross. It ties together characters and happenings from past books. I found this book predictable, no surprises here, but enjoyable none-the-less. I would give it 3.5 stars..."},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"If you read &quot;Roses Are Red&quot;, then you know that the last page of it tells you who &quot;The Mastermind&quot; really is. It was a cliffhanger, and I hate those, but you couldn't deny it was a good novel. &quot;Violets Are Blue&quot; literally picks up seconds after the other novel's end, and goes for a good ride from that point on. The beginning is gripping, and the end is by far one of the best Patterson has ever written. The middle is the problem. For one thing, The Mastermind's identity isn't &quot;revealed&quot; in this one until the last quarter of the book - even though it was clearly stated in the last one - so you are supposed to act surprised at the revelation (I guess if you didn't read the other book, it would be a surprise). For another thing, the vampire/S&amp;M storyline just gets too graphic for no reason. The sex/murder scenes just are more than we need to know. Some of the best parts of the book are at the beginning when the couple is found murdered and you try to figure what happened. When we stand bedside while people are graphically killed, the imagination doesn't have to go anywhere - so I feel some of the middle is too over-the-top. However, I have to say that the last quarter of the book (after the vampire storyline is over) is the best. When it's just Alex Cross versus The Mastermind, it's incredible work! Characters from all the previous novels get cameos or mentions (including a cameo from one of the better female characters in the series - Kate McTiernan). As the Mastermind goes after those in Cross' life to kill them while Cross tries to stop him, it's stuff that you can't put down. You'll be reading this one late into the night, that's for sure. Unfortunately, within the first few pages you can easily tell where this will all end up and what Cross' next life-move will be, but it still makes for a good story. Almost 5 stars, but the vampire killings are just too bloody graphic for my taste."},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"I have read all of the Alex Cross novels and I must say that &quot;Violets are Blue&quot; is frustrating to read and not up to par with the other Cross novels. The biggest frustration centers around the Mastermind. I was disappointed with the way &quot;Roses are Red&quot; ended and was looking forward to having the matter resolved quickly with Violets are Blue. Instead, the reader is lead through several anti-climatic scenes with the Mastermind getting close to dealing with Cross, but then deciding the &quot;time wasn't right.&quot; Gimme a break! Each chapter seems to rehash the same type of suspense that goes nowhere and leaves the reader plowing through another endless chapter of mayhem, gore and another budding romance between Cross and another female. Read it, seen it, tired of it! I love Cross' character, but Patterson does him a disservice with this storyline. What else could happen to this man! I for one will continue to look forward to more novels, but I am leary and disappointed that Mr. Patterson has gone into the mass market, cookie cutter manner of writing. Take a break Mr. Patterson and write the next Cross novel with better care and respect for the character and your many readers."},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"I rarely write a review of a book I dislike, but if I can warn a single person away from this book, the effort will be worth it. &quot;Violets Are Blue&quot; was so predictable, so poorly written, and so shamelessly padded, I was almost laughing. I was reminded of the time in high school when I was given an assignment to write 2000 words about some topic, I can't remember what. Well, I wrote the paper, but when I counted the words, I was less than half way to the 2000 word total. So I spent hours adding in extraneous material any way I could to bloat the paper to the requisite length. Patterson has done the same thing to two (flimsy) mysteries stories and rolled them into one.Both mysteries are so predictable that if you can't figure out the bad guy before detective Alex Cross does, you might think about switching to reading romance novels. One manhunt goes from city to city throughout the U.S. so that Patterson can add paragraphs of flimsy local color, including street directions to every scene, local restaurants (where I'm sure Patterson will dine for free from now on), etc. In neither mystery does Cross actually DETECT. The bad guy is simply the last suspect standing.A shameless padder, Patterson gives a plot summary for every one of his previous books and phones all the (living) key characters from them. And every other chapter is a warm, touching slice of his family life. Which has nothing to do with the plot, but sets the reader up for the next book in the series.I liked &quot;Along Came A Spider&quot;. Since then, Patterson has obviously decided it's less work to be a hack than a good writer, and the pay is the same."},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"I have read all but 2 of the Alex Cross books by James Patterson; a few weeks ago I finished &quot;Roses are Red&quot; and anxiously snatched up its sequel, &quot;Violets are Blue,&quot; after doing so. I admire James Patterson's way of getting you immediately involved in his Cross novels via the suspense and plot turns and VERY short chapters (though stylistically he leaves alot to be desired), but I just felt a bit empty after reading &quot;Violets&quot;.In this book, Dr. Alex Cross has two cases on his back; first, he's receiving daily threatening calls from the Mastermind, the psychopath Cross failed to capture in &quot;Roses&quot;. The Matermind's identity is known to anyone who reads the last page of &quot;Roses are Red&quot; but Cross is still in the dark, even as the Mastermind promises Cross he and/or his family will die soon. Added to this, Cross's FBI friend Kyle Craig draws him into a string of brutal &quot;vampire murders&quot; around the country where the attractive and healthy victims are found hanging upside down and drained of nearly all their blood.I think Patterson heaps too much into this novel. Through two-thirds of the 393 pages the Mastermind does little more than threaten Alex, and that wears thin after awhile -- it's almost like filler, like a &quot;b-story&quot; storyline that is stretched to fill up book space. In &quot;Roses&quot; the Mastermind was all about action -- nearly every 2nd or 3rd chapter he pulled something. Here, he's just a boogeyman on a phone through so much of the novel.The vampire murders story is NOT as gorey as some reviewers here would have you believe (try a little Laurell K. Hamilton if you want to experience some REAL gorey story writing), and though I found the twin blond vampire brothers interesting as heck, the whole Sire thing was a bit farfetched and lacking in real suspense (should have made the blond brothers the main focus of the story, they were so intriguing). Also, the solving of that case didn't leave me feeling the case was solved at all; it was too convoluted, with too many possibilities that other killers could still be out there, or that someone could simply pick up where the Sire left off . . .Knowing the identity of the Mastermind didn't keep me from enjoying the book, and I read it through quickly and eagerly. But while &quot;Roses are Red&quot; was satisfying like a big bowl of popcorn -- light, but filling -- &quot;Violets are Blue&quot; made me search for the butter or salt, trying to give this popcorn some badly-needed flavor."},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"I have read all of James Patterson's books, and was anxiously awaiting his latest. I was very disappointed in the vampire story and found a lot of the sexual scenes unnecessary for such a talented writer. In the previous book, I already knew the identity of the Mastermind, so it was no big surprise in the this book when it was revealed. I hope he continues on with the Alex Cross stories, but I also hope he returns to his writing of old and not the style in this book."},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"This book's been getting pretty bad reviews. I'm really surprised, because I ended up really enjoying this one. Yes, I admit this is not Patterson's best work, but it was still thrilling and chilling. \\"Violets are Blue\\" is the dark conclusion to \\"Roses are Red.\\"Before I get this review started, I have read the following books by Patterson: Kiss the Girls, Along Came a Spider, and Roses are Red. Just wanted to show that I HAVE read other books by him so I don't have somebody trying to say I don't know what I'm talking about. This is all my opinion, and I'm not afraid to go against the grain on this one.We follow Detective Alex Cross once again as he is on a case that involves some of the most gruesome murders he has ever seen. The body count is rising and it's happening everywhere. The strangest thing is that the victims don't appear to have been killed by people, but more like by creatures. As Cross goes down further and further along the road of truth, the more disturbing the truth becomes.The story also picks up where it left off with \\"Roses are Red.\\" Because as Cross is on the case, The Mastermind is still lurking and taunting him. Once again, the heartless killer threatens everything and everyone that Alex Cross cares about. The Mastermind wants Alex dead, and he will not stop the mayhem and rampage until he gets his wish. Could this be the end for Alex Cross?I thought it was a really good read. I finished it in less than three days. Usually when I finish a book the quick, that means that I really enjoy it. The action is sharp and fast-paced, with almost a cliff-hanger lurking around every chapter. The chapters are also very short, which makes it all the more easier to read. The narration is quite powerful and convincing; you can tell that Patterson has the most fun when he has Alex Cross narrating the story.Yes, it's not as good as the other books by him, but that still doesn't mean you shouldn't read it. If you like Patterson and you have read \\"Roses are Red,\\" give it a chance! What do you have to lose? (Yes, read \\"Roses are Red\\" first, since that is the first part. Too bad that \\"Roses are Red\\" tells us who The Mastermind is at the end, I think he could've left that out. That way it'd be more shocking when we read this one. Oh well.) I think the problem that people had with this one was that it seemed too much like something Stephen King would write and that the killers weren't realistic enough. Well, after writing so many Cross novels, Patterson wanted to take a different approach. I don't see anything wrong with that, but I can see why other people did.I found \\"Violets are Blue\\" to be a great page turner that kept me guessing. It is quite violent, so it's not for the squeamish. And, it gets VERY disturbing at times. Although while it may not be Patterson's best work, I found the book to be very well-written and structured. A great thriller with numerous twists and turns along the way."},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"When I heard the book was actually out, I jumped in my car and headed to the store to grab a copy so I could start it that night. I finished it the next day. Patterson has given us another wonderful suspense thriller about Alex Cross and the Mastermind. Add vampires into the twist and it only gets better. I learned so much about vampires that I never knew and, at the same time, couldn't wait until the Mastermind and Alex finally went head to head. Patterson has once again proven that he is on top of his game."},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"Violets Are Blue is an unusual Alex Cross novel in that it involves the supernatural or it appears to. It is actually about two stories a group of vampire killers killing like vampires are supposed to do and the return of the mastermind. There is good transition and balancing of the two storylines which Patterson does not always do and somehow Patterson is able to make an outrageous premise work to some degree . As usual the romance elemnts are the weakest part of the novel. Patterson is unconvincing at writing romantic scenes."},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"It was strange to start a book knowing 'whodunnit' from the start...or at least who was responsible for the murders in Cross's previous case. It worked though and I found myself waiting for The Mastermind to make his move or Alex to work out who it was.I have to say I was probably more interested in that conclusion than the main (I think!) plot concerning numerous killings where victims had been drained of blood or bitten to death, which seemed a bit far-fetched.That said, I still enjoyed reading it."},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"I must begin my comments by suggesting Alex Cross fans read Roses are Red prior to starting Violets are Blue. The ending scene in Roses are Red is the starting scene in Violets are Blue with one important change. It's a grabber!This story seems on the surface as surreal, a bit of the Dark Side when in reality it is an even running suspense story with a predictable ending, assuming that you read Roses are Red first. However, as good as it is it also at times becomes a bit repititous, whereas many thoughts and scenes are reworked and presented over and over, probably as filler content.This book is not one of James Pattersons best offerings, but it is miles ahead of many of his others including the one Alex Cross clunker London Bridges.If you are looking for a fast read and want to tie-up some \\"loose ends\\" then by all means read this book. It is though a once-read forgettable novel."},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"The sequel to Roses are Red.

At first, I didn't think it mattered which order I read the novels in, but I soon realized that it did make a difference because Patterson presents the characters in a way that makes the first/third-person literary past as important as the first/third-person literary present (which is the way he writes in). However, &quot;Roses Are Red&quot; was captivatingly entertaining, so of course I had to read &quot;Violets Are Blue.&quot; I could *not* put either of the books down! But as for &quot;Violets Are Blue,&quot; I feel that it was a tad more obscene and perverse than it needed to be. Ultimately, I felt the book was a satisfying conclusion to other one. The writing is impressive, as are character descriptions and settings. But since I spoiled the whole premise/character of Alex Cross for myself by starting at the end instead of at the beginning, I don't think I'll read any more of the series; nevertheless, I might start the right way with Patterson's other series. Still, overall, &quot;Roses Are Red&quot; &amp; &quot;Violets Are Blue&quot;--two good books! But one is wasting his/her time if &quot;Violets Are Blue&quot; is read before &quot;Roses Are Red&quot;.

As I read I noticed much of his writing is straight forward, no flowery language or overuse of deadword words: typical he said she said. Figurative language was not a strong point in Patterson's writing either. His style did include strong sense images though, especially sense image-sight. I especially appreciated the detailed descriptions of the events Cross encountered. The vocab was also not too challenging, but the choice of words was appropriate for the novel. Overall I thought his style was very intriguing and not overshadowed by unnecessary or overwhelming expressions or wordings."},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"This may be the first Patterson book I read, but it will certainly be the last.

He travels to San Francisco, New Orleans, and Santa Cruz, &quot;the Vampire capital.&quot; As bizarre as it sounds, the story was spell-binding. I am not one for horror stories, but, this was also a thriller. I will say that Dectective Cross seemed a little slow on the draw as I knew and so did some of the characters, who the Mastermind was before he did. For someone with strong intuitions he let some people get killed simply by his lack of insight, which is totally out of character for Dr. Cross.

Unfortunately, he has become a prisoner to the style that made him so big: the quick chapters, the short, pained thought-bytes of Alex Cross, and the ubiquitous Nana. But for him it has gone even further, and his writing has become a caricature of his former style. While other top writers like Grisham and Michael Connelly have flirted with this type of complacency, they have come roaring back as soon as they have become aware of it.Patterson, unfortunately, has not, and is sinking fast."},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"There once was a time when I actually got excited to hear that James Patterson had a new book coming out. His style was edgy and entertaining. His short two-or-three-pages chapters helped at building suspenseful plots. There was very little in his novels that was superfluous and his characters were usually very belivable. All of that seems like the very distant past.Patterson's latest in the Alex Cross series, Violets Are Blue, is a book with a very intriguing concept that is very badly actualized. Cross is faced with the most ferocious killers of all; a pack of vampires who are killing all across America. There is nothing that links the murders together save the bite marks at the victims's necks. And Cross also has to deal with The Mastermind, an unknown mystery-man who has been tormenting Cross for quite some time now. It is in this book that Cross will finally come face to face with The Mastermind and try to put an end to his murderous spree.I liked the vampire story part of the novel. It was different from what Patterson usually does and it felt a little fresh. I thought it would actually jolt a little life in his tired series. But then, the book had to drag on with The Mastermind plot. The book is also ruined with idiotic characters, pointless twists (Alex Cross seems to be running all over the place with no aim in mind) and way, way, way too many pop-culture references (as if the country's best psychologist/cop/investigator/father has the time to see all those movies and reading all those books he keeps mentioning).This book reads more like an outline for a movie than an actual novel. I don't know if Patterson has lost his touch (maybe that's why he is writing more and more collaborative efforts these days), but this book goes to show how a once prominent author can easily lose his touch. The Alex Cross novels used to be intellige and full of great twists and turns. Alex Cross used to solve cases with his mind and his wit. That is no more.There is very little fun to have reading Violets Are Blue. Hopefully, Patterson is only in a slum. I can't wait to finally read another good Alex Cross novel."},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"Patterson is one sick puppy!! Where did he ever get the idea for this book? Anyway, modern day vampires and their minions are certainly an interesting, if unusual, subject for a book of detecting. I must admit that, disturbing though the subject was, the crisp writing and fast-paced plot kept me reading on into the night. The final solution to the mastermind situation was somewhat less satisfying, sort of an afterthought to the whole concept of the work. The author seems to be just churning out these books at a fast pace, and not really thinking them through. Possibly too many best sellers engenders a contempt for the reader in the author's mind, and he figures they'll buy anything. Often that's too true, and we see the best seller list inhabited by mere remnants of talent from writers that were really excellent at the beginnings of their published careers, and now are just living on their reputations, and the gullibility of the reading public. How sad!"},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"I've read all of the Alex Cross series and usually love anything that James Patterson writes.

Regardless, the book still had a lot of action and suspense in true James Patterson fashion."},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"This was my first James Patterson book, so I'll have to accept the general consensus that many of his earlier novels are better than this one. The main problem with Violets are Blue (aside from a title that has nothing to do with the book, at least that I can tell) is that it has two distinct storylines that do not significantly intersect or complement one another. Detective Alex Cross is being stalked by a brilliant psychopath (aren't they all?) known as the Mastermind. This puts added strain on his already difficult family situation. Cross is a single father attempting to raise three children. The conflict between job and family life portrayed in Violets are Blue is somewhat hackneyed. Meanwhile, a series of brutal murders apparently committed by vampires (and possibly a pet tiger) sends Cross all over the country. The vampire part of the plot was the most interesting. It explores the goth/vampire subculture, and postulates what might happen if some of these people took their fascination with the dark side of things to an extreme. As I mentioned, the two threads remain separate until the very end of the book. To my mind, one of them resolves itself too quickly and the other too predictably; I guessed the identity of one of the villains fairly early. All in all, some good elements, but not combined in the best fashion."},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"...I love Alex Cross, and James Patterson's writing.

At the end of his last book, Roses Are Red, Patterson reveals who The Mastermind is, thus leaving us hanging only in the area of how long it will take Cross to figure it out in Violets are Blue. Throughout Violets are Blue, there is never any indication that Cross even has an inkling as to who The Mastermind is--no little suspicions, clues, or niggling feelings leading up to his mind-boggling realization that it is none other than his close and trusted friends of many years. The fact that Cross never even suspected the man, and then suddenly figures out who it is totally ruins any credibility that the storyline might have maintained leftover from Roses are Red. Couple this with the main storyline that people are being murdered by vampires and wild cats and you've got yourself a disappointing read, espcially if you have followed Patterson from his first Cross book all the way through--somewhere along the way he detoured. Let's hope he finds his way back to the quality of books we know he is capable of writing."},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"James Patterson has an unequaled ability to grab you on the first page and immerse you in a whirlwind of a story.

At the same time, Alex and FBI agents investigate a nationwide series of murders by a pair of killers who believe themselves to be vampires. I'll let you imagine what happens in each murder.

Can't wait for the next installment."},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"I love Patterson's work, especially the Alex Cross series, but I would have liked this book a whole lot better if we weren't introduced to the character of Jamilla Hughes. At the end of the last Cross book, Alex is devastated because someone he's been having an affair with was killed by The Mastermind, yet, within a very short period of time, we now have Alex introduced and having romantic feelings for another partner. Having said that, the crime writing was as good as ever, even if a bit over the top, but I don't think I could stand to hear Alex say &quot;I couldn't forgive myself if something happened to them&quot; one more time."},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"This Alex Cross masterpiece picks up where &quot;Roses are Red&quot; ended. This literary work is definitely one of Patterson's best to date and is filled with all the psychological suspense, intrigue and drama that one would expect from such an accomplished author. Yes, there have been a few disappointing novels in his time, but where Alex Cross is concerned he never lets us down. When two joggers are found murdered and hanging by their feet, Alex once again goes in hot pursuit of justice. Modern day-vampires? Freakish cults? From east coast to west, the story unravels with twists and turns that will keep you reading late into the night.Patterson is well known for his books with short chapters, which most of us find extremely convenient, and this book is no exception - there are 116 to be found here. Like his other Alex Cross novels, there is also a smart, attractive female character, by the name of Jamilla Hughes, who weaves her way into Cross's life. Cross seems to have difficulty holding on to his romantic interests, they either die or leave him, but that is all part of the mystery and intrique, isn't it? This book is definitely James Patterson at his finest and &quot;Violets Are Blue&quot; is a page-turner you will not want to miss."},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"Being an avid reader and a huge J.P fan I didn't like this book at all, just too weird for me. I didn't finish it so don't know how it ended, except to take a peek to check on the mastermind.The first of these two, which is Roses Are Red, was GREAT, Very Scary in a usual Patterson way. There was a bit to much gore in this book. I do think that together Gross and Patterson are a good team, I liked the beach house and kiss the girls, they were both excellent. I can't wait for their next collaboration."},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"DevonReview on Violets Are Blue\\"If you hunt for the vampire, the vampire will hunt for you,\\" is an excellent quote for a horrible novel. Violets Are Blue, written by James Patterson, is a mystery/suspense novel about Alex Cross; he is a homicide detective for the FBI and has problems keeping a relationship lasting because every woman he comes into contact with meets a horrific death by the Mastermind. Alex spends most of his time trying to find these so-called \\"vampires\\", William and Michael Alexander, whom \\"The Sire\\" Peter Westin led. The novel is weak, unappealing, inappropriate for most audiences, and unoriginal. The strong sexuality, gore, drug use, and the suggestive language prove this theory.While Patterson's strong use of detail added to the story, it also took away from the appealing aspect. At some points, too much gore and blood is described. This gory detail along with the descriptions of their sexual pleasures overwhelms the reader and takes away from the immediate plot. \\"They are hard,\\" and \\"their penises pulsed...\\" isn't the type of material I want to read and no sort of warning is printed in the entire book to warn people of this indecent writing. I was astonished to read such filth only found in romance novels. I didn't realize the American society had dropped to such low measures as to feel this book to be a best seller.The gore and drug-use promotes the wrong way for people to find entertainment. I don't wish to read, \\"We're going to hang you and drink every last drop. The most amazing thing-you're going to enjoy it when you die. It's ecstasy, Jamilla.\\" I was not happy with the \\"vampires\\" talking about using cocaine and how not using it makes the experience better.The language of the book starts to become offensive and aggravating because I don't wish to read words that I would never say. The words are usually used in the most intense parts of the book when the main character is in the middle of a fight or arguing heavily with someone. The words take away because they make me stop reading and wonder why that word was necessary.Most readers enjoyed reading the book, but I was not satisfied reading any part of the book. I do not consider this book to be a best seller and strongly recommend not reading it. Don't succumb to the low standards of the modern man and support such tasteless writing."},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"The order was for a new book, the pages of the book are brown and dried out.This was not a new book, Im am very disapointed.F.DelPrete"},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"James is a very good writer and recently cannot get enough of him"},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"The first few Alex Cross novels were really quite good.

After reading all the Cross books, It is obvious who the villian is and a predictable read. Patterson rushed this book and gave away too much from Roses are Red. It takes 150 pages before Cross profiles the Mastermind. Patterson repeats previous sentences from other Cross novels: &quot;Alex Cross crashes into a table, his full weight falling on the villian.&quot; At least with Cat and Mouse we get a new narrator. Jamilla Hughes was interesting and I would have liked to have seen a romantic developemnt similar to Cat and Mouse. Bottom line: Cornwell and Deaver are better writers on the subject of forensic profiling.Patterson's movie casting is all wrong. Morgan Freeman is too dry. He does not come close to conveying Cross's wit. A better choice would have been Chi Mcbride from Boston Public. The obvious choice for Sampson is Michael Clark Duncan. If Violets are Blue becomes a movie I would cast the guy who plays opposite Gillian Anderson on X-Files as the Mastermind."},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"Many times when authors use a character ad infinitum in a series of books, the plots become old and tainted. Cussler continues to use Dirk Pitt, Ludlum (to a lesser degree) capitalizes on Jason Bourne, and Patterson, of course, uses Alex Cross. In Patterson's case, he wrote two books in between the latest Cross novels (Diary for Nicholas and 1st to Die) so perhaps the reader would benefit from a fresh perspective. Yes and no.(If you haven't read &quot;Roses are Red&quot; and intend to do so, I suggest you stop reading the reviews for &quot;Violets are Blue.&quot; You'll thank me later.) In the latest iteration of Alex Cross' life, we find Alex whisked off to California to investigate some very bizarre, vampire-like murders. The bodies of two joggers were found in Golden Gate Park....hung by their feet and drained of blood via bites. Vampire bites? Alex's FBI friend(?), Kyle Craig calls Alex and asks him to join the investigation team. Upon arriving in San Francisco, Alex finds a pleasant surprise in Detective Jamilla Hughes. Alex and Jamilla run the traps on the few leads available. However, even as they are investigating the Park murders, several other murders occur in California and now, in Las Vegas. It becomes quite obvious that the murderers are on the move and several steps ahead of Alex. Concurrent with his murder investigation, Alex receives continual cell phone calls from the Mastermind (Alex's nemesis from &quot;Roses are Red.&quot;) Ultimately, Alex heads back to D.C. dejected as to his lack of progress in this highly unusual and complex case.As the parasitic vampires move from the West coast to the East coast, Alex is plunged into the seemingly paranormal world of vampiric norms. Alex learns much more about the tilted netherworld of vampiric cults, teeth sharpening and yes, the consumption of human blood. Alex continues to follow the trail of the murderers crisscrossing the East coast to New Orleans and finally back to California. All the while, Alex is haunted by the Mastermind.The vampiric portion of this book climaxes for the reader in Alex's last trek to California. The storyline relating to the vampire-like murders is very unusual and off-beat thereby making it less than expected. If Patterson had developed this storyline a bit more and left the Mastermind for a succeeding book, I believe that &quot;Violets are Blue&quot; would have been an excellent book. However, with the ever-present Mastermind hanging over each chapter, the reader isn't allowed to focus on the vampire plot. This is a shame as I felt the vampire plot was so peculiar (out of the ordinary), it was engrossing.Finally, the Mastermind. I enjoyed &quot;Roses are Red&quot; thoroughly with the exception of Alex's &quot;Frasier-like&quot; love life. However, at the end of &quot;Roses,&quot; the identity of the Mastermind is revealed. Inasmuch as &quot;Violets&quot; shares of dual plot of vampiric murders and the eternal search for the Mastermind, the latter portion becomes somewhat rote as the reader already knows the Mastermind. If Patterson knew he was going to write a continuing sequel (which was a given based on the ending of &quot;Roses&quot;), why did he reveal the identity of the Mastermind? Knowing the identity of the Mastermind was almost a nuisance in this book.Patterson is a very gifted and creative author. However, &quot;Roses&quot; and &quot;Violets&quot; could have been blockbusters if Patterson had stepped back from the writing and looked upon his current and successive plots from the point-of-view of the reader. Oh and, by the way, Patterson has very obviously left the reader hanging for the next installment of the Cross saga with the following, final sentence of the book, &quot;But that's another story, for another time.&quot; Yes, I'll read it but I hope that Mr. Patterson will read a few of these reviews prior to penning it."},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"Big fan of James Patterson, easy reading, you don't get lost in too complex of a story line.

In fact, I'd consider it good had it been written by anyone other than the modern master of suspense, James Patterson. I found Roses Are Red to be one of the best books in the Cross series, and was really anticipating the release of Violets Are Blue, and ended up rather disappointed. The ending is quite anti-climactic for those who have read Roses are Red. The whole vampire plot sounds good when you read it on the jacket, but turns out to make this a weak entry in a great series. The ending is anything but thrilling, making the reader miss the quality writing exhibited in Kiss the Girls. Hopefully, Patterson is not falling into the trap of sacrificing quality for quantity. With any luck, the next novel will find Alex Cross back in top form."},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"After reading Roses and Red, I did what I rarely do, preorder a hardbound fiction book. Violets are Blue, Patterson's latest, takes our beloved Alex Cross to investigate macabre killings on both sides of the country. The antagonist of the last novel, the Mastermind, takes a backseat in the first 2/3 of the book, other than intermittent cell phone rantings. When the eventual confrontation takes place, in some respects, it feels like an exhaustive afterthought. Minor SPOILER**: Eventually Alex Cross does figure out who the Mastermind is, however you wish he would have spent more time explaining to us how he finally figured it out."},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"Violets are Blue is pathetic. The vampire killings, which take up a good chunk of the book, are repulsive and not very interesting. The previous book, Roses are Red, revealed the true identity of the Mastermind, but reading this, you would think his identity was a surprise. Patterson goes out of his way to overwrite scenes involving the Mastermind to not reveal his identity until the last 60 pages. I have to admit, the last 60 pages are terrific, because the vampire story is over and the confrontation between Alex and the Mastermind finally takes center stage. The mind games are the reason I read Patterson, and why his best books like Jack and Jill work so well. When Alex finally realizes that the Mastermind is someone he knows, the scene is so poorly written, you would think that he stubbed his toe. I think his reaction should be more than &quot;disappointment.&quot; Overall, I would say this is slightly better than Roses are Red, but the two books could have easily been combined. I hope the next Alex Cross gets back to what makes the series great."},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"I got an Advanced Reader Copy of this, so I have had a long time to think about if I liked it or didn't.

First, we have the silly tale of a sub-culture of modern \\"vampires\\", who are killing at an alarming rate, sometimes with the help of a tiger that only they can command. This story alone made this a pretty sick book. Finally, Patterson attempts to bring some closure to some of the earlier Alex Cross books by disposing of the \\"Mastermind\\", who really killed many of the victims wrongly attributed to other mass murderers in the previous books. The identity of the \\"Mastermind\\" was very dissappointing, and even laughable. Forgive me, but I couldn't take this book seriously.

As with all of Patterson's books, this is an exceptionally quick read with very short chapters. This is nice if you only have a few minutes to devote to the book and don't want to stop in the middle of a lengthy chapter. That being said, knowing who the Mastermind was throughout the book really ruined the fun that Patterson normally provides his readers. Very easily, he could have ended Rose are Red without giving away Kyle Craig and then not revealed him until Alex sees Kyle outside Jamilla's apartment...now that would have knocked me out of my chair.

It was a fine continuation to the Alex Cross series, but as a stand-alone book, I'm not so sure I'd feel the same. Also, I (like many other reviewers) was really bothered by the way The Mastermind's identity was revealed in &quot;Roses Are Red.&quot; I think it would have made much more sense for Patterson to write this book more like he wrote &quot;Along Came A Spider,&quot; where the READER knows the identity, but must wait for Alex Cross to figure it out.

This book grabs the reader early and does not let go, effectively weaving together two main storylines (a cross-country murder spree and the Mastermind's pursuit of Alex Cross). Clearly, however, the book is not for the feint of heart - the body count is substantial and the vampire murders are described in graphic detail. Delicate subject matter notwithstanding, Patterson kept me turning the pages."},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"I had previously liked several &quot;Detective Alex Cross&quot; mysteriesby James Patterson . . . however, for some reason, I had stoppedreading them as of late . . . so I decided to revisit the genre by listening toVIOLETS ARE BLUE, the tale of a series of murders that appearto have been caused by vampires.As with Patterson's other books featuring Cross (think KISS THEGIRLS, ALONG CAME A SPIDER), etc., you'll find yourselfdrawn into Cross' compelling character . . . and wanting to find outwhat happens next in his love life and/or with his family.The actual plot kept me interested until the end . . .

I really enjoyed it as I have all other Alex Cross books.Alex Cross has a real piece of work cut out for him in this book. He is appalled by the gruesome murders of two joggers in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park-killings that look more like the work of savage beasts than humans. Local police are horrified and even the FBI is baffled. Then, as Cross is called in to take on the case, the carnage takes off, leaving a trail of bodies across America, and sweeping him to Savannah, Las Vegas, New Orleans, and Los Angeles. The merciless criminal known as the Mastermind, stalks him and taunts him, and once again threatens everything he holds dear."},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"I read everything he comes out with. He is my favorite author and can't wait for each new book. He makes you think that Alex Cross is real and you come to feel like you know him and his family. After reading his last Alex Cross novel, I couldn't help but tell my husband that I didn't know what I would do once his grandmother (in the book) died, she seems so real. Read one of these book and you will be hooked!"},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"Honestly, I felt that this book was rushed. All I wanted to know was Who, What, When, Where and Why the Mastermind is all about and his true agendas!! In Roses are Red, James Patterson told you who the Mastermind was at the end of the book even though he decieved you a couple of times during the read. I felt he didn't have enough material about the Mastermind, so he included a story of vampire killings, maybe trying to throw you off the Mastermind. In this book there were a little twist but not enough to make your jaw drop like in his previous books. If your a Patterson fan I would buy the book if not just read this at the library...it much cheaper!!"},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"The first novel I read of James Patterson's was Along Came A Spider and I was caught in his web.

It would take a great deal of convincing to entice me into reading any of his future novels."},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"I used to look forward to Patterson's novels, especially the Alex Cross ones, but lately each one just keeps getting more and more unbearable. I thought Roses Are Red was bad...that is until I picked up Violets Are Blue. This book is so bad I would have called it trash but I think too highly of trash to do so. I think Patterson should read some of the previous reviews before sitting down and scribbling any more of his pseudo-thriller nonsense and drivel. I usually can finish a Patterson book, no matter how bad it is, in a day or two, but this one has been gathering dust on my nightstand for going on one full week. His plots have become so far-fetched that as a reader I am offended he thinks so poorly of his audience. I realize these books are supposed to be light fiction but to have the nerve to charge [list price] for what amounts to at most 2 or 3 paragraphs per page is rediculous.For all of you out there who have not bought this book and are considering doing so, take some advice from Mr. Patterson's latest victim...settle for reading all of the 1 and 2 star reviews listed here.

Violets are blue is not all that bad. But it greatly lacks of depth and this is a serious flaw in book writing. If you torn the page off right from around page 240 onwards, voila!!! you have 2 novels. One's about the vampire and one is about the payback with the so called Mastermind in which it is absolutely irrelevant. My opinion is, he could've just add a couple of pages more on Roses are Red and finish it off and start with clean sheet with whatever title he would like to put. Having it like now is just utter silly.

The ending wasn't even surprising or thrilling as it should be... I gave this a four star because it was such an easy read and it was thrilling at many other points in the story.

It is also at the end of the book where the reader learns who was the Mastermind of those crimes. However, Detective Cross is not privy to this information just yet.VIOLETS ARE BLUE continues where the last book left off. In this case, Cross is investigating a rash of brutal killings involving wild tigers and \`vampires' while the Mastermind keeps taunting him with harassing phone calls. It is not necessary to know whom the Mastermind is in order to enjoy the book but I would recommend one read ROSES ARE RED before jumping to this book.Unfortunately, I cannot say that I loved this book. The \`vampire' subplot reads more like filler before the showdown between Cross and Mastermind. I was having trouble making sense of the vampire story. I could not empathize with the characters involved, what their motives were and the reasons for their actions.

Write simple sentences. Don't use big words or describe people wearing colors other than black or \\"powder blue.\\"2. Dialogue should be monotonous. Have your characters say the same thing over and over. Especially the hero. He has to bemoan his life yet cheer himself on in the next breath, reminding himself how great he is. Over and over. Bemoan, cheer, repeat! If that doesn't work, have other people say the same thing. Bemoan, cheer, repeat!3. Keep your chapters short. Three pages is pushing it.4. Take a subculture -- like goths -- and exploit them in the most obnoxiously ignorant way. Use the real names of their clubs in Los Angeles, and make sure every person depicted is a lunatic, a drug addict, or both. Get everything wrong, even if getting it right would make your story more complex and interesting. Don't even try to understand said subculture. They won't know! They'll never read your book, anyway!5. Don't worry about the accuracy of anything you write. Geography, culture, language -- it's fiction! You can do what you want!6. Kill a lot of people.7. Make your villians go to Vegas. No reason. Just get them there. You've got to write off that trip to Vegas for your taxes somehow...Wow! I'm ready now to write a commercially successful thriller. It'll take about a month.But please shoot me first."},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"James Patterson's Violets Are Blue is another of his Alex Cross mysteries, which are always a good summer read. However, some are better than others and this isn't one of his best efforts. I'd rate it 2-1/2 stars.In Violets Are Blue, Dr. Cross has yet to jump ship to the FBI and is still working for the Washington, DC police force. He is called to San Francisco when two joggers are found brutally murdered. Their bodies are hung upside down from a tree and most of their blood has been drained from their bodies. Their deaths seem to be the work of savages, and Cross had a similar unsolved case back in DC. At the same time, he is being stalked by The Mastermind, a psychopathic criminal who seems to have a love/hate relationship with Cross. Cross teams with the capable homicide detective from San Francisco, Jamilla Hughes. Together, they crisscross the country, trying to follow the trail of savage killings as they try to find the key.I have enjoyed all of Patterson's books, although the plot to Violets Are Blue is just a bit of a stretch with the vampire angle. Also, the discovery of the identity of The Mastermind was a complete surprise, but also a bit unbelievable. In Patterson's defense, I would have probably enjoyed it more had I read this book before The Big Bad Wolf. If you're a Patterson fan, you have to read Violets Are Blue. It will tie up some loose ends from previous books. I will continue to read the exploits of Alex Cross--even though not all Patterson's are created equal."},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"This book was fast-paced and had an interesting premise, but the writing was lacking. It was sloppy. Alex Cross is still a great character though; that never changes."},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"I've read every Patterson novel published thus far and I would rate this in a lower group that his top tier (Kiss the Girls, Along Came a Spider, Cat and Mouse, and Roses are Red). As with all of Patterson's novels, this is an exceptionally quick read with very short chapters. This is nice if you only have a few minutes to devote to the book and don't want to stop in the middle of a lengthy chapter. That being said, knowing who the Mastermind was throughout the book (from Roses are Red) ruined what could have been an absolute \\"fall out of your chair\\" surprise. Patterson could have ended Roses without giving the Mastermind's identity, not revealing him until Alex sees him outside Jamilla's apartment...now that would have been outstanding! Violets are Blue is still face-paced and I enjoyed being bounced around as vampires appeared and then vanished, leaving death and mayhem in their wake."},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"One of the top fiction writers of today and the true master of suspense is James Patterson. At twenty-seven years of age his debut novel, The Thomas Berryman Number, won the Edgar Award for the best first mystery novel. This novel was followed by a string of national bestsellers that include seven books with the main character in each being detective/psychologist Alex Cross- beginning with Along Came a Spider, to the more current novels Roses are Red and its sequel Violets are Blue. Violets are Blue is Patterson's latest #1 best selling novel to hit stores in the paperback edition.Violets are Blue continues the mystery featuring Cross' nemesis, The Mastermind, a psychotic genius who has been on a killing spree for many years, but add ann unexpected twist to the novel- a second mystery. Mystery two is revealed when two joggers turn up dead in San Francisco and soon after people are turning up in various cities just like the two killed in San Francisco. The victims are found hanging upside down, bitten, and drained of their blood. The second part of the thriller revolves around vampires. The vampire angle is intertwined throughout the book with the Mastermind angle. Cross chases the vampire killers all across the United States. Alex is assisted in the gruesome investigation by SFPD detective Jamilla Hughes and FBI investigator Kyle Craig. As usual Alex Cross is just one step behind the murderers, arriving at one horrific murder scene after another.As one mystery (the vampire angle) climaxes and is close to being solved, the other angle heats up. The Mastermind stalks and taunts Alex by continuously threatening his life and the lives of the people he loves. The identity of the Mastermind is revealed and the roles are reversed. Alex Cross becomes the hunter and sets out to capture the monstrous killer.All of Patterson's novels have been fast-paced with a high energy level from beginning to end, making his books hard to put down. What makes Patterson unique, and the reason he is one of my favorite authors, is his writing style. His short chapters make the reader feel like the book isn't so intimidatingly long. The reading seems easy and therefore the reader wants to continue on without interruption. I also like how Patterson's style changes from chapter to chapter. Some chapters are written in first person point of view where Patterson tells the story through Alex's eyes. In other chapters he writes a third person narrative of the killers.Violets are Blue is written in the same tradition and writing style, making it a great book to read. The book was full of suspense and had a strong impact. The only downfall to this novel was that it was too predictable, other than that I thought the novel was excellent. James Patterson once again proves, he is one of the best suspense-thriller novelists of today."},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"This addition to the Alex Cross series, while not as good as the others, is still well worth the read, and has some great high points, chief among those being the fact that it is two books in one.Aficionadoes of the Alex Cross series know that the identity of the Mastermind, one of the most fiendish villains yet, was revealed on the last page of \\"Roses Are Red.\\" I literally put down that book and picked up this one, continuing to read as if it were Part 2. I HAD to see how, when, or if Cross would figure it out. Patterson kept me on tenterhooks for a good long time, and that gave an extra element of suspense to the book. That's the lure of \\"Book 1,\\" if you will.But for those who might have picked up Violets Are Blue out of order, or as a quick airport read, \\"Book 2\\" is just as good, and the revelation of the Mastermind's true identity as shocking as it was the first time. There are major flaws in the plot, however. The continued behavior of Christine, who has given up her own child, is annoying at best, mind-boggling at worst. The vampire cult is simply not believeable because of the extreme (blood drinking) lengths of the behavior of its members. I found myself wondering how John Samson could give up his day job as a cop at will and go off to spend weeks at a time guarding Cross's family. The connection of the Mastermind with the vampires is never entirely clear, and his after-the-fact link with former criminals such as Casanova and the Gentleman Caller made no sense at all, because it was not explained enough to make sense.Hence, the three stars. But it must be stressed that as a reader, I loved this book anyway, and am impatiently awaiting the next one in the series."},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"Let me start off by saying that this is my fourth book in the Alex Cross series; &quot;Along Came a Spider&quot; was excellent, &quot;Kiss the Girls&quot; was much the same. I found &quot;Roses are Red&quot; to be a very entertaining continuation of the type and style of book that &quot;Along Came a Spider&quot; was--that is, a psychological story involving an intelligent, unpredictable enemy. However, unlike Patterson's first two Alex Cross books, &quot;Roses are Red&quot; was written with the intention of creating a cliffhanger ending, most likely to drive sales of his latest work, &quot;Violets are Blue&quot;.After reading &quot;Roses are Red&quot;, I immediately picked up &quot;Violets are Blue&quot;, expecting an immediate continuation of the predecessor's story. Instead, what I go was 300 pages of a poorly written, highly erratic story that desperately tried to stretch the length of the book out past the realm of a long essay. In fact, Patterson doesn't focus on the main story line until 3/4 of the way through the book. And, what's worse, the first 3/4 of the book deals with a laughable plot involving a cult of vampire-like killers, terrorizing unknown prey. Give me a break! If I expected or wanted horror/cult-related stories, I'd buy a Stephen King or Clive Barker novel. Obviously, fiction readers expect a certain level of the impossible; but we also appreciate well-written, highly realistic stories. &quot;Violets are Blue&quot; fails both these expectations.So, my advice to any first-time Patterson readers or would-be Alex Cross fans: read &quot;Along Came a Spider&quot; and &quot;Kiss the Girls&quot;. If you're still curious, pick up a copy of &quot;Roses are Red&quot;, knowing that you'll be left hanging. But should you opt to read the [supposed] conclusion, &quot;Violets are Blue&quot;, don't expect much. The book doesn't read as fast as Patterson's others, nor is it as satisfying. Without knowing what &quot;Four Blind Mice&quot; will be like, the next Alex Cross novel, I can only hope that Patterson realizes he needs a major story change; he's been trying to emulate his best, most original works and failing miserably."},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"I just had to comment on this book again. I read it about 3 months ago and am still amazed that the bad feelings I have for Violets are Blue are still so strong.Vampires are on the loose and are killing people across the country. Cross follows them everywhere. There are plenty of twists but no turns. A lot of stuff happens, and Cross and Co. never can figure out why. But the problem is, Patterson never reveals to the reader any reason to care about the vampire killings. Two things amazed me: how inept the police were in finding the killers, and how Patterson came up with this convoluted crazy stupid plot.Then there is the whole mastermind fiasco. The mastermind is the villian from the book Roses are Red. After reading that, you know who the Mastermind is, so throughout this book, the reader is left to wonder when Cross will find out who it is. Then in the last several pages, Patterson throws in what he probably thought was a clever plot point about the mastermind in tying him to several other crimes, but its not clever if it's not explained. I was left just shaking my head. It would have been cool if it had made sense or been feasible or possible. But what Patterson described was both impossible and ridiculous.I guess in Patterson's world, all serial killers operate with a personal vendetta against Cross. That seems to be the plot in every book.Patterson is a great writer. I enjoyed 2nd Chance much more than this book. He just needs to work on his plots a little more."},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"After reading Violets are Blue, I have to say that after six previous Alex Cross novels, James Patterson has finally got it right.Violets are Blue contains two main story lines. The first story line is about two demented brothers who believe that they are vampires and travel across the United States murdering people. They tie thier victims upside down and drain them of thier blood by pucturing thier necks. Washington, D.C. Detective Alex Cross is assigned to investigate the case along with San Fransico Detective Jamilla Hughes. As the investigation continues, Alex and Jamilla become increasingly attracted to each other.The secondary plot line would be the continuous taunting of Alex Cross by someone who calls himself \\"The Mastermind\\". The Mastermind continuously calls Alex and threatens him, as well as his family.I have to say that I was truly satisfied when I completed this novel. The main plot line was horrifyingly unique and the secondary plot line was a creative way to add to the suspense of the story.If I had to say one negative comment about the story, it would be that the murders were slightly too graphic for my taste. Creating extremley grotesque crime scenes is a cheap way to add to the suspense of the novel, but thankfully, it was not used that much.All in all, I would gladly recommed this novel to anyone who apperciates a good murder mystery and has a tough enough stomach to read through the gruesome details that Mr. Patterson provides."},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"Much of my reading is done on my lunch hour and I could barely devour my sandwiches on some days. Violets Are Blue delves into the murky, bloodbath lives of vampires and cults. Patterson was unrelenting in his descriptions of the multiple deaths and almost relished in making each one worse. The reader already knows the Mastermind if they had read Roses Are Red, but Alex Cross does not. How can this wonderfully brilliant detective whom I have loved throughout the previous books could not fathom or even guess the identity is beyond me. There was no suspense here - it was as plain as day. What happened to Sampson - he only appeared briefly and this is Alex's partner? Character development was shallow. If this is where Patterson is heading, I will no longer be reading his works unless they are in the vein (no pun intended) of Suzannah's Diary for Nicholas.I still like his writing style of short chapters urging the reader on to the next one. Many readers object to this.Being a naive person I surely did learn a lot about vampires and the activities that actually exist today. Maybe I want to remain naive!"},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"i love the alex cross novels, but this one was just plain goofy. he shouldn't have written it; it reads like a 'trashy novel'. his serial killer books are fascinating..and best of all, they're realistic. that's a large part of what makes them scary. this is not scary, it's ridiculous. don't waste your time."},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"My first book by James Patterson was &quot;Along Came A Spider&quot;. Since then, I have been hooked. I just can't wait for his books to hit the shelves. When I was in the US, I bought an autographed copy of &quot;Cat and Mouse&quot; and it is now sitting proudly on the top of my shelf.This time around, in &quot;Violets Are Blue&quot;, James Patterson writes about ritualistic killings and mind games. As usual, the protagonist in this story is Dr. Alex Cross. This book is slightly twisted and weird. However, according to the author, such events (or the existence of vampires) do occur in real life. Much research was done on this topic for the book.I think this book is the darkest of all James Patterson's books so far. I mean, vampires and ritualistic killings really put the creeps into everyone. I didn't mind so much the kidnappers, serial murderers and schizophrenic killers. But, vampires really give me the creeps.Overall, I still think this book is worth reading. James Patterson's style of writing makes reading his novels easy. I like the short paragraphs and quick flow of action.If you are reading James Patterson's books for the first time, I would suggest that you get &quot;Along Came A Spider&quot; first before reading this, in case you think all his novels are so dark."},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"Caution: This book contains much gross violence of the sort that appeals to teenage boys. If such things upset you, definitely skip this book. Much of the violence is not essential to the story. The language is frequently vulgar, expressing Mr. Patterson's way of capturing colloquial English.The last two pages of Roses Are Red, the prior Alex Cross novel, reveal the identity of one of the bad guys in Violets Are Blue. Your enjoyment of Violets Are Blue will be vastly reduced if you know who did it in advance. If you decide to read that book, stop at page 398 and cover page 399 with a sheet of paper so you don't accidentally see any material on it. Then read this book. After that, go back and read pages 399 and 400 of Roses Are Red. Also, be careful which reviews you read of both of these books. Some reviews reveal this information as an ultimate spoiler, harming your enjoyment of two books.\\"You're next, Dr. Cross.\\" The hunter becomes the hunted in this unusual novel about finding mass murderers. How would you feel if your cell phone caller told you that you were the next person to be mutilated and murdered? That's part of the suspense of this book.The main story line in Violets Are Blue is locating and stopping a murder spree being conducted by people who kill others so that they die from loss of blood. The way they lose this blood is not for the squeamish. Variations on this grossness are developed to be sure you get the maximum shock value. I found the story contrived, unrealistic, and unappealing. On the other hand, if you like old vampire movies, you may see this as high camp and a lot of fun. Who knows?What Mr. Patterson does best is write plots, so with a weak plot here, there's not much good I can say about the book. It has the usual hard-to-differentiate characters, uninspiring dialogue, lack of any police procedure worth mentioning, and description of crime in mostly amoral terms.Now, if Mr. Patterson were to write locked room mysteries, he would really be something. In his concept here of trying to describe being a metropolitan detective dealing with Stephen King figures, his talent just doesn't work.If you really love Alex Cross books, go ahead and read this one. But remember that I warned you that you probably wouldn't like it! If you have read Roses Are Red, you will probably like this book much less. If you have read the last two pages of Roses Are Red, you may actually find this book annoying. I did. Be forewarned!Where does providing too much, make something less? Certainly, eating more when you are already overstuffed is one example. Having a gruesome murder or crime occur every few pages may be another.Seek the right balance in all that you do, so you can have the clear perspective to see the best opportunities for improvement!"},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"If you're a fan of James Patterson ( or of his primary character, Alex Cross ) be kind to yourself and avoid this poorly plotted, developed, and -sadly - written addition to the ouvre.

If you're new to the Alex Cross novels, don't let this one put you off the entire collection. The others are much, much better.

For some reason, Patterson decided to put in a vampire subplot that only partially works. His fast pacing lends itself well to story, and the twists are as good as ever. Thankfully, the pursuit of the Mastermind provides the excitement readers will crave after the fantastic previous novel."},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"I don't usually bother to review books here but this book was so awful I felt compelled to take the time. I love mysteries, thrillers, suspense novels - whatever you'd like to call them. This book was none of those. A prior reviewer was correct - Patterson seemed to be making a word salad to fill up the pages. I was in my car this morning forcing myself to listen to the very end of this crap - mostly so I could honestly say I read the book - and heard the same SENTENCE repeated at least 3 times in one chapter. The end is particularly dreadful with endless repetition of Cross' worries, feelings, stupid random thoughts. Who will be killed next? He goes through his list ad nauseum several times. Total dreck."},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"This is an early Patterson novel, about Detective Alex Cross, the protagonist that made Patterson famous, a book written when he had only 17 other books to his credit, when he only had one that was written with someone else. Today, although less than a decade has passed, this franchise writer has about three times that number to his credit, most of which were written with others. The books he writes alone are far superior to the others. He draws his readers into a suspenseful well-told story. This is, therefore, one of his better books.There are two crime plots and the general Cross family story that Patterson tells so well, with pathos, love, and schmaltz. One crime drama focuses on vampires, those who \\"know\\" that they are real vampires and thrill seekers who play at it or who just think they are real. The vampires have killed people and drained their blood for some eleven years. The \\"real\\" ones are charismatic and have an almost hypnotic draw over their victims.The second plot concerns \\"the mastermind\\" who calls Cross daily, harasses him, and threatens that he will kill him. He knows all about Cross, where he is and what he is doing. He kills people that Cross likes, including his female partners, because he wants to hurt him. His praises himself constantly on his intelligence and on his ability to hide from Cross and torment him."},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"This was such a fast and enjoyable read that I got though it pretty fast, about two evenings of reading and once done I was ready for the next book, that's what I love about them the most, the need to know more and more, endings are never satisfying enough when it comes to Alex Cross books. The main character grows through the series and develops into someone that the reader cares and certainly worries about. Sometimes I forget that when Patterson writes these books, that he creates the good and the bad guys, and when the good guy is betrayed the surprise and pain feels very genuine, the images in my head feel like a real story and Alex's life is changing in front of my eyes, usually there's a lot of pain and suffering but also romance, which after all mimics real life.Book seven picks up right where \\"Roses are red\\" leaves off and Alex is still being haunted by the mysterious Mastermind. The reader of course knows who that is because of the ending of Roses, but the way this is written really plays tricks on the mind, since the killer is in the book a lot and their interaction is unnerving to read. Also his personal life is picking up again, but anyone knows that the women Alex dates are always in grave danger so he's a bit apprehensive about new prospects and treads that area carefully, it always amazes me that he has time for love but heck, man can't live on homicides alone, so why not. There are more bizarre deaths in this book, murders that look as if they were done by vampires and also there are some large cats praying on joggers in parks, a mish mash of random stuff that ties up in the end but isn't more interesting than the fight to capture the Mastermind. Alex's hate and anger towards the criminal grows to the point where he has a hard time not wanting to kill the guy to avenge his killings, while his conscience feels that it's not the right way to go about it, so the internal battle starts...For biggest impact I highly recommend starting the series from book 1, people who start with book seven might not find it as intense as I have, because so much previous history is unknown to them, the layers really add up to make the story rich and vivid.- Kasia S."},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"The Dragon Slayer becomes a Vampire Slayer???

James Patterson does it in less pages than most, which is great. Many twists, and just when you think you figured it out, another change in direction.

A great author doing something different. There will never be another &quot;Kiss the Girls&quot; or an &quot;Along Came A Spider&quot; so quit expecting every new Patterson novel to be better then the previous one. I enjoy a James Patterson novel for a few reasons: #1 The great character of Alex Cross who is always evolving #2 A memborable villain is always introduced that is not one dimensional #3 A great plot with lots of action, suspense and twists to keep you guessing. I also love the short chapters that keep you turning and turning the pages. My only gripes with these books are the chapters dealing with cross's family. I hate the constant banter back and forth between family members, it gets really repetative and annoying. But besides that, this book excelled at everything I l look for and would recommend it to anyone looking for a great mystery, suspense procedural book.Thanks.P.S. a suggestion to Mr. Patterson: How about a book with Cross finally investigating the murder of his wife. This is something that has always bothered me and I just feel that an outstanding detective like Cross would not be able to rest until his Wife's killer is caught. Just a suggestion"},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"I loved it. I read 'Roses are Red', 2 days later got this. Awesome.

But sadly, I must say that Patterson has lost his way and Alex is adrift. This book was a major disappointment. The story line was totally implausible and the &quot;Mastermind&quot; story line was absurd and humorous. Trying to top the antagonists of the past may have caused Mr. Patterson to go so far over the top that his readers are unable to clear the hurdle. Traveling all over the country, chasing each grisly murder, with no rhyme or reason was just as an unrewarding for the reader as it was perplexing for the &quot;Detectives&quot; attmpting to solve the murders. All the old characters (Sampson, Nana Mama, Christine, the kids, and others) are mentioned, but you don't feel them, you can't see them, the characters have no substance or depth. They have become caricatures. They no longer feel real. Yes, the book moves at a fast pace as events explode one after another, but this is a novel. Let the screenwriters pen the screenplay Mr. Patterson. Next time write us another great Alex Cross Novel. This was an Alex Cross hatchet job."},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"This book will be very disapointing to Alex Cross fans. I can still remember how impressed I was with the ealier books - and that makes this one even more disappointing. I felt like James Patterson was actually trying to write this book so that it could easily be adapted for the &quot;big screen&quot;."},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"The differences are amazing. Compared to Flesh and Blood, this novel reads like an episode of scooby doo, with more violence. Where's the actual suspense and detecitve work here? Alex Cross simply goes to crime scene after crime scene, following the muderer around until he stumbles upon him. The one bit of detectivie work was figuring out the link between the cities. No other speculation, clues, or other ideas. Not many suspects to choose from either. We knew who 2 of the murderers were, and anyone who reads James Patterson's books already knew that there were more than 2 killers. So no plot twist there. Other than that, there were 2 possiblities for the sire, the 2 'experts' that cross interviewed... pick the name out of a hat, and there's the sire! No explanation about motives either. At least scooby doo episodes had some sort of motivation for the crime. Compare this to Kellerman's novel where there was actual police investigation, many possible suspects, and many theories thought out logically. THAT is a novel for a thinking adult, this is a brainless outline of a novel.And then there's the tacked on issue of the Mastermind. First, and most annoying, it seemed like Patterson forgot that he revealed the identity of the mastermind at the end of the last novel. That ruins the mastermind portion of this novel, making 0 suprises through the whole thing. Also, if you're going to reference occurences from 3 or 4 novels past, a little bit more detail would really be nice to refresh the reader's mind. I read Kiss the Girls over 4 years ago... am i supposed to remember what happened there, what the Mastermind did in that novel? It all seems just a little bit of a stretch to tie together every single alex cross novel ever written.Oh, yes, one more comment... I counted apporoximately 130 pages of blank space in the book (probably more, i was generous in my counting). Take that with the huge font size and the large margins, and you barely have a novella, let alone a novel.I KNOW Patterson can do much better... I recall his earlier novels being well written. So what's happened to this once great author?"},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"THIS IS BY FAR THE WORST BOOK THAT I HAVE EVER READ IN MY 70 YOUNG YEARS..THE TRASH WAS TO GOOD FOR THE BOOK, SO IT WENT INTO THE FIREPLACE!!"},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"In a mystery or thriller book--indeed, in all good works--a little filler goes a long way. Patterson apparently is unaware of this dictum. In &quot;Violets Are Blue,&quot; most of the prose is filler, padding, refrains. Especially irritating are the superficial ruminations by the main character; these repeat the same whining mantra throughout the book. What little actual plot line that does exist is tenuous and amateurish, containing almost no examples of real detective work. Elementary police processes--DNA testing, hair, skin, and blood samples, fingerprints--are never employed; had they been, the hero would have solved the &quot;puzzle&quot; quickly. In many places it seems like a bad imitation of the marvelous &quot;Red Dragon&quot; (which, if you haven't yet read, you should). Finally, the ending is all too predictable, as any reader will find.

It was a fast paced Alex Cross chasing the serial killers book with some surprises. It actually had two different cases going on at the same time, which made it all the more interesting.

I just can't accept the premise that there are vampire cults or cells across the country and that these weirdos actually kill people to drink their blood. I could accept it in Bram Stoker and Anne Rice, who wrote romances, what ifs, in artistic fashion. I was able to suspend my disbelief mechanism for them, but not for this book.Another serious problem is the re-introduction of the downright silly villain, \\"The Mastermind\\" from \\"Roses Are Red.\\" It felt as if Patterson couldn't deal with the blood suckers any longer and still had pages to fill, so he tossed in a second plot that wasn't really connected.In the rush to get books out, perhaps the writer is not thinking these plots through.

'Violets are blue' is indeed another great book, with short sentences and you cannot wait until the next chapter starts. But ...Patterson should have split this book into two different books. The dark and frightening descriptions of the murders and the vampire gatherings are chilling, but as another reviewer has said, Patterson should have left Mastermind (detective Alex Cross' arch-nemesis) out of this story. It has nothing to do with the main theme (vampirism) and the different themes don't mix well. It's still a page turner, but not his best work."},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"There are no great suprises in this typical outing from James Patterson.

Violets Are Blue is James Patterson's best book since... any of them. There have been killings from the west to the east coast and Alex can't figure out who or what is doing these horrific murders. Is it The Mastermind, some magicians, a couple of young kids, or his closest friend? The Mastermind isn't helping either. He is still harassing Alex and he will never stop. Or will Alex end this nonsense with his worst enemy. Alex goes on a wild goose chase across the country to find who is killing these people. The worst part is they have no leads.My favorite chapter is when you find out who The Mastermind is and why he is talking Alex.

But unlike 1st to Die, it appears that this book was rushed to print without the editors taking enough time to polish it up. First, there are way too many murders. The book would have worked better if it had focused on one or two murders, with the threat of another ticking like a time bomb throughout. Instead, he has the characters running in too many directions. And, you never get the feeling of tension and fear that comes when you know another murder is going to be committed and you think, hurry, character! Don't let the next person die! You don't feel that here. Also, Patterson uses redundant language. I'm a writer, editor and aspiring novelist, so I read with more of a critical eye than some. But I never use the same word twice two sentences in a row. He does it over and over and over. (Example: If he calls a character by name, he'll use her name again in the next sentence, instead of referring to her in the pronoun form in the second usage. Or, if he uses the word \\"though\\" in one sentence, he uses it again in the next sentence.) In the end of the book, he completely gives away the killer, instead of letting the reader discover the killer through clues. Finally, I like white space, but there's more air in this book, I think, than text. If the pages had been tightened up, it would have taken up half the space."},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"Overall, a decent story.

Personally I always enjoyed his earlier books, they were more meaty. In this book Mr. Patterson proves that no one can write more than one book a year and be good at it. Violets are Blue is a terrible book. Before the book is half over we have figured out who the bad guy is and why. He's writing to a formula and like Robert Parker, with Spenser, his main character has been been lost to the lure of big money, i.e. multiple publishing deals and movies.

I wish Alex's kids had more of an intergral part of the stories, bit that might not be a good move.I was a little disappinted in the truth telling about the 'Mastermind', but I guess it helps with solving the current stoies. It was pretty predictablble about the identity of the Mastermind, but that made the story go a lot quicker. I liked the novel, and I didn't like it. It was a little too easy to read and not challenging enough."},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"Okay, I really wanted to love this book. It has all the earmarks of something I'd enjoy - cults, vampires, the hint of the erotic and even a half dozen or so psychopaths of various makes and models. I'll say up front, I believe that this COULD have been a wonderful book. It had potential beyond earlier Alex Cross novels to grow into something larger than life, but instead, for me, it simply nose-dived and fell flat. Here are a few reasons.There is a wonderfully dark set of twins who are played up, built up, and then, in the end, fizzle, all of the hints at a grand plan and intricate plot evaporate.There is the sub-plot of this killer, \\"The Mastermind,\\" who has stalked Cross through several cases now and killed his partners. Starting with the fact that \\"The Mastermind\\" sounds like the moniker of a big worm in a Shazam Comic Book, this guy rings false and is intrusive. When Hannibal Lector was outwitting the FBI and the world at every turn, we were shown how, and why he was smarter. \\"The Mastermind\\" just does whatever he wants, never an explanation of how, or why people don't catch him...just that he's \\"very mysterious\\" (Like The Sphinx in the movie \\"Mystery Men,\\" you want to say...that's it?)When the secret is \\"revealed,\\" you realize that all the hints you thought were written in to put you off the scent and allow the climax to be wonderful were not hints at all, but blunt plot hammers giving away the ending. There is no wonderful climax...he's \\"outed\\" to any discerning reader less than halfway through the book and only world-class-detective Cross is too stupid to get it.In their own book, The Casanova Killer, and The Gentleman Caller of \\"Kiss the Girls\\" fame loomed larger than life and were creepy as hell. The way Patterson keeps bringing all the killers up, though, and having \\"The Mastermind\\" think about them, you get this warped vision of a an underworld filled with prancing sexual killers too smart to be caught, hanging out and partying together like it was a secret club. It begins, in other words, to seem ridiculous, and that is how it stays. The worst of it is that not a chapter after complaining about a particular home appliance and commenting on how he doesn't have one, Cross uses that very thing to get the evidence he still (for unknown reasons) believes he will need to put the Mastermind away...So...to sum it up, this is not Patterson's best effort. A couple of times he gets in the groove and you think he's painting his way toward a masterpiece, then he hits the next chapter and slaps some paint on Pollock style, not really worrying how much it muddies up the careful work that has gone before, and in the end he wraps it all up too quickly, leaves loose ends unraveled all over the place, and tries to pretend like the whole book was really about Cross and \\"The Mastermind\\" all along. It's a very weak book, and I get the impression that the author hurried through it to get past the rut that these two antagonists have left the series in and get on with Cross' life. Otherwise I have to conclude he's fallen into the trap of just writing predictable series fiction as fast as he can thinking readers will buy whatever he dishes out - which unfortunately is true enough to keep a lot of lazy authors in the money. Recommended only vaguely for it's delving into the odd sub-culture of \\"real vampires\\" and recommended only with the cautionary qualification that I was horribly disappointed, overall."},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"While I won't say that \\"Violets are Blue\\" is the worst book I've ever read, it is certainly in the top (or is that bottom) ten. I liked some of Patterson's earlier novels but the last two I've read have been dreadful. \\"First to Die\\" was bad enough; this one was worse. First, the plot is ludicrous. He tries to juggle two stories and does a poor job with both. The main plot, if you can call it that, deals with alleged vampires. It is overly graphic and meandering, with lots of loose ends. Most ridiculous is the fact that after chasing the villains around the country, without being able to find out even who they are, our hero suddenly wraps up the chase in an abrupt and totally preposterous manner. Clever police work has nothing to do with it; all of a sudden, a small town that is supposedly \\"vampire central\\" shows up on Alex Cross' radar scope, he goes there, and the vampires are all together waiting to be caught. It's outlandish. The second plot, dealing with the character known as the Mastermind, is equally stupid. I had not read \\"Roses are Red\\" where the identity of the Mastermind is apparently revealed but it didn't matter. Anyone who can't figure out who it is halfway through should turn in his or her library card. Second, the book is sloppily written; to give one example, there is a couple victimized by the vampires about a third of the way in. In the scene where the vampires attack them, the man's wife calls him by his name. When the cops discover the body, he is identified by a different name. A minor point, perhaps, but an indication of how thrown together the whole thing is. Finally, the dialogue is possibly the worst I have ever read. Some of Alex Cross' thoughts are so silly, especially during the romantic interludes, that you want to laugh out loud. This is truly a bad book and the sad part of it is that Patterson can write; he had demonstated it in the past. But one cannot help but believe that he has decided to chase the quick buck; he knows that this stuff will sell so he grinds it out, presumably to satisfy his contract to produce so many books a year. The result is that he gets rich and his readers get cheated. Fortunately, I checked this out of the library so I'm not out any money; I feel sorry for those who bought it."},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"Once again, James Patterson didn't let me down in Violets Are Blue! He continues to keep my attention on what is going on with Alex Cross and the Mastermind. The chapters are short - 3 pages on average. I warn you in advance that once you start reading this, you may have a tough time putting it down, it's that good, which is the reason I give this book 5 stars. James Patterson does a fine job again."},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"Although I did enjoy this book more than 'Roses Are Red', I am diappointed in the path that Patterson's Alex Cross novels have taken. Each novel in the series since 'Cat and Mouse' has involved less police work and very little suspense. At several points in Violets are Blue, I found myself feeling as though I had read this all before - Cross asking himself questions about the killers, Cross yearning for his current partner, Cross yearning for his former partners from previous books, Cross feeling guilty for not being with his children, etc. Where is the suspense? The police work?? In Violets are Blue, Cross did nothing to catch the vampires or the Mastermind - the police find the vampires on a tip from a journalist, and Cross stumbles across the Mastermind after &quot;having a feeling&quot; - please. I hope Patterson has some better ideas for the next Cross novel."},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"I love James Patterson anytime for a quick, easy but page turning novel. Over the years I have come to depend on his Alex Cross detective series as a sure fire good book. Roses are Red was decent, and I was looking forward to reading this book as a follow up.But follow up it wasn't! Because the same exact character was again weaved throughout the book. When I first read the Mastermind called him, I thought I was imagining that he had been discovered in the last book. And then I looked back andrealized that in fact he had -- and in Violets are Blue, he was resurrected as the same exact character, right down to the end. I was so annoyed by this. And the writing in this book wasn't as good as usual, in part, because it kept detailing old crimes. It was in serious need of editing.I heard that the next new Women's Murder Club is soon to be released, and I will purchase it. As I would the next in the Cross series. But maybe it is time for Cross to take a new path in a new career. Or something. Anything. But not this again. I wanted my money back by the end.

What a great book - it starts with a bang and keeps on going!There is a vicious murder in San Francisco that looks a lot like a previous case of Alex's. So, he is off the SF to help with the investigation. This case is really creepy. As the case heats up and more murders occur, he is forced to travel from place to place gathering critical evidence. Patterson does a great job of building the tension and getting the reader wrapped up in the story. After reading about 100 pages I didn't want to put it down. It was a compelling and very well written book. My reason for taking one star away is that Alex is becoming predictable with his 'partners'. Once again he is partnered with a strong female character. Once again he finds he has romantic feeling for her. It seems a little strange that he keeps getting the same types of female partners case after case.In addition, the Mastermind is back and tormenting Alex Cross on a daily basis. Taunting him and challenging him. During this story line I found out a lot about past cases and more about Alex Cross.

That fellow used his wits and his contacts to track the bad guys down. Somewhere between \\"Jack & Jill\\" and \\"Roses are Red\\" Alex Cross got a little too big for his britches or, more accurately, a little bigger than life. One got a little tired of hearing how he was \\"better looking than Muhammad Ali\\" or how heads would turn when he walked into a restaurant with a lady on his arm or how he would take over an FBI briefing for the Director ( when he wasn't even in the FBI ) or even how crying babies magically shut up once in his arms. It got to be too much. But the old, nose-to-the -grindstone, listen to Nana Mama, Alex Cross is back. Or, at least, back for this book.\\"Violets are Blue\\" tells the tale of vampire killers - \\"real\\" vampires that is. But, don't worry, neither Bela Lugosi nor Christopher Lee are going to pop out of the shadows. These vampires bite their victims, sure, but then string them up and drain their blood. Pattison never does explain how it is they don't leave a mess ( aside from the corpse, that is ) but there is one credo that Cross does learn: \\"When you hunt the vampire, the vampire hunts you.\\" Cross, the FBI, and his latest \\"squeeze\\" from the San Francisco P.D., follow these ghouls on a cross country murder spree. Pattison's usual short page chapters are fairly well packed with action. Oh, and lest we forget, the Mastermind from \\"Roses are Red\\", whose identity we know but Cross doesn't, makes a final appearance. A relationship between the Mastermind and earlier Cross mysteries ( and I mean very earlier mysteries ) is revealed.There is still an allusion to \\"Super Hero\\" Cross. He is involved in a fist fight while having an ice peak stuck in his chest - and he wins! Still, I'll give him that one transgression because he does admit, \\"I'm always going in first. How long am I going to keep it up?\\"It's good to have you back, Alex."},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"I have not been this disappointed in a book in a long time. Found myself flipping it over to glare at the author's photograph as I trudged through. If I didn't have feelings for Alex Cross I would have bailed early on, but sadly, I saw this thing through 'til the simple-minded end.The vampire subplot was not even remotely believable, and the subject of murderous biting was done far more elegantly by Thomas Harris. An example of the lack of basic police work: due to an amazing congruence between the murder dates and the show schedule of a pair of magicians, Alex and Co. suspect them of the vampire murderers. Once they rule these poor guys out as suspects, however, they apparently neglect to screen the magicians' fans. If they'd but asked around a bit they might have caught wind of the only fans who giggled hysterically through the Shocking Fake Bloody Death Tricks AND left the show with a couple of future victims.In the same vein, that Alex Cross could stumble through the entire thing without figuring out the identity of the Mastermind, his oh-so-personal nemesis...well. One wonders if the man might best be looking for other work.Perhaps the hint at Alex as a future stay-at-home Dad is a great outcome: for him, for his kids, for law enforcement, and for us."},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"Tyger, Tyger Burning [Nearly] BrightFor some reason, James Patterson's novels about Alex Cross, the psychologist turned police detective, never seem to develop. Not that a series has to develop, but Alex Cross, for many reasons, should have more depth to him after seven novels. Especially considering the effect his investigations have on his emotional life. But he goes on about the same, with the same too perfect family, with a series of similarly unsuccessful or tragic relationships, doing the same things to the same kind of bad guys. Fortunately he generally writes well, but Patterson is in grave danger of becoming a slave to his formula.'Violets are Blue' is actually a continuation of 'Roses are Red.' It picks up the story of Alex Cross's hunt for The Mastermind with the murder of Betsey Cavaliere a FBI agent and close friend. Next time, The Mastermind's voice assures the detective over his cell phone, Alex Cross will be next. Then, abruptly, we switch to a different set of killers, a pair of young men who believe they are vampires, and are leaving a trail of gruesome death behind them. Nor do they hunt alone, a pet tiger is a frequent companion as they seek their victims du jour.This is really the primary plot, centering on an underground vampire cult that is not quite hidden from sight. Patterson uses it to reintroduce regulars like Kyle Craig and Sampson and to bring a new player on board, Inspector Jamilla Hughes of the San Francisco Police Department. With the romantic interest in hand, the plot is now ready follow its regular pattern of grisly killings, phone calls from The Mastermind and miscellaneous repartee. The vampire plot reminds me of those Russian containers that have containers in them, ad infinitum. Every time you get past on vampire, up pops another one.By the time you either discover who The Mastermind is, you will be convinced that he is one of the most overblown, silly serial killers in the genre. We are assured that The Mastermind is a mysterious genius who pulls all the strings from a distance. But the reality is much less satisfying than the hype. For some reason Patterson has peopled this novel with a string of stoned egotistical killers, all of whom last far longer than they should have. One is tempted to conclude that it is the police who keep serial killers on the streets.Sadly, with just a little bit richer plot and a dash more attention to the dimensionality of the characters, this could have been a respectable novel. Instead is simply mediocre, a pattern repeated until it begins to be tedious. I tend to blame this sort of thing on publishers, who seem to firmly believe that more of the same thing it best, especially if it is action, and that character development is a risky business. I would have thought that Patterson had enough moral fiber to resist this trend, but apparently the temptation is too great. A plague of vampires on all their houses."},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"\\"Violets Are Blue\\" is a good read. Alex Cross, ace detective and psychologist, must track down modern-day vampires while simaltaneously battling a serial killer called, 'Mastermind'. The concept is creepy. The mood is intense. The action flies by in short spurts of about three pages per chapter.The highlight is the first person perspective of Alex Cross. You sense his frustration, fear, competitiveness, anger and guilt. James Patterson wove a very complex and rich character.There is some disappointment. The vampire murders actually become monotonous. Sure, Patterson finds some creative methods of dealing with each victim, but the reader loses the intitial terror and dread as the bodies pile up. Also, 'Mastermind' is too similar to Gary Sonji, a serial killer from 'Along Came A Spider' who re-appeared in a later book. The deja vu is a lapse in creativity. We don't that kind of hook to buy the next book.With those two exceptions -- \\"Violets Are Blue\\" is a good thriller.

This book compared to ROSES ARE RED was a pretty bad book. I loved the previous book so I picked this up. Boy was I surprised.First of all, if you haven't read ROSES ARE RED than don't read this book because this will completely spoil the book for you. The Mastermind returns (as if we don't already know who he is!) in this book....well sorta. What I mean is Patterson went and explained the plot with the vampires for the first like 100 chapters. Then for the last 16 it was all the mastermind!Now, is it just me, or was the vampire plot a little corney and predictable? Well it was. You can easily figure out who the sire is. The plot involving the vampires and such was not a very good one.Now for you Alex Cross fans out there. Is this book really worth it to the fans of the Cross series. Well, not really. Allow me to explain. Alex is usually a logical, strong person. In Violets he ain't very strong. In fact he pretty much turned into a coward. Don't get me wrong! I like Alex Cross, but in this book he wasn't the best and he was too busy being scared of getting close to someone rather than solving the case.How Cross figures out who the mastermind is ...(pretty bad) too. He usually figures stuff out more logically than that. In this he simply looked across the street! Does that mean he could've seen anybody and jumped to the conclusion that the one he saw was the Mastermind? It seems so. While I was surprised with how Cross caught the Mastermind though.The character developement is all wrong. The characters seem like completely different people! Sampson (crosses partner) doesn't even play a large part in this book the way he did in the previous ones!I know this deals with Cross' personal issues but where was the action that kept me on the edge of my seat the way \\"Kiss the Girls\\" or \\"Pop Goes the Weasel\\" did? What happened to his \\"formula\\"? It was working perfectly until now!Well, as far as short chapters go I was okay with it. Being that when I get home after a long day I'm exhausted, and like to stop on chapters. Now when I come home after a long day. I usually read. I hate stopping in the middle of a chapter though. So I can't read a book where the chapters are like 40 pages! But when I see Patterson books I'm usually saying \\"I'm tired, but I can scrounge up three pages.\\"Anyway, I'm a James Patterson fan, but this book was just as bad as \\"Cradle and All\\" was! I doubt this much, but the book was probably worse than that one. If you like Alex Cross I guess its worth a try, but other than that you should probably stay away from this book and go find a better one like \\"Roses Are Red\\" or maybe \\"Along Came a Spider.\\" But this book just isn't worth it."},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"Watch out Cross they're out to get you! &quot;Roses are Red&quot; set the stage earlier in 2001 by revealing who the Mastermind is. &quot;Violets are Blue&quot; kept me suspended in raw tension.

One thing is for sure, there is no shortage of opinion. Whether or not you enjoy this book may well depend if one likes Patterson's style of very short chapters and not very much background on his characters. In this book, Patterson feels compelled at least twice to go back through each of Alex Cross's book appearances to try and tie one aspect of the mystery together, i.e. who is The Mastermind. Once would have been enough, believe me.There are two mysteries in this book. The identity of the aforementioned Mastermind and the identity of the vampire slayers who have been killing people at an alarming rate and in a horrifying fashion.Because of his writing style, one never really gets an understanding of the whole vampire issue and the interweaving of The Mastermind throughout is as much annoying as it is interesting.It is an easy book to read, but at the end one feels like the effect that is often described to a Chinese dinner.

I know I shouldn't expect another Cross novel to possibly rival &quot;Along Came a Spider&quot;, but &quot;Violets&quot; reads like it was thrown together in a week. The entire character of Kyle Craig could/should have been developed in such a way that we the readers care about what led to his decline. I found myself just wanting the book to end. Period. Of all the novels, &quot;Violets&quot; spends the least amount of time on Cross's family life with Nana Mama and the kids. It is hard to believe that Alex would spend extremely long periods of time away from his infant son, Alex Jr. as well. But then again I never bought why Christine would ever leave him to begin with.

Sure hope there is a pony somewhere in the pile."},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"First let me begin by saying I listened to the audiobook version of this novel, as I have most every \\"Cross\\" novel. They provide an entertaining enough distraction from life. It included a \\"very special introduction\\" from the author. Wow! James Patterson actually taking some time to possibly give some insight into how he created the character, or what his writing process is, or...or just him patting himself on the back. Yes, this is indeed what he took two minutes out of his writing schedule for. He literally began by saying he's been called an author that people tend to read too much of. They seemingly are so enthralled by the story they sit in their driveways or in the parking lot of the office not wanting to get out of the car. He then went on to talk about how he went to dinner with friends and met Clint Eastwood, who told him he \\"needed a hit movie..bad!\\". So basically he insinuated that ol' Clint needs him to write him a hit movie. What?! I wanted to (and would have had I not been at work myself) scream out loud, \\"You pompous ***!\\" I couldn't believe he was being so self-serving.A very humble writer once said that a good writer can never hope to be a great writer. There are very few great writers, such as Shakespeare. This humble writer put himself in the good writer category, knowing he could never hope to achieve that level of penmanship. This humble writer is considered by many to be one of the greatest writer's of our time. His name is Stephen King. While you may be a competent writer Mr. Patterson, you sir, are absolutely no Shakespeare. You are not a Stephen King for that matter.As for this book, it's a typical Patterson \\"Cross\\" novel. It employs psychopathic killers who tend to be over the top, and this one is basically two stories in one. The main focus of the story involves two (in the beginning) serial killers who commit vampire style killings, biting their victims, then draining the blood and hanging them upside down. This for the most part is the most unbelievable antagonists Patterson has come up with yet. However, he does end up executing the story well enough to keep the reader involved. I've read most of the \\"Alex Cross\\" novels, mostly because they provide enough entertainment that I'm distracted from the real world for a while.The backstory is of a man called \\"the Mastermind\\". He calls Cross at all hours of the day and night, usually while he's in the middle of solving this particular murder. Cross ends up on a cross country trek hunting down the two killers and trying to figure out exactly how they operate. It leads him to San Francisco where he reteams with Jamilla Hughes, and of course sexual chemistry abounds. Although I have to commend Mr. Patterson for choosing this time not to have Cross end up in the bedroom of a hotel describing almost every intricate sexual detail. Between that and the following pillow talk, I begin to wonder if I'm reading a crime novel or an erotic novel written for women. It's not only uncomfortable, it's just in my opinion, unnecessary.Of course there is the family time, and for the most part, those scenes are written in order to give us a break from the tension that the main story is supposed to provide us with. These are written in a way that seems forced and the dialogue is so sappy sweet you can't help but laugh. Unfortunately, it's not because the jokes are funny. Dialogue is meant to sound real, not like a gimmick that Mr. Patterson would use in a commercial back when he was in marketing. Unfortunately, most of the scenes play out so quickly there isn't any real tension to be found. While the author is adept at moving at a quick pace, whenever \\"the mastermind\\" calls to taunt Cross, threatening his family, the situation is resolved so quickly you never feel the gut-wrenching fear that Cross should feel. By the time you get 3/4 through the novel, you don't believe for a second that his family is in any real danger.The vampire part of the story ends up in a very anti-climactic showdown that plays out a little too conveniently when he reveals the plot twist. And the most tense filled moment of this particular part has Alex facing down a tiger.When we finally do find Cross figuring out who the mastermind is, we can't help but see a huge plot hole big enough to drive a semi through. He's been taunting him with phone calls for weeks, yet he can't recognize his voice on the phone. The showdown between the two plays out just as expected, a little more tension filled than the rest of the book, however more unbelievable than the vampire story. I find it a little hard to believe you can interrogate a suspect with an icepick buried in your chest!Overall, it's worth a read or listen, but just don't expect to be enthralled enough to sit in the car not wanting to get out. The shame of it is that I wouldn't be shocked if Cross started shamelessly promoting himself and name-dropping the same way that Mr. Patterson does. At times it seems that Cross is not only a doppelganger of Mr. Patterson, he has his same arrogant traits. It's usual \\"Cross\\" antics, and unfortunately that's part of the problem. You pretty much know how it will all turn out. At this point you know he's not in any real danger. You just wish that Mr. Patterson might change up the game a little and have him do something original. Have Cross and Samson open up a private detective agency. At least then the hard-boiled over the top cop dialogue might be more believable...or at least easier to swallow."},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"No im not bragging im just saying thats how great the book was.

Third, the ending is a real twist and it makes me unstoppable to turn the pages to know what will happen. Finally, this entry almost signify the end of Cross's life in Washington PD migrating to FBI.Another good thing about Cross series is that, once you are hooked to them, the characters (Nana, Sampson, Christine, Jamila, ...... are just so real that they all like part of your life)"},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"i loved this one. it was definatly one of the best. But at the end of roses are red was just heart stopping. I should've seen it but in the same way i couldnt. i love the way how you got to know other characters beside alex cross."},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"Violets are Blue by James Patterson is a captivating suspense novel. Once I started this book I could not put it down.This book is the sequel to Roses are Red. The main character Alex Cross is a Washington D.C. police detective. He has two murder cases to solve. The first set of killers leave their victims' bodies drained of blood and strange teeth marks on them. To solve this mystery detective Cross explores the secret world of modern vampire fetishes and role playing. The second case is much more personal. The Mastermind is still tormenting Alex Cross. His ex-girlfriend has been murdered and the lives of his family threatened. He must find the identity of the Mastermind before he kills again.I loved this book. Anyone who is a fan of James Patterson will enjoy reading this. It was smooth, fast paced and well written. I recommend this to anyone who loves a good mystery."},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"In the beginning, I was dissapointed. For a few pages I thought it was a Horror story, not the typical Alex Cross type. But Isoon figured that it was not, and couldn't put it down, Thisbook ties up a lot of the previous characters' actions also. I loved this book, and since have ordered all the Alex Cross series from Amazon, to re-read them in order. I am not however, looking forward to his new novel, The Jester, since it takes place in Midevil times."},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"When I'm stuck in a foreign airport with a limited selection of English books from which to choose, two facts are often true:1) At least one of the selection of books will be a new James Patterson.2) The James Patterson is usually the safest bet.Patterson has a firm grasp on the kinds of novel that he writes-- a kind of updated penny dreadful, appealing to people who need a few hours to not think about their surroundings. As such, his books consistently deliver with a reasonable quality of craft exactly what the reader is looking for.Don't expect any shocks from the new Alex Cross. There's a vicious serial killer (this time with a fun tip o' the hat to Anne Rice), a mysterious unmasked baddie, and yet another gorgeous woman who will probably be loved and lost. You won't stumble over the prose, and there's nothing that feels particularly ridiculous. Alex is by turns human and reassuring, a real hero for our time.Another consistent effort and not bad reading during turbulence."},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"I enjoy murder mysteries but all the way through this book the excessive killing was at no time matched by smart detective work. All Alex did was fly around from city to city. It was so obvious who the villains were that nothing was left to hold the suspense.

I was extremely disappointed."},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"order came in better condition than i thought it would. very happy with seller and would recommend to anyone"},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"I usually try to make it my business not to read any books relating to either werewolfs or vampires. As a matter of fact, I stopped reading Patricia Cornwall's Kay Scarpetta series for this exact reason....the werewolfs had invaded the pages. Since I like to read all of my series \\"in order\\", Violets Are Blue was the next one up at bat in the Alex Cross series. Little did I know that it would have the \\"dreaded\\" vampires as the main characters.This book had two stories going on at the same time....the vampire invasion and the return of \\"The Mastermind\\". One thing Patterson is definitely good at is bringing you up-to-date with what's happened in his past books so you're not totally lost when you're reading his current offering. I appreciated all of his reminders of how much The Mastermind had taken over Alex Cross' life with all of his threats and purported killings of people close to Alex. Another thing Patterson is great at is writing short chapters. I read this book while on the beach in Mexico and it's just the type of book to bring on vacation because it goes quickly. I finished it in two days and was able to give it to a friend who was with me who also finished it on that same trip.Now, getting back to the vampires. As much as I dislike reading about them, I did find it quite fascinating but scary at the same time. Just to think that something like this could possibly exist (please tell me it doesn't) is enough to keep me from reading another vampire book in my lifetime. But in usual Alex Cross fashion, the vampires didn't stand a chance against our hero. The Mastermind, however, was another story. I do have a problem with how this part of the story panned out and it's something many authors do that really bothers me. I can't elaborate because I'd give it away but it's a cop out I don't appreciate. Wow, did I just use a pun there? I actually didn't mean to but if the shoe fits, wear it.Next up....Four Blind Mice. I know there's really only three blind mice. I can just imagine who this fourth mouse is going to be."},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"I am a new reader of this author, but I am reading Patterson pretty fast. I am a big fan of the Women's Murder Club books. My first Alex Cross was Violets are Blue. Wow...was I disappointed! It seemed to be disjointed, unfocused even. Murder after murder...and the police response was always to meet and talk (heck!he even bought doughnuts in this one!!)..no real police work like Lt. Lindsey Boxer would do. A new lead in the case didn't produce redoubled efforts or gearing up, more likely a trip home to DC for Alex. I didn't find the name Nana Mama at all believable. I guess I should reiterate that I am a fan. I just think this one was largely filler and fluff. Did I miss something? I thought you could read these in any order. Perhaps I would have been liked it more if this hadn't been the first Alex Cross for me? Ah, well. The 5th Horseman should put the world to rights."},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"The unabridged version of \\"Violets Are Blue\\" is my first encounter with the writing of James Patterson and I was greatly disappointed. The story is about detective Alex Cross' investigation into a vampire cult following and killing for the \\"Sire\\" all while being plagued by the \\"Mastermind\\". The book starts off seemingly jumping all over the place and never really does pick up that flow for a cohesive story.Patterson's concept of people living the lifestyle of a vampire is a good one and had so much potential. When the Sire is eventually discovered you're left wondering \\"who was that again?\\". I agree with some of the other reviews in here that by the time you reach the end of the story you can determine who the Mastermind is from a mile away so there was no big climax on that ending either.Although I'll probably read another one of Patterson's books at some point in the future, this book does not leave me anticipating the next read by this author.

I'm as big a fan of Alex Cross as anyone, but after reading \\"Violets are Blue,\\" I think that James Patterson has taken this character beyond believable. Really, how much torture can an author inflict on a character in novel after novel, and still make that character realistic to the reader? First of all Alex is constantly being stalked by the current homicidal maniac. Madmen make threatening phone calls at all hours of the day, and invade his house in the middle of the night. He can't have any kind of a relationship with a woman, because the psycho stalking him will either terrorize or kill her. His kids will probably have emotional issues all their lives because they're forever being guarded or moved to a safe house away from the killer/stalker/vampire, etc. Please Mr. Patterson, don't you think Alex has had enough? Have him take an early retirement, and move him and his family to a remote location where no one can ever find him. Maybe your next action hero could be Alex's best friend, John Sampson; but whatever you do, please let Alex Cross finally rest in peace!"},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"...After being thoroughly disappointed by the last two novels by Patterson that I picked up--his Murder Club series--I figured I'd give him another chance with the latest Alex Cross story, Violets Are Blue. ...Violets are Blue is just plain deplorable. The sentence structure reads like something out of a \\"See Spot Run\\" book and the storytelling isn't much better. Supposedly, Cross has been pursued by some person called the Mastermind... However, the secret to the identity of the Mastermind is so obvious from the first 10 pages of the book that it's not really any fun to keep on reading and find out if your suspicions are confirmed or not. As for the rest of the story--involving Cross investigating a series of murders based around a vampire cult and maybe falling in love with his co-worker...well, it's pretty much yawn inducing the entire way around. ..."},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"Among the three reviews I had read, James Patterson is considered a talented writer. Using a style not often seen within long novels. Patterson uses small chapters barely seven pages long at the most. Designed to keep the reader reading without being bogged down by a never-ending chapter. These shorter chapters also afford Patterson the freedom to change time lapses and scenes often, without confusing the audience.Unfortunately in my opinion that was about the only clever decision Patterson made in writing this novel....I found that the book could in fact be consumed very quickly. Actually the book had only taken a day to \\"consumer\\". And like most fast food it left me with heartburn.While reading, the audience discovers more about the \\"vampire brothers\\" then they do about Cross's character.

On the one hand, I'm glad I didn't spend any money buying the book, but on the other, I'm sorry someone wasted THEIR money to get it for me as a present.Almost every aspect of the story, from the plot to character development was sub-par. The \\"mystery\\" wasn't mysterious. The detective/psychologist protagonist spent most of the time showing up at one crime scene after another wondering what was happening and why, and doing practically nothing that even the average person would have done to solve the crimes or to protect himself and his family from a deranged killer. He unwittingly escapes death twice only by the grace of the killer deciding to wait about doing him in, and in their last encounter, by winning a fistfight in which the true mystery is why the villain apparently stops fighting after having the upper hand from the start.

The killers are vampires (not the kind that turn into bats, just crazy men who suck their victims' blood). It comes pretty close to horror-novel territory. This may come as a disappointed surprise to those Patterson fans who want to stick with the more believable villains, but, in my opinion, it was very intriguing to read about the vampires. After figuring out who the Mastermind is, Alex is horrified. The Mastermind is probably the most interesting and one of the most sadistic of the villains in Alex Cross novels, and I hope that he makes lots more appearances in the future.

I have a fondness for the characters Alex Cross, his friends and his family. Alex Cross is a detective with the police force in Washington, DC who is used as a liaison with the FBI and other police forces in the USA. He has solved many difficult murders and has quite a reputation.Alex looses a good friend, a female FBI agent who was murdered in Virginia by the Mastermind who then called him on his mobile phone at the scene of the crime to challenge him. Before he can grasp the whole story; a friend, Kyle Craig, FBI, requests his help to help with another murder on the other side of the USA. This murder was similar to another one that Alex had investigated in DC earlier and that was still open.This book switches very early to a case about a sect of live vampires, and again Alex has been called from Washington D. C. to the west coast to help the San Francisco police with a case of two weird murders there.Alex hopes that he will get a rest from the Mastermind, but of course he doesn't. The Mastermind is right with him wherever he goes. The murders on the west coast had similar aspects to one in DC. The victims in San Francisco and the one in DC had been gnawed on and were hung upside down with apparently a lot of blood drained out of their bodies.The novel has two mysteries interwoven, the Mastermind and the vampires. While Alex is working on the serial murders by the vampires the Mastermind is constantly harassing him with phone call and the threat of additional murders of his family and friends-two of which he carried out.Although this story had a lot of murders in several States and plenty of suspense, it was not as good as a few of his first books or I'm getting jaded, one or the other. Even though, in the end he solves both of the mysteries, crossing the USA several times in the process. The story has a lot of impact with the super vampires and the Mastermind.I like his short chapters and good writing. I think it's worth four stars."},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"This is a terrible book that I kept wishing would get better, but only got worse as the plot tedium wore on. For starters, the title &quot;Violets Are Blue&quot; has absolutely nothing to do with the plot, the characters, or the action and the title (or the context of the title)is never mentioned once. Call the book &quot;Mastermind&quot;, or &quot;Vampires&quot;, or &quot;Mass Murderers&quot;, but &quot;Violets Are Blue&quot; never applies here. And the plot and the whining of Alex Cross that he keeps getting weird phone calls from the Mastermind that can't be traced despite the full electronic technology of the FBI is silly. By the way, someone has been committing gruesome murders for eleven years with the distinct modus operandi of hanging victims upside down and drinking their blood. Not to mention white bengal tigers (two in the beginning but only one is killed in the end. Where is the other tiger?) who bite their prey to kill on command but never feast? And goulish teen-agers by the hundreds across the country who revel in blood, gore, killing, and mayhem circus acts? In the end, the vampire murders are unrelated to the Mastermind character that has been stalking Cross (we are told) for years and turns out to be his best friend in line to become the Director of the FBI. Huh? The Mastermind is also a mass murderer in his own right who's killed a number of Cross's female detective partners in the past. In short, none of the story hangs together, there is no cleverness, no plot twists, and nothing to recommend this novel. Unless, of course, you're really into macabre, fifty or so vicious murders where the victims have their throats slashed, are tortured, hung to death, or bled upside down in a purported feeding fenzy."},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"The New York Times is right -- James Patterson can't write!! An unbelievable plot, poorly written with weak characters and worse dialogue. I am donating this book to my local library anonymously! Don't waste your money or your time."},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"Two joggers are found in a San Francisco public park hanging by their feet, drained of blood, and covered with bite marks. Could this be the work of modern day vampires? Horrified local police want help with this one, and call in the FBI. In no time, Washington, D.C. Police Detective, Alex Cross, is winging his way out west to consult on the case..... After last years &quot;Mastermind&quot;, cliff hanger, readers probably thought that Violets Are Blue was going to be the big show down between Alex Cross and his nemesis, but not before he dispenses with this ridiculous vampire case. James Patterson spends 320 pages basically repeating the same crime scene, full of gratuitous violence and gore, over and over again. This a police procedural without any forensics, police work or details. The story line is not gripping, suspenseful, nor compelling, and listening to Alex constantly whine and wring his hands, gets old fast. The case is finally closed with an absurd ending that leaves all the loose ends hanging, and unexplained. You get the feeling that even Mr Patterson couldn't come up with a plausible conclusion to his own story. Now on to the Mastermind, the heinous murderer who's been terrorizing Alex and his family for years. In just 70 pages, almost as an afterthought, Patterson wraps up this long running story line. Everything about Violets Are Blue is disappointing, from the choppy, uninspired writing, and meandering, unbelievable plot, to the poorly drawn, one-dimensional characters. This is a thriller without the thrills. Violets Are Blue gets my vote for worst novel of the year!"},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","review":"This was one of the most disturbing books I have ever listened to. I truly enjoyed it and I found myself more often then not poised at the edge of my seat trying to catch my breath. The book was well crafted and full of schocking scenes that it caused my heart to beat twice as fast. Every time William and Michael struck, I would begin to breathe faster. they have got to be the worst psychos Patterson has invented yet. one has to wonder what Patterson was thinking while writing this book. The sex scenes were quite arousing until of course it turned into horror but I love that combination. Why does Patterson make his psychos so sexy yet so deadly at the same time. Look at past novels and you'll see what I mean. Lets face it, on a fantasy note, wouldn't you like to spend some time with Michael and William? The thing that was most distressing about this book was the amount of evil directed at Alex Cross. Not only did he have to solve the vampire killings but he had to deal at the same time with the Mastermind from Roses are red. i didn't find the conclusion to that rushed; I think it ended quyite nicely. I really do not understand why this book has gotten such a low overall rating. Could it be that patterson has dared to expose our most darkest desires and has made us uncomfortable? The fact is, these sub cultures really do exist and while I would not join such a group do provide an alternative view point. I really felt for Alex Cross this time; a character who at times I think is a bit too smug for my taste. He truly was at his wits end in this one and I would not blame him if he retired. I hope he does not, I hope there will be another Alex Cross novel just as dark and [seductive] and deadly as Violets are. Come on Mr. patterson visit that dark room in your mind and treat us to another terror filled ride. Highly recommended. The audiobook version especially for its full of suspense building music and two readers really bring the story to life. Buy it folks and prepared to be shocked.

The sequel being a similar analysis of religions, was titled God The Invisible King.Here Wells defines his position as a strong believer in one God and proceeds to evaluate the dogmas of the Christian Churches. He describes the notion of Trinity as an Alexandrian contamination three centuries after Jesus from the Nile, declared into creed in council of Nicea, and made fundament of all Churches of Christianity since then. Well calls the bluff of mysteries of the Triune or trinity, attributing an anti-religion motive to the institution that has been instilling this dogma into children. He describes his own childhood experience and how he was driven away from the Creater by the dogma.It should be read together with Thomas Paine for a complete perspective of scriptures, institutions and effects on which the religion in the West is based.It is a pity that the other two boks of Wells which make a series with this one are not included among books offered here. I thought they were missing even among books out of print. These are, as said above, First and Last Things and The Open Conspiracy.Wells is going to make a spectacular come back in one of these days, to take most established institutions by surprize, as very graphically and prophetically described in When the Sleeper Awakes! Also an immortal book.Have fun."},{"Title":"God the Invisible King","review":"I REALLY REALLY wanted to like this book. Throughout the entire first half I was planning to give it 4 stars because it greatly inspired me. In the second half Wells' weak arguments dropped it to 3 stars. By the end the book was such a confusing mess that I dropped it to 2 stars. Finally I bumped it up to 3 again just because it is a good historical resource into Wells' thinking. Honestly I say it's 2 1/2, but I'm having a really hard time giving an H.G. Wells book fewer than 3 stars.Everybody knows that H.G. Wells was an atheist. At least that is a common conception, but in this book Wells' vehemently denies it and spends the entire book laying out his form of neo-theism. I was confused by this and did a little online research. According to the H.G. Wells Society of America, Wells was an atheist but went through a religious phase due to the emotional trama of World War I. Supposedly he rejected those religious ideas later in life; I will have to read my copy of Wells' \\"Experiment in Autobiography\\" to get a better understanding of his religious views. In any event, \\"God the Invisible King\\" was written in that religious phase contemporary to the First World War.The purpose of this book is to lay out H.G. Wells' religous beliefs and those of \\"modern religion\\". He explicity claims on the first page that he is not a Christian. Although to us it seems like he is trying to promote a new future movement, to Wells himself this modern religion was already happening in his day and was the direction that religion would continue to go. (He might have been right except that the reactionary fundamentalist Christian movement changed modern religion into something quite different.) First Wells lays out the difference between the Creator God and the Christ God. The Creator God is that power behind the universe which is distant from man and can be seen in God the Father of the Christian Trinity. The Christ God is the personal aspect of God which is in people's hearts and whom people relate to. Wells claims to be decidedly agnostic towards the Creator God, whom he calls the \\"Veiled Being\\" and says is both unknowable and irrelevent. He does however literally believe in the Christ God. In making this distinction Wells actively denounces Trinitarian theology, and after this distinction is made all references to God mean specifically the Christ God as opposed to the Creator God.What is Wells' God like? He did not create the universe. He is not omnicient, omnipotent, or omniprecent. He doesn't know everything or have all power. He doesn't work miracles or answer prayers (although Wells contradicts himself on this point later in the book). He doesn't judge or condemn us. But according to Wells this God is definitely a person. He is a personal God whom we can know, but we don't really pray to him or worship him in any direct way. Mostly he is there giving us courage, feeling our pain with us, standing shoulder-to-shoulder with us, and we are supposed to serve him with everything we do. Wells says that it is impossible to prove God, but we can experience him directly.I must admit that in the first half of the book Wells says it much more compellingly than I do. In fact for the first half I was inspired by this God and thought that I as an atheist could almost believe in a God like this. It seems like kind of an amorphous feel-good God that doesn't really exist out there but is a very real and important part of our psyche. But Wells doesn't want us thinking like that because he constantly reminds us that God is a real external person.Unfortunately the inspiration and though-provoking aspect of this book wears off halfway through when Wells makes half-hearted attempts to prove the existence of his God. Wells makes the same old agruments that would later be made by C.S. Lewis in \\"Mere Christianity\\", but Lewis did it much better. For example Wells tried to prove the existence of God through the existance of human morality. Lewis at least tried to prove the existence of objective morality (and failed), but Wells did not even try. He simply \\"proved\\" that objective morality exists because it is obvious to common sense. Therefore God exists. A thin argument indeed.This book started as really good and went to mediocre, but after 2/3 in it just gets bad. I had to skip a lot of pages to find major points in the argument and to find anything that made sense. Here Wells transforms his God from a feel-good entity that lives inside of us to a militant ruler. He says that people need to change their perspective so they do everything (especially work) for the glory of God. If we all do our jobs to God's glory, then we will enter a socialist paradise ruled by God himself - the Invisible King. But God never comes down from heaven to rule earth in physical form. No, God is our dear amorphous leader who rules through humanity's combined actions (or something like that). It is a call for an end of governments and the rise of a theocracy ruled by God with no priests and no church. (But of course God never comes down physically, and as wells said earlier in the book, God never sits on a throne.) God forbids the wealthy from giving their belongings to the poor, but he also forbids them from enjoying their wealth and being greedy. All wealth and all labor somehow work together through the glory of God to create a human paradise. The problem is the Wells seems like a communist in one sentence and like an Ayn Rand objectivist in the next sentence. It would probably take a lengthy book for a modern scholar to sort out Wells' economic and political ideas.I really wanted to like this book. I found it inspiring at first, but ultimately it fell flat on its face. I was struggling with the rating, but after writing this review I have decided that this book sucks and gets 2 stars. When Ayn Rand and Karl Marx join forces to create a churchless theocracy run by nobody, then I think it's time for H.G. Wells to go back to writing science fiction."},{"Title":"God the Invisible King","review":"This is an excellent book. H.G. Wells was a deeply spiritual man just not in any traditional sense. His views on religion are very unique and intriguing. I would have thought him to be an atheist, but obviously he was not. His comments on the subject bring that to light, and interestingly he dubs atheism as a religion.He calls the Council of Nicaea the most disastrous of all religious gatherings and expresses a lot of disagreement with current Christian dogma, particularly the cruel and arrogant portions of it. I definitely agree with him on that.I think Christians' insistence that their way is the only right one and you will be tortured in hell forever if you don't agree cannot possibly be true and is inconsistent with the actions of a loving god. Wells also talks about the popular belief that people are born into sin along with a lot of other spiritual topics, on which he has many interesting points to make.What I liked the most about this book was Wells belief that organized religion is unnecessary to spiritual growth and, in fact, harmful. I strongly agree with him on that. I was also very interested to read his thoughts on this subject. This is the only book like this that he has ever written, and his beliefs surprised me."},{"Title":"God the Invisible King","review":"I was surprised to see that H.G. Wells had written a spiritual work. I'd always identified him with Martians invading earth. I firmly believe that his ideas are on the right path. Intermediaries are certainly not necessary for those seeking the divine. We are all one and the issues we squabble about are so petty. It is especially sad that the greatest arguments are over spirituality. Wells clearly seeks unity in these matters, and I strongly agree with his objective. This is a valuable book with great insights."},{"Title":"God the Invisible King","review":"The January 24, 2011 issue of The New Yorker had a cartoon that expressed the feelings of most people. One character said to another: \\"I'm in the market for an easier religion.\\" Readers of H. G. Wells' God the Invisible King (1866-1946, written in 1917), which is not a novel, but expresses his views of God and religion, may think that he reflects this attitude. Actually the reverse is true. He writes that people must learn to act, not passively wait for divine aid. Some readers may disagree with his views, but they should find them thought-provoking.Wells states that he is not a Christian and his ideas are not Christian. He says that he believes in a \\"personal and intimate God.\\" He rejects the widely held dogmas, especially the \\"disastrous\\" idea of a trinity. There is \\"no revelation, no authoritative teaching, no mystery.\\" Ideas such as a virgin birth and resurrection and sin are untrue. These dogmas prevent people from thinking about the truth, make them passive, and discourage them from living a proper fulfilling life.The word \\"God,\\" he writes, could mean God as nature or God as helper. The first, he says, is the God of Spinoza and the second the God of the human heart. Wells believes that if a person accepts the first understanding there is no problem, but he prefers the second. When people petition God for help, the same God that helps everyone, no matter what the person's religion. God is not a being attached to a particular religion. All people are, metaphorically speaking, God's children. God is not found in a building, but in the heart.Wells defines God as \\"boundless love,\\" a \\"friend,\\" \\"courage,\\" and \\"salvation from the purposelessness of life.\\" God \\"works in men and through men.\\" He does not intervene in this world to help people. He neither rewards nor punishes. People do these things to themselves. Prayers do not help. God lacks the powers and knowledge attributed to him.Wells states that God \\"is as real as a bayonet thrust or an embrace,\\" he is the king, we must do what he wants us to do. Yet, he also says that he is not the God of old, but the God of youth. \\"He looks toward the future,\\" he loves us \\"in the sense of\\" wanting us to achieve the best. God's \\"nature is the nature of thought and will.\\" These statements suggest that God is a human invention; God is that which is in humans that causes them to strive to better themselves and the world. Obeying God means striving to better ourselves and the world.Thus, for example, the current behavior of lawyers and judges is outdated, incompatible with \\"what God wants,\\" with the human goal. The lawyer shouldn't seek to present only his client's view in a dispute and hide facts that support his adversary. He should only take cases that he considers just and seek the truth, justice, and the common good. So, too, judges should not decide cases based on conformity to technical rules, but truth, justice, and the good of society.Thus, Wells sees the idea of God as a challenge to humans to be all that they can be and to improve society to become the best it can become."},{"Title":"God the Invisible King","review":"Not for me!, Not my beliefs and will not be my kind of book. I will be leary of books with titles about God after this."},{"Title":"God the Invisible King","review":"I have the answer to the question 'why would God put people in hell if he is loving?' Suppose you knocked on the door of the most expensive home in the country and told the owners,\\"I'm moving in with you.\\" What do you think they would say? Of course they would say no! And you wouldn't expect them to welcome you. You don't have any relationship with them. So you, who question God's fairness, live your entire life having nothing to do with Him, even denying Jesus is the Son of God; you then come knocking on God's door at your death and say, \\"Excuse me, I'm moving in with You!\\" Why would you think that you have a right to move into His house? Why should He let you in? You never asked Him to be you Father, as He has offered Himself to you during your life on Earth. As a matter of fact, you denied His Son as your Lord and Savior, who He told you was the only way into heaven. Therefore, there is no relationship that exists between you and Him. He is not your Father, only your Creator. You say,\\" But He knows me, and He is supposed to be a loving God!\\" He knows you exist, but He doesn't know you personally. In Matthew 7:23, Jesus said, \\" And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me ye that work iniquity\\". How terrible would that be to hear that from His lips? The fact that He gives us a choice to be in relationship with Him proves He is a loving God. It is up to us to choose whether we do so or not. If a stranger came to you and said that he was moving into your home, would I be justified in calling you \\"mean\\" for not allowing him access? Would I be justified in saying that you were \\"unloving\\"? No, because their moving in with you is not based on the question of whether you are \\"loving\\" or not, but it is based on your \\"relationship\\" with them. So it is with us. If we do not have a relationship that exists with Jesus, then we are not in His family, and we have no right to enter His home. Now tell me, who here is the inconsiderate and unreasonable one? I don't know if you are ready for this or not, but Jesus actually said in John 8:44\\"For you are the children of your father the Devil... He says this because His message did not find a place in the people's hearts. In other words, either God is your Father, or the devil is your father. I know that is strong language, but most don't realize that we all have a spiritual father, and there are only two choices. If we have'nt made Jesus our Lord, then we have a father whether we know it or not. If you think that is foolish, then you have a right to disagree with Jesus, but it won't change the facts. I know many assume we are all \\"the children of God\\". That is a misnomer. In addition to John 8:44 above, John 1:12 says, \\"But to all who believed him and accepted him, he gave the right to become children of God\\". Again, when speaking to the Father, Jesus said in John 17:9, \\"I pray for them. I do not pray for the world but for those whom You have given Me, for they are Yours. According to Galatians 3:26, our faith or belief in who Jesus is makes us children of God. It says, \\" For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus.\\" Ephesians 1:5 states, \\"His unchanging plan has always been to adopt us into his own family by bringing us to Himself through Jesus Christ. For us to show up at heaven's gates and expect to just move in without a relationship would be as foolish as expecting to live in that expensive home. Our lack of knowledge is no excuse. It is just as if we were speeding and told the policeman, \\"I didn't see the sign!\\" Well, I reread the book and I am thinking to myself \\"Why would a god be finite?\\" I mean, for crying out loud it is a GOD. His god sounds like a human. A real god would be infinite like the christian God. And lots of other things in his book make me laugh. I do not recommend this to you."},{"Title":"God the Invisible King","review":"I enjoy reading opinions that oppose mine. Makes me test my faith in a positive way.

There wasn't anything really new here. I thought that his presentations often did hold water and I do believe that this sort of thing is done in advertising but since it has been said before...I wish that the author had used a better designed book to present his theory. Having a cheap design doesn't add weight. The companion website just compounds the feeling that this is put out by amateurs even though the message is serious. Had it been done with an eye to good sophisticated design, the author's argument would have been easier to absorb.I would have liked to have known more about the author as well. We are told he is a lawyer but not what kind of law he practices, where he lives or anything much to help us form an opinion as to his seriousness.Worth reading, would help to drive home the idea that there is subliminal advertising out there but the method of delivery could have used a lot of professional help from real graphic designers."},{"Title":"The Secret Sales Pitch: An Overview of Subliminal Advertising","review":"Having worked at a dozen New York ad agencies - some tiny, some huge - I can assure you that the people who create ads have no interest in employing \\"subliminal selling techniques\\". There are three reasons for this. One: there's no such thing as a \\"subliminal selling technique\\", at least not within the ad industry; two: anyone who suggested using a subliminal technique would be accused of being on serious drugs; and, most importantly, three: the people who create ads have no interest is selling products. They want to win awards for \\"creativity\\". Because that's what advances careers. It's a cliche in the industry that the client always wants the product shot and the logo bigger, and the ad agency always wants it smaller or, ideally, absent. Just one example: I've seen an ad agency present an ad about the TITANIC to a cruise line. The ad was funny. That's why the agency tried to sell it to the client. But the client, rightfully, was furious. No one contemplating a cruise wants to think about the Titanic. But, as I said, the agency didn't care. Or, at least, those responsible for creating ads didn't care. They were just trying to figure out a way to say \\"Go on a cruise\\" without saying \\"Go on a cruise\\". Not because saying \\"Go on a cruise\\" is not \\"subliminal\\" enough. It's just not \\"clever\\" enough. And that's how ad creatives justify their salaries.However, I did look at the web site associated with the book. And the guy in the cigarette ad does look like he's holding a (...). I laughed. It's worth checking out. But, I'm sure it wasn't intentional. It's just like looking at clouds. Look at enough of them, you'll find something. Same with religious images in billboards, or the virgin Mary in the lady's grilled cheese sandwich on ebay.Oh well. I haven't (...), though. So, maybe there are some good parts.

If I'm wrong (about the thesis, not about the existence of subliminal advertising) sorry for giving it the one star."},{"Title":"The Secret Sales Pitch: An Overview of Subliminal Advertising","review":"I'm a graphic designer, with a special interest in the power of subliminal advertising. Having recently compiled a written paper on this subject, Bullock's 'The Secret Sales Pitch' was immensely helpful. Bullock has mananged to summarise complex theory into easy-to-read chapters, that would be perfect for those studying the subject or would be interested in learning about this facinating area.Subliminal examples are clearly identified and supported with full colour images, making points easily recognisable to the reader. Bullock's style of writing is accurate yet humorous at times, personalising his own experiences. He has also included possible experiments that the reader can test out for themselves. I did just that, and the results were incredibly revealing.If you thought you understood the hidden arts of subliminal persuasion, this book is bound to teach you something new and will ultimately broaden your perceptions of advertising in today's society. A must-have in anyone's book collection."},{"Title":"The Secret Sales Pitch: An Overview of Subliminal Advertising","review":"I was skeptical going into this book. I had read about subliminal advertising on the internet. It seemed logical the idea that companies would use subtle manipulation techniques to their monetary advantage if they were able to do so. But I questioned whether it was really possible to manipulate emotion and desire without the person being aware of it.The first few chapters of this book, before Bullock gets to the examples, are a powerful, persuasive argument that lays out the scientific facts of how and why subliminal manipulation can be done. The subconscious takes in more information than the conscious mind is aware of. Every bit of the theory behind subliminal advertising that Bullock expounds is based on real experimental data. Cognitive scientists have proven beyond a shadow of a doubt that people are influenced in all sorts of ways they are not consciously aware of.The power to use this knowledge as a tool for manipulating people is very great. It blows my mind the blase attitude people have about being totally saturated in advertising since childhood. People think it doesn't affect them. This kind of go-with-the-flow attitude is exactly what advertising is there to engender.One of the many good points the book makes, is the fact that there isn't even really a harsh dividing line between subliminal advertising and non-subliminal. It's not controversial that beer commercials use sex in them. Well what is that other than an attempt to connect in your mind alcohol and sex? You don't have to look too closely to see that not just alcohol, but EVERYTHING is sold by connecting it to sex. Obviously because sex is the most powerful human drive. Now if I said to you \\"buying this shirt is like having sex\\" you would say \\"You're crazy\\" but through the clever use of images I could connect them in your mind whether you like it or not. In a sense all advertising is subliminal because it creates associations between the product/service and certain things: sex, satiety, comfort, popularity, acceptance, fear, death, guilt, shame. Whatever works. These connections are made automatically by your brain when it sees two things connected in images and words. The advertiser doesn't approach you like an adult and make a reasoned argument that this lipstick and sexual acceptance, or that cigarette and fear of death, should be connected. It is done subliminally without the person's consent or knowledge.So all advertising is more or less subliminal. Bullock's examples of hidden penises and corpses and crossdressers and so on, just go one step further. Since reading this book, I have personally located many examples of subliminal penises in real advertisements, including a big one in Jennifer Aniston's neck on the cover of Vogue magazine. The knowledge in this book will, if not protect you from those who would manipulate your subconscious mind for their own gain, at least give you the tools to begin to see through their tricks. Considering advertisements constitute the environment for anyone growing up in this era, the value and usefulness of this book cannot be overemphasized."},{"Title":"The Secret Sales Pitch: An Overview of Subliminal Advertising","review":"Subliminal messages in advertising - many people claim they exist, most advertisers claim they do not. In &quot;The Secret Sales Pitch&quot; author August Bullock presents a strong case not only for the existence of subliminal influences in marketing but also for their effectiveness. Some of the examples in the book are very obvious once they are pointed out and there is no question that they exist, others seem to be a bit of a stretch. Prepare to be both surprised and at times appalled at the things advertisers put in their marketing pieces.It is important to point out that some of the subliminal examples could also be an accident of light and photography. As an avid photographer myself I have had some photos end up with what would appear to be subliminal messages and images entirely by accident. Some of them were less of a stretch than some of the examples in this book. This is not to say that his examples are not created on purpose as part of a subliminal plan. Many of them are unquestionable created for this purpose. There is also no question that psychology plays a very important role in advertising. One thing that differentiates this book form similar ones is that Mr. Bullock not only examines the subliminal items hidden in the picture but also explains the psychology behind other parts of the advertising piece. &quot;The Secret Sales Pitch&quot; is a highly recommended read for anyone interested in marketing and the use of subliminal messages in advertising."},{"Title":"The Secret Sales Pitch: An Overview of Subliminal Advertising","review":"With a degree in marketing and experience in graphic arts, I was aware of the basics of subliminal marketing messages. However, I was unaware of the pervasive presence of such hidden messages in mass market advertising --- the traditional marketing classes generally describe subliminal marketing as &quot;untested&quot; (perhaps because the high level advertising agencies keep their research confidential).Bullock describes an ad for an alcoholic beverage -- an ad that I recall viewing in some detail as I rode the subway to work each day. At that time, I found the image in the ad both disturbing and riveting -- but I could not understand what kept bringing my eyes back to further study it. (As I never drink the particular product being advertised, it wasn't due to any obvious interest on my part.) Imagine my surprise when, there in The Secret Sales Pitch, is that ad I remember from the subway train thoroughly dissected and explained. It _does_ have disturbing aspects, I was _not_ going crazy to have been drawn to the image -- there were many distrubing subliminal aspects that I couldn't identify until I saw the discussion in the book.I no longer simply look at any mass market ad without looking for hidden messages ... and I've seen some ads that have an initial &quot;innocence&quot; that, upon reflective examination, have many subtle images that reach out to our most basic emotions.Read this book and you'll never be able to just look at an ad ever again without wondering what secret messages the advertiser is sending you."},{"Title":"The Secret Sales Pitch: An Overview of Subliminal Advertising","review":"This book really goes into great study lenghs to give you an overview of what has gone on in the past and may be going on today.At the very least it is eye opening and kind of makes you think about what we see in advertising from a different prospective.I am excited to think we can change our future through sublimial messages. Still I can see that is very much up for debate.Great reading on a fasinating subject."},{"Title":"The Secret Sales Pitch: An Overview of Subliminal Advertising","review":"\\"The Secret Sales Pitch\\" is a marvelous book, as well as a labor of love, which seems to have been years in the making. It is an indispensible resource in the field of subliminal messages. The book is extremely enjoyable, with a number of easy to understand examples and a free-and-easy, insightful, witty manner of speech. However, it never strays from tackling a serious subject that can affect everyone everyday. Kudos to Bullock for making this book available to the public."},{"Title":"The Secret Sales Pitch: An Overview of Subliminal Advertising","review":"It is very interesting to read. It makes you obsessed while looking at any ad in order to discover if it has embeds or not. I don't know if these tricks can increase your sales or not. I have to try it first. But for sure, it can work for propaganda especially if the designer is a sharp artist in including embeds."},{"Title":"The Secret Sales Pitch: An Overview of Subliminal Advertising","review":"Author August Bullock provides an informed and informative survey of how the media manipulates the minds of consumers through subliminal messages in The Secret Sales Pitch. By revealing the psychology involved in contemporary marketing strategies and tactics, Bullock has produced a kind of instructional manual which will prove to be a superbly presented introduction into subliminal message and image oriented advertising. The Secret Sales Pitch is strongly recommended reading for all elements of the advertising community, as well as social activists and reformers concerned with media manipulation issues arising from corporate and/or governmental efforts to persuade consumers and the body politic."},{"Title":"The Secret Sales Pitch: An Overview of Subliminal Advertising","review":"August Bullock's new book on subliminal advertising is well written, logical, perceptive, educational and controversial. Whether you ultimately agree with him or not about advertising tactics, you have to give him his due. Most of his conclusions are reasonable. His thesis is amply supported by carefully crafted analysis and numerous examples. Highly recommended for the artist, advertiser, teacher, student, or for anyone looking for an unusual read."},{"Title":"The Secret Sales Pitch: An Overview of Subliminal Advertising","review":"yes...this book makes many excellent points. the problem is, if you are someone who isn't a beer swilling heterosexual male meathead, a pathetic lipstick-sucking, baby-craving, diet-obsessed simpering female, or the new object of marketing--the Man Who Is Homosexual And Loves Men And Loves To Be Worshiped By Women Whom They Find Disgusting, this book will bore you. Come on...is it so hard to believe that the advertising world is saying to the macho men, \\"Dood, yer a man and goyles are stoopid, do this so you can make them let you have sex with them\\" or, alternatively, \\"giggle giggle ladees, you don't want to be alone and ugly, so do this so that men will be fooled into giving you The Rock even though they hate everything about you except what they get out of your parts\\"? of course it's not! This is pretty obvious stuff; in fact, the very foundation that heterosexuality is based upon; the silly lie that creates a bargain between the two of them. Check out any advertisements for diamonds, plastic surgery, matchmaking companies, etc. And now that the GLBT world is ripe for advertising, gay men (to advertisers, they are the sole representatives of the GLBT community) are going to be--to advertisers--a fascinating amalgam of this miserable gendered world, as advertising is about nothing but gender--a mistake this book has made, as while it has discussed SEX as prime fodder for advertising, it misses the fact that it is really GENDER that advertising is about: \\"euuu, if you're not a girly girly perfumed giggle, you won't get that man\\" or \\"if you're not a manly manly man man man women are stupid we're men then you're a stupid girl\\", and with gay men, \\"men men men manly men men men men\\" while lesbians are ignored because, hey, they neither want men nor are men. those who opt out of gender completely are utterly ignored by advertising, and that is my biggest critique of this book: the author doesn't seem to understand that advertising feeds gender and gender feeds advertising, and the two-gender system, led by the identity of being a MAN and/or the desire to be desired by men is the raison d'entre of advertising. A penis on Jennypie Anniston's neck means nothing if you don't: a. want to sleep with Jenni Anniston, b. want to be Jenee Anniestone, or c.enjoy talking about Jenniefurr Annystone with your other gay male pals during brunch. In essence, this book's lack of gender/sexuality analysis is its biggest flaw.It in essence acts as if all consumers are straight males longing to sleep with Hollywood girlies. While these beer-swilling meatheads definitely contribute to why advertising are poisoning the brains of the masses, there are also incredible amounts of silly females poisoned by their longing to be silly Hollywood twits that are just as affected by advertising as those macho males who long to see penises on Jennypie Annyston's throat. P.S. I am as far from a \\"feminist\\" as they come; I am just repelled by gender and how it is used, abused, and manipulated by advertisers not only to reify the pathetic gender norms that create the \\"sex wars\\", but also to encourage them. I can only hope that someone else writes a book on advertising (and not a 'feminist', mind you) who has a more nuanced notion about how pathetic and dualistic notions of gender both reify AND prescribe the dichotomies of sex/gender which continues to create humans, both men and women, who are half of what they could be."},{"Title":"RULER OF THE REALM","review":"Although I have not read this story in the epic, I have read the other two. They are very good. Herbie Brennan tells a very scary, but gripping tale of war, love, secrets, and lies. This is not a book for young children, but for ages 12 and up, it is a great read.The last chapter of the 2nd book has left me begging for more. I hope to get this book from my public library, although I don't think they have it...This is a great read for any believer or lover of sci-fi fiction, or fantasy involving Faeries and demons and light and dark forces. I recommend this for any young adult or fan of fantasy, but I repeat, this is not for the light-hearted or those who believe books are not meant for scare."},{"Title":"RULER OF THE REALM","review":"the book was in better shape than listed and was sent in record time this is a good person to buy from and i will be buying more from him"},{"Title":"RULER OF THE REALM","review":"Some little minion told me in advance about something that happens in this third book of the Faerie Wars chronicles... and so I set it aside for six months. Dang it, I should never have listened! When I finally picked it up, I enjoyed it more than the first two. It is more of the cheeky humor--and more fanning of the flame between Blue and Henry... sigh....--and more violence, though not the cruel-to-kitties type from the first book, thank the Light. I think my favorite part is... um... How can I state this without creating a spoiler? Let's see: the validation of Mr. Fogarty's claims regarding alien abduction. There. Loved this one. (Please don't purchase for kids below high school age; they understand the violence but they may have questions about the s-e-x parts that you aren't ready to answer yet.)"},{"Title":"RULER OF THE REALM","review":"Faerie Wars was an all-around great book. Purple Emperor wasn't quite as good, but I still liked it. This one...I would classify most of the plot of this one as weird. It was still interesting, and it was actually REALLY good at the very end, but there were a few places where I felt like I was plodding through.However, I did really enjoy some of the character growth. I'm getting kind of annoyed at the Henry-Blue relationship, and wish that Brennan would do something already. This book didn't finish it, but made some progress. I also really liked the way the plot came together, but it did start out slow.If you liked the way the first one was structured, this one is better than Purple Emperor, but still not as good as Faerie Wars. I'm hoping Brennan returns to his original structuring for Faerie Lord.So I would Recommend it, but not highly recommend."},{"Title":"RULER OF THE REALM","review":"Another fast paced adventure in this series. The same characters are seen, and Henry's life on Earth is still just as confused. At the opening of the novel he is trying to convince himself that the Fairie Realm is his reation to stress and that he created it all in his mind. Of course he and the reader get to be really confused as he is abducted by aliens and later transported a la Star Trek into the Fairy Realm.The love Henry and Blue feel for each other is exploited in this and Blue is having a hard time dealing with the pressures of being the Ruler.While these books are about fairies and magic they have alot more of a tomboyish bent to them than a girly froofy fairy tale. Some very fun scenes happen and clearly this is not the last book in the series."},{"Title":"RULER OF THE REALM","review":"A new 'Faerie Wars Chronicles' title for middle-school fantasy enthusiasts will reach both prior fans of The Faerie Wars and newcomers, who will find most accessible the story of the newly crowned Queen Blue, who is trying to rule her new kingdom. Her visit to the Spicemaster brings a warning and when her brother discovers a secret weapon just when Lord Hairstreak offers peace, trouble ensues, furthered by Blue's disappearance just as Henry returns from the Analogue world. It's the third adventure in the chronicles, but leisure readers will find it quite accessible."},{"Title":"RULER OF THE REALM","review":"this was a fascinating read. i really enjoyed it. i read all 4 books in this series and loved everyone. it takes you away from the day to day ordinary time."},{"Title":"RULER OF THE REALM","review":"Title: Ruler of the Realm by Herbie BrennanPages: 423Time spent on the \\"to read\\" shelf: 2 or 3 years.Days spent reading it: 4 days.Why I read it: I first purchased Faerie Wars for my wife as a Christmas present. I was experimenting with a book I thought she might like. Turns out it was a phenomenal book. This is the third book in that series.Brief review:I loved Faerie Wars and its sequel The Purple Emperor. So I was expecting good things from Ruler of the Realm. I was not disappointed. The target audience for these books is definitely teenage readers, however it is also being marketed to adults (I've seen mass paperbacks in the Fantasy/Science Fiction areas that are aimed at adults, not teens). These books are definitely worth being read by any fantasy reader.Herbie Brennan has great characters. However, the real selling point for me from that book on is Herbie Brennan's mastery of plot. I will not reveal much about the plot, because it is so great and fluid that even talking about basics gives away the plot from previous books. His books take 2 or 3 complete story shifts through the book. NOTHING is ever as it appears, and great revelations are made throughout the series. Ruler of the Realm has some great seismic shifts.My biggest complaint about this book is that Henry (who I would consider the main character from the first two books), is sidelined during most of this book. His character just is not doing much. A little disappointing, because Henry is such a likable character.My only caution to readers: This series does have demon characters and sometimes odd (or scary) rituals that reflect a pagan worldview. I was put-off by some of the events, but not so much that I would not recommend this book to teenagers whose parents would talk about the content.Favorite quote: He was reaching for another crystal bloom when the guards fell on him like a tree.Stars: 4.5 out of 5.Final Word: Surprise!"},{"Title":"RULER OF THE REALM","review":"If you liked Faerie Wars, you'll like this one.

Lots of action and surprises that make it an easy entertaining read."},{"Title":"RULER OF THE REALM","review":"I guess you could say this was a science fiction/fantasy blend. I can easily see why Artemis Fowl fans like it, and know that it is a great tale. Yet, Herbie Brennan does not give you history about the Realm. His names for characters, places and things are uninteresting and sometimes boring. However, once you get over the fact that it is an unhistorically backgrounded realm, then you will enjoy it.The first book was gory, and strangely horror-filled. I knew someone who read it who, although they liked it, thought it was VERY freakish and mean to animals. I admit, this series is NOT for the faint hearted, and defintely not for fans of epic description, lagging five or so pages on a character's appearance, while he dies the next chapter.Yet, Harry Potter fans will delight: the humor of this story is almost exactly like that. The characters were the best part, and although their names are aforementionedly boring, they themselves have nothing to regret. I give you a short list of important characters, and someting destictive about them:Mr. Fogarty--The most humorous charcter in the book, an old WWII veteran brought to the Realm.Henry--The main character in the series, Henry has a crush on Blue (see Blue) and continually is brought to the Realm, sometimes against his will.Pyrgus--My personal favorite character is Prince of the Realm, and continues to try to protect Blue, the Empress.Blue--Empress of the Realm, she hones a secret crush on Henry, and gets herself into a heck lot of trouble.If there's to be another chronicle in this series, I will get it the first day.This is a fantasy that, strangely alike with AF, does not descend from Tolkien."},{"Title":"RULER OF THE REALM","review":"I liked this even better than the first two books in the trilogy."},{"Title":"RULER OF THE REALM","review":"My favorite books are fantasy and while I may not put this right next to the dragon lance series, I thoroughly enjoyed the set."},{"Title":"Ivor Horton's Beginning Visual C++ 6, Installation & Contents Guide","review":"I've given the book 5 stars simply because the contents have been '4 &amp; 5' starred by many others already (see ISBN 186100088X)I have to say it that way because I was editorially involved with the book. That said, I'm specifically answering the US reader who rated the book but hated the Compiler...There was very minor 'doctoring' of the Compiler: you have to run programs within the product; it had a 'nag screen' come up when you compile and, for Windows programmers, a statically linked MFC( Microsoft Foundation Classes)which gave normal, but fatter code than the full priced product.Other than those caveats you're getting a $100, Visual C++ product, for close to zilch.

In fact, Windows 3.1 was a contributing factor on my decision to give programming.I decided to buy this book after reading Horton's Beginning C++ that a friend had loaned me. The Beginning C++ was easy to understand, filled with explanations and examples, and allowed me to work at my own pace.This book follows the same formula.

It has all the repetitiveness of a five-paragraph essay, and is written in a rickety academic prose. By which I unfortunately do not mean that it's abstruse or deeply complex. In other words: not an artistic tour-de-force. Also, don't look to this book as a way of understanding suicide, which is out of its scope to explain. But, like a good workhorse, the book gets the job done, and does succeed in tying a great number of facts and sources together. If you're interested in Dostoevsky's religious convictions, or the society in which he was writing, this is a wonderfully intruiging book."},{"Title":"Tuning for speed and tuning for economy,","review":"I bought this in 1967 to guide me in taking care of a Triumph TR3.

Although an avid reader, I find myself involved with non-fiction especially in the area of quantum physics and cosmology. Well, the 99 cent price of this eBook had me doing what I vowed never to do; I read \\"Time Ship\\" and will never regret doing so!This is one spectacular piece of writing! The interplay of not only the characters in the tale but the back-and-forth time sequences of these same relationships, on different level, was intriguing. The author's writing was very pleasurable in both the direction and detail on the subject of the book and his character development was concise and made the characters highly believable. I will not disclose any of the book's content in order to take away from future reader's pleasure, but let me assure you that you are 'hooked' very quickly and find it hard to not want to continue reading deep into the night."},{"Title":"Time ship","review":"If you like a pre-modern writing writing style, like H.P. Lovecraft, you will like this book. It is an example of the 'Tell, don't show' style. Thus, the reader is told in the voice of an ever present narrator what the characters are doing and feeling instead of vividly describing what things the character actually sees and and his actual reactions to those things are. Thus Lovecraft would say \\"the horrble sights of the monsterous ruins caused the boy to go mad\\", w/o describing what 'horrible' actually looked like and what going 'mad' meant as a reaction in this context. A modern writer would instead simply vividly describe what happened: 'the trembling 10 year old boy's eyes widened at the sight of the huge transparent, crumbling castle made of skeletal bodies whose arms reached to grab him and he screamed and screamed and could only close his eyes and wet his pants\\". Thus the reader is left to supply the words horrible and mad, and the reader actually knows what is going on instead of taking Lovecraft's word for it, and the voice of the narrator is not even needed. Having a narrator in charge is simply a way of making speaches, a way for the writer to carry on a conversation with himself and force the reader to listen to it. And this writer has no understanding of modern physics at all, the discussions of the space-time continuum represent mind-bending ignorance. His so-called dialogs are just written speeches of two sides of an argument that the author controls, and in reality in this book, neither side knows what the hell is going on."},{"Title":"Time ship","review":"Both the characters and the narrator feel like they have the same blase personality, like some extra from a 1950's movie. And it's as if the author thinks nobody has ever heard of time travel, tediously explaining basic concepts. I don't want to be a jerk when this is probably his passion project, but serious sci fi fans should stay away."},{"Title":"Time ship","review":"Mr. Cottrell has hit a home run with this work! It is very entertaining and intriguing - one of those rare books that you hate to put down before completing the entire book. I am still thinking about the book and trying to get it all clear in my mind one week after reading it. It is an excellent book!Steve Izard."},{"Title":"Time ship","review":"I came to this book partly because of a review for the book The Time Machine: A Sequel, in which the reviewer suggested Time Ship as a better sequel to H. G. Wells' Time Machine. To be clear, this is NOT a sequel to that classic in any way.SPOILERS AHEAD!!Firstly, the title itself is misleading. In my mind \\"Time Ship\\" invokes visions of some sort of craft that a time traveler would enter and use to move about through time. Not so in this book. In fact, the book barely has any time travel at all. Rather, it's more about the development and subsequent effects of time travel. The plot for the book became predictable within the first couple of chapters. I was able to discern how character relationships would be revealed in relation to time travel within moments of said character's introduction into the narrative.I found the characters to be flat and boring, not to mention contradictory to themselves, and, often, unnecessary. A large portion of the book chronicles the main character trying to dissuade his research partner away from attempting time travel after spending much time and energy convincing the same partner to join him in his quest to develop time travel! I found one character to be particularly annoying and unnecessary: the prerequisite Crazy Christian who goes on a personal quest to defeat the abomination of time travel, only to have his antagonism amount to essentially nothing. Equally useless is the reporter who is always lurking about, but whose efforts also amount to nothing, and the love interest who is summarily dismissed by the author after several chapters of courting by the protagonist.Most of what works against this book is the author's reluctance to commit to it. Years of research are glossed over in the span of a few sentences. Little to no information is shared about the main character's lifelong benefactor, arguably the most important character in the book. Relationships and characters are built up only to have them fizzle in order to get to the next plot point.Ultimately, I found this lagging and predictable, and just wanted to get through it so I could move on to another book. A story that has promise in concept is defeated by predictability, lackluster storytelling, and uninteresting characters."},{"Title":"Time ship","review":"Let me start off by saying that Time Ship is not only a great first novel, but a damn good one at that! I understand that some readers couldn't enjoy the book because of the writing style, but some of the reviews came off as hostile! This book, nor its author deserves that. I genuinely feel bad for them. They missed out on a good read.As for my actual review... Time Ship doesn't provide Sifi bang. If you're looking for that, go elsewhere. If you're looking for enjoyment from Paradox effects, Time Ship is for you! Yes, it's kind of predictable, and some of it made more spiritual sense than scientific, but that didn't ruin my enjoyment. It would have with other novels, but Time Ship feels immune.At .99 cents it's not right to complain about this book considering the quality you're getting. In fact, if I had the authors P.O. Box address, I'd send him the difference of the paperback price because I feel like I somehow ripped him off!In closing I'd say just give it a try. If some of the other reviews have you worried about writing style, download the sample. It's what they should have done... they wouldn't have had to waste time and energy angrily waving their fists about the dollar they just lost."},{"Title":"Time ship","review":"I can't really say I liked this story. It started out promising and then just seemed to drag. The plot was decent, but the execution was poor. As another reviewer indicated, the author spends a lot of time TELLING us exactly what the characters think and feel, instead of SHOWING us via descriptive language. A lot of the dialogue is clunky and stilted. The author spends way too much time having characters discuss the various mechanisms and feasibility of time travel.Also, the plot will most likely be very predictable for anyone who has read more than a few time travel books (or seen a few time travel movies). The author takes way to long to get to the focus of the story, and then drags out the ending. Even after everything appears to be wrapped up, the story continues for pages and pages, from another character's point of view. And finally, the author attempts to give his story one final twist, which is not consistent with everything else that had been set up and revealed, and thus in my opinion further diminishes the story.Save yourself some time. If you want a good time travel story, rent the movie, \\"Somewhere in Time\\", which is a fun time travel movie and a pretty close approximation to what this story tried to be."},{"Title":"Time ship","review":"I've been into time travel novels lately and decided to give \\"Time Ship\\" a try based on the description. I loved it! I truly cannot understand the two negative reviews. I think those readers may have been looking for a fast paced story with lots of time travel back and forth. Sorry, but this book takes a much more serious and scientific approach to the subject. The author spends more time than some others I have read exploring the paradoxes and other issues involved with time travel. Personally, I appreciated this.This novel is expertly written with great character development. There are very few typos and formatting problems compared to most low cost e-editions. I agree that this book would make an excellent movie and I look forward to a possible sequel. Keep up the good work Gary!"},{"Title":"Time ship","review":"I love time travel stories and this is one of the better ones I have read. It has some unique twists which is difficult to come by other than the typical paradox. The only thing lacking is some technical descriptions of the actual process but the rest of the story was good enough for me to overlook that aspect. Well done!"},{"Title":"Time ship","review":"As the book description promises, this story stimulates some thought provoking concepts about time travel without the excessive romance and spine tingling action that is normally padded into novels of this genre."},{"Title":"Time ship","review":"I just finished Time Ship and for the life of me, I can not see why anyone would give this book one star. It may not be your typical time travel story because it deals more with how time travel affects lives not so much traveling in time, but the story grabbed me from the begining. I really look forward to other books from this author."},{"Title":"Time ship","review":"So I found the story that this book is based upon very interesting, what's not to like about time travel and geeks! I think the author spent too long on making the story complicated and twisting threads around one and other. I generally dont read books in one sitting, normally over the course of a week and often I found myself forgetting certain details. To the point that when the book ended some of the final wrap up seemed rushed and I did not fully understand all the different threads of the storyline and how the played together. I found myself thinking 'thank-you' at the end, not so much for the book itself, moreso that I had finished it. I would not recommend this book to a friend."},{"Title":"Time ship","review":"Well, I just finished reading your novel, Mr. Cottrell, and I must admit to thoroughly enjoying it. It was well thought out, smartly written (it truly had a 60's feel to it), and overwhelmingly entertaining. A good job was done with the characters -- I could feel a sense of relationship with each. Foreshadowing was sprinkled throughout, perfect for a rousing time travel novel. You make me look forward to my own retirement and the possibilities that will exist. I enjoyed that the story contained concerns the reader could relate to, but it did not become offensive, contrived, or overly-predictable. And take heart, what some reviewers may find slow and mundane, others may find interesting and necessary for plot and character development. Obviously, I belong to the latter group. Great, great job, sir. Keep on writing, and we will be sure to keep on reading.

So glad I found it! It is very well written. I found it to be mysterious and exciting. I had a hard time putting it down. It grabs you from the beginning and doesn't let go 'til the end. Definitely my kind of story. Looking forward to seeing what Mr. Cottrell comes up with next."},{"Title":"Time ship","review":"What a waste of my time. Let's outline the next couple chapters then flesh it out after the fact, now let's do that all the way through the book. Don't waste your dollar on this story."},{"Title":"Time ship","review":"This is a enjoyable book and you can't beat the price. The editing was decent (few errors). If you are like me, you won't be able to guess all the plot twists (although I was \\"on to\\" some of them fairly early) but I don't want to spoil your fun. I particularly liked the way the scientists argued issues regarding the behavior of light and the nature of time. Unlike a lot of time travel stories, this is not a multiverse view of the cosmos. Try it - I bet you'll like it!"},{"Title":"Time ship","review":"Only by sheer persistence did I get half way through this stinker. I found myself saying aloud, \\"Just get on with it for heaven's sake....\\" If listening to two self absorbed scientists talking talking talking talking about the possibility of time travel is your cup of tea, then this is the book for you. However, if you'd like something interesting to actally HAPPEN, then maybe you might want to pass this one up. I couldn't get it off my kindle fast enough. What a waste of my time, and of space on my device."},{"Title":"Time ship","review":"I purchased this book based on the description given. Bad move! I found this book long winded, overly worded, and boring. I couldn't make it past the second chapter without putting it down because I had lost interest.

I knew what was going to happen almost as soon as a character was introduced.If you like to be led by the nose when you read, then this one is for you. If you prefer to be surprised and left wondering, then pass this one by. While I found the writing to be fair, the story lacked substance. I did finish the book, but I had to force myself to continue reading and when I finished I was unsatisfied."},{"Title":"Time ship","review":"Well I have to say that the idea is good however I found it a little predictable however a good read. Rate it a 2.5 out of 5."},{"Title":"Time ship","review":"This story was not quite what I expected. First of all the reader does not get to experience time travel at all; the story is told from the perspective of characters who are witnessing the effects of travel. Also, the main characters are intellectuals and therefore speak and think very differently than your average reader. Their conversations, for example, felt scripted and artificial rather than being a natural exchange."},{"Title":"Time ship","review":"\\"Time Ship\\" is a good book. It's not a mind-blowing one, and the story itself is not the most original plot ever written. On the contrary, the plot itself is kind of predictable. Yet, what is nice to read is the implications connected with time travel. It's not the act of the travel itself, it's the consequences. I think that this is the focus of the book. So, if you want a twisted, complex plot, probably this isn't the right book for you. But if you enjoy thinking about what could happen if time travel was possible, then give it a chance.The only downside of the book is the ending - to be completely honest it didn't satisfy me. The ingredients were all there, and they were good, but somehow the mix wasn't as great as one could expect. Still, it's worth the read."},{"Title":"Time ship","review":"The Time Ship is probably the 50th book I have read about time travel, and this one had a lot of surprises and plot twists. Even though this is an older book, and the plot moves more slowly than modern books, it keeps your attention.

It keeps you interested and leaves you with a wow when you figures things out."},{"Title":"Time ship","review":"The story is about time travel and the conflict it causes.

Dulles and P. Grandfield who also recently received the homage of a book: The gift of the Church (you can find it in Amazon). The authors select among the huge material in this field some of the best articles and books dealing with the several possible items of the eclesiology: biblical, patristic, dogmatcis, councils, primate, ecumenism, mission, church-religions...Pitty that is too reduced to the english speaking area of theology."},{"Title":"Listen to the Nightingale","review":"This story is happy in deep ways--not superficial. The author understands the world of ballet, and how a girl might feel when poverty and responsibility could keep her from being the fine artist she could be. The story is intriguing and the writing is masterful. IF THIS BOOK WERE REISSUED IN HARDCOVER I WOULD BUY LOADS OF THEM AND GIVE THEM TO EVERYONE I LIKE."},{"Title":"Listen to the Nightingale","review":"If you loved Noel Streatfeild's &quot;Ballet Shoes,&quot; you'll be just as passionate about Rumer Godden's &quot;Listen to the Nightingale.&quot; Certainly they are very different books, by very different authors. But what I find similar is each author's ability to create vivid, complex characters. Like Streatfeild, Godden isn't afraid to give weaknesses to adults and strengths to children. Charlotte is a very talented dancer - but she tells lies, loses a role to a false friend, has her feelings bruised, and through it all keeps the reader's sympathy and interest. The ballet background is beautifully detailed, but it's the personalities that are so memorable."},{"Title":"Listen to the Nightingale","review":"&quot;Listen to the Nightingale&quot; is an enchanting work. It revives, in part, the setting of Godden's &quot;A Candle for St. Jude,&quot; for Charlotte Tew, who was Lottie in &quot;A Candle for St. Jude,&quot; afrer the death of the famed dancer Anna Holbein and the closing of her school,studies at the Royal Ballet School. Lottie's deepening engagement with the dance. her journey from the London streets to the stage, her fascination with Salvador, and the profound impact her time at the school has on her and her aunt, will delight even those who do not yet know Miss Godden's work.

I've read it about six times, and will probably reading it over and over again for as long as I live. Rumer Godden has a wonderful story, and wonderful chracters.

It's so much more."},{"Title":"Hunger Signs in Crops: A Symposium","review":"I received the book in the condition in which i could expect it to be the best in. I am really happy with the product"},{"Title":"Shin Megami Tensei: Nocturne--The Official Strategy Guide","review":"Quite simply, and with no beating around the bush, you need this guide. If you've got the US or UK version (entitled Lucifer's Call rather than Nocturne)this is the guide for you. The game itself is incredibly hard without it, as anyone who has played it and run straight into a level 50 demon within minutes of starting could tell you.But do not despair, this book is your new bible. It is a pocket size encyclopaedia of all things demon related, and will be your new best friend. Trust me.It is nearly 400 pages long, has every bit of information you could possibly need and is fairly easy to understand once you've got used to the layout. At first I was put off by the sometimes confusing layout, I am a simple man, and want all the information I want right there in front of me, I'm not one for all this cross-referencing lark, flicking between pages and whatnot. And you WILL be flicking forwards and backwards a LOT, but once i got used to it, it all fell into place nicely.I have racked up over 100 hours of gameplay thanks to this book, double what the back of the game says, and i still haven't captured every demon in the game. Without this book I would have given up on this game after my first play. In fact, I did. It wasn't til I found this book on the Net a few weeks later that I thought about restarting it, and I am glad I did.So if you're one of the people who, like me, loves a good rpg but was put off by the difficulty, then I strongly urge you to invest in this guide. Any rpg-er will tell you the main pull is to find all the hidden quests/demons/gems (delete as necessary) and this book allows you to do just that, as well as giving hints on how to beat some (really rather tough) monsters.And no, it's not cheating by getting a guide. Some of my friends say it ruins the games to buy these sort of guides, but they are all crazy fools! Let them enjoy their 50 hour final fantasy's, i'll be getting a full 200 hours out, and be hitting 5 times harder than them when it comes to the end of the game. Woo hoo, I'm the man!Anyway, the point is I would never have got past the first hour of this game had it not been for this book, and so it was well worth investing in. If you own this game and DON'T have this book, then unlucky pal. If you do own this book, well done, you made the right choice."},{"Title":"Shin Megami Tensei: Nocturne--The Official Strategy Guide","review":"please place an order 4 more nocturne stategy guides. this game is mad fun and very challenging. please 4 the sake of rpgers everywhere(and so i dont have to pay 60-90$ 4 a freakin strategy guide)."},{"Title":"Shin Megami Tensei: Nocturne--The Official Strategy Guide","review":"I was planning on keeping my strategy guide in the best condition possible so I could try to resell it. Nope, couldn't do it. This strategy guide is so handy that I've used it at least one a day while playing. The guide has very useful sections like one that shows what demons there are and their stats(with an index) and what spells there are and what they do(with an index). There's also a fusion chart which shows what races combine with other races to create other races. Even beyond all of the useful things in this book, it has nice extras such as a foldout poster, two bookmarks and character art. :) Also, the book itself is easy to hold, not being the size of a magazine like some inferior strategy guides."},{"Title":"Shin Megami Tensei: Nocturne--The Official Strategy Guide","review":"Double jump makes good quality guides and this is one of their best.

This has GOT to be the largest guide I have ever seen for a video game.

Its a great guide for a great game."},{"Title":"Shin Megami Tensei: Nocturne--The Official Strategy Guide","review":"This little book has a great wealth of information on this game. It's a little tricky to use, but once you get the hang of it, it's priceless. The maps and boss strategies are especially helpful. And who could forget the fusion guide? If you buy Nocturne, buy this book!"},{"Title":"Shin Megami Tensei: Nocturne--The Official Strategy Guide","review":"The official strategy guide for \\"Shin Megami Tensei 3: Nocturne\\" is mind blowing in how big it is. Offering over 300 pages (while not exactly coming in at the 400 that the guide claims it has on the back over), the guide reveals almost every single detail about the game aside from going into Tolken-like descriptions of the background textures of the levels you will come across. The guide also features pictures of every single demon in the game, and tells you how to get every single recruitable one. Finally, the guide also features interviews with the makers of the game, which provides incite on the past of the SMT series.However, the book is not without several flaws, and those are listed as follows: First, the size of the book is not much bigger than that of your standard holy bible, and due to this problem the guide is small and somewhat fragile. Due to the cheap binding on the pages that it is printed on, users will find the pages coming out of the guide quite easily as they read it. Also, the editors of the guide did a bad job in several places. Spelling mistakes, errors on boss and party member information, and game strategy are wrong in a handful of places on the guide.Also the guide is vague on how to accomplish some of the more \\"hidden\\" tasks in the game (I.E. enabling the true last boss), and it requires reading through the whole thing to get the general idea of how to unlock those features. It also provides maps that are somewhat difficult to read, which says that the editors could have probably spent more time working on making the maps easier to follow. The guide however still does a good job of directing the player's actions thought the game, but it does show that the content of the guide does leave something to be desired. It is still highly recommended for anyone who plays SMT3: N, mainly because the game has so many little secrets that would be easy to miss on the first play through."},{"Title":"Shin Megami Tensei: Nocturne--The Official Strategy Guide","review":"A most invaluable guide, for one of the greatest RPG's ever! I picked up this game finally after 2 or 3 years of yearning for it! It was really hard to find in the area where I live! To my utter joy one of the game stores around here finally got in a used copy! I picked it up immediately (albeit with no instruction manual)! To my dismay, the world was so massive, the items, skills, Magatama, enemies, etc.! So I started searching for a game guide, to my dismay discontinued! Oh but Amazon had them, to my surprise, they were going for anywhere from $50 dollars used in so so condition, to a $100 plus brand new! I opted to go for an $86 slightly used copy, and I must say that it has come quite in handy! I love it! A must have guide for a must have game!"},{"Title":"Shin Megami Tensei: Nocturne--The Official Strategy Guide","review":"This book is a wonder of it's kind. If only the other strategy guides I have had were as wonderful as this. A monster of a book filled with everything you need for the game.

Monster stats, abilities, and even boss tips can be found within the pages of this guide, so get it while the getting is good."},{"Title":"Shin Megami Tensei: Nocturne--The Official Strategy Guide","review":"This guide was very useful for the shear amount of information it has; however whoever wrote it made many mistakes. There are many cases where the listed weaknesses and strengths aren't correct. Also, the way they did the binding, the book can lose pages rather easily with constant use. Another complaint is with the treasures. Though you know what are in the chests for each floor, you don't know which treasure corresponds with which chest, so for floors with many chests, you can't tell which chests aren't worth opening. The maps however were extremely useful as this game was originally a dungeon crawler, and the beastiery is almost necessary."},{"Title":"Metabolize: The Personalized Program for Weight Loss","review":"The media has hyped the French diet as being so healthy.

First for Women magazine had an article about a new book that came out in Jan. of this year called METABOLIZE. I bought it out of desperation having tried everything else.

The idea that one person's metabolism is probably different than another person's makes a lot of sense to me. And why do all these fad diets assume that they work for every type of person on the planet?First you take a self-test in this book to determine your type. Then you can figure out a diet based on relative amounts of certain nutrients you need. Apparently, certain nutrients have exact opposite effect in some people--a high protein, low carb diet may be absolutely WRONG for you. I sure would like to know that BEFORE I decide on a diet plan.I also like the fact this book includes exercises, breathing exercises and recommendations for supplements and vitamins. The calorie levels are also set so you can pick one that suits your size and sex (not everyone should eat an extremely low calorie diet.) Of course the book also has sample menus, which are always helpful. Finally, the paperback edition is a reasonable size to fit in a purse or in a briefcase, meaning it can go with you anywhere.I wasn't sure if I was Atkins, Pritikin or NO KIN to any of these (turns out I am mixed, so that is why I had trouble) This book is really excellent and I can recommend it to anyone who wants to lose weight and eat right."},{"Title":"Metabolize: The Personalized Program for Weight Loss","review":"I was told you are 50 years old you can't change and you will always be fat.Metabolize ghanged my life and my body.Ilost 47lbs and have the energy of a 35 year old.

Contrary to many interpretations of this work, I did not view it as a historical novel, at least not the history that is represented on the surface. Instead, it is the history of Poland, Christianity and Judaism now, then and every time in between. Furthermore, it is a story of the human condition. One should not approach this novel in a literal sense. If you do, you are bound to be disappointed."},{"Title":"The King of the Fields","review":"Many years ago, when I was a teenager, I read Singer'sEnemies, A Love Story. Today, I barely remember the plot or the characters. What I do recall is the sense of beauty and strength in the writing, how it evoked strong feelings and emotions. I have meant to go back and re-read that book. Now after reading The King of the Fields, I definitely will.In this novel, a story about a small tribe in pre-industrial Poland, the Lesniks, and their leader Cybula, Singer manages to evoke a good number of universal human experiences, in particular disturbing thoughts. For example, Cybula deals with his desire to die rather than confront the problems of daily life, as well as his discomfort with seeing his own daughter nude. He seeks truth but is constantly confused about what is true or not. His tribe believes in many gods, but this belief is tested when it encounters a Jew and later a Christian bishop. Who should he believe? As far as he can tell, his own gods did not protect him or his tribe from misfortune and the new gods seems to come with their own burden of contradiction, rules and cruelty. This basic questioning of religious faith - to believe or not, of so what to believe, and if so, how to deal with the contradictions and inconsistencies? - is something that most people confront and deal with at some point. Cybula's default is his god of death, who seems to be the final arbiter who gives peace when someone dies.The religious aspect is but one of many different perspectives upon which the novel touches. There are also the plusses and minuses of industrialization, including the challenges and meaning of giving up a former way of life. There is also a lot of substance to be found on the meaning of relationships between men and women. Singer presents this in a very crude and raw form, as they probably were in those pre-modern times, with women being completely subservient to man. At the same time, Singer shows how this power relationship can be easily inverted given the right circumstances.This is a powerful novel that will resonate with the reader for a long time. Read it and enjoy the work of this Nobel laureate who has been called a master story teller."},{"Title":"The King of the Fields","review":"Singer in his novel \\"The King of the Fields,\\" written in 1988, just three years before his death, examines religions (Christian, pagan, Jewish), myth, male-female relationships, sex, politics, and man, through a purported history of pre-medieval Poland. The novel is basically an existential examination of man and his beliefs positioned in a fairy-tale world. In many ways it shares themes with the Book of Job and possesses slipstream qualities similar to those in William Golding's The Inheritors and Jack London's Before Adam. But even this comparison is not accurate. Perhaps, a better comparison would be to Kafka's \\"The Castle,\\" Hesse's \\"Narcissus and Goldmund,\\" Bergman's \\"The Virgin Spring,\\" or Camus' \\"The Plague.\\" All of these books are philosophic texts examining belief and philosophy. Each of these books illustrates how a novelist can write a philosophic text without sacrificing the essential qualities and pleasures inherent in a novel.The story is set during the emergence of Poland approximately three or four centuries after the death of Christ, a time when the hunter-gatherers are beginning to cultivate the fields and missionaries from Rome are arriving in the Northern woods to convert the pagans to Christianity. In his created world of the forests near the Vistula, Singer demonstrates dramatically the interaction and absurdities of religion as exercised by untutored, unlettered men, struggling for supremacy and survival in a state of nature. Like Hobbes, Singer shows man in this fantastic world as brutish and deadly; with his survival depending upon strength, intelligence, guile, and luck.Iron men ravage the land, destroying, murdering and raping; however, our protagonist, Cybula, although a skilled hunter, is not a hero or a warrior. Instead, he seems to be a precursor to the Singer nebbish. He assumes control when fate demands it but he is never comfortable with the mantle. Women control his life, although he seems to have an inordinate success with them. He is not comfortable with the change from hunter-gatherer to sower, farmer, villager, although he quickly sees its advantages.The action begins when a group of Poles take control of a tribe of Lesniks; hunter-gatherers living near the Zakopane mountains. The Poles led by Krol Rudy, the Red King, descend on the Lesniks like wolves on sheep. They murder the men and rape the women. Some of the Lesniks, led by Cybula, flee to the forests and the mountains but most of the survivors--women and children--fall under the control of the Poles. Eventually, Krol Rudy makes peace with the Lesniks because he needs workers to harvest his wheat. He, then, makes Cybula his head-man and marries his daughter to tie the Lesniks and the Poles together through marriage.On one level Singer uses this story to study the transformation of the Lesniks from hunter-gatherers to town dwellers and farmers. On another level he follows the progression of man's beliefs in the gods. First Ben Dosa, a Jew, arrives in the village, and he brings the message of the one God. Later, a priest arrives and he preaches Christ and accuses Ben Dosa of killing God.Suddenly, religious prejudice arises and hatred of the other fills the villagers with rage. The women attack a Mongol woman for her slanted eyes and they beat Ben Dosa for trying to protect her. Within the context of the novel, Singer works in the theme of the scape-goat and hatred of the Jew, as other.We quickly realize that Singer is using the historical novel to comment on the present, on the way the world is now. Although, the Jew, Ben Dosa, is a decent and moral man, Cybula is the protagonist and the one who carries Singer's ultimate message. Cybula worships only one God and that God is death. Singer's conclusion is:life is short and brutish and the only tangible, living God that man can expect to speak or reveal himself is death. For Cybula there are moments of passion and happiness but these moments are short and rare. There is always another Krol Rudy who wishes to take control and dominate.Ultimately, the novel is existential in theme. Cybula is a loner, who leaves the village and lives in exile in the woods with his young wife, Kora, and waits for death, which he expects to arrive shortly. Ben Dosa seems to experience a bit of happiness in Rome with his people but even his happiness is overshadowed by superstition and emanations of fate.Although the themes of the novel are dark and man's future bleak, it is an amazing book. Singer translated it from the Yiddish and the prose is precise and lyrical. He carefully describes the society and its inhabitants. Each character is delineated and articulated. And even though it is a complete fabrication, more a fairy-tale, than a realistic rendition of a historical period, it is so well-wrought that you believe in it and its characters.Singer's novels, like the novels of Kafka, always seem to have a quality of otherness to them. When the villagers talk about the witch god, Baba Yaga, you expect her to appear. Mystery and magic seem to lurk around the edges, although the novel is meant to be realistic. It is this magical realism that raises the book in my esteem."},{"Title":"The King of the Fields","review":"This novel, a pre-history of Poland, is really a post-history of Isaac Singer. The concerns of his character and the characterization of this Poland is Singer's: a man who has a plural marriage (this time with a mother and daughter, sometimes it is two sisters, sometimes unrelated women), who grows disgusted with eating meat, and whose only faith is the belief in death. This is the end of The Family Moskat: \\"Death is the real Messiah, and that is the truth!\\" And here it is again, slightly less brilliant and stiring, but not without some drama and interest. Singer's Poland (like Singer's New York) is really about the difficulty of finding and maintaing belief in our world, a world that works to strip us of it with unbending will."},{"Title":"The King of the Fields","review":"\\"The King of the Fields\\" is a little unusual for Singer. It is one of the last novels he wrote and maybe he decided to abandon his usual framework and try something different. The central character is not a Jew but is a heathen, Cybula. Nominally the period is some time around the century or so after Christs death which I think is much earlier period then any other of his novels (\\"The slave\\" is 17th century - I can't remember reading anything earlier). In the novel he imagines a primitive Polish tribe of hunters who are conquered by another group who force upon them a more agricultural way of life. This kind of dates it much further in the past. In fact its best to relate to the novel as a fable, a musing on various changes in human society and not to treat the events or contexts too literally..After the hunter group are conquered their leader Cybula flees to the mountains while the leader of the conquering group, Krol Rudy, marries Cybula's daughter. Cybula eventually returns to his village and joins forces with Krol Rudy. Cybula is sent with another member of Krol Rudy's group, Nosek to a nearby town - this is the first time he has seen any community outside his own. They return from the town with a Jew and a slave girl. When they get back to the village Krol Rudy is gone mad and no longer functions as a leader. Cybula, who for most of the book is carrying on a fairly open sexual relationship with his best friends widow and her daughter (both of whom approve of this) eventually becomes the leader of this primitive community.The Jew becomes the villages teacher and all seems well but of course it doesn't last.There are plenty of developments in the story not to mention rape, incest, human sacrifice, matricide and lynches. All this makes the novel sound a bit heavier and depressing then it is. The story flows, there is much black humor and the characters are interesting and as with most Singer books once you start it you can't put it down till you finish it. So an interesting and entertaining novel worth your time and, as with everything else I have read by this author, recommended."},{"Title":"Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise","review":"I had half of this book left when I had to report for jury duty and, though my choice was unintentional, I could not have had a better companion to fill a day of waiting and boredom. When Ruth Reichl decided to become the restaurant critic for the New York Times, she had to give up a sunny, relatively anonymous way of life in California to become one of the most watched-for faces on the culinary circuit. In an effort to do her job well, Reichl not only had to develop a thick skin, but also a number of different characters to play (with full costumes and personalities) when doing her research. These discoveries and transformations not only impact her relationships - especially poignant are those with her young son, Nick - but also her understanding of herself from commune to critic.Having written for perhaps the most venerable newspaper around, I expected the quality of Reichl's writing to be good. Her style is easy and inviting, and instead of pictures we are given sporadic reviews that appeared in the Times and some of her own enticing recipes. Reichl appreciates food in ways that most of us could only imagine, but as readers we are indiscriminately brought into this world. The mere sight of a mushroom on my plate makes me nervous, but I was still able to enjoy these restaurant tales as though I had a broader palate. Perhaps this book is not for the true connoisseur, but for those of us who enjoy good food, good wine, good company, and a good story . . . or if you find yourself stuck on jury duty, this is a fun read."},{"Title":"Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise","review":"\\"New York is the centre of the American restaurant world.\\" And a job at the New York Times as its new restaurant critic could potentially make nervous wrecks of anyone, never mind the new upstart from California, home of veggie burgers and tofu salads. But New York throws out the welcome mat. Even before Ruth Reichl arrives, there are \\"wanted\\" posters of her in nearly every restaurant in the city, as well as substantial \\"bounties\\" for spotting her. So much for anonymity! Now how is \\"the most important restaurant critic in the world\\" to get her job done?With the help of wigs, makeup and vintage clothes, Reichl morphs into Molly, Miriam, Chloe, Brenda, Betty and Emily, fooling every sharp-eyed waiter and restaurateur in the city. Her personas are hilariously funny even as her reviews are mouth-wateringly delicious. Unlike the previous critic Bryan Miller with his penchant for French, Italian and Continental establishments, Reichl is an equal opportunity critic - dining and reviewing even Asian, Indian and Latino restaurants, leading her readers into hitherto unknown territory of the city's culinary map.I admit to being a fan after reading her earlier novel \\"Comfort Me With Apples\\". And I thoroughly enjoyed \\"Garlic and Sapphires\\" which not only has some of her best restaurant reviews and recipes from her own kitchen but also anecdotes of her life in New York and her time at the paper."},{"Title":"Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise","review":"During the 1990s, Ruth Reichel was the restaurant critic for the New York Times. When she began the job, she realized that a majority of the restaurants she would be reviewing knew what she looked like and were on the lookout for her. Therefore, she created a number of disguises for herself using clothing, wigs, and makeup. I highly recommend this book for an enlightening look at how Ruth's costumes changed the way people treated her as well as the effect on Ruth herself.I found it intriguing how Ruth took on other personalities almost without trying to. When she dressed as her mother she found herself ordering the foods her mother liked, and criticizing and returning foods to the kitchen as her mother would. My favorite character was Brenda. She wore a long and oddly scruffy carrot red wig that made her look rumpled and sleepy as if she had just climbed out of bed. She wore bright colored clothing, large colorful eyeglasses, and lipstick painted on bigger than her own lips. The way people treated her was different and wonderful. They smiled at her and talked to her. They wanted to spend time with her. They wished her well. Ruth states \\"Brenda was my best self, the person I've always wanted to be. She was generous and funny, optimistic and smart. She was kind. I hoped that finding the Brenda inside me would not always require a wig.\\" See the end of this review for Ruth's comments during an interview about wearing disguises.I also loved Ruth's artistic and sensual descriptions of food. Personally, I am not into food and I cook as little as possible. So I was surprised that I was entertained with her eating experiences and her knowledge of food. Some examples follow.P 86 regarding oysters. She said \\"You can't eat these. They've been out of the water too long. See how dry it is? An oyster should have abundant liquid in the shell. See how dull it is? When an oyster first comes out of the water, it is shiny, luminescent. It looks like this moonstone. But the longer an oyster is out of the water, the duller it becomes. This, as you can see, has no shine at all.\\"P 60 regarding a japanese noodle restaurant: \\"It takes a magician to make soba. They are made of buckwheat, which has no gluten. That means that getting them to hold together is an act of will.\\"More than once during this book I thought about truth being stranger than fiction. For example, Mr. Shapiro purchased a dinner with the author through a charity fundraising auction. He bragged to her that he always insisted on being the last person out of the restaurant. Her dinner with him lasted six hours. He was a jerk in other ways as well. My first reaction was disbelief that someone like him even existed. Another item that surprised me was about a man who would not give any money to his wife but allowed her to purchase as much clothing as she liked. Therefore, she frequently purchased two of each article of clothing and would give the second item to a consignment resale shop.There is an interview with the author at the end of the audiobook, which does not appear in my paper version of the book. In that interview, the author discusses several topics, one of which follows. I've done some editing for length and clarity.\\"When I first started wearing disguises, I thought it was about being anonymous and that it was all about the job, but as time went on I began to see that it's very hard to pretend to be someone and not be that person. People react to what you look like and you yourself begin reacting to how people react to you. I found being in disguise was a way of connecting with myself in a way that I hadn't anticipated. It was also a way of seeing how important (pause). You know, we always say don't judge a book by its cover and it's only the surface, but the truth is that it is more than surface deep. I started thinking how important clothes are and the way that when you're a little girl you make these choices about what you're going to look like and how important it is every time you cut your hair. You're making these decisions and thinking about what it is that people are going to think of you. The surface that we present to the world is very conscious, even when we think its not. We're always thinking about who we are in the world. Our clothing choices and our hair choices and our makeup choices are all saying to the world this is how I want you to see me, and the world really does see you as the way that you present yourself.\\"Setting: 1990s New York area.

Reading Garlic and Sapphires is almost as wonderful as just tasting it. She knows how to describe things and it makes it like the reader is actually there. You can feel her fear, anxiety, and excitement. She has a peculiar connection with food. Yet her whole experience is simply delicoius. For example she describes sashimi as soft and luxurious, but (you never know) some book just might say Oh! Just delicoius! and BOOM thats it.

I often go to the \\"starred\\" restaurants and have my own opinion not only on the food but on how I was treated as a normal everyday person. Having a food critic do the same in costume and actually rate the restaurant based on this makes me want to give her a standing ovation. Hopefully, restaurants around the world have learned something from her and her very equitable way of evaluating restaurants. Ruth writes so very well and entertainly, and you are torn from your own reality into her world of costumes and intrigue. I highly recommend her books if you like food, wine and real life New York restaurants. It may change where you decide to spend your hard earned dollars next time you go out to eat."},{"Title":"Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise","review":"Gourmet magazine's editor-in-chief Ruth Reichl provides a sometimes funny and often insightful account of her days back in the nineties as the New York Times food critic, certainly one of the most influential culinary posts in the world. She obviously did not take this responsibility lightly judging from the amount of effort she went through to disguise herself in restaurants she had to review in order to avoid preferential treatment. In fact, one of her more intriguing insights is how a fine dining experience can and should be the great economic leveler, and her disguises would often reflect a lower socioeconomic status or an out-of-place temperament, including pretending to be her own mother. No matter whom you are, according to Reichl, you can walk in and place your credit card on the bill tray, and for however long you want to be at a formal restaurant, you can be anyone you want to be. Like a paid fantasy come true with no emotional repercussions, one of the big reasons people go out to eat is to have that experience of being glamorous and wealthy. Reichl understands this concept clearly, and she is enthusiastic about helping people appreciate what they're going to experience in the way that any good film, art or dance critics can.Her zeal can be infectious, especially as she breaks with tradition and explores ethnic food in the outer boroughs of New York with creative abandon. Her approach apparently did come at a price as she has made enemies at the Times and among those who had come to expect four-star ratings from the paper. When she describes her courage in facing her adversaries head-on, Reichl can come across as smug and sometimes cloying in her attempts to deflate egos, even though she offsets those comments with discourses on colleagues she truly does love and respect. Moreover, she fluently displays a breadth of knowledge about the overall trends in the American culinary movement of the last quarter century. The author doesn't quite have the been-there-done-that tone of Anthony Boudrain in his books, \\"Kitchen Confidential\\" and \\"A Cook's Tour\\", nor does she have the idiosyncratic wit of Alan Richman in his eclectic food travel tome, \\"Fork It Over\\". But Reichl's book does lend a uniquely personal perspective, is it is as much about politics at the New York Times as it is about food, an almost professional survival manual that would serve both present-day foodies and future food critics equally well."},{"Title":"Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise","review":"Get the scoop on what life is like as a foodie writer! What may seem like a dream job certainly has its quirky side! Reichl writes to entertain and inform and you need not live in New York to appreciate her New York moments in the eatery scene. She fairly gives all eateries their due, from hole-in-the-wall ethnic cafes to uptown linen and stemware fine dinner houses. This books makes an excellent gift to readers in the trade or for those who simply enjoy eating out."},{"Title":"Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise","review":"The title of Gourmet magazine editor Ruth Reichl's third food memoir comes from TS Eliot's Four Quartets and is courtesy Ruth's husband, Michael but the reader doesn't understand his reasoning for the quote until near the end of this delightful collection of tales of Reichl's time as food editor of the New York Times.Filled with stories of her life as a critic, reviews of New York restaurants--well known and some not as well known, as well as recipes, this book is absolutely unputdownable. Imagine, if you will, how Ruth discovers, on a trip to NYC that her photo is plastered on bulletin boards in restaurants all over the city and decides that that she's not going to be able to go to restaurants as herself and fairly do a critique. Instead she devises a plan. She will go incognito. Ruth enlists an old friend of her mother's who was an acting coach and with her help she becomes Molly, a middle aged woman from the Midwest; Brenda a vivacious and friendly woman; the sexy Chloe; Betty a plain elderly woman, and even Miriam her own cantankerous mother. As one can well imagine, these women get very different treatment from one another and VERY different treatment from Ruth Reichl, the food critic.My mouth was watering as I read of Ruth's experiences in restaurants that I can only dream of eating at in NYC (although I do admit that I will attempt some good sushi again after reading how it is properly eaten) and I know that many a fine eating experience will be enhanced.I borrowed the three Ruth Reichl books from the library, but will be buying copies of my own for my keeper shelf. I am not sure if I will eventually try any of the recipes, but I sure want to. The only thing that disappointed me was that after reading these three books, one right after another, that there are no more Ruth Reichl books to read. I guess I am going to have to satisfy myself with a subscription to Gourmet magazine and hope she has another book in her future with which to entertain her legions of fans."},{"Title":"Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise","review":"First, the obvious: food is for eating. Food is very, very rarely fun to read about; we may think we enjoy it, but ultimately, it's no fun being teased unless we can have some kind of release at the end (and last I checked most food books don't come with a mini-fridge). For this reason, food literature seems to appeal to a very particular group of masochists, or those who at least have the means and ease of running out to satisfy their cravings when the going gets tantalizing. Somehow, however, Ruth Reichl manages to make not only writing about food, but writing about writing about food both entertaining and gastronomically bearable.In Garlic & Sapphires: The Life and Times of a Food Critic in Disguise, Reichl grudgingly accepts a position as the new NY Times food critic, but the trouble starts before she even moves to New York to start the job. On a plane from LA, she is recognized by a waitress who begs her to reveal where she'll be eating that night, confessing that the information is worth a lot of money in the high-stakes restaurant world of the Big Apple. Not only does the waitress know Ruth by sight, however, but she quickly ticks of a list of personal details like the name and age of her son, and what her husband does for a living.The lack of anonymity may not be a problem for some food critics, who make it their business to dangle coveted four-star ratings before chefs who are all-too eager to create fabulous dream-like meals and offer the most idyllic table service. After all, the Times picks up the bill, and what would be the point of paying big bucks for small fries? Reichl, however, sees herself as something different - during her interview, she openly criticizes the paper's high-brow approach to restaurant ratings, telling the editors that most people reading the reviews will never be able to eat at Le Cirque or Daniel (at least not on a regular basis) but want to be able to imagine that they can. And once they're there, Reichl discovers, they probably never get the same service as the glitterati.It quickly becomes established Ruth Reichl is the Peoples' Food Critic (which occasionally gets her into trouble at the paper and with her readers). So, in order to maintain her anonymity - to have a truly authentic experience as a diner - she begins to don disguises, taking on different identities in her quest to rate the restaurants of New York with open eyes. She gets in character, complete with wigs, make-up, and costumes that render her unrecognizable to her coworkers, the elevator operator, and her husband (but never her pre-school age son, Nicky, which becomes one of the book's many charms). She dons the attitudes of her fantasy eaters along with their clothing, becoming in turn her mother, a red-headed bohemian that her husband develops a crush on, or a frumpy and invisible forgotten old aunt at a table of her friends and colleagues. The differences in how Reichl is treated (often going to the same restaurant in and out of character) is astonishing, and these moments are the punchlines of the memoir.Reichl's work as an editor at Gourmet shows; she seems to anticipate potential criticisms. After I started feeling a bit uncomfortable reading about the casual consumption of fois gras and the lunch menus of the elite, she addresses the morality of being a food critic. One review near the end feels lackluster and a bit dull; the following chapter explores a period of ennui, as she tires of the costumes and the pomp and circumstance of eating out. Occasionally, text in the chapters and the reviews were a little repetitive, and at times the restaurant reviews are a bit anti-climactic (maybe because Reichl's writing skills have since improved, or because of the mandated seventh-grade reading level for newspapers). I sometimes tired, just a little, of the descriptions of foods that I will probably never eat myself.Still, Reichl does such a marvelous job of putting you in the seat of a restaurant critic (or one of her ill-treated characters), that it's easy to play along; her descriptions of food manage to conjure the intangible and utterly personal.Her treatment of the gender, class, and generational issues pervasive in the world of fine food gives Garlic & Sapphires more weight. Each chapter is a different restaurant experience, typically with a new character, and includes the original restaurant review and Reichl's own recipes (an acceptable substitute for a mini-fridge). I've found that my own experience of going to restaurants has changed for the better since reading this book, which is probably the highest praise one can offer someone who spends a lot of their time writing about food. Reichl manages to balance our interest in and out of the restaurants, through the streets of New York, and in the office, delivering a fast-paced and dynamic memoir - it's almost good enough to eat."},{"Title":"Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise","review":"Anyone interested in food and dining MUST READ this book. I bought it in the San Francisco airport after a gastronomical honeymoon blowout (1550 Hyde Street, The Slanted Door, Chez Panisse, Bouchon, Cyrus) so I didn't feel TOO envious at Reichl's mouth-watering descriptions of divine meals at New York's finest restaurants.... but I appreciated her attention to the vagaries of atmosphere and service in such places. I never realized how \\"democratic\\" Reichl was, compared to other NYT reviewers -- radical, even -- going to lengths of disguise in order to see how these places with their astronomical prices treat the \\"average\\" person. Frequently, like crap! (Fortunately we didn't experience this anywhere in California.) Also, she put more of a focus on \\"ethnic\\" restaurants than reviewers before her, which was prescient. Honestly, I was lukewarm on Reichl's other two books, and I'm not too crazy about that crazy yellow-fonted Gourmet cookbook she did... but this one is great.

Yet when she describes the food, her writing is almost magical. She reminds us that food is art, that food is beautiful and sensuous and exciting and fun.

In order to avoid simply describing how the restaurants feed important people, Reichl enlists an acting coach to disguise her. In the course of the book, Ruth becomes Molly (a nouveau-riche Midwesterner), Miriam (her own mother), Chloe (a gorgeous blond), and so on. Each disguise takes on a personality, and what Ruth learns about herself and others through each one is really interesting (although I felt the stories drag once or twice).Occasionally Ruth tempts us with tidbits on the political and social importance of food (how politicians signal affiliation with minorities by eating ethnic foods, for example), and at one point she brings up an issue that made me uncomfortable throughout the book: she writes an article entitled, \\"Why I Disapprove of What I Do: It's indecent to glamorize a $100 meal. Or is it?\\" But it's just a tease: her answer is unsatisfying, and the reader is left to decide whether glamorizing elite food in the face of world hunger is okay or not.Her husband, at one point when she gets caught up in the glamour of her job, reminds her why food is really important (besides the obvious biological role): \\"You love to eat, you love to write, you love the generosity of cooks and what happens around the table when a great meal is served.\\" In an interview with the author at the end of the unabridged audiobook, Reichl adds insightful comments on the social role of eating together and the value of family dinners.In sum, Reichl can describe food like no other, and her experiences are interesting. I felt the book was a little too long, and I was disappointed by the superficial treatment of social issues. That said, the professional critics have been solidly positive: the New York Times called it \\"never less than fascinating,\\" and the Washington Post said it was \\"funny - at times laugh out loud funny - and smart and wise.\\" It's certainly worth taking a bite and seeing if you like the taste."},{"Title":"Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise","review":"I stumbled upon Ruth Reichl a few years ago with her first novel \\"Tender to the Bone\\" and loved her. While I wasn't as wild about her second book \\"Comfort me with Apples\\" this lastest of her releases has me a raving fan again. She is funny, and candid and allows a bit of voyerism into a life some of us think we might want. Be prepared for a laugh, and a little educating on the New York Restaurant scene."},{"Title":"Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise","review":"Ruth Reichl's \\"Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise,\\" centered around the author's work as a restaurant critic for The New York Times. Knowing that restaurants would go out of their way to make her eating experience as wonderful as possible, Reichl had to resort to disguising herself when she went to the restaurants that she wanted to review. She hoped to give her readers as accurate of a review as possible.I enjoyed this book immensely as it is highly entertaining to see the author disguised herself and the restaurants had no idea who she was at all. This book provided an insight look into the life of a restaurant critic for one of the more prominent newspapers in the country. It was not as easy as one would think due to the free meals in posh restaurants but Reichl showed that there were politics involved when it came to reviewing restaurants. In addition, I like that Reichl provided some recipes for her readers which didn't seems too difficult to make. I like this book a whole lot better than Amanda Hesser's \\"Cooking for Mr. Latte: A Food Lover's Courtship, with Recipes\\" which was more impersonal and the recipes too impractical. I highly recommend this book as it is fun and witty!"},{"Title":"Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise","review":"Who doesn't dream of being someone different every now and then? In Garlic and Sapphires, Ruth Reichl shares her forays into the world of alter egos as she strives for anonymity while preparing restaurant reviews for The New York Times. She uses a diverse array of disguises, and creates stories and personalities for each one. Her alter egos allowed her to get an \\"everyman\\" experience at a restaurant instead of the red-carpet treatment, and she wrote her reviews accordingly. Also refreshing was her introduction of a wider variety of ethnic restaurants into the vaunted Times reviews. Each section packages up a restaurant and a persona along with some personal insights.I thought this book would probably be interesting, but I had no idea I would have such a hard time putting it down. Reichl's writing is humorous and flows well. Her food descriptions are vivid and truly mouth-watering. She really captures not just the food, but also the essence of the dining experience. Meals are not just fuel for the body; they also feed the soul. An entertaining and easy read, Reichl leaves you hungry for seconds."},{"Title":"Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise","review":"I loved this engaging memoir by the New York Times food critic. I particularly enjoy Reichl's egalitarian view of fine dining (everyone should have the same great experience, famous or not). As a lover of good food and fine dining, I found this to be a very entertaining read."},{"Title":"Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise","review":"I am not a foodie. However, Reichl's writing is so vivid I found myself thinking about the dishes she describes. Her style is easy to follow without dumbing the language down. The novel is one part funny anecdotes, one part food, and one part introspection. A great read!"},{"Title":"Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise","review":"Reichl is one of my favorite authors and I think I've read everyone of her books. Perhaps that is why I especially enjoyed this book. It was so much fun! I feel like I know Ruth from reading all of her auto-biographies. This book definitely gives you a different view of the competitive world of restaurants. I think I've enjoyed fine dining even more since reading her latest book. When's the next book??!"},{"Title":"Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise","review":"If you are a food fanatic you will love this humorous yet informative book. Written with great insight and imagination it is a splendid true story. It is worthy of a Michelin star or two!"},{"Title":"Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise","review":"A truly enjoyable read. Ruth Reichl is more than an epicurean, she is a poet. Her memoir takes you through an intensively personal account of what it means to become the foremost food critic in America.People who love food will salivate reading her descriptions of many varied types of cuisine she enjoys in its best form,People who don't dine out at fine dining restaurants very often could learn a few things, namely:DON'T DINE AT A TOURIST TRAP"},{"Title":"Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise","review":"I found Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise by former New York Times Restaurant Critic, Ruth Reichel as enjoyable as a warm plate of risotto paired with a glass of red wine!In Garlic and Sapphires, Reichel recounts the six years she spent contriving clever disguises to hide her identity as she gallivanted around New York City's restaurants and bistros writing reviews for the Times. Reichel's memoir focuses on three aspects of her life at that time: her personal life as a wife and mother, her restaurant patronizing as a critic, and her life as an employee of the venerable and mighty New York Times. Reichel's descriptions of her son are touching and heartwarming, her recounting of the extremes she went to in order to create and truly become her aliases are entertaining and amusing, and her telling of the behind-the-scenes goings-on at the Times are fascinating and fulfill the gossipy voyeur in all of us.Reichel is a talented writer and her truly joyous love of food, cooking, and eating are evident on each page of the book. The book is peppered with Ruth's favorite recipes and this adds a certain feel-good warmth to the tome.My only criticism of the book is that I had to be willing to suspend my good reason in order to believe that Ruth truly became the characters she created to the extent she described. According to Ruth, she was so immersed in these characters that she found herself unable to use her own judgment and mannerisms while inhabiting that character's persona. For example, is she was dressed as \\"Miriam\\" she was brash and rude and \\"Ruth\\" had no control over the rude things that came out of \\"Miriam's\\" mouth. This was slightly hard to believe - but maybe I just don't have the same amount of acting chops!The title Garlic and Sapphires is only briefly alluded to and comes from a poem written by T.S. Eliot.Overall, Garlic and Sapphires is a delicious romp of a memoir that I truly relished devouring - excuse the puns!"},{"Title":"Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise","review":"Reichl is a witty, smart writer who certainly knows her way around food. She has this uncanny ability to make food and the ritual of eating accessible to her reader, no matter how removed the reader may be from the actual setting. I recoiled in horror thinking about shrimp writhing as they died in the 'Dancing Shrimp' centerpiece in a chinese banquet, but nevertheless enjoyed reading her account of the events that unfolded on the evening in question.The characters that she works with are as colorful as the make-believe characters she invents, ostensibly to avoid being recognized as the restaurant critic of the New York Times. As she dons her various disguises, she adopts a whole new personality. The premise that adopting a new personality influences the experience of eating is as entertaining as it is revelatory. All in all, a refreshing, well-written book."},{"Title":"Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise","review":"Reichl is brutally honest about herself, which makes for moving stories. At one point she dresses up as her crazy mother and enjoys the freedom of being an obnoxious old lady. I read this last book in the series first and it prompted me to order and happily read all the others."},{"Title":"Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise","review":"I loved this book and if you enjoy good food, New York restaurants, and great storytelling, this book is for you. Read it cover to cover on a plane trip & laughed and salivated all the way through!"},{"Title":"Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise","review":"Ruth Riechl has a way with words when it comes to food. One can't help but be hungry after reading her accounts of meals in New York - they are so vivid, you can almost taste them yourself."},{"Title":"Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise","review":"I really disagree with the \\"most helpful critical review.\\" I absolutely loved this book! I am not much of a restaurant goer--I don't like cold dining rooms, I don't like to wait for my food--I like to be in my own kitchen, in control. I never went to Chez Panisse when it first opened and began to get rave reviews because it was in Berkeley and I lived an hour and a half south--that was just too far to go to dinner. And so often restaurant food is just not worth what one has to pay for it--I leave a restaurant thinking \\"I could have done that better,\\" and I spend the rest of the evening disappointed. This book, then, was a way to enjoy restaurants without having to visit them, to savor the good experiences and not have to suffer the bad. Reichl writes deliciously, her disguises were wickedly amusing, and her work became a road to self discovery. We all need to learn how to do that. I couldn't recommend a book more to anyone who is interested in good food."},{"Title":"Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise","review":"This was the book my book club picked for last month. I would never have picked this book myself to read. It was very interesting and gave me a different perspective on dinning out and the restaurant industry. Ruth Reichle is one smart and interesting lady."},{"Title":"Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise","review":"I was long overdue to read this book and enjoyed every last drop of it. Ruth Reichl writes about food in such a descriptive way that you can practically taste it. It's a book about more than just food reviews. Reichl gives you a glimpse into her mind and palette as she experiences food disappointments and pleasures from around the city.Her stories also paint a vivid picture of what it was like working for the NYT - an amazing, but competitive, news organization. There were many laugh-out-loud moments when she talks about her various food critic disguises. There were some surprisingly emotional side story lines as well, like the one about the department's secretary Carol.The balance of laughter, sadness and self-reflection made this book a treasured addition to my bookshelf. It's a must-read for the food lover."},{"Title":"Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise","review":"I LOVE RR in general and have read all of her books, but this one was a big disappointment. A huge part of the book is old food reviews and the rest is the stories of the disguises she wore to restaurants and how she came up with them. This wouldn't have been a bad book if there had been less of the (now very old) restaurant reviews and more of the story telling surrounding them. This just felt like filler between publishing a greatest hits of old articles."},{"Title":"Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise","review":"The reviews got a little long at times. It was interesting to read of the disguises she picked and the recipes were interesting. Just a little too wordy which made it tiring to read."},{"Title":"Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book and seeing a different perspective of what food critics are like. I just wanted to keep reading to see what adventures Ruth had as an editor of Gourmet too."},{"Title":"Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise","review":"I so loved this book. I love food. I love to cook it, eat it, read about it and watch it on TV. So this book was right up my alley. I loved her descriptions of her visits to the restaurants, and how the final review becomes the final word. Her descriptions of the food was mouth watering. And the disguises were insightful.If you really enjoy all aspects of food, you'll love this book.

She is able to combine her personal life experience, her desire for professional culinary satisfaction, yearning for husband and family and never ending quest for the perfect meal and wine pairings. Best of all, her idea of a perfect meal includes her husband and child. How lovely.

Her disguises were part of the fun. I read her columns when she was at the LA Times and we still miss her. I agree with some reviewers that got a little bored with the detailed description of Japanese buckwheat noodles, but after all, she's a food critic. What else would she do?"},{"Title":"Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise","review":"Ruth Reichl explains the genesis for her disguised reviews. Her explanation of being asked to become the Times restaurant critic reveals New York to value intellect over comfort or beauty. She portrays herself as a little naive when the Times woos her for the job. We know she's smart; she can't disguise herself as dumb. It's such a fun book.Sheila Ellenbogen"},{"Title":"Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise","review":"I love this woman. She writes books that are full of information and fun.

This book describes in hilarious detail the many disguises she assumed to turn the world of food critiquing into a reality show of epic proportions! Laugh out loud good. One should really start with her first book, \\"Tender to the Bone\\", to get the full effect of this writer's charm."},{"Title":"Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise","review":"This was the first book written by Ruth Reichl that I had read although I was familiar with her through Gourmet Magazine. Her style is lighthearted and humorous which moves the story along well. At first glance it seems like a foodie book about her crazy tenure as a Food Critic for the times. The book wraps up with a deeper, introspective look at life and finding what really matters. It was an enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise","review":"I have not gotten around to reading it yet but I cannot wait to dig in. From the few pages that I have read, I know it is a good read."},{"Title":"Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise","review":"I enjoyed what was a pretty light, unchallenging read. This book doesn't knock your socks off but it does provide an interesting look at the role of a restaurant critic for such a powerful publication. It doesn't provide any great insights, very little surprised me. I would have preferred to see more of the reviews and hear a little more on the wonderful food encountered. I'm not so sure about the role of the recipes scattered through the book. Most of them have little connection with their placing in the story."},{"Title":"Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise","review":"I prefer to read on my Kindle but I can't see the justification for a higher price for the digital edition for this 6 year old book than for hardback or softcover.

This one was good and I enjoyed reading about her New York Times' experiences (and back flashes) but it didn't have quite the pizazz as her others. Still worth reading, though."},{"Title":"Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise","review":"I decided to buy this book after hearing an interview with Ruth Reichl on CBC. It was the first book I've read by her and definitely the last. Yes, it was interesting to read about the different treatments she received based on perceived social status; however, I found it rather too much when she was \\"becoming\\" a different person, timid or obnoxious, as soon as she put different clothes on and a wig. Also, after a few chapters, I started getting a little annoyed with her constant \\"I found myself saying\\". There are also remarks in the book of how Mrs. Reichl finds New York people rude; ironically I found her character (her real character) rather pompous as she rarely had anything good to say about others but plenty of criticism."},{"Title":"Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise","review":"The book might be fabulous but I will never know as I want to purchase the digital edition. However, the digital edition is more expensive than the soft cover version or the hard cover version. That seems ludicrous and unjustified and I will not be purchasing this book. Also, 13$ for a book which is a few years old? Why?"},{"Title":"Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise","review":"I preferred Tender at the Bone and Comfort me with apples. Reichl does describes the meals to make you feel as if you were there eating with her."},{"Title":"Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise","review":"This book left me feeling like I consumed too much, uncomfortable and wondering why I spent so much time doing it. It's a little interesting in the way that it's a little interesting to know what Paris Hilton is saying and doing. In fact it may be exactly the same as reading this book. The author is good at describing food but not that wonderful at making the stories involving. Her fascination with herself bleeds into bizarre as she dons disguises at various times. I found her reviews and the peek at the underbelly of the New York Times fairly intriguing. However, the uncomfortable feeling comes from my understanding of how the privileged in this country have taken conspicuous consumption to obscene levels and we all become participants by glorify them. I don't want to know any more about Paris Hilton or read any more food orgies thank you very much."},{"Title":"Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise","review":"Maybe it's not such a good idea to have the author read her own book aloud. Ms. Reichl is a much more talented writer than reader. I found her delivery so nasal and monotone and gasp--Boring! that I didn't even finish the first disk. Now I shall go in search of the book to read myself as it does promise to be interesting. Just not read aloud by the author please."},{"Title":"Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise","review":"Reichl is a knowledgable food critic and a talented writer, however I was uncomfortable with her use of alter egos to get restaurant reviews. Her disguises went far beyond seeking anonimity; her true personality quirks were allowed out of their cages, where they normally are housed in polite society. Most of this was harmless, although there were times when she became quite catty. She belittled a person who had purchased her dining companionship for the benefit of charity. Even though the person was a bore, it was her duty to see the evening through without compaint, or she should have never auctioned herself off. I would have expected her to set some ground rules for the evening, rather than letting herself be abused (restaurant choice, length of the committment, etc.),then becoming resentful. It would have been easier for her to write the charity a check and excuse herself. On another occassion she dressed vampishly and led a man on. She was married and deceived a gentleman over the possibility of a deepening relationship, even though she paid for her own dinner. Her husband was uncomfortable with the deception, as was I.This book is a display of Reichl's self-absorbed, brattish behavior. Her reviews were fair and even inspired, however her behavior was not."},{"Title":"Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise","review":"I enjoyed Reichl's previous two memoirs, so when I spied this third memoir on the new books shelf at the local university library, I seized it. Unfortunately, it doesn't live up to its intriguing premise of her as a critic in disguise. She does discuss the first \\"undercover\\" meals of each persona, but she doesn't follow up on them. Apparently, the restaurants discover her alter egos so she creates new ones. But how do they do that? Does she always eat undercover? She doesn't answer many questions. I like her brief discomfort with the homeless man on the bus begging for food; she feels badly and gives him her leftover $100 doggy bag. But then (despite still feeling guilty about being paid to eat extravagant meals when many in NYC are homeless and hungry) she writes a lame column somewhat touching on the issue and then we never hear about it again. Was her guilt in reviewing food that many can't afford to eat part of the reason why she resigned? We don't know because she drops it. And what about the crusade against her by the previous food critic? It bothered her enough to mention it in the book and to use his real name, but after she discovered the nasty letters written about her, she drops it. Wasn't she angry? What happened? Something happened since she worked in the same area as the grumpy ex-food critic. This book just didn't meet the standards of her two previous memoirs, which are funny and well-written. This one had many passages devoted to her recipes and long descriptions of eating food (a salad became a forest, a fish the whole ocean, etc.) which is understandable since she is a critic, but I'd like to know: a) do people other than foodies really enjoy that food? Most of it sounded absolutely horrifyingly disgusting to me and b) do wealthy people go there to enjoy the food or just to enjoy the fact that they are wealthy? I can't imagine that having $100 million suddenly makes you love sauteed goose liver with fish eggs (ick) when what you really like is Kraft Mac N Cheese mixed with Starkist tuna (water-packed)(yum!). And how does she stay thin? It sounds as if she eats about 10,000 calories a day. These are the questions my inquiring mind wanted to know."},{"Title":"Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise","review":"I was extremely disappointed with this book. I expected to read more about the inner workings of NY restaurants, not recycled reviews from the New York Times. I thought it would be interesting to read about how she fooled restaurants with her various disguises. I did not expect to read page after page of where she bought the wigs, how she found the clothes, etc. etc. You can only read \\"the tastes exploded in my mouth like hundreds of little fireworks\\" (not a true quote from the book) so many times before you start skipping over the reviews. Save yourself some money and read the actual restaurant reviews from the Times' archives. I wish I had."},{"Title":"Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise","review":"Am I the only reader who felt that Ms. Reichl's fascination with disguises bordered on creepiness? Perhaps I'm naive, but is theatrical make-up, a wig and a new wardrobe absolutely required in order to mask the identity of a newspaper food critic? Did it sound perhaps like Ms. Reichl had perhaps a bit too much time on her hands? Was it absolutely necessary that she create long and detailed lies to tell complete strangers (the manicurist and unsuspecting dining companion Dan Green)simply to write a compelling restaurant review? I think not. It seems she simply enjoyed playing dress up and putting one over on everyone.All in all, I couldn't get past the author's odd behavior to appreciate her talent as a food critic. While I did enjoy Tender At The Bone, this is certainly a book I would skip. As another reviewer here mentioned, many parts of it felt contrived, exaggerated and perhaps, with Ms. Reichl's penchant for creating an elaborate ruse, simply untrue."},{"Title":"Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise","review":"Interesting behind-the-scenes peep into what makes a food critic. This gave me a different perspective on what seems like the perfect job."},{"Title":"Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise","review":"I just read this book cover to cover on a flight back to NYC from Barcelona. My mouth watered as I read the included reprints of her past reviews of NYC restaurants - even after my five days of fantastic Spanish cuisine! But more surprisingly, I was drawn in by what seems to be quite an honest glimpse of the NYC restaurant experience seen through the eyes of many \\"characters\\". The book left me such respect for the depths that Ruth Reichl went through in order to dine as the everyday person would experience, especially in NYC's \\"best\\" restaurants. Her recounts made me actually appreciate the research and dedication required to write a truly objective (as objective as food tastes get, I suppose) review. A very easy and enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise","review":"Ruth Reichl uses words to describe food the way Van Gogh used paints to describe a starry night. I actually tasted the flavors on my tongue and felt the warmth and texture of the dishes she describes. She has an almost erotic connection with food and is shares her food-lust with her readers with something approaching wanton abandon.I read this book in a day, rushed back to the library and read her other 2 books that same week. I can't wait for her to write another."},{"Title":"Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise","review":"good insight into the world of a food critic, fun read for foodies. somewhat repetitive towards the end, and the whole episode with the lawyer who was also a food connoisseur seemed a little made up (she randomly starts talking to him at a bar, and he immediately starts talking about the new york times food critic, and also invites her to the very same restaurant she was meaning to go to, without being prodded? too much coincidence). but she does seem to love food a great deal and writes well about it. i was surprised, but shouldn't have been, by the various underhanded ploys used by upscale restaurants to make their patrons spend more money."},{"Title":"Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise","review":"Ruth Reichl, now editor-in-chief of Gourmet magazine, was restaurant critic for the New York Times from 1993 to 1999. Prior to her, Mimi Sheraton and Brian Miller, good writers and critics, had held the post. Reichl brought restaurant criticism to a new level. Her reviews took into account not only the food, but also the treatment she received by the waitstaff, and also who the other clientele of the restaurant was. She would often comment on the \\"ooh\\"s\\" and \\"aah's\\" from the table next to her reacting to the food.In order to avoid being recognized (her appearance is distinctive, with a round face, wild dark hair, and strong, hadsome features) she would disguise herself. This book is a behind-the-scenes look at how she arrived at the different personas that she used to hide the real Reichl when she went out to eat. Some actors I've seen should be so thorough. Included at the end of each chapter (each a different dining Reichl) is the reprint of the review she wrote after dinng there as the character.If you enjoy fine dining, or reading about food, and especially if you've never read her writing, you'll love this book.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise","review":"I approached this most recent creation of Ruth Reichl with a degree of skepticism. Could a food critic really be entertaining? Within the first 4 pages I found that not only could she be entertaining, but also downright hilarious, insightful and reflective.It would be impossible to do the book justice in any review, so I won't attempt to do that here. I will say that if you enjoy a quick paced book about human nature, human interactions, high society with twists of humor, insight and poignancy, this is the book for you. Garlic and Sapphires has become my faithful companion on my long commute, and I have repeatedly laughed out loud, ignoring quizzical looks.I love the recipes as much as the prose, and can't wait to buy another Reichl creation!"},{"Title":"Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise","review":"A romp through several years in the life of the New York Times food critic who had to go in disguise so as not to be made by the resturaunts she was reviewing. It's a fabulous read into food the likes of which most of us will never experience. If you love food and want to know how the better half eat it, read this book. It's as good as going to dinner with her"},{"Title":"Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise","review":"Ruth Reichl's passion about food could have made her the sort of irritating foodie snob that she skewers in \\"Garlic and Saphires\\" or the sort of ethnic restaurant evangelist who forgets that a dingy location in a dodgy part of town can ruin a meal as much as bad service or overcooking. Thankfully she seems to blend the two together on her crusade to be a \\"spy in the house of food.\\" Reichl proves that there is so much of social hierarchy and belonging to a tribe when one dines out that it is possible to have a completely different experience simply because you don't look like every other patron in the restaurant. There were some truly inspired moments in the book such as her meal at the Four Seasons where she dressed up as her late mother and got treated like a celebrity. Her moving conclusion was that life is too short not to treat yourself well, once in a while. Her son's reactions to his food at high-priced steak houses and the maitre D's reactions to her son were classic. As a new parent, I feel apologetic bringing my child out to a restaurant, but as long as they are well-behaved, I wonder why I should have to after reading that. I agree with other reviewers that remarked that this \\"memoir\\" was a tad unbelievable at times. Whole swaths of dialogue come off as faked and her childhood memories seemed to have taken on a bit too much of the shine of nostalgia. Still, the book reads fast, like a peculiarly structured comic novel. The recipes are a nice touch and though I am skeptical about a few of them (the Risotto for example assumes you already know how to make it), I might try the cheese cake just because Reichl is correct in asserting that every cook should have it in their repetoire."},{"Title":"Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise","review":"Ruth Reichl is an excellent writer and the story is compelling. If you love to read about food and the top restaurants, this is a fantastic book."},{"Title":"Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise","review":"I received this book as a birthday present from my sister. She chose this book because I'm an avid food enthusiast (cook, baker, taster, shopper, reader of anything related with food). I must say that I love getting a peek into the glamorous (and not-so-glamorous) world of being a restaurant reviewer. I mean, really! That's every foodie's dream job! I love that Ruth Reichl is so candid and honest in this book about the ups and downs of life as a New York times restaurant critic. I also adore her keen observations of the people around her (such as her mother's old friend and her loveable son).I find it satisfying that she also includes the final article that is published along with her notes and observations for an overall perspective. Ruth Reichl has a very down-to-earth and approachable style of writing. I had fun reading about her adventures in search of the perfect Chinese restaurant for her boss and coming up with new ideas to disguise herself to give a fair review. Overall, I loved this book and I can't wait to read her other works!"},{"Title":"Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise","review":"This is a great book, giving insight into the world of a food critic.

Entertaining with laugh out loud sequences. If you appreciate gourmet food you will love this storytelling. The audio book is also excellent."},{"Title":"Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise","review":"I agree with others that the idea of her dressing up and going to a restaurant does get tedious, it needed a little something more. The side stories aren't very involved and don't add much. However, she is a food critic and she writes about the food in such a way that it keeps you captivated in the book. Reichl also places much value in her reviews on the way that people are treated, despite their age or looks, in a restaurant. We find that this is hard to come by in New York. I hope restaurants will learn a little bit about the importance of providing everyone with excellent service. She also includes several recipes in the book that aren't overly complicated, I just bought all the ingredients for a recipe in the book called Aushak that I'm super excited to try!"},{"Title":"Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise","review":"This was a very good book.

The author has obvious passion for the subject matter, although some of the language describing food is seriously hyperbolic. I just couldn't wait for it to finally end.At first, the storyline seemed like an intriguing insider's view of the author's process of dining at restaurants, in disguise and as herself, to write her restaurant reviews, but it quickly became tediously repetitious. Throughout the book, the author continuously presented a verbose description of her dining experiences at a particular restaurant, and then followed it up with a rewrite of the same scene(s) within her reviews. I enjoyed reading the account of her first dining experience and subsequent restaurant review, but found myself skimming the reviews after the second or third restaurant assignment.I felt the same way about the author's belabored creation of and performances in her disguises. The process seemed like an interesting challenge at first, but became monotonous (not to mention a little creepy and occasionally hurtful) with each new disguise.If it had not been a book club assignment, I would not have finished it."},{"Title":"Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise","review":"Brief Description: Ruth Reichl became the restaurant critic for the New York Times in 1993, and this book is an account of her tenure there. Combining her personal account of the job (including the elaborate disguises she created to avoid detection), reprints of some of her reviews, and several of her own recipes for the various dishes and foods discussed in the book, this memoir is a must-have for foodies as well as an interesting read for non-foodies (like myself).My Thoughts: The only reason I picked up this book was because I needed a \\"book with a gem in the title\\" for the What's In A Name Challenge. As a non-foodie (I confess that I skip almost all cooking and food-related blogging posts), I wasn't sure if this book was going to resonate with me. However, the chance to learn about the life of a restaurant critic helped me overcome any doubts. I'm glad I gave it a shot because it was an interesting and relatively painless read (yes ... I skimmed the recipe parts). It was fun to hear about how she came up with her various disguises to eat undetected in some of New York's finest restaurants, and how her \\"radical\\" approach to restaurant reviews often caused controversy. I thought she was down-to-earth and egalitarian in expecting restaurants to earn their stars by treating celebrities and \\"unknowns\\" the same, and it was a kick to hear about her two very different experiences at Le Cirque (once eating as herself and once eating disguised as an old woman). I loved that she wrote about her experiences and then shared the resulting reviews that she wrote; it made the book to come alive and helped me to understand her as a critic. And darn ... she even made a non-foodie like me want to try some of these dishes! I think the appeal of this book extends beyond the foodie crowd, and I'd recommend it if you're looking for a memoir with a different spin."},{"Title":"Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise","review":"Absolutely delightful!

I loved it and want more Ruth Reichl!In the book she only briefly refers to the meaning of its title, saying that it's a line from T. S. Eliot's Four Quartets: Burnt Norton. I found this interpration of that line in the poem on sparknotes.com:\\"Ruins also call to mind fragments, especially of the kind that make up Eliot's earlier poetry. The first line of the second section of \\"Burnt Norton\\"--\\"Garlic and sapphires in the mud\\"--highlights Eliot's new attitude toward the fragmentary nature of modern culture. This famous line juxtaposes a series of random things, but the effect is not the atmosphere of belatedness and melancholy characteristic of The Waste Land. Rather, the collage-like arrangements of this section form a nearly coherent whole, a meaningless song that sounds traditional but isn't. Again fragments and ruins stand in defiance of human aspirations, only this poem does not lament that things once made sense and have now ceased to do so; rather, it declares that coherence never existed at all--that meaning and human experience are necessarily mutually exclusive. \\"The book cover left me feeling deliciously frustrated since her face is obscured.

The missing fifth stars says more about me than the book. Five stars would require taking my breath away.The book appealed to both my passion for food and cooking (complete with descriptions of amazing meals and recipes) and the sociologist in me (Ruth Reichl descriptions of how she was treated in various disguises).

I gently licked it off with my tongue and sent a tingle charging down my spine.\\"Did that sentence make you uncomfortable? Because it sure as hell made me uncomfortable the first time I read it; especially given the fact that the author is not describing a sexual encounter with an unfortunately endowed man. No, that grotesquely erotic narrative is actually referencing Reichl's first bite into noodle dish served at a dumpy Korean restaurant in lower Manhattan. Creepy. Here's the thing; I am no prude. I love me the occasional steam in my reading rainbow but when a prix fix turns passionate, the walls of my comfort zone are breached and Sister Mary Sanctimonious takes over. Again...creepy.Now, all that aside, I was really looking forward to reading Garlic and Sapphires and I am really disappointed by how little I enjoyed it. What I thought would be a fun, food filled account of this woman's first year as the food critic for the NYT is in fact a compilation of short stories punctuated with recipes and excerpts of her actual reviews. It was very choppy and ultimately tiresome.Another point of irritation was the repetition. In those chapters that included a story + the review, I felt like I was reading the same thing twice. Reichl would tell the story about her experience at a restaurant and then post the article as it appeared in the paper. The only thing is, it was often the EXACT SAME narrative. That's just sloppy editing and a waste of paper.To be fair I did enjoy reading about the different types of food that's out there. If anything it was a great education and I admire people daring enough to try the more exotic fare (seafood chowder garnished with squid ink? Squid ink?? No. Absolutely not). However, the culinary creativity was just not enough to keep this book afloat and in the end I was happy when the meal was over."},{"Title":"Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise","review":"Ruth Reichl is passionate about both food and humankind. She puts herself in the shoes of different common folk, through clever disguises, to see how snooty service staff in highly rated restaurants react to these group of customers.Only if both food and service meet her standards in her various disguises, then she would feel that she had a celestial dining experience & the restaurant would deserve its highest rating in her New York Times reviews.She has raised the bar for fine dining and totally humanized it. Way to go, girl!!"},{"Title":"Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise","review":"Some of us are fascinated with behind-the-scenes looks. We want our DVDs packed with \\"making of\\" featurettes. We want to go backstage with the band. We want our favorite foods \\"unwrapped\\" (as in the Food TV series). Ruth Reichl's book is the perfect memoir those of us who (1) have the \\"behind the scenes\\" fascination and (2) love food.If you've ever wanted to know how food critics prepare for, think about, and write their reviews, this is the book for you. In it, Ms. Reichl traces her journey from the Los Angeles Times to the New York Times, shares how her husband had to talk her into the job, how the previous food critic Bryan Miller organized a smear campaign against her, how she disguised herself time and again to avoid being recognized by sharp-eyed restaurant staff.Like any good tour of New York City, we get to see an awful lot along the way. We see the petty editorial politics at the New York Times. We see the sometimes funny and often surprisingly bitter reactions readers have to reviews. We see the once fringe ethnic cuisines (e.g., Korean) go mainstream. We see all the New York Times writers cower in fear of Al Siegal, the notorious editor whose job it was to publicly ridicule writing not up to the notoriously high standards of the paper.Ms. Reichl weaves a rich tapestry of characters through her memoir, from her boy Nick to the wig seller who helps her perfect her disguises; from fellow food celebrities such as Ken Hom to Claudia Banks, the acting coach who helps her flesh out each of the identities she assumes. But it's Living section administrative Carol Shaw who steals the show as the most richly rendered, three dimensional character. You can't be help liking her.Ms. Reichl writes honestly and poignantly. She's as critical of herself as she is of the worst restaurants in New York City. In one memorable scene, her husband excuses himself early. Thinking that he left to get away from an obnoxious dinner guest, Ms. Reichl is startled to discover it was actually to get away from her:----\\"I couldn't say and watch what you were doing. I hate it when you pretend to be that person.\\"\\"What person?\\" she asks.\\"The Restaurant Critic of the New York Times. The Princess of New York. Ms.-I-know-I-am-right-about-food-and-don't-argue-with-me. Take your pick.\\"\\"What I that bad?\\" I whispered. My cheeks burned and I could feel the sweat prickling against my skin.\\"Worse,\\" he said. \\"You were the person you used to make fun of.\\"----All in all, this is a great, memorable read."},{"Title":"Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise","review":"Rarely do books make me laugh out loud in public when reading them, but this one did multiple times. Ruth Reichl does an excellent job of telling of her hilarious undercover adventures as a food critic for the NY Times. You don't have to have a lot of knowledge and experience of fine foods and restaurants to appreciate her viewpoints as she poses as an old woman, seductress, uptight woman, a complainer, and more. Reading about her characters' experiences is as enjoyable as being at the restaurants with her. As a New Yorker, I can say she hits the nail on the head as far as the culture and attitudes of different sorts of people who live, work and of course, eat in the city. A very enjoyable, quick read - and you'll never see restaurants the same way again."},{"Title":"Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise","review":"The third memoir Reichl has written continues with the common theme that not everything is as it seems at a glance. Here she tells of her years at the New York Times as their restaurant critic.(a position which many might envy) She spent so much time hiding behind many disguises and attempting to convince many that there wasn't more than meets the eye; everyone from the servers of the restaurants she was eating in to herself who faced a considerable onslaught of criticism from readers when she became their restaurant reviewer. The sweetest moments of the book have to do with Reichl and her son Nick who was quite small when she got the job and her own recollection significant moments with food and restaurants from her childhood. She had returned to where she had grown up and she was being re-introduced to old memories and even to her Mother who had past away. Another thing I really liked in the book was a few recipes that she had mentioned in passing from her other books were finally published in this one. This volume contains recipes and some of her restaurant reviews as well so it adds another element to the writing. You are given some subtext when she tells what was going on at the time and so there are many layers to the writing and hidden emotions.Reichl has yet to disappoint me with her memoirs but this book has a much happier tone in comparison to the last one. It isn't until the end that there is considerable sadness but it ends with hope and possibility."},{"Title":"Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise","review":"\\"Garlic and Sapphires\\" is the first book of Reichl's I've read. I knew going in that it is generally considered to be the weakest of her three books, but I was intrigued by the true story of an incognito food critic. I was somewhat disappointed, though I'm finding it hard to pinpoint exactly why. I think the main disappointment for me was Reichl's writing style. When writing about food, she does an excellent job conveying with words the experience she's having as she tastes a wide range of dishes. But when writing about other things--and most of this book was about these \\"other things\\"--her writing is simplistic, almost as though she'd written a children's novel. Additionally the stories in the book, through presumably biographical, seemed to be coated in an egg wash of retrospect and Hollywoodization--the people seem too much like stock characters from a romantic comedy. The wig store owner is a particularly egregious example of Reichl's overdescription. Reichl's descriptions of her assumed personalities are similarly weak--I don't fault her for relying on stereotypes for creating these personalities (for that's what I would do if I were in her shoes), but what I do fault her for is her willingness (weakness?) to be completely swept away by inhabiting the role. You're a food critic, Ruth, not an Oscar award-winning method actor, so please don't try to convince us that you couldn't find a happy medium between yourself and Emily or Brenda.Despite Reichl's writing and rom-com stylings, I did enjoy the book because Reichl comes off as a person I'd like to know, and she allows the reader a good degree of intimacy with her thoughts and feelings.As an aside, does every \\"good\\" restaurant in NYC serve foie gras with fruit and some variation of creme brulee??? I mean, come on, you four-star chefs--there's an endless variety of food out there! I wish Reichl, with her appreciation of ethnic cuisine, had smacked some sense into some of these hoity-toity restaurants while she was at the NY Times!"},{"Title":"Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise","review":"I was in Long Island visiting my mother-in-law, and ran out of things to read. This book was on her deck. I picked it up and was hooked by the second page. Being completely food illiterate, I thought that I wouldn't enjoy it. I read it in two days. I am now reading \\"Comfort Me With Apples: More Adventures at the Table\\" and can't put it down.Ruth writes with such honesty that you want to become her friend. Her figurative language is extraordinary, and makes me want to become a food warrior. I doubt this will happen, but I am living vicariously through her words.I love the recipes that are peppered throughout her books. Several, like lemon pasta, and the goat cheese on toast, are easy, elegant, and can allow a neophyte like myself seem like a great cook.Even if you aren't into food, Ruth's story is entertaining, and wrapped in prose that is remarkable."},{"Title":"Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise","review":"I loved this book. It just shows that these so-called fancy restaurants are mostly overrated. I found it fabulous that the food critic had the guts to go out and review the mom and pop places out there that often go unnoticed. The author also had a good writing style that kept my interest throughout the book. Plus, we are still using some of the recipes she included in the book."},{"Title":"Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise","review":"This is a warm, witty, and fun memoir from a real, warm female. She is so self-revealing that it can be shocking. I was delighted to find out Ruth Reichl has written two other books about her life that preceed this one in time. I've read one--Tender at the Bone--wonderful--and now I feel compelled to read the next one, and then Garlic and Sapphire all over again! I love all the loving talk about food, and the light but meaningful touch on relationships."},{"Title":"Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise","review":"I laughed out loud tons of times during this hilarious look into the undercover world of restaurant critics. Reichl shares the disguises and personas she employed as a critic, to see what the average person experiences when they go to a restaurant. It was outrageous and thrilling to watch her take on rude service and sub-par food (served to her when she is dressed in dowdy clothes) and then go back to the same restaurant as the star critic, getting bigger and better portions of food and getting seated ahead of waiting foreign royalty.I rooted for her different personas and was indignant at the treatment she got as a regular person at some of the snobbier restaurants. I loved the story about how at one restaurant, they recognized her and whisked away her half eaten raspberry tart and replaced it with a raspberry tart with, get this, bigger berries! Can you imagine someone in the back of the restaurant picking out VIP raspberries for the VIP tarts?I loved the food descriptions and the sometimes unglamorous look into the life of a critic. The food isn't everyday fare, but I don't read Ruth Reichl to hear about the types of meals I can afford - I could write about those myself!Her exposure of snobbery, and the care she takes to try and show the restaurants who care for us normal folks like we are all VIP's, was touching and made for satisfying reading.The abridgement on this audiobook did not feel truncated or like I missed out on anything important. She narrates the book herself, and while her husky, measured voice took some getting used to, I loved that she was able to give just the right inflection to each persona and to carefully emphasize her feelings and actions. The audiobook has some recipe cards included and has an interview with the author at the end.One of the rare audiobooks I am keeping in my permanent collection for years of relistening."},{"Title":"Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise","review":"A devout NYC metro-area foodie, I have read all of Reichl's books and love her writing style, which I find honest, touching, informative and insightful. Garlic and Sapphires was my favorite. To boot, it is a great diet book and it will save you lots of money if you [think you might] like eating in fancy restaurants. By this I mean, she paints such vivid pictures of food, including appearance, textures and tastes, that you actually feel like you're tasting her words, sans the calories. And if your friends have ever told you you were just being paranoid about being treated differently (i.e. much worse) than the rich and/or famous at most well-known restaurants, you will feel sadly vindicated. My only huge disappointment with Garlic and Sapphires was that it didn't include pictures of Ms. Reichl as Miriam, Chloe, Brenda, Betty and Emily. These larger than life characters who helped her slither undetected through the city's culinary palaces screamed out to be seen! But I loved that she allowed new personalities to accompany each disguise and that she shared her insights about what she learned from each one. Forgetting about the food for a moment, what woman wouldn't long for a job like this one that allows/requires you to transform yourself into a slinky blond, a sassy redhead or their own mother (gasp), on an expense account?! Throw in designer and/or vintage clothing and food and it's a career made in heaven. For me, anyway. If none of this appeals to you you may not enjoy Garlic and Saphhires, but I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise","review":"This book was very entertaining, and the mind pictures that she creates from her descriptions are wonderful.

For readers like me, who enjoy good writing about food almost as much as eating itself, Reichl's descriptions will be relished. All her books deserve a place on the shelf next to American icon food writer, M.F.K. Fisher.This book details her series of adventures in disguise, and how her different appearances affected the attitudes of restaurant staff people, and the varying level of service she received. Her accounts are both laugh-out-loud funny and thought-provokingly poignant.A woman of quick, far-ranging intelligence and subtle understanding, Reichl could be a successful writer in any field. Food lovers appreciate that she chose to write in their genre!"},{"Title":"Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise","review":"I thought the book was funny. It grabbed me from the first chapter and I laughed through the whole thing. This is a great read and I am up for reading any other books from this writer. Another great one is the glass castle and also Whispers of the wicked saitns. Great reads !!"},{"Title":"Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise","review":"The subject hooked me in immediately - a famous NY food critic working in disguise, so as to experience the same treatment restaurants give to lesser mortals. Her reviews of these places gave well-deserved rebukes, and reading her newspaper pieces shows why she's a respected critic. Her palate is obviously exquisitely sensitive, and her knowledge of the business must be tremendous.But it's only in the short format of a review that I can read her writing with any enjoyment. In a book, all her defects of style become very tedious (despite her acknowledgments citing all the help she's had from top-flight editors!). She writes in a breathless, overblown manner, with no sense of narrative proportion. She introduces new characters in lavish paragraphs of purple prose, and then they vanish entirely from the book. Incidents of no importance are written up in minute detail, and parts that would have been worth developing are skipped over.Her descriptions of people (including her own disguises) call on every cliche in the romantic novel genre, and her dialogue plods along clumsily, stating the obvious at every turn. After a chapter or two I had to suspend the willing belief one normally brings to an autobiography - really, are we to believe that her late mother's friend nearly fainted on seeing her put on her mother's dress, because the resemblance was so utterly convincing? Or that her own husband failed to recognise her as soon as she put on a wig and some stage make-up? Reichl tells us firmly and at length that it happened, and since her writing is otherwise completely without irony, I gather she intends us to take it as fact.Overall, I finished the book wishing I'd followed my impulse and dumped it after the first chapter. I kept waiting for it to turn into the promised hilarious and charming piece, but I waited in vain. I was left with the impression of a woman self-absorbed, arrogant and shallow, who notices little and cares less about other people except as they massage her ego or give her fuel for showing her contempt. There is no attempt at developing a theme or plot, and no insight into her own or anyone else's character. If extravagant, adjective-riddled descriptions of food appeal to you, there's plenty of that - but even then, my vicarious enjoyment of the meals was spoilt by the feeling that she's only saying this to impress us all with what an infallible and sensitive judge she is. Yes, Ruth, I guess you are. That's why they employed you. But a little more humility and humour would make for a better book."},{"Title":"Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise","review":"Thank you Ruth Reichl! I have been reading your work for years and I always feel right at home. But this book is special to me because you have liberated me. When I go into restaurants now I will ask for what I want, change the meal, send back the bad food, and be whoever I wish. I laugh now when I recall the many times I have cringed at the bad seating, horrible meal, and indifferent service and meekly accepted it. No more! I have been set free. I realize now - I am paying for this experience. The restaurants need us - people who pay - to keep going. Let's make them earn it. Lead on."},{"Title":"Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise","review":"The book was/is in excellent condition. I loved the character Ruth became as her costume changed.

I'm trying my best not to buy any new books unless I need to (for book club). I already own quite a few books that I need to get through. Once my stockpile is lower then I can justify buying some new ones.Garlic and Sapphires is written by a former New York Times restaurant critic, and is a tale of her dining adventures in disguise. Her goal is to have a totally normal dining experience, because when she's recognized the chefs seem to pull out all the stops, and the service all of a sudden becomes amazing. She wants to be able to provide a review on the restaurant that anyone off the street would be able to experience, not rave about a restaurant then have a normal person go in and wonder why in the heck she thought it was so great. In an attempt to dine anonymously Ruth creates a number of disguises, each with their own persona, style and name. She does successfully go unrecognized, but over the years she becomes a little hardened and realizes it's time for a change (she eventually becomes the editor for Gourmet magazine). She began as a cook, and includes a lot of yummy sounding recipes in the book as well - a few I definitely plan to try. Reading about her dining experiences was fun. But there isn't really a plot per se, so it's not exactly a page turner.

To Ruth's utter shock, she learns that important restaurants in the city have virtually compiled a dossier on her, complete with photographs and background information. In that stomach-dropping moment, Ruth realizes that the job she hasn't even started yet is in jeopardy. Just as suddenly, she decides that she can outfox the foxes. Her mother's old friend is an acting coach who teaches Ruth the ropes in disguising herself so completely that even her personality undergoes change with each new \\"character.\\"Unlike her predecessor, Ruth aimed to review restaurants on how they catered to the average patron, not a powerful critic. As you might guess, there is a big difference. For me, hearing about those differences were the most entertaining portions of this book. Although Ruth's descriptions of delectable dishes were colorful enough that they practically leapt onto my taste buds, many ingredients and techniques are so foreign to my far-from-Manhattan experiences that I couldn't savor them the way a food aficionado would. (But they did underscore what I'm missing from chain restaurants.)Toward the end, as Ruth grows disenchanted with her job, the memoir wanders from the restaurant to the specialty food shop. Here, it adopts an almost \\"I heart New York\\" theme that bored me. Clearly, my enjoyment of her book corresponds to the periods when Ruth most enjoyed her job. Luckily for us readers and listeners, those periods comprise the bulk of this engaging book."},{"Title":"Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise","review":"I thought it was pretty good....not the finest piece of literature I've ever read, but it was good...and sort of an inside look at the world of restaurants and their proprietors and the class of people who go to the very best and finest restaurants and how they are treated as compared to how a frumpily clad person would get treated. I'd say if you are in-between books and need something 'lighter' to read..or in need of a fast read....this would be perfect. Some good recipes, too!"},{"Title":"Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise","review":"If you liked Ruth Reichl's other books, you will definitely like this one.

Needless to say, I eagerly await her next release."},{"Title":"Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise","review":"Not only do I love Ruth Reichl's writing, but the emphasis in this book is psychologically fascinating. It's a must read for fans of food, dysfunctional family dynamics, actors, and the socially curious among us."},{"Title":"Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise","review":"I loved everything about this book and I wish Ruth was a personal friend. The concept-- the meals, the disguises, the reviews following the visits and then the personal touch of the recipes included....what a fabulous gift. Ruth seems like a person who truly appreciates her good fortune in life, and she is a very clever and talented lady. It was a privilege to spend time with her."},{"Title":"Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise","review":"I'm a pretty die-hard \\"foodie\\" and I love to read books about food and travel (see some of my other reviews). This book was recommended to me by a friend, and I have to say I was skeptical at first because of the lack of \\"adventure\\" I assumed it would have. (How \\"adventurous was a book by the editor at the NY Times likely to be, after all...). And, I was right - if you compare this book to something by Anthony Bourdain or Bill Buford it does lack \\"adventure\\". But what it does have (and what I really enjoyed) was wonderfully-written observations on human nature; how we respond to one another based on our perceptions. There were sections that made me laugh out loud because of the ridiculous scenarios Ms. Reichl found herself in at times, and other sections that were heartwarming and familial. The book is really more of a memoir, and unlike most memoirs, I enjoyed it immensely.Yes, there are wonderful descriptions of food, and of the meals Ms. Reichl was fortunate enough to enjoy during her tenure at the NYT. She reveals a very interesting and new insight into not only the life of a food critic (and the inevitable \\"food politics\\" involved) but also the day-to-day workings of the \\"front of house\\" in many of New York's most famous restaurants.Bottom line, I don't think you have to be a foodie to enjoy this book. Ms. Reichl has a smooth and engaging style, and a perceptive ability to capture many nuances of human interaction that are missed by most other authors in this subject area. A great book for a long train, plane, or boat ride, or a weekend getaway."},{"Title":"Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise","review":"If you love to read about or cook gourmet food this book is for you!

She is sensuous, loving, knowing... Add to that powerful sensation her honest desire to educate and entertain her readers, she becomes a tour de force. Ruth is gifted with the wisdom of knowing the common denominator that binds us all together - food, food, fabulous food, and has a unique ability to take us to a higher level of enjoyment through her lush and sumptuous voice.

This is the Ruth Reichl we know and love as the editor of \\"Gourmet\\" magazine. She has written two books about her life as woman and chef. This third book is about her life as the Restaurant Critic for The New York Times. This is a great book, humorous, down- right laughing out loud funny, serious, and sensitive. And a story about Ruth and her life and family in the city she was born in and loves, New York City.Ruth was the restaurant critic at the Los Angeles Times and was very happy. Or, she thought she was. She had reviewed every great restaurant and received the laurels she deserved for her expertise. Unexpectedly, she received a phone call asking her if she would be interested in talking with the editor at the New York Times about a job. She agreed to come and talk, and the next thing she knew she was being interviewed by everyone and anyone that had any holding at the NYT. She was off putting, not sure she wanted the job, and, of course, they wanted her and, of course, she wanted the job.New York is a strange city. The chefs and owners of the grand restaurants placed her picture in their kitchens so that if she came to them, she would be recognized. So, Ruth had to take matters into her own hands. She started to wear disguises while eating at the restaurant she was reviewing, and she fooled them, fooled them all. She became Emily, her mother, a witchy bitch and a gorgeous blonde. She would visit a restaurant at least 3-5 times before writing a review. Her reviews were masterpieces. She can make or break a restaurant. She discovered that if the restaurants knew she was there, she was treated like a queen, while the everyday couple next to her, recieved a different meal than she did. After all, Ruth was there to review for the masses not the well known New Yorker. Ruth was able to complete her job with her disguises and such funny experiences she had. Her trips to the wig shop and the second hand clothing shops are hilarious. Her son, wanted to know about every disguise, and her readers were enthralled with her reviews. Ruth visited every neighborhood in New York, She met the great and the man next door. She was happy to just be around the thing she loves the most, next to her family, food. Ruth developed strange alliances and wonderful friends. This is more like a chat with your best friend, thant a novel. Ruth gives us her amazing recipes. I must try them all. There does not appear to be one better than the other.After five years, Ruth became tired of the critic's life and was looking for something new. What, she was not sure. However, a phone call came at the right time. One of the best books I have read in a long time- Admirably and heartily recommended. prisrob"},{"Title":"Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise","review":"Ruth Reichl's \\"Garlic and Sapphires,\\" takes readers behind the scenes of the five star restaurant scene in New York, where she was the food critic for the New York Times.

Visiting restaurants 3, 4, and 5 times, the disguises, the passion - who knew so much effort went into writing a single review. Most interesting was her depiction of how individuals are treated at high power restaurants... star treatment for those who matter, pot luck for the average person off the street. The book is incredibly entertaining, well written, and hooks you from the start on Reichl's plane ride from LA to New York. It also exposes you to a life of a critic outside of the restaurant. While eating at the best restaurants for a living many seem glamourous on the surface, Reichl provides perspective by exposing the reader to the sacrafices her family must make to accomodate her job, and to the various characters she must deal with from time to time. Her depiction of the \\"food warrior\\" was particularly funny. I was not able to put it down and finished it in one day. Great book!"},{"Title":"Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise","review":"I read her two previous books and found them to be a tad dull. What I was really looking for is what is in this book: her experiences reviewing restaurants for the New York Times. I didn't find the parts about her trying on different personas to disguise her identity to be objectionable at all. It didn't seem to me that it took up all that much space in the book, and it was interesting.The only criticism that I can make of the book is that I would have liked it to have been longer, with more stories. Having been to some of the restaurants, and having read her reviews for years, I really enjoyed the stories behind the reviews. I was glad to have a couple of the recipes, but could have done without them. The part about her coworker's illness seemed a little out of place in the book, as it didn't seem to be a terribly serious book otherwise, but perhaps it is just that I dislike running into sad stories when I am seeking to be entertained."},{"Title":"Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise","review":"For fans of Ms. Reichl's first two books (as well as fans of M.F.K. Fisher, A.J. Liebling, etc.) this book may well be worth reading. Yet, one longs already for the \\"revised\\" version where the names and descriptive characteristics are not changed and we are able to experience not only her lovely writing style but also more of the 'real' story. The book is charming throughout; it is just that the apology at the end (rather than at the beginning) for 'exaggerating the details' leaves a bitter aftertaste."},{"Title":"Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise","review":"Reichl has done it again. I was happy to find her latest memoir just as wonderful as her other two. I just love Reichl's writing. She is funny, down to earth, a mom. She seems like a regular person - not a snooty gourmet who talks above your head. I love the stories of her escapades in disguise and how she came up with the characters and how she completely inhabited them. But as much, if not more, I enjoyed her descriptions of her meals and how they affected her. Her love and understanding of good food is absolutely fascinating to me. I can't wait to read her next one about being editor of Gourmet Magazine."},{"Title":"Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise","review":"This book was great! I really liked the fact that the author would go out to restaurants in full disguise. What an interesting experiment to see how people are treated based on their status, how they're dressed, how they speak, etc. The descriptions of the food and tastes were so clear that I felt like I was actually eating and tasting the food! I also liked the fact that the author included recipes in the book.Read this! You'll love it!"},{"Title":"Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise","review":"If you've already read and enjoyed her first two books, then this is going to be again a pleasure for you. The book covers the period of her tenure as food critic at the New York Times. She recounts the trips (with her in disguise) to various restaurants with friends immediately followed by the actual NYT article that she wrote of those experiences. Interspersed in the book are various recipes similar to dishes that she had tried in those restaurants. What strikes me immediately from page one is her wonderful prose. She is continuously surprised and delighted by new culinary experiences and her prose beautifully captures the almost indescribable sensations of tasting new and wonderful dishes. I love the pineapple juice part. Like her first two books, this is not only on food but on life and on people. It's not a grand critic giving judgements from on high - it's the pleasure in dining (and eating) and culinary ingenuity shared by Reichl and her fellow diners. Now what I really want is a compedium of her food articles."},{"Title":"Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise","review":"As much as I enjoy cooking and restaurant reviewing, I'm not big into reading about food. However, a friend passed on this book and it grabbed me from the beginning. I enjoyed Reichl's experiences getting into character and seeing how the world (and high end restaurants) reacted to her in her different physical personas. Indeed, someone could write a great book just about this topic. I also very much enjoyed reading her reviews. I hadn't before and I loved how she weaved story and food report at the same time, in a way I hadn't thought was possible. I rushed through the book and enjoyed it thoroughly.I was indeed about to write a review of the book on my own site when I googled it, in search of a picture of the cover. One of the first links I found wsa the book's review in the NYT. It was a mostly favorable review but it pointed out an Afterword I hadn't noticed, one in which she admits she has tampered with the facts, exaggerating, conflating meals and events. Apparently she has also made up people. That I find dishonest and, not knowing what was true and what was not, I'm left with a bitter taste in the mouth. I'm not eager to visit her other books."},{"Title":"Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise","review":"Oh to go undercover with Ruth to various restaurants in New York City in the 90s wearing wigs and costumes, what a perfect delight! It is quite obvious how profound an impact she had on the food revolution, daring to give legitimacy to Asian noodle restaurants when no one else would dare. This book is so entertaining to read, I loved every second of shadowing her on her food adventures. I will be attempting to make her recipe for Sort-of Thai Noodles very soon. For a foodie, this book is fantastic escapism to one of the food capitals of the world. To see the life of the most powerful woman in that industry in action? Pure bliss."},{"Title":"Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise","review":"Ruth describes getting her new job at the New York Times, the odd characters she works with and picking restaurants. I do like the fact that she would go to a restaurant at least three times before rating it, usually once as herself and other times in disguise. I did not enjoy the descriptions of the disguises, they seemed to go on and on. I more enjoed the descriptions of the staff at the restaurants and how she was treated. I liked the way she picked the places, one time she followed someone into a sushi place. I enjoyed her relationship with \\"Carol\\" but kept wondering where he little boy was during all the times she was eating and spending time with Carol.Overall, not bad. Definately not one you couldn't put down."},{"Title":"Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise","review":"If you love food, you will love Garlic and Sapphires. Ruth Reichl, newly hired by the New York Times as restaurant critic and already well-known as the Los Angeles Times critic, determines that she needs to disguise herself to get non-critic meals and service. Masquerading as various characters, she learns quite a bit about society at large, as well as herself. Further, Reichl describes her meals so vividly, describing flavors, aroma, texture, and oh my, the reader can feel like they are eating with her. Fairly quick read too. Highly entertaining and enlightening."},{"Title":"Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise","review":"Ruth Reichl's Garlic and Sapphires, an account of her years as restaurant critic of the New York Times, is simultaneously hilarious, refresing and poignant, altogether a five-star read in the light memoir category.The hilarity comes from Reichl's penchant for donning elaborate disguises, the better to assure anonymity in assessing New York's most prominent eateries. These incognita excursions allow Reichl to skewer the pretensions and omissions of such well-known restaurants as Le Cirque and Tavern on the Green.Garlic and Sapphires sets a refreshing tone due to Reichl's insistence on recognizing excellent dining in all of its venues, from humble ethnic restaurants to New York's most elegant establishments. Reichl's penchant for ferreting out little-known gems earns her the opprobrium of Bryan Miller, her predecessor as the Times's restaurant critic, and his supporters, all of whom charge Reichl with \\"letting down standards\\". But the many New Yorkers who experience life without expense account or trust fund appreciate her excursions to the wrong side of the tracks to identify dining delights.Most important, Garlic and Sapphires provides a poignant look at what it is like to be too old, too unfashionable, or too poor to fully take part in the glories of the Big Apple. Reichl's disguises frequently place her in one or more these overlooked groups, and she provides a sensitive picture of what it is like to be marginalized-- not only by headwaiters at four-star dining establishments, but by society. One hopes that Reichl's tenure as Times restaurant critic made top restaurants more likely to treat all of their patrons with dignity and respect.Garlic and Sapphires led me to develop the following advice for restaurant patrons:--As Reichl notes, restaurant preferences are subjective. Go to the places you enjoy, rather than the places fashion dictates.--Restaurants are there to serve you. If you are unhappy about food or service, speak up-- preferably to a manager, if your waiter or waitress hasn't dealt with the problem. Above all, don't be intimidated. If you need instruction on what fork to use or what wine to order, you should be able to ask without embarrassment.--You are especially entitled to fine service and cooking in a top restaurant-- don't let the establishment off the hook. If you have arrived on time for your reservation (or called ahead to notify the restaurant if you are delayed) and behaved courteously, any lapses in food or service reflect a deficiency in the restaurant, not a deficiency in you.--At least in the U.S., tips are discretionary. If you're not happy, reduce the tip accordingly. Feel free to advise your friends of the restaurant's shortcomings. And fortunately, you're not a critic who must return to give the establishment a fair chance. If you're not happy, you need never darken its doorstep again.One final piece of advice-- if you enjoy books about the food world, read Garlic and Sapphires."},{"Title":"Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise","review":"This is my first Ruth Reichl book, so I really didn't know what to expect, but was intrigued by the title. I just bought this today and am almost done. It feels like the best kind of book, a novel that just grabs hold and pulls you right into another world. I'm right there, as she dons her disguises, dresses up as her mother, right down to the attitude, as she sends dishes back, or gives herself up to the sheer pleasure of the food without over-analyzing it. What comes across more than anything, is the pure passion for the food and her job,and the sincerity and respect for the reader as she sets out to share her experience and to rate each restaurant.She also has a way with description. I can almost taste these dishes, and am now starving...If you like food, and the restaurant world, you will have an absolute ball with this book."},{"Title":"Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise","review":"It's one thing to hold the coveted job of restaurant critic for the New York Times but it's an entirely different matter when that person can deliver such a wonderfully breezy book about her experiences. Ruth Reichl has done just that in a style that is as warm, informative and delicious as the best restaurants she has reviewed.In \\"Garlic and Sapphires\\" the author invites you into her world so intimately that you feel you are sharing each and every meal with her. It would probably have been enough if Ruth had simply given us a compilation of her entire collected reviews because she writes so well in that vein, but the joy of this particular offering includes a cast of characters who are not from central casting. While she manages to keep herself in the limelight, as she should, she surrounds herself with willing (and sometimes unwilling) cohorts in her attempts to review restaurants through her many disguises and personalities. Her usually understanding husband, Michael, her precocious son Nicky, her friend and sometimes mentor Carol, and her close buddy Claudia all add to her support as the author becomes Miriam, Chloe, Brenda, Betty and Emily. A male critic could never have gotten away with what Ruth pulls off! It is a surprise to both the author and the reader that her dinner guests often become angry with her because she plays the roles of her assumed identities with such panache that they almost beg her to return to her own self.In one of the most alluring chapters, Ruth relates how she meets a total stranger, Dan Green, who ends up dining with her at Lespinasse. Keeping her secret, she spends an evening with him wondering what he will think of the review when he reads it. In another hilarious chapter she endures an evening with the \\"food warrior\\" at Windows of the World. Who wouldn't have wanted to be at the next table for that encounter?Through it all, Ruth Reichl keeps an eye on herself. She is her own best and worst critic, often worrying about thelegitimacy of her characters. In the end she simply reverts back to Ruth. As the book nears its close, Ruth speaks of her friend Carol's final illness and her own (ultimate) decision to leave the Times, a poignant reflection by the author. At this moment, knowing the book is about to be finished, I am reminded of that other moment when you've just finished an extraordinary meal and reluctantly acknowledge it's time to go. I highly recommend \\"Garlic and Sapphires\\"."},{"Title":"Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise","review":"After reading Tender at the Bone, I was looking forward to more of Ruth Reichl. Garlic and Sapphires was not only a disappointment, it was as if a completely different person had written it. It is ironic that in a book about disguises, Reichl herself was unrecognizable. Far from the funny, sensitive, and sincere person she was in her first book, Reichl had transformed herself into a self-absorbed snob loaded with enough hypocrisy to sink a ship.This book covers Reichl's stint as the New York Times chief restaurant critic. Although she accepts the position, she has reservations about the elitist implications of the job, and vows to write for the masses--those million readers who can't afford to spend $100 for a meal at a four-star French restaurant. Part of her mission is to expose the poor treatment many of these restaurants heap on the \\"common man.\\" But in order to accomplish this lofty goal, Reichl must eat in disguise. For if she is recognized as New York's premier restaurant critic, she'll be treated like royalty. (Although this obviously has no bearing on the quality of the food, it has a great deal of bearing on the quality of the experience. Personally, I eat for the food.)The idea is cute, and for the first few chapters it was fun. But Reichl shows her true colors right from the start when she heaps disdain on a bearded ignoramus (wearing Birkenstocks...unforgivable!) for having the audacity to dip his sushi rice-side down, thereby \\"ruining\\" the \\"clear transparent flavor,\\" the \\"taut crispness,\\" and the clam that was \\"almost baroque in its sensuality.\\" (I have yet to meet a sensual or almost baroque clam, but I'll take Reichl's word for it.) Reichl then reminisces about her trip to Japan, in which she is first exposed to the proper way to eat Japanese food. (I'm pretty sure the guy in Birkenstocks could not afford to go to Japan for eating lessons.) In her other encounters with diners at top-notch restaurants Reichl indulges in so much blatant one-up-manship that you simply can't sympathize with her concern for the \\"simple folk\\" no matter how much she tries to dress like them. The verbal food fights with the poor guy she picks up in a bar as the vampish Chloe (what's up with THAT??), and with the self-avowed \\"food warrior\\" were downright churlish. After proclaiming that there is no right way to eat food, Reichl clearly demonstrates that it's her way or the highway. Even Reichl's portrayals of other diners, who are merely innocent bystanders, are dreadfully stereotyped, sometimes to the point of cruelty. (She assumes that a \\"loud, brassy blonde,\\" who is disturbing her expensive meal, is a prostitute. Apparently, sitting next to the \\"masses\\" isn't nearly as much fun as pretending to write for them.)Even Reichl's disguises lacked credibility. Reichl's claims that she had an instant personality transformation with each new disguise are simply unbelievable. She BECOMES the 'little people,' taking on their imagined attributes, their voices, their very lives. She comes up with histories for each of the women she invents, and, with just a wig and some makeup, is so amazingly convincing that she can even fool her husband! Either Reichl is schizophrenic, or she takes method acting entirely too seriously. She certainly takes herself too seriously.If the book had been well written I could have forgiven the snobbery, but, with the exception of one chapter, \\"The Missionary of the Delicious,\\" in which Reichl was somehow able to get a grip on herself, purple prose abounded. (As her editor I would have crossed out half of her adjectives.) The inclusion of reprints of her published reviews was redundant, and the recipes were mediocre. (There was no clue in these recipes that Reichl was an expert in the kitchen. But, hey, she was writing for the \\"huddled masses yearning to eat free.\\" What do we know? We can't even dip sushi right.)If Reichl hadn't been so intent on wallowing in her ego, this book might have had possibilities. She loves food, and she has dined in some truly fabulous restaurants. The fact that most of us can't afford them is irrelevant. She had a duty to go to these marvelous places, enjoy herself to the max, and then take the rest of us with her."},{"Title":"Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise","review":"\`Garlic and Sapphires' is the third volume of memoirs by Ruth Reichl. After \`Tender at the Bone' which deals with her childhood and teens and \`Comfort Me with Apples' which deals with her early journalistic career in San Francisco, this latest volume deals with her five years as the lead restaurant critic for the New York Times.This volume proves that Ms. Reichl is truly the best culinary memoirist today, and easily the best since M.F.K. Fisher. And, as one who has read more than a few of Ms. Fisher's memoirs, I would easily choose Ms. Reichl's humor and great stories of the modern scene over Ms. Fisher's slightly musty, albeit exquisitely crafted tales of cities and towns in France.The primary point of this volume is to tell the stories behind Ms. Reichl's various disguises and personas she took on in order to dine at Daniel's and Lespanisse and Le Cirque without being identified as the restaurant critic for the Times. The book starts off with the amazing story of Reichl's flight from Los Angles to New York seated, by coincidence, along side a waitress of a major Manhattan restaurant. It turns out that posted in all restaurant kitchens in New York City was already a photograph of Ruth Reichl with a reward to any staff member who identifies Ms. Reichl in their restaurant.In spite of all the other things on which Ruth could dwell, she stays remarkably on message. There is only the slightest of references to the great New York Times culinary writer, Craig Claiborne, who was still alive while Reichl was at the Times. And, there was only a slightly more specific reference to R. W. Appel and Amanda Hesser. The only two writing talents cited to any extent are Marion Burros, a friendly colleague who mostly worked out of the Washington bureau and adversary Bryan Miller who left the critic's post and objected to Reichl's overturning a lot of his restaurant opinions. What Miller forgot was that the power of the restaurant critic's column was not based on the writer, but on the newspaper which published the column.The most important character in this story after Reichl may be \`THE NEW YORK TIMES', commonly thought to be the best and most powerful newspaper in the world. This fact makes it almost unthinkable that Reichl would question whether or not she really wanted to work for the Times when she was literally offered the job on a silver platter. There may have been some foundation to her doubts when she saw the Times offices for the first time. In contrast to the light, airy, Los Angles Times offices, the New York offices were crowded and filled with lots of old desks and unmatched chairs. After a full day's interviews plus total willingness from her husband to relocate to New York, Reichl took the job and immediately changed the tone of the paper's reviews.Reichl's personal philosophy was that reviews were nothing more than informed opinion and taste. This may seem utterly subjective, but actually, it is not far from what you would see in a scholarly work on the nature of aesthetic judgment. One is much better off trusting the opinion of a literary critic who has read 10,000 novels, both good and bad, than of your dentist who may have read 10, all from the same author. The thing that endeared her to her Times editors and publishers was the idea that her columns were written to sell newspapers, not to promote restaurants.For someone who does not read reviews of major Manhattan restaurants, I was a bit surprised at the incredible difference between the quality of food and service given to a pair of \`beautiful people' versus the quality of food and service given to a drab looking old woman. And, if the diner is known to be the critic from the Times, food and service quality goes off the charts. This was the reason for the many disguises. And, it is obvious that more than one was needed, as it was all too easy for an astute restaurateur to connect a person with the byline on a review which can change their gross by tens of thousands of dollars a week. The truly remarkable thing about many of the disguises is how the personality embodied by the wig and clothes became part of Reichl's persona in dealing with people who were not in on the ruse. By far the funniest was the incident when Reichl took on her mother's persona, using her mother's clothes and jewelry. The story is doubly amusing if you have read \`Tender at the Bone' where Reichl describes her primary chore was to keep her mother from poisoning any guests by serving spoiled food.It should be no surprise that Reichl's job had a serious downside. In addition to all the nasty mail from offended restaurateurs and their advocates and the political backbiting at the newspaper, there were the really unpleasant situations where Reichl offered \`a dinner with the New York Times restaurant critic' as a prize to be auctioned off for charity. Ruth recounts one especially distasteful episode where the situation went so far as to turn her well-trained chameleon personality into someone who was distasteful to her husband. This job is no picnic. From this encounter comes the name of the book from a line in T. S. Eliot's \`Four Quartets', \`garlic and pearls in the mud' which echoed the fact that the evening had nothing to do with Reichl's love of cooks, food, or writing.The book includes the Times reviews Reichl wrote as a result of the meals described in the book. These are fun and interesting, but are really just sidebars to the real action in the main text. My only regret is that Reichl did not find it useful to include photographs of her disguises.Very highly recommended reading for foodies and non-foodies alike."},{"Title":"Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise","review":"In contrast to the cover's stated premise, the heart of Ruth Reichl's newest book, \\"Garlic and Sapphires\\", turns out to be not so much about her covert efforts to produce a fair restaurant review. And that's a good thing...Instead, what she's produced is somewhat of a narrative on the transformations that occurred in her life while she the was chief restaurant critic of The New York Times. Don't get me wrong, there are a number of very funny stories and insightful looks into the life of a restaurant critic, but after reading over a few of them, I'm glad that she didn't devote the book to just this theme.To me, it got tiring after a while to read about her efforts to obtain the perfect wig or coat or look to enable her to step into another life beyond her own. Interspersed between the logistical procedures to obtain these covert reviews are lovingly told desciptions of the diverse foods of New York, served by ultra-uppity 3 star French joints to the painstakingly precise sushi bar.Also very worthy of mention are Reichl's recollections of time spent at the NY Times, as to the people she met, hated, feared, and loved. The latter primarily focused on a woman named (at least in the book) Carol, to whom Ruth pays particular attention, and conveys sincere emotion as regards their friendship.In surprising depth, Reichl conveys how, through her secret identities, she was able to learn about herself and her motivations / intentions when reviewing restaurants. Was it just about the food itself or about the \\"lifestyle\\" that comes with loving food?As such, ultimately, the thrust of the book is very much about food -- how it can in itself be excellent, mediocre, wonderous, or deflating and how the treatment of the waitstaff or the quality of one's companions can dictate the tenor of the dining experience.An oftentimes hilarious, and surprisingly sincere book. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise","review":"Other reviewers have given you the basic premise of Ruth Reichel's memoir about her years as a New York Times restaurant reviewer. I certainly agree with the opinions that this is a very funny, readable and personal story. Many of us -- at least many of us food enthusiasts -- wonder what it would be like to dine out nearly every evening, to constantly judge the merits of a restaurant (how do you keep notes?), to stay anonymous. Heck, I've always wondered how one gets a credit card with a Not-You name on it, a question that Reichl answers in the first few chapters.Those questions alone -- and Reichl's great prose -- make the book entertaining right there. In fact, I snuck out of work early and read the book straight through in a single day. (Shh, don't tell anyone.)However, Garlic and Sapphires exceeds simple enjoyment. Reichl is occasionally philosophical about what she is doing, by donning wigs and dressing up as other people -- ostensibly in her efforts to be anonymous. She became an actor, really, not Ruth-in-a-wig. Without beating you (or herself) over the head with it, Reichl examines how much of our self-image is wrapped up in our physical presentation.For example, at one point, Shirley -- the woman who sells the wigs -- comments about her customers, most of whom are women with cancer undergoing chemotherapy. \\"Shirley was beaming. 'I wish,' she said fervently, 'that you were here to talk to all my customers. These poor women come in wth no hair on their heads, and they have such a great opportunity to remake themselves. It's their chance to try on new personalities. But what do they want? To look as much like their old selves as possible.'\\" Reichl's friend Carol counters with the opposing view. In only a few paragraphs, you've seen all sides of an \\"identity\\" issue -- in the middle of an anecdote about choosing a carrot red wig.And the food. Did I mention the food? I learned more about fois gras than I ever knew.This book manages to be funny, thoughtful, and educational all at once, and you can read it over a weekend. Thoroughly enjoyable: I recommend it."},{"Title":"Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise","review":"Author Ruth Reichl has written a very funny and poignant book on her life as a restaurant critic in New York. The book starts at the restaurant \\"Le Cirque\\" then proceeds on to her adventures at restaurants such as Honmura An, Lespinasse, Sparks (for meat and potatoes), to her experiences in Flushing, New York in which she is scouting out for Chineese food and ends up at the KB Garden Restaurant.In the book Ruth Reichl disguises herself with wigs and various clothing for the roles she plays when reviewing the restaurants. We meet \\"Chloe\\", \\"Miriam\\",\\"Brenda\\" and last but not least (my favorite) \\"Betty\\" in which she puts on a gray wig and goes to Tavern on the Green\\" in Central Park New York.To my greatest surprise, when reading the book, is to find out that Sea Bass is actually known as Patagonian Toothfish!!As Ruth Reichl says in her book \\"the fish didn't sell very well under it's own name. So they changed it.\\"Brava Ruth Reichl for a great read. I enjoyed every minute of this book - I couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise","review":"Reichl's book, like her famous double review of Le Cirque, raises the probing question of whether the \\"best\\" restaurants truly have earned their titles by treating all of their customers as four stars restaurant should, or whether, instead, the four star treatment is reserved for \\"special\\" patrons. With that question she delves into issues related to food, class, and economics from her unique and powerful perspective as the NY Times restaurant reviewer. The reader cheers her reviews of Le Cirque, Tavern on the Green and The Box Tree, in which she took powerful restaurants to task for their failure to treat ALL patrons (rather than just the most well-known or privileged) with the respect and graciousness for which they have paid. My husband and I now have the luxury of being able to eat at such restaurants from time-to-time (though certainly not regularly), and we usually happily get what we paid for. But we *have* had occasional negative experiences like Reichl describes, and have seen others have them as well. As Reichl recognizes, many people \\"save up\\" to eat at these establishments, or visit them for very \\"special occasions,\\" only to be treated poorly. Restaurants who do not give the \\"four star treatment\\" to *every* guest (rather than the select few) are NOT, by definition, \\"four star\\" and do not deserve to be treated as though they are.Taking this point one step further, Reichl also uses her reviews to make New Yorkers understand that truly good cuisine need not be expensive, and need not be French. Her positive reviews of ethnic cuisine are educational and delightful. In short, Reichl might be seen as the democratizer of the NY Times restaurant reviews.However, at various points in the narrative Reichl seems to suffer from snobbery of her own (which she largely fails to recognize). Her behavior at dinner with the man who paid for a meal with her at a charity auction-- showing up his food knowledge, expressing extreme frustration that he wanted to eat at a nice restaurant-- and her nasty comments about the young couple next to her at another restaurant, for example, exhibited a sense of superiority that seems to run beneath the surface of her narrative. She acknowledges her poor behavior on these occasions through the words of her friends or her husband, but it would have been nice to see a bit more recognition of her limitations in her own words or discussion about her growth from these experiences.In addition, the deep \\"transformations\\" that Reichl claims overtook her when she was in disguise seem contrived. While I understand the need for the disguises, I (again) do not understand her need to \\"become\\" these characters and while \\"in character\\" treat others poorly, such as by leaving a cab driver no tip or making rude comments about others.While I found the book enjoyable, Reichl generally likeable, and the restaurant reviews fascinating, Reichl offended me by including her negative views on, and review of, Windows on the World. Writing in 2005, Reichl unquestionably knows that Windows on the World perished in the terrorist attacks of 9/11/2001, together with approximately 80 members of its dedicated staff who were on duty that morning, including its executive pastry chef and countless workers who undoubtedly took pride in their work at what was a pillar of New York. They are the images we see in news coverage waving towels out the windows of the top floor, begging for rescue. We have seen some of their family members speak on television about the delight some of them took from working at such a renowned establishment. Her inclusion of Windows seemed totally unnecessary except to tell her story about dinner with the \\"obnoxious\\" charity guest she could not stand. Did she really need to kick these people, or the memories of these people, while they were down? How hard would it have been to edit out?The book is very entertaining, and I applaud Reichl for democratizing the Times' restaurant reviews. I just wish she had been a little more thoughtful about what details she chose to include, and how she chose to frame them."},{"Title":"Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise","review":"No one will argue with Ruth Reichl's ability to discuss food as well or better than any foodie of our generation, and her New York Times reviews were generally very interesting, sometimes maddening but seldom boring. Her newest book of remembrance, this one focusing on her days and nights as the most powerful restaurant critic in America (more due to her position at the Times than to her own persona, as she often points out), certainly has its moments, and her recounting of the responses of her young son and her late colleague, Carol Shaw, to her many disguises and opinions is often affecting and entertaining. But this, her third book of foodie memoirs, does not hold the way her two earlier ones did; she seems a bit too full of herself too much of the time, and her constant stories of restaurant visits are often followed by the complete Times review, where everything she has just told us is repeated nearly verbatim. I also didn't need the blow-by-blow of each new disguise; it seemed padding to make the book long enough. This turns a rather slim volume (also featuring some fine recipes) into a much longer journey than it needs to be. And too often the recountings of events just don't ring true. While this was the case with her earlier books as well, it seems a bit too self-indulgent this time around. Perhaps the third time is not the charm?"},{"Title":"Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise","review":"I've loved all of Ruth Reichl's books, although this one is not quite as compelling as her previous autobiographies. Nevertheless, for fans of her writing, this should not be missed. What I found fascinating was the behind-the-scenes look into the world of the restaurant critic - who knew that this was really the way it worked? It makes you think hard about critics across the board - how can they be objective if they are pandered to this way? (Unless they go out of their way to disguise their identity, like Reichl did.)Her passion for food and her work is another reason to buy this book - the way she lives her life with vigor and purpose is truly inspirational. I am a fan. (But I will still give it 4 out of 5 stars because I didn't quite love this effort as much as prior ones.)"},{"Title":"Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise","review":"Here's Ruth Reichl again, at her plain-spoken, truth-telling best.Best? Well, yes. If you've ever lived in a metro area where a food critic doesn't bother with disguise and, in fact, cultivates those he purports to \\"review\\", you've probably wondered whether his experience differed just a teensy bit from yours. Here's proof: it does, wildly.Enter the many faces of Ruth: literal faces made up with the artistry and precision of a theater artist. Restaurants are a kind of theater, after all, and it is fascinating to observe Reichl's various transformations. How she looks literally seems to effect personality changes, body language, facial expressions, the whole person. If you have ever wondered how \\"ordinary folk\\" fare at, say, Tavern on the Green, here's your chance to find out at much less cost than you would (disappointedly) pay on your own.In the background of creatively written reviews lurks the grinding machine of the New York Times. Her descriptions leave one with the sense of having a map to her office, of knowing the way to the special, rarefied atmosphere of celebrations. There are gentle (and not-so-gentle) evocations of various characters so that an underlying thread of the book reads almost like a novel.Front and central, though, is the journey the author takes from Los Angeles to New York and the Times. It is a journey of discovering that her first love continues to be the kitchen, of eating and serving forth her own food. By the end of the book, she has found a way of returning to the kitchen, in a sense, by moving on to Gourmet Magazine.In most memoirs, the recipes usually strike me as throwaways. They are essential neither to the text nor to my recipe shelf. This book, unusually, has earned a place among my cookbooks. The roast chicken recipe and Reichl's comments make the book well worth its price."},{"Title":"Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise","review":"I like Ruch Reichl - but this book meaders too much. When you read her actual restaurant reviews - they are superb... however, too much build up when she's not reviewing. Once or twice with the disguises to get into restaurants was enough - after the fourth time - it was redundant - and I was interested in learning more about her views on the whole food industry (than what wig goes with what outfit/make-up and so on for costuming herself to appear in public -so chefs/maitre-d's do not recognize her). That played well once, twice - but after that - it didn't matter anymore... I got the point. Ruth writes very well - and is very down to earth and really knows her food... but I thought better editing could have tightened up her stories and made for smoother flow. I felt this good book - could have been a great book. Ruth has a nice way about her - she takes on the world of high end food and restaurants - and makes it approachable for the average person - in that way, she is excellent."},{"Title":"Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise","review":"I first heard about Ruth Reichl's book after hearing her interviewed on CBC Radio. She was talking about the vast difference in the way restaurants would treat her when they recognised her as the New York Times restaurant critic compared to when she went in disguise - and she was encouraging people to stand up for their rights and insist on being well treated when they went out, something that most people don't do.The book is about food and restaurants - but much more than that. It's about the different aspects of your personality that come out when you're someone else, and how life-alterning those experiences can be. From a nondescript, middle aged woman, to a seductive redhead, to an acerbic shrew, Ruth Reichl describes her transformations, how they exposed different parts of herself that she never knew about, and for better or worse, how they changed her.Reichl isn't afraid to say what she thinks of people. At one moment she can be sublimely sensitive and loving towards someone in a way that reminds me of June Callwood at her best, and the next, describing in detail the dinner companion from hell at the top of the World Trade Center. She is also frank about herself - how idealistically she started out, how the job changed her, and what she thought of herself for it.One of the marks of a really good dish is that you discover something fresh about it every time you try it. In the same way, Ruth Reichl tells the same story in each chapter, but each time she reveals a little more about herself.This is one of just a few books I've read recently that made me feel disappointed to find there weren't any pages left at the end."},{"Title":"Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise","review":"This book set my finely attuned bull**** meter clanging away. When she sticks to her strengths,that is, writing about food, she is an engaging writer. Sadly, this book strays too much into make-believe land. I didn't believe most of the scenarios.Many had the resounding ring of COMPOSITE about them.I don't know---maybe it is because I just saw the film \\"Shattered Glass\\". Most dubious was an episode in which Ms.Reichl conveniently runs into a chic, ultra-sophisticated Hong Kong native who shows her the ropes at a restaurant in Flushing. Too many characters sound made up. Most annoying was Ms.Reichl's foray into pyscho-babble with the 'multiple personalities' that arose from her disguises. Particularly annoying were Brenda Rose and Emily whatever-her-name was (by that point in the book I was fed up with the Six Faces of Ruth). The experiences described in this book, especially, the ending, which I won't give away, are just too pat and convenient to seem like anything but the plot devises of an amateur novelist. I hope for his sake her son is not as cloyingly sweet and goody-goody as he comes off in this book. I'm the mother of three and if my kids were this too-too I'd want to retch. Eyekk. Please, Ms.Reichl, forget the mysticism and psychology and stick to your writing strengths. Who knew one could salivate over a description of squid ink?"},{"Title":"Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise","review":"It took me over half of the book to warm to Ruth's ways. I felt too many times she built up a scenario and left me hanging, wanting to know more. I was desperate to find out what happened... if there was any comeback from the charity couple, how the guy she duped on a date with her sexiest disguise reacted to finding out he had in fact been dining with the NYT critic, what the Chinese restaurant who had diligently faxed menus back & forth felt when she decided to unceremoniously dump them for some other venue, after so much effort to please her.Its a light read and charming enough, but my appetite was whetted and I craved more gritty details."},{"Title":"Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise","review":"If comfort food were a book, it would be Garlic and Sapphires. Ruth Reichl's writing is warm and inviting, instantly pulling you to her. She describes food and friends with a sensuality rivaled only by Pat Conroy's ability to elevate small human encounters into lush emotional landscapes.As much as this book is a journey of restaurants and food, it's equally an exploration of identity. Ruth dons disguise after disguise to avoid being recognized at restaurants, and in so doing explores and creates different aspects of herself. The journey is compelling and fun. You'll feel like her confidante and her companion.I listened to Garlic and Sapphires unabridged on audio, narrated by Bernadette Dunne. Ms. Dunne has a mellifluous, melodic voice and gives a magnificent, joyous performance."},{"Title":"Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise","review":"Still a great read, but not as good as Tender at the Bone and Comfort Me with Apples. Foodies will love the continued insight into restaurant review protocol, but the author really shines when she remembers early food experiences with her mom, dad and other relatives and friends. The highs are not as high, nor the lows as low in Garlic and Sapphires. Reichl has a long way to go to lose me as a reader; that said, I hope she has a few more early memories to incorporate in her next book."},{"Title":"Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise","review":"I seriously doubt any restaurant is going to recognize me anytime soon. Regardless, I'm tempted to throw on a pair of rectangular rimless glasses, a thrift shop t-shirt, some low rise, trendy un-trendy jeans, and pumas and go as some Emo child and head to the next soon to be chic culinary hot spot. I would not only look Emo, I would become an Emo; annoying and disenchanted with everything. That's called sacrafice for art people, as I hate Emo kids (and goths, hippies, and any subculture like that in general). I would go undercover, and hide my true identity from the watchful kitchen staff. All for the sake of an honest, and real, review.Okay, so I doubt I'm known enough (if at all) to need a disguise. I'll also probably go and dress up for fun anyways, but most likely if you read Garlic and Sapphires - The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise, then most likely you're digging around for your old wig from that Halloween back in 87' thats somewhere in your closet.Ruth Reichel, the current editor in chief of Gourmet magazine, and previous restaurant critic for the Los Angeles Times and the New York Times chronicles her (mis)adventures as she recently takes on her position at the NYT. The memoir opens up as she's on the plane to the Big Apple, when a restaurant worker on the next to her informs her of the bounty on her head. Ruth learns that every cook, prep chef, restaurant owner, waiter, and hostess is part of an army of personal stalkers. Even the plump plane lady can recite Ruth's personal information. This is how horror movies usually start.Ruth realizes her predicament: How can she retain her anonimity, and still correctly review a restaurant? Why, go in disguise of course! Ruth begins to develop (with a little help from friends for hair and makeup) a series of identities in order to infiltrate her targeted eateries and provide an accurate review. One that the everyday patron can take to heart on their own visit.However, each disaguise begins to take on as aspect of Ruth. She doesn't simply make up a persona to match the disguise, but she becomes that persona and subsequently a hidden personal outlooks of her own Ego. This leads to her confronting her dark side in the bitter and lonley Emily who snaps at the wait staff, adopting her bright and bubbly inner child as the smart and colorful Brenda, and recognizing the sexy-powerful Chloe and her apparently dangerously flirtatious tendencies. Each alter-ego strives for the experience that any everywoman would receive. Regardless who she is, she always provides an captivating experience for the reader.Of course, Ruth also goes into the nitty gritty, showing her devotion to her art. The politics her job plays in the food world, and the sacrafices in her family and social life that she makes due to it lay out the real life drama involved in the glitzy big city food world. The insight into how her personal and work life intertwine, and how her history of food has made her who she is gives pulsing motion to the book, putting life into the pages to be absorbed by the hungry reader.No review can really do this book justice. I picked this up on a whim with the intention of reading it for a week or two. I finished in in one weekend. I laughed out loud, and I sat on the edge of my seat. Any self proclaimed restauranteur should pick this one up right away.Enjoy!(review written for the blog, Vanilla Garlic)"},{"Title":"Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise","review":"This book was so good and entertaining that it was hard to put down. What was really interesting was seeing the finished review after reading the story behind it."},{"Title":"Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise","review":"Ok, so I like going to nice restaurants once in a while (but not the NY gold standard kind), but I'm not into critiquing my meal. Having read Ruth's book I have a new appreciation for the job she does & those who make their living in the restaurant business. I have a new outlook on getting a very nice meal. She also does a great job explaining the characters she takes on in her quest to get a meal without the servers, chefs, etc knowing that it's her (she's a restaurant critic for the NY Times). This is an interesting look at something I had no idea about."},{"Title":"Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise","review":"This is the third installment that Ruth Reichl shares about her life. This book follows her as she becomes the NY Times restaurant critic.While flying to NY to start the job she realizes that she's going to be recognized and must come up with a plan to eat out and not be treated as the NY Times restaurant critic. So she comes up with the fabulous idea of transforming herself into different people. She enlists help from her mother's friend and \\"becomes\\" her characters. She finds out that when she dresses up as these characters -- that she has within her to be that person as well. She even becomes jealous of some of her characters (Brenda) and despises others (Emily). It's such a great learning experience for her that I wish more people could do it as well.This is fun to read and if you're not hungry starting out -- you'll definitely be by page 20. I love that instead of using pictures, she uses recipes to further illustrate her love and passion for food. It's as if you're at dinner with your best friend who's sharing every bite of food with you.I read her past two books, Tender at the Bone and Comfort Me with Apples and thoroughly enjoyed them as well. I am eagerly awaiting her next book about her experiences as editor-in-chief of Gourmet. I'm going to have a dinner group -- where everyone has to read at least one of her books and bring one of her recipes. I highly recommend Ruth Reichl as an author. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise","review":"Aside from the endless foie gras and wine lists, the author described what happened to her with each disguise. We could see how they influenced her. Each personna seemed to have it's own set of traits, as we humans do have many good ones; some bad. This author seemed to learn and evolve- or go back, from her many uncomfortable disguises to a wonderful personality she had to begin with.My pity is for the Betty's of the world; shoved into corners and rudely treated even though they have the one-time, exhorbitant monies to pay for the spectacular meal of their lives.The author showed me this, and showed me deep concern for the Homeless. While we feast on the World's Bounty, the author addressed a growing concern!!!There's always our Mother in the background, isn't there? Whether ghost or alive, she is always there forcing dialogue or memory in some way, whether we like it or not. Few of us can escape it. Authors especially. I didn't appreciate the author's telling of her mother's shortcomings. Disloyal. We didn't need to know her mother made people sick with her food. Let that be buried with her and go on, picking out instead, her attributes. For as she goes, the descendant will also.I especially enjoyed a peek into the author's life, her friends and the wonderful food that I might only read about. It was so very nice to be treated to a glimpse of her little boy and his own take on life as well as her husband's. I especially loved Carol and felt grief over her demise.Each character the author took on, gave her greater understanding about herself, as I gleaned from the pages. Not all of it good, but all of it enlightening.I paid attention when her husband stated his concerns as Marion did as well. The author admitted this with brutal honesty, describing the critique well, and went into a soul-searching. A good person to begin with, she saw what was happening to her and fixed it; Hurray!The author is quite generous, exhibited a good sense of fair play and a conscience!Enjoyable book. A woman evolving. Great food. Nice recipes. Sharing of grief, friendships, and honesty. She took us along the way.The author shared with us, her innermost ideas, feelings and personal growth. I recommend this book to anyone whether or not we have the means to dine so well as the author."},{"Title":"Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise","review":"As a person who loved Ms. Reichl's previous two books, I even pre-orederd this new one just to find out that it was far below my expectations. I really expected much more from such a talented person who knows the industry inside out and writes prose wonderfully. This book turned out to be a tedious story about changing wigs, fake names, clothes plus some old restaurant reviews. Hence, to delete the not so good impact of this last book on my memories, I went back to reread 'Comfort me with apples' so that I remember Reichl's prose as a much more delightful creation. Nevertheless, I will still read whatever she will write in the future and will look forward to her next piece."},{"Title":"Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise","review":"If you're into food and New York you will like this book. Ruth Reichl is funny in this memoir about her times as the New York Times restaurant critic. One of the rules of all serious restaurant critics is to go anonymous, so Ruth describes in her book not only the desguises she wore but the personalities she created for the different characters she became: Brenda, Emily, and even her own mother. Ruth transformed herself not only physically but mentally, sometimes confusing her own self. At the end of the book she discovers she needs to move on, and go back to the kitchen instead of the dining room. Great read, I personally loved this book."},{"Title":"Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise","review":"I love Ruth's work. Seeing a glimpse into what a restaurant reviewer goes through adds a new dimension to the dining experience. I've experienced some of the the same treatment at restaurants that she describes in this book- lousy treatment by myself as an unknown, being kowtowed to when I go in with somebody \\"important\\".One of the things I enjoyed most was the amount of effort that went into creating her other personas. Anybody can just slap on a wig- it takes real work to become another person altogether.Give this book a read- you'll think twice about what and where you eat!"},{"Title":"Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise","review":"About halfway through the book, I started getting bored. Reichl comes up with a persona, creates a disguise, eats at (mostly) fancy restaurants, and then shares her review. The book has no real forward momentum, it's mostly a collection of similar vignettes.I enjoyed her previous two books a lot more, and the tales of food mixed with her personal life and loves was a lot more entertaining. I'm glad she has a good husband and a beloved son, but their presence doesn't make for exciting copy.I am also glad Reichl is using her considerable talents more than she did during her years as a NY Times restaurant critic. It's quite an overrated profession, and gathered into book form did nothing but reinforce how pretentious and excessive these restaurants can be"},{"Title":"Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise","review":"When I heard that this book is the work of a former restaurant critic for the NY Times who found that \\"important\\" restaurant patrons get treated a lot better than ordinary people, I wondered:* Is there anyone over age ten who doesn't know that?* How could you write a whole book about this, and keep it interesting?Ah, but I was in for a pleasant surprise. Though the snobbery of fine restaurants in New York City is as unpleasant as it is commonplace, ordinary folks like me have a champion, and her name is Reichl. I need not have worried about the theme wearing thin, because this book is actually a collection of short stories, all entertaining.Mrs. Reichl is a keen observer and good story teller. She knows that we don't go to fine restaurants just to enjoy the food, and she knows that ill manners or bad service can ruin an otherwise happy occasion. As she says:\\"I did not come here simply to eat. I came for the glamour. I'm willing to pay for the privilege of feeling rich and important for a few small hours. Is that too much to ask? I have come here looking for a dream and it has turned into a nightmare. I feel frumpy and powerless. I may be nobody, but I don't like paying to be humiliated.\\"Restaurant owners and employees will eagerly roll out the red carpet for a NYT restaurant critic, just as they did the time the King of Spain was kept waiting in the bar while she and her party were seated immediately. They recognized her, of course, and knew that a good review in the Times was worth more business than any King could deliver.A lot of people would be happy to wallow in such a privileged role, feeding the ego along with the appetite (and all on an expense account) but not Mrs. Reichl. To find out how regular customers get treated, she contrives a variety of elaborate disguises. And sure enough, if you're just an ordinary man (a la Henry Higgins) you may well wind up on the receiving end of some surprisingly coarse, even insulting, behavior in place of hospitality. But one of the delights of this book is the way Mrs. Reichl brings the villains to justice-and if you have ever been similarly mistreated, even vicarious vengeance is sweet.To say the book is good is not to say it's perfect, however.* Though replete with examples of how bureaucratic, mean-spirited, and self-important NYT managers can be, and though published within two years of the Jayson Blair scandal, Mrs. Reichl clings to her memory of it as \\"the world's greatest newspaper\\". I think she gives them better than they deserve.* She gets carried away with her disguises; making up biographies for the characters, undergoing a personality change to go with them, and on one occasion even let herself get picked up in a bar. It's too much like Bridey Murphy for me.* Her recipes, though quite good, come with instructions bordering on the baroque. For example, hash browns call for \\"waxy\\" potatoes (she means \\"boilers, not bakers\\"), and her chicken must be \\"farm-raised\\". Now, isn't any place that raises chickens a farm by definition? (does she mean free-range?). At any rate, I'd like to be there if she ever walks into Wegman's to ask the greengrocer for \\"waxy potatoes\\", or wants the butcher to tell her whether the chicken was \\"raised on a farm\\".* She tells us to \\"cut the potatoes into 1\\" squares.\\" Does she mean cubes? Impossible. Hash-browns are sliced, but you'd never know it from these instructions.* She describes a visit to a Jamaican neighborhood where the cooking equipment is \\"jerry-rigged\\". That is a malapropism. \\"Jerry-built\\" means shoddily built from inferior materials, and \\"jury-rigged\\" describes a repair contrived from materials at hand to get a ship get back to port. But there is no such thing as \\"jerry- rigged\\". It is like saying \\"fire distinguisher\\" when you mean \\"fire extinguisher\\", and I am surprised her editor never caught it.The New York City restaurant scene would make a proving ground for Thorstein Veblen's theory of Conspicuous Consumption. Take Mr. Shapiro, the food warrior, for example. To be part of this extravagance day-in, day-out for ten years would be enough to corrupt a saint. And yet, Mrs. Reichl seems to have kept her head through it all. Just look at her choice of recipes. She may order petit fois gras a Le Cirque, but in the book she tells us how to make dishes like hash browns, and baked chicken. And even when she chooses something more exotic (like New York cheesecake) she gives us a version that is as easy to make as it is delicious. My hat's off to her."},{"Title":"Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise","review":"This book is less autobiographical than Reichl's other two books, 'Tender at the Bone' and 'Comfort me with apples.' Nonetheless, this book is a great read and hilarious. Reichl talks about moving from being the restaraunt critic for the LA Times to the NY Times. It is great to read about how she dresses up and goes undercover to see how regular, non-rich people get treated at restaraunts. Great stories and pleasant to read beacuse Reichl has the gift of sounding like your friend and that she is right there telling you what happened to her today."},{"Title":"Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise","review":"Although it was entertaining to read about resturants I will never get to eat at, I found the dialogue,style, and story boring.I don't know what I was expecting, but my book club wanted to do this book & I did not enjoy it. Maybe newspaper articles are better."},{"Title":"Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise","review":"I like the book til about 3/4 of the book. It was cute in the beginning, but it was getting tiresome. There were parts of the book that was funny. But, if you don't go to expensive restaurants, and know about gourmet foods and restaurants. It becomes tedious. I had a hard time relating since I don't go to pricy reataurants. But, it did give you a different outlook on the restaurant business. How they treat you. I go to my local restaurant, or coffe shop any day. They know my name, and it is personal. But, in these xpensive restaurants you have the status if you are somebody, and they will seat at the best table in the house. Getting back to the book, The best part were the disguises, how her family felt when she had all the disguises, now that was funny. The treatments of the customers if you were famous. They would get the best table in the house. And when she was found out to be the food critic of TNYT. Then they gave her the best table, the best wines, made sure she had a full glass of wine. I never even thought of going to a restaurant and being a social event."},{"Title":"Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise","review":"I was so disappointed in this latest book.

And the recipes just happened out of the blue and were not very interesting.Don't bother buying. Wait until it hits your local library."},{"Title":"Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise","review":"I cannot understand how a publisher can justify charging more for the Kindle version than paperback. It leads me to believe that as e-readers dominate the market place publishers are opting to gouge us with higher prices. It makes no sense when you consider they do not need to print or transport the books. So why the higher rate? Pure greed that ultimately hurts the authors because readers like myself refuse to buy the book."},{"Title":"Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise","review":"Book was listed as being in good condition; I would have said fair since it has quite a bit of water damage."},{"Title":"Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise","review":"I loved the characters that Ruth created and how she learned from each character.

I read this one first not knowing there were others before it. It stands by itself...but it was great to look forward to two others..

Master writer...Ruth doesn't write high and mighty reviews... just enjoyable, humorous and interesting episodes..."},{"Title":"Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise","review":"Oh, how I love the way Ruth Reichl writes - about food, family, everything. I just want to hang out with her sometime, she seems very much like someone I should know, but just haven't met yet.I loved her transformations into different personas, and how she truly seemed to become a different person by putting on a wig, a new outfit and some shoes.This is a delicious read, and I am anxiously awaiting her next book, whatever the subject!"},{"Title":"Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise","review":"This was an entertaining book. If you love food, you will enjoy reading about this food critics experience. She writes in an unexpected comical way, pulling you into her assignments with mouth watering descriptions.

I was wrong - it is so much more. Reichl is an amazing writer who describes the dishes she eats so well that you swear you can taste them. After working in restaurants for years I found that her observations rang true and loved the humor that she sprinkled in to the story. A must-read for those who love food, eating out, and a great read."},{"Title":"Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise","review":"Reading this book is almost as good as dining out. If you never have the opportunity of dining in the kind of establiments Reichl describes, then this is the next best thing. Ruth Reichl can paint word pictures with such clarity that even some of the most disgusting sounding dishes make your mouth water. One thing I like is the inclusion of a few recipes so it is a \\"twofer.\\" \\"Who's Afraid of Virginia Ham\\" is a great companion book to \\"Garlic and Sapphires\\" and it is quite by accident that I read one right after the other. The last several chapters of Reichl's book were very poignant, given the history of what has happened in NYC after the time period in the book. Her enthusiasm is infectious, and her writing leaves you still hungry for more. She and Dominique Browning should collaborate on a food/garden book. That would be most delicious!"},{"Title":"Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise","review":"If you enjoyed Ruth Reichl's two previous memoirs, Tender at the Bone, about her childhood, and Comfort Me With Apples, about her earlier adventures in the restaurant and food writing business, prepare for a change of pace. Garlic and Sapphires is funnier, louder, and more memorable.If you are new to Ruth Reichl's writing, you can enjoy this one without having read her previous memoirs. Reichl describes how she stumbled into writing restaurant reviews and how she got the premier gig for any reviewer, The New York Times. And then it really gets interesting.She realizes on the flight to New York for her job interview that the entire New York restaurant world will be stalking her, since a review from the NY Times can make or break a restaurant. Knowing that she will need to remain incognito in order to fairly evaluate a restaurant, she comes up with a scheme.Enlisting the help of an acting teacher she knows, she comes up with a disguise and a persona to go with it. It works and she is able to review restaurants undetected for a time. But when she suspects her disguise has been discovered, she has to create another, then another. With every disguise, Reichl comes up with a new character to fit it, complete with backstory. She throws herself into these new roles, becoming the person inside the disguise.One character turns out to be her recently deceased mother, giving her a chance to work out a few unresolved issues, another character is a woman her husband finds disturbingly attractive, and yet another is so unlikeable that she has to discard the disguise before she ends up alienating her friends and family.Reichl writes about each episode without holding anything back. They are hilarious, or poignant, or fascinating, or all three. The only thing that could have made this a better book would have been to discard the out-of-date restaurant reviews at the end of each chapter and replace them with photographs of Reichl in each of her disguises."},{"Title":"Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise","review":"I was very disappointed in this audio CD book. First of all, something about this book seems very self-indulgent. For example, CD1 goes on endlessly about how the author doesn't really want this top job, but of course, she interviews and ends up with it. It seems very disingenous. Second, stories from a job of eating out at mostly very fancy restaurants seems pretty irrelevant in 2008, when most people are struggling to pay their monthly bills and save for retirement. Listening for 20 minutes to someone describe perfect buckwheat noodles is rather tiresome. Third, and perhaps most importantly, the publisher has chosen a reader who is very dramatic and overly inflects each and every voice. She mimics a 4 year old child, a portly Yankee editor, old Jewish men, the author, a haughty, constipated sounding friend (Claudia),Italian waiters, etc. I guess some listeners might enjoy this, but it personally drove me bonkers. A matter of personal preference, I guess. Be careful you can handle this type of a narration before you opt for the audiobook."},{"Title":"Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise","review":"Annoying, trite, and painfully over-exaggerated.That is all. This short review is about the perfect length the book should be."},{"Title":"Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise","review":"If you are interested in food and food critics, this is a awesome book for you. Ruth Reichl is a great author that should get some honor. Her book is filled with hilarious moments and the plot is just incredible. I will advise everyone to purchase this book because it will give you some incredible knowledge in food and critiques."},{"Title":"Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise","review":"This is my first exposure to Ruth Reichl and it was an entertaining ride. I have always thought what a great job being a food critic was, as echoed by Ruth and her other food critic friend when they squealed, \\"Can you believe they pay us to do this?\\" And Ruth reveals that glamorous aspect early on in the book - the special treatments these food critics get at restaurants are fit for royalty.But Ruth wants to experience the restaurants like a commoner. So she disguises herself and creates a personality for each one. For me, a commoner who does not go to fashionable restaurants, it was an eye opener to see the difference in service if you do not look the part.Unfortunately, the costumes come off and Ruth is no longer a commoner. When she visits a sushi restaurant, she is shocked when a man dips his rice into the soy sauce instead of the fish. There are other foodie rules broken by commoners that Ruth criticizes, which shows that she is actually royalty at heart.Including the original reviews at the end of the chapter was very redundant. Although her descriptions of food were vivid, they became tedious and wordy as the book went on. I thought the ending was a bit abrupt, her reflections a bit short.Nevertheless, I liked that Ruth did try to stand up for fairness when it comes to treating different people, not only in restaurants, but in general. She also wanted to expose people to foods other than French, American, or Italian, and dared to review lesser known ethnic restaurants, which were not considered chic and created controversies.And in the end, Ruth showed me that all seemingly great jobs have a downside. Her son told her despite all the fancy restaurants, he prefers to eat at home with her. After that comment, I realized that I would not trade my life for what Ruth did. Despite all the glitz and glamor, it really is the simple things in life, like eating a homemade meal with your family, that gives us true happiness, and that is the greatest equalizer for royalty and commoners.3 1/2 stars."},{"Title":"Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise","review":"a completely enjoyable read, from the standpoint of a real restaurant reviewer.

I always liked Ruth and believed her to be a very down to earth person. This book in no way changed my opinion of her. Garlic and Sapphires has a good balance of food and non-food writing. I am a foodie and sometimes am disappointed when there isn't enough about the food. She accounts her experiences dealing with editors, and I found that interesting as well."},{"Title":"Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise","review":"I relished this book. It's funny and inspiring. I loved the main character, preparing for her performance, including her many creative disguises. My mouth watered with descriptions of the food. I wanted to rush out to restaurants, to not only have a fabulous meal but to really pay attention to the ambiance of the restaurant, the presentation and taste of the food. This book wanted me to expand my experience from ordering a glass of wine and an entr&eacute;e to also include an appetizer, salad, and definitely dessert.

Times to the new position she held for 6 years in New York (an unwanted one at that.... and how she tried to blow the interview!). Ruth Reichl learns quickly that in New York the restaurants have been learning about her months before she has arrived into her new job. Rumor has it they even have her picture posted in the restaurants so everyone can be aware when she enters. A flight to New York gives Ruth time to come up with a plan....With the help of a family friend, clothing, make up and wigs, Ruth is morphed into several alter egos:Molly Hollis: A larger older woman, bland in her clothing choicesMiriam: The creation of her own motherChloe: A blond bomb shell who dresses to the nines, with red nails and lipstick to matchBrenda: The earth motherBy utilizing these different disguises, Ruth is able to dine in the restaurant she wishes to review without fear of being recognized or receiving special treatment.... in fact, with each disguise, she learns how the restaurants really treat their everyday customers... in some cases poorly, and in other cases - remarkably well. Ruth's reviews lead her to be the most influential restaurant critic in the country, but it was hard-earned.I loved this book. I picked it up from my library yesterday and this morning after I took care of a few home projects I settled into my cozy chair with a blanket and let the life of a restaurant critic both amaze and delight me. I enjoyed how Ruth came up with her many disguises, her funny restaurant happenings, and the opinions of her husband and five-year old son. I really enjoyed reading the story of the restaurant and the follow-up with the actual New York Times Review. Every so often Ruth wold drop in a recipe as well which has inspired me to do a little food creating myself - which for me is a rare occurrence!I never knew I would enjoy a book like this but I am so glad I read it.

Secrets that any food lover is going to want.I admit I've always dreamed of having a job as a restaurant critic, so Garlic and Sapphires was like a peek into the life I dream of. It's indulgent but real. You might have heard not-so-fabulous things about Ruth Reichl's other books (they weren't my favorite), but this book is awesome.

She knows food, she loves food, she loves excellent food, and she likes a jelly donut with coffee from the corner stand every morning. She's a real person writing about restaurants.Ruth knew when she left LA for the coveted New York Times food critic assignment that she would get great food and great service is she appeared as herself, so she dresses in a variety of disguises and gets treated like all the rest of the patrons. Sometimes that means the same courteous service and sometimes that means being treated with disdain.Her in depth discussion about the food and wine and the atmosphere is reminiscent of Julia Child's My Life in France, which I loved.

It was worth it. Well-written and amusing.I write a restaurant review blog, not that I am anywhere near her caliber, so I found her attempts at not being discovered to be amusing. Think Mrs. Doubtfire. It was interesting to read her observations on how she was treated, depending on the disguise she was wearing, and how she'd get into character.

This reviewer does notemploy numerical ratings.)"},{"Title":"A Life in a Year: The American Infantryman in Vietnam, 1965-1972","review":"After spending the last 40 years studying about Vietnam and American involvement in Southeast Asia, every biographical account deserves honorable mention for those who served in the military during that era.After growing up in the Army with a father who worked his way up the ladder from scratch and retired as a Major, I was privy to how the soldiers felt about the subject of Vietnam. I grew up hearing about it, realizing the Western mind cannot grasp the subtleties of the Eastern way of thinking. In Asia, every act has a strategy that has been planned to the nth degree. It has been this way for centuries. Westerners are brash, impulsive and loud. Aggressiveness cannot win over the mild temperament, calm word and slow reaction-time. Remember a mild word can break a bone. Americans landing in a foreign culture never had the knowledge rooted in them from years of training. Mere weeks and months cannot teach one the value of subtlety. Asians may be built smaller but their culture has survived centuries of invasion, leaving one to wonder about the possibility of American victory.By the end of 1968, most soldiers knew they were fighting a war that could not be won. Theirs was mostly a 9-5 war fought on forays into jungles and humping over mountains for days before being resupplied but seldom separated from radio contact. At night they fought behind heavily defended concertina wire, psychologically tortured by mortar fire shot randomly into each LZ. Hand to hand combat was a rarity and body count for NVA virtually nil.Those who operated primarily in the rear did not often experience the highs and lows of combat action such as the battle for Khe Sanh. Theirs was the daily drudge of military idiosyncrasies and rules that served little purpose but kept everyone occupied even if all they did was fill sandbags and dig foxholes. Their experiences have value because they were the ones who supported the combat units in the field. After all, someone had to sort and deliver mail, prepare and cook meals, not to mention the variety and enormity of paperwork involved for the families of soldiers KIA, MIA, POW, or wounded.Overall, the highest praise has always gone to the pilots, gunners, medics and nurses while those who \\"worked\\" in the rear in other valuable positions were given the misnomer of REMF, named such out of sheer ignorance of their actual responsibilities. FNGs were also all lumped into one category--soldiers too new and raw to comprehend the situation was volatile even in camp. Yet, every man who served was once an FNG to someone. Little sympathy has been shown in the majority of memoirs over the responsibilities of higher echelon officers and their service to their country or even how much they had to learn--individually--before they became officers.That being said, I enjoyed the journalistic efforts (funny, at times) of every combat veteran simply because it illustrates each person's values, morals, and personality. The experiences helped me to grasp the bigger picture of the war against heat, rain, mud, dust, disease, jungle warfare, spider-holes, a poisonous population of animal life and the randomness of how soldiers were murdered. It was not a war of armor and fighting, as Americans understand it to be over the centuries.

As a combat Vietnam veteran with the 4th Division(Central Highlands '69-'70), I have to have my tongue firmly-planted-in-cheek and my BS alert set to high when reading interviews conducted by civilians of alleged combat vets.This book is different. Mr. Ebert's troops are the real thing. There are a few portions of some accounts I would question as possibly being embellished, but from personal experience I know that truth - and life - in the bush was often, if not usually, stranger than any fictional stories that could be thought up.

Written by a teacher.. organized from an Infantryman's life before the war and then his step by step journey from combat training to fighting the war .. to stay alive and in many cases not. I was an Infantryman in 1967, I was wounded and spent my remaining 7 months of duty in Army hospitals. I tried to forget the war, and did so for 40 plus years. Within the past 6 months, I was diagnosed with Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma.. due to exposure to Agent Orange. I felt the need to fill in the blanks and find out more about the War everyone wanted to forget. I have read many books on the Vienam War in a short time.. But the best and the most truthful about the experiences of the \\"combat soldier\\"---The Infantryman-- is A Life In A Year, by James R. Ebert.

Nothing fancy, nothing cute, nothing outlandish--just like really being there day in and day out. Straight shooting from basic to the freedom bird. If this was required reading before Vietnam I am not so sure the volunteer rate would have been as high as it was--but then we had to live Vietnam so such a book could be written."},{"Title":"A Life in a Year: The American Infantryman in Vietnam, 1965-1972","review":"I would give this book more than 5 stars if possible. Wisconsin high school teacher James R. Ebert does a masterful job as he combines interviews and printed primary sources in this remarkable telling of the infantryman's experience during the Vietnam War. Ebert tells the story of the US Army and a few US Marine infantrymen during the Vietnam War. He takes their story from induction into the service through basic and advanced individual training, arrival in Vietnam, their first combat experiences, the first killed in action they experience, in some cases the soldier's death, and the freedom birds that take them back to the world. Ebert points out while infantryman accounted for less than 10% of the American troops in Vietnam, the infantry suffered more than 80% of the losses.Ebert uses an interesting technique starting every chapter with a letter by Leonard Dutcher to his parents. Dutcher just wanted to do his part for God and country and go home at the end of his tour. In the last chapter, we find out that Dutcher was killed. It caught me off guard and really added to the impact of the book. Ebert takes many of the soldiers and Marines experiences word for word from the individual himself through interviews or letters. It is a collective look at similarities of the many infantry soldiers and Marines in the war. It is a very personal account from many points of view.This is an important book in Vietnam War literature. This is what the grunts really went through. I was left with somewhat of feeling of guilt from reading the book. Why? I graduated high school in 1971. Some of my high classmates went to Vietnam and fought. My classmate Everett Maxwell was killed in action. I went to college and was ultimately commissioned a second lieutenant in the infantry, went through airborne school and served three years active duty. My becoming an officer deferred my entry on active duty from 1971 to 1975. This is the reason for my reflective thoughts.Read and reviewed by Jimmie A.

It is a classic. It is simple and direct and the many short excerpts of interviews of men who servied in Vietnam are graphic and sometimes overpowering. I found this book in our local library and will now buy it for my collection and for my children and grandchildren to read. In addition to the depictions of what infantry combat is truly like, what impressed me most was the overriding theme that Vietnam was a war without clear military objecives. There were no cities to liberate, no islands to capture, no real enemy to defeat. It was a year in the bush and out. The men who fought there were denied the incentive of a battle won, an objective taken, an end of game. They were the objective."},{"Title":"A Life in a Year: The American Infantryman in Vietnam, 1965-1972","review":"As a serious student of the US Vietnam War but who never served in that country I have often wondered just what it was like to be there - in that country during the War. In particular what was it like for the combat soldier. Let it be understood I have respect for those individuals who served in support positions - the tasks they performed were essential, but those most exposed to mortal danger were the enlisted or drafted army and marine infantry soldiers. None of my veteran friends or relatives would discuss their experiences with me in any detail.I have read a dozen or so memoirs of combat experiences in Vietnam. Some were quite good, all were informative. James Ebert's 1993 book \\"A Year in the Life - The American Infantryman in Vietnam\\" attempts to give a complete overview of the entire combat experience from induction and basic training to getting short and then taking the freedom bird back to the states. The author distilled over sixty interviews with veterans and created a narrative that walks the reader through a combat tour. Using extensive quotes and summary paragraphs we are provided an understanding of what these young men experienced.In my opinion this book would go on my very short list of essential reading for understanding the US combat experience in Vietnam. In retrospect one can only ponder with respect and admiration the patriotic sacrifice made by so many fine individuals in a cause that was predestined for failure from it's conception."},{"Title":"Malta Epic","review":"As mentioned in some of my other reviews; whereas much has been written about the London Blitz which lasted for 57 days - during which the city was staunchly defended by RAF and ground forces, the Malta Blitz lasted for 157 days and whilst there was no shortage of valour from defending forces and civilian population, the Maltese did not have either the aircraft or ammunition to put up the same level of defence. Theirs was, therefore, a struggle which has become known as The Epic of Malta. This book has no such heroic stature.With 4 pages of introduction by a professor of history at the University of Malta, the entire history of Malta in WW2 is reduced to its bare bones. This is followed by chapters headed; Undefeated Malta, The Island and its People, Keeping Malta Supplied, Malta Under Fire and In Defence of the Island in which we find a product which is more reliant on photography than text to put over the underlying message.With text spreading almost to the four edges of every page on which words appear and many of the pictures being faded, the overall impression is one of a reasonable product being spoilt by cheap reproduction. Nevertheless, the photographic history is there and should be welcomed for that.NM"},{"Title":"A Practical Guide to Past Life Regression (Llewellyn's New Age Series)","review":"The book introduces that any person with simple training for relaxation can regress to past life memories. The main goal is improvement of quality of present life. The author presents a lot of situations from her life. One deals with how her recollection about an earlier life in which she died (as a male) in a cave because of earthquake, helps her to resolve her fear of closed spaces in the present life. The important point is that she verifies from historical records about the actual occurence of an earthquake associated with the time and place. Her girl child always insist on some packing of eatable even for any mudane visit outside home. By regression, she identifies that she has died in a desert in a earlier life. This insight helps her to be compassionate to her child. The issue is not whether one believes in past lifes or not; one can check oneself whether such regression helps one's present life. In case of many phobias, addictions , unreasonable emotinal behaviours, she suggests that past life regression can give understanding and cure.

Dickens knew how to put together a page-turner. Many of his novels were first printed in sections at weekly intervals, and sold for a penny each installment, so the story had to have strong &#34;what happens next&#34; elements.But what sets Dickens apart is his depiction of the social strata. In France it was aristocrats & downtrodden; in England it was the middle & working class (or more accurately if metaphorically white & blue-collar workers). Jerry Cruncher, bank messenger, part-time grave-robber & part-time bodyguard adds to the collection of wonderful Dickens characters. So does the banker Jarvis Lorry, a confirmed bachelor, &#34;man of business&#34; & wise old bird who shows almost despite himself the need to give & receive emotional comfort.In our world of the ultra-rich 1% & the other 99%, a new revolution may be brewing.

Mr. Lorry goes to Paris at great risk to himself because he is loyal to his firm. Lucie is loyal to Charles Darnay.

We must give our lives to something. Sydney Carton redeemed himself by his sacrifice for a noble end."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"A Tale of Two Cities is Dickens' vision of the French Revolution, a character drama given much extra weight by the enormous social, political and economic upheavals that were happening in France in the late eighteenth century. While the beginning of the novel is languorous and meandering, skipping half-decades and years as it sees fit, the end of the novel focuses upon the tumultuous time in Paris when the citizens took back the reins of power from the aristocracy. Because of this, there is an undercurrent of danger and urgency that perfectly matches the danger and urgency of the main plot, as Charles Darnay's heritage is revealed and his fate is sealed while his horrified wife and father look on, impotent.Because of the sheer magnitude that is the backdrop to a Tale of Two Cities, it is easy to forget the quiet, measured conversations of the main characters and focus upon the brief episodes of carnage, confusion, destruction and death, scattered throughout the novel as the Revolution picks up speed, decimating the lives of everyone involved - peasant and aristocrat alike. Whole chapters are a cacophony of sounds, actions, weapons and blood, in the reading, it is almost as though the reader themselves are lost within the time period described, fighting alongside the men in the streets, knowing only what they know, but realising it in the full, deadly detail that such an occasion. demands.Lucie Manette, a young British woman, has found her father years after he disappeared - presumed dead. They re-unite and he is a vague, confused shell of the man she knows only through the stories of Mr Lorry, a banker. But the goodness of her love is enough to win his mind back, and the two are re-united properly. She eventually marries and has a child, then the Revolution begins and her husband, Charles Darnay, the man who swore on his wedding day to Dr Manette never to reveal his secret to his wife, is recalled back to Paris to account and atone for the mistakes of his family. Another friend, Sydney Carton, a lonely, self-deprecating but brilliant lawyer who wants more than anything else to share in the rainbow of love that Lucie offers to Charles, travels to Paris as well.In Paris, Madame Defarge and her husband, important elements in the Revolution, live their lives peacefully and quietly, all the while plotting for the eventual success of the 'common man' against their oppressors. Her heritage is linked inextricably with Darnay - at least in her mind - and it is through these two families - one in England, one in France - that the story unfolds.When not exploding into violent prose concerning the endless bloodshed in Paris, Dickens is content to have his characters slowly wander through life, stopping often for leisurely conversations and lofty ruminations. Even towards the end, the scenes which are played out seem so minor when compared to the calamity around them, and yet, at the same time, are indicative of the world in which they live. In all bloody times, there are intimate family dramas being played out, some more or less significant, but all important to those involved.Throughout the novel, subtly, the guillotine is deified and the sweet rustling of Lucie Manette's dresses fade away into the background as the symbols of war become more important than the people. This is perhaps one of the most important themes in the book, and one that is well and truly made evident by the end. In the final few scenes, in which one of the characters make a heroic, unbelievably sad sacrifice for his friends - who, even sadder, do not appreciate or even realise, some of them - an important statement is made, a poetic song to the unspoken stories of war is sung: That the people are, as always, more important than impossibly epic events happening around them, and that once this is forgotten, as it inevitably is, then the cause is lost, and everyone suffers."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"Because it was told piece by piece in a magazine, A Tale of Two Cities develops extremely slowly. But in the case of some characters, the story does not develop at all. Two of the main characters are Lucie Mannette and Charles Darnay, two fairy tale stereotypes. Lucie is the petite, flaxen, \\"damsel in distress,\\" who faints at every given chance. Dickens does not clearly elaborate on Darnay, but when we do see him, he is submissive, monotonous, and does not have an impact on the plot. On the other hand, Madame Defarge, the vindictive villain, and Sydney Carton, the hero, were well drawn and were easier to understand. Although Carton is one of the decent characters, the changes he makes are unrealistic. Sydney evolves from being a lethargic drunkard and jackal to sacrificing his life for another in the end. This transition is sudden, surprising everyone with his fatal decision.The rest of the plot follows this pattern of dull confusion followed by revelation. With books one and two being uneventful, Dickens startles us with a dazzling end. Cartons last words,\\" It is a far, far better thing that I do, than I have ever done; it is a far, far better rest that I go to than I have ever known\\"(352), represent the height of the novel, but then it abruptly ends. The better part of the book is wasted with too much unnecessary detail, such as when describing Mr. Lorry: \\"Very orderly and methodical he looked, with a hand on each knee, and a loud watch ticking a sonorous sermon under his flapped waistcoat, as though it pitted its gravity and longevity against the levity and evanescence of the brisk fire (14).\\" These details prove no importance in the plot, and make readers less interested. The time spent on describing random features would be better spent on developing Carton.Since this story is of the two-sided revolution, the narrator is best as author. If the narrator had been anyone else, such as Darnay or Dr. Mannette, the story would have been biased, corrupting the strong point of having unprejudiced narration. Dickens does show slight sympathy for the poor, such as the scene with the Marquis running over a peasant's child and throwing out coins to pay for his life, but overall, Dickens does an excellent job of telling the story of Paris and London.The language makes this love story seem more complicated than it actually is. Using words such as \\"obsequiousness (105)\\" and \\"tumultuous (217)\\" clutter the romantic yet heroic plot. The language is a surprise, considering the book started out in a newspaper which people of all reading levels could buy.Written in 1859, A Tale of Two Cities has been a well-loved novel for over a century. The timelessness of the novel proves that no matter how lingering and dreary it can be, the outstanding love story overrides the negative components, such as the characters. Carton's gallantry exemplifies pure and unselfish love, and his resurrection makes a great story line with an everlasting value of importance. Even though every period is different from the next, Dickens makes an original love story with an unexpected twist which people of any age and social ranking can relate to."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"When reading Charles Dickens's works, the reader is put into a whole new world. Though Dickens does relate events back to the actual late 1700's, he makes you feel as though you are actually witnessing these actions. In A Tale of Two Cities, Dickens brings out the best and the worst in his characters. A good example of this is Sydney Carton. Carton is a lawyer, physically resembling Charles Darnay. This character lives in a fog of apathy and alcohol. Throughout the book Carton expresses his love for Lucie Mannette, although he knows he has too many burdens for her. He ends the book a completely changed person, sacrificing his life for Lucie's husband, Darnay. While bringing out the problems and selfishness of Doctor Mannette, Lucie's father, Dickens also shows how this character has grown into a man of distinction. Mannette was imprisoned for 18 years, until he was \\"recalled\\" to life. He witnessed several downfalls throughout the novel, mainly losing his daughter to a young man. Lucie marries Charles Darnay, and during their honeymoon, Mannette goes into a state of depression and the past life of imprisonment resurfaces. Overall, the character developments were handled well in Tale of Two Cities.The most difficult part of reading Tale of Two Cities is the first 60 pages. Once the reader passes those, the rest is enjoyable. Dickens should have spiked some interest into those pages to better draw in readers. Dickens also has a tendency to drag out problems, only because the book was first issued in installments in a newspaper. He had to keep the people reading. The way that Dickens intertwined historical records into the everyday problems helps the readers have a better understanding of the French Revolution. When writing the novel, Dickens included so many details and descriptions. I feel he directed this novel towards history buffs more so than readers.Dickens chose to write Tale of Two Cities in third person. Most people prefer reading works written in third person so they can experience what happens to the main character or know what all characters are thinking. On the other hand, some readers enjoy reading what one character thinks and what runs through their minds. When reading the novel, the reader might not have known how Lucie felt about Charles Darnay or Sydney Carton. Dickens writing the novel in third person, gives the reader a better overview.The major downfalls of this book are the language and style of the book. A Tale of Two Cities is incredibly cluttered and overly-packed with information, overwhelming the reader. This puzzled me, being that the tale is drawn out, and also packed with information. Dickens should have thought more about the amount of details he included. A great deal of is learned about the time period and how the men and women in Paris and London lived their lives.This novel has no humor and is overloaded with details. It's geared toward adults and historians. When finishing this book a sense of relief is felt. A Tale of Two Cities is a classic for teachers and historians; it is literature and history in one. Dickens's themes of poverty, violence, and revolution are there. The many details make getting to these ideas difficult."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"A Tale of Two Cites is a novel of two different insights- the Aristocrats and the Revolutionists, or perhaps, a book caught between the public and private views of the effects of the French Revolution. The story is simply a piece of literature, balanced in its strengths and weaknesses, telling the story of the Manettes, a family who struggles to stay together.The Manette family is just a handful of characters who interact in the story. Some are inclined to be more realistic than others. Lucie Manette, for example, is the daughter of Doctor Manette. She tends to be absolutely perfect in every aspect, except for her extraordinary fainting spells. Sydney Carton, the Christ figure of the novel, is better drawn. His life in the beginning is of little importance and when he is shown, he is bleak and unmotivating. Towards the end, Carton sacrifices himself for Lucie and her ideal world. He proves to all that they should be more altruistic like him.Dickens, like his character sketches, has the tendency to have problems in his plot line throughout the tale. About a hundred pages into the novel, A Tale of Two Cities becomes dry and unexciting and the reader feels compelled to finish quickly. The riots and action sequences are a few effects that keep the reader interested. Once the discovery of Darnay's imprisonment is made, the novel immediately becomes tolerable. Dickens needs to have exploits and clarity replacing the long, drowsy passsages told in the time frame between Dr. Manette's escape from his prison and Darnay's arrest. To most readers, A Tale of Two Cites is a book of despondency, but somehow, through the years, it remains a piece of &quot;Great Literature.&quot;A Tale of Two Cities is better told from a third person narrator's point of view rather than that of one of the novel's characters. If told by a character, the balance between the Aristocrats and the Revoluionists would disappear. Perhaps, if a character told the tale, it would move quicker, but the narrator choice is the correct one. If one of the characters told the story, it would have changed dramatically. For instance, if Lucie had told the story, the reader would get a sense of serious compassion and might wish to alter his life to be more like Lucie's utopia. If Madame Defarge had told the tale, the reader would feel utter forgiveness for all of Defarge's anguish against Lucie's family. The narrative choice is clearly the best.The story in its entirety is quite confusing. Judging by the intensity of the wording used in the novel, it is clear that the piece is intended to be read by an adult with a dense vocabulary. For instance, the passage on page forty-three states,&quot; The uncontrollable and hopeless mass of decomposition so engendered would have polluted the air, even if poverty and deprivation had not loaded it with their intangible impurities; the two bad sources combined made it almost insupportable.&quot; Even though the wording is strong, the style definitely fits the particular era. The collaboration of the narrative, the development of the story and character is very unique. When the collaboration is broken down separately, the reader senses less creativity and barely any imagination.Though this book is not one to be crammed page-to-page with action and wonder, it does keep the reader thinking. The wording and style of the piece are understood from the beginning to be produced by a master storyteller. Only a &quot;great&quot; could accomplish such an opening to a story,&quot; It was the best of times; it was the worst of times...&quot; (13). The passage is so intense and foreshadowing that an ordinary writer could not produce such a powerful statement. The book as a whole was quite convincing as the Manette family struggle for completeness during such an ordeal. Though the tale was at times incomprehensible, it will stll be read years and years from now. It qualifies as one of the &quot;greats,&quot; the style of writing its qualifying factor. All should read such a book to satisfy a taste of literature in Dickens time."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"A Tale of Two Cities is one of Dickens's classics and certainly one of my favorite novels of all time. It is a masterpiece on many counts, the development of the characters, the setting of the scene, the intricacy of the plot, and for its meaning and ability to move the emotions. Here we have a complex plot gently unfolding under the shadow of the turbulent French Revolution. Where Dickens excels most is in his descriptions and characterization. Thus after a few pages you will be living with the characters, feeling their tribulations and enjoying their moments of happiness, traveling with them on the road and feeling the tension of the trial rooms. One can feel through the pages the rush of the crowds during the historic moment of the storming of the Bastille, and cannot escape feeling the sympathy for the rescued Dr. Manette. The patterns of the novel shift from the violent to the happy to the frightening to the violent in an endless cycle not unlike today's turbulent world, where the secret trials and the revolutionary bloodshed are the theme of the day. A Tale of Two Cities is a timeless story about the triumph of love in such terrible times."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"A Tale of Two cities was the first book of Dicken's I have read. Parts of the book seem drawn out at the beginning. We are introduced to many charcters who seem to have nothing to do with each other. This where Dicken's literary Genius takes hold. As he walks us through this amazing story, he tells us his opinion of the institutions of the time (religious, judicial, etc) and we begin to peel back the layers of the onion. By the end of the book everything comes together, which only Dicken's could do.Simply the feeling of everything coming together is worth your read.

Dickens weaves an intricate tale, giving us seemingly unrelated tidbits which all come together at the end with one pull of his master storyteller thread.

What I mean by that is Charles over describes and repeats lots of matters that dont need to be. Also with little dialogue in long periods of the books, the book tends to get boring, monotonous to read, and easy to get lost in.Difficulty wise this book is hard for those who are not proficient or advanced readers not only because of the confusing old style language, but also because of those long paragraphs i mentioned earlier. Plot is pretty straightforward and predictable throughout the book if you understand it.Overall this book is not as good as a book as i thought and i think its over hyped simply because its Charles Dickens.PS If it is required for you to read this book go to spark notes not only for summaries, but also to read their No Fear Literature section (Translates the whole novel into readable english!)"},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"if you don't like reading books with way too much detail than don't buy this book. when i was reading it i couldn't understand anything it said. if you are older maybe you wouldn't think it's boring, or if you like this author's books, but i thought it was very boring and it took me forever and a half to read."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"I don't have much to say, so I will be brief.

Let me say that indeed the story has originality and touching moments but, in my opinion, it doesn't rise above average for mid-Victorian melodrama. The prose is extremely long-winded, as if Dickens was paid by the word. And the characterizations are either too endearing or too evil, .. very little in between.The story is complex. Let's just say it involves people whose lives are affected and even jeopardized by the French Revolution. Charles Dickens does a fine job in demonstrating the excesses of the old French aristocracy and the extreme anger of the impoverished. Anger quickly turns into vengenance and a vigilante mentality. It's this brutality and it's encroachment on the lives of good people which seem to comprise the moral of the story. Oh, and there is a very weepy ending to the book involving extraordinary self-sacrifice.Bottom line: I found 'A Tale of Two Cities' to be an arduous read despite its distinct merits. Recommend only to fans of the author."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"The symbolism and plot of the final three chapters of the book made what I consider to be one of the best closings of all time. However, the 300+ pages of drawn out language and wasted talk before the closing makes this book somewhat tedious and annoying. I'm a sophomore in High School and was forced to read this book for my Honors English II class. I must say that I consider myself to be an above average reader, and I would have gone crazy had it not been for the intervention of Cliff's Notes. Furthermore, I feel that the same points that Dickens got across about the French Revolution could have been expressed in half as many words. The characters wandered aimlessly among each other until they finally collided in one big bang at the end. In closing, I loved the final 3 chapters, but the immense amount of time wasted in getting there and figuring out where I was really spoiled the total experience for me."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"We read this book for my Honors Tenth Grade English Class. I was torn while reading between liking the book, and wanting to throw it against the wall. *CONTAINS SPOILERS.*A Tale of Two Cities is about a man named Alexandre Manette, a former Doctor who was falsely imprisoned by two members of the formidable aristocracy family in France (Charles Darnay's father and uncle) for attempting to expose the two brothers for the crime of raping a young peasant woman, killing her husband, and subsequently tearing an entire peasant family apart. At the beginning, Mr. Jarvis Lorry, a Tellson's Bank Banker and a very by-the-book man, arrives in England to take a woman named Lucie Manette to France to see her father for the very first time. (Dr. Manette.) Lucie is seventeen, and is beautiful, charming, learned, sweet, compassionate, caring, and everything under the sun. Lorry can't help but be charmed by her, and begin to care for her in a very fatherly way. When they meet, Lucie is extremely polite and extremely torn up by learning of her father's plight and her true history.After getting acquainted, the two soon journey to France, and go to a tavern run by a man named Defarge and his wife, Madame Defarge. Times are tough in France, and the peasants are desperate for revenge. Defarge leads them to Manette, and there Lucie gently calls him back to life. They all leave together, and it is happy and bittersweet.Time passes, and it is now England six years later. They are all at the trial of a French diplomat named Charles Darnay, and Britain wants to try him for plotting against them and working with France and the United States during the American Revolution. However, he soon is set free, thankfully, and Darnay immediately starts having feelings for Lucie, and she for him. He was set free by a man named Sydney Carton (my LOVE!) and Sydney has a very damaged personality. He is very smart and sweet deep down, and similar in looks to Charles, but has low self-esteem. The story leads on from here.Like Charles, however, Sydney is also DEEPLY in love with Lucie, and would do anything for her. In the end, Dr. Manette, Darnay, Lorry, Miss Pross, Sydney, and Lucie, all become very good friends, and hang out together.Both Darnay AND Sydney are in love with Lucie, as I said, but ultimately, of course, it is Darnay who wins her heart. (Poor Carton. :( ) Darnay and Lucie get married, and have children, and there the story ends. Or does it?Indeed, in France, the Revolution is heavily underway, and everybody associated with French Royalty and the Bourgeois is heavily in danger. I won't summarize too much because the French Revolution should be quite easy to understand and such, and most people reading this book will have learned about it long beforehand. Darnay is soon drawn there to save an innocent man who had helped him get back at his uncle, the Marquis, and Charles had also helped give his family's Royal assets to the peasants. However, it was misunderstood, and Charles is soon imprisoned and tried. Numerous times. The time passes, and Charles, innocent Charles, is sentenced to die. The question is, on the Guillotine in the end, just who will be on the receiving end of the blade?----------------------------------------------------------------------------------*Overall, I REALLY DID like Sydney Carton the best out of all of the characters. And I don't care what ANYBODY says, in the end, he should have ended up marrying Lucie, and taken care of her and her and Darnay's children for the rest of their lives, and had children of his own with her. It was so beautiful, and my heart bled for him. I DO like Charles and Charles/Lucie, but I honestly think that Carton deserved her far more. I CRIED at the end when he died! I am seriously in love with Sydney Carton. The book made him seem so bad in the beginning, but that quickly changed right away for me! And after we had finished the book, our teacher had us watch the movie version (Masterpiece Theatre, 1989 edition), and Sydney was just ADORABLE in the movie! :) Overall the movie was pretty horrible in terms of casting (Lucie is supposed to have BLONDE hair and BLUE EYES PEOPLE!) and acting and everything in general, Sydney was AMAZING! James Wilby was the EMBODIMENT of Sydney's character and what I pictured while reading, and just PERFECT. :) AND yes, I'm not going to lie, but James Wilby was REALLYYYYYYYYY cute as Sydney, too. :) &lt;3 &lt;3 He was simply gorgeous! Anyway, back to the book review:However, I do have to admit that I guessed the ending in the second book. It really was quite predictable, and I knew Carton would ultimately take Darnay's place.I did also like Lucie and Lorry and Charles and Dr. Manette and Miss Pross, but I did hate Madame Defarge with a passion. Learning her backstory really didn't change my opinion, but it ultimately helped me to perhaps understand why she acted like she did, and ultimately did what she did.In terms of writing, yes, there is no question that the book IS well written, but Charles Dickens sometimes REALLY needed to learn when to stop writing. Some descriptions (like in book three describing the peasants setting fire to the Marquis's house) went on for FAR too long for my patience! That cost it a lot of stars, as well as the fact that he felt the blatant need to repeat a LOT. Also, sometimes his writing WAS pretty bad in some parts......Also, overall the plot really was METICULOUSLY developed and such, and very tight, but once again, sometimes it was just too slow.In the end, however, this book is certainly NOT one of my favorites, but for what it was, it was OK for a school-required book! It certainly had a mix of both good and bad in the book, and I am not in a hurry to read it again anytime soon, but it's way better than Frankenstein!But if you ask me, Les Miserables is a MUCH better read if you are looking for things on the French Revolution and such! :) (JUST saw the musical last night with school--------AMAZING! :) )Here is the movie version that we watched: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005N5RH/ref=pd_lpo_k2_dp_sr_3?pf_rd_p=486539851&pf;_rd_s=lpo-top-stripe-1&pf;_rd_t=201&pf;_rd_i=B000UYN9OA&pf;_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf;_rd_r=0WEMXCZH1X25ZVVTR5KB"},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"One of the great mysteries of 19th century literature is how this book got this name. A subtitle might help. Yes, certainly, for the most part, the action in this book takes place in either London or Paris and the contrast between English mercantile society and the French Reign of Terror could not be more extreme. It is a story of contrasts on many levels, it is a tale of marvelous coincidence and psychological insight. The biggest coincidence is the physical resemblance between the noble Charles Darney and the self destructive Sidney Carton. Do you see the contrast? More contrasts? The abusive French aristocracy...Oh, the Evermonds are despicable to the nth degree, and Madame Defarge of the Jacquerie (peasantry)--who bears the biggest grudge in two centuries of literature. Dickens has done an excellent job of showing people from all walks of life interacting, of painting the landscape of the times and telling a very gripping story. As for psychologically insights, consider Sidney Carton...a case study in depression as Dr. Manette exemplifies PTSD. I have seen the video, listened to the tape and read the book. The tape is especially noteworthy as Dickens frequently read his work to make sure he got the rhythms of speech just so. Well, I promised to offer a subtitle. It's somewhat unweildy but here goes: How about-The Reign of Terror, Temple Bar and Lucy in the sky with Diamonds?"},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"i didn't like this book and i don't really know why. i guess it's just the mood i was in, it's too somber for my tastes."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"A Tale of Two Cities by Charles DickensThis is one of Charles Dickens' greatest and darkest novels.

This book is perfect for readers who enjoy a writer who uses twenty words when one will do!"},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"A Tale of Two Cities, by Charles Dickens, is a highly interesting and griping novel from start to finish. Right from page one, Dickens manages to capture the reader's attention by placing one of the main characters in a dark and damp environment, in the middle of a cold and wet night, during the time of the American Revolution, where he receives a mysterious message, \\"recalled to life,\\" which makes absolutely no sense to the reader. This, as do many other vague ideas presented by Dickens's in the novel, become clear as the novel progresses, and come together to create an interesting and captivating story.Dickens manages to vividly capture the French Revolution in this novel. Scenes from his novel, such as the wine cask episode, demonstrates how completely impoverished the French peasantry is, by showing just how desperate they are to get even a drop of the spilled wine. The aristocracy's complete disregard for the peasantry is shown when Monsignor the Marquis runs over and kills a peasant child, and pays for it as if it were a broken pot; something that could be replaced and of no particular sentimental value. And finally, the revolutionary's unquenchable thirst for blood is shown through their insane and wild dances, such as the Carmagnole. The depth to which Dickens goes into this historical event, complimented by his outstanding use of imagery, makes it seems as if the reader is actually there during the time of the Revolution.The unforgettable characters of this novel only add to its great reputation. The sinister Madame Defarge, who, when she was young, was wronged by an aristocrat, now has a thirst for blood that can only be quenched when every last aristocrat has met their end at the guillotine, and seems to embody the revolution itself. And, the heroic Sydney Carton, who lived his life as a wanderer, with no set purpose in life, until he met the beautiful and charming Lucie Manette, which eventually made him give his life for her, by sacrificing himself in place of her husband, ending his life with the unforgettable words: \\"If is a far, far better thing that I do, than I have ever done; it is a far, far better rest that I go to, than I have ever known.\\"Though at first, it seems that there are two individual stories going on in the novel, one taking place in England, the other France, Dickens brings them together at the end of the novel to create an amazing and truly memorable finale to one of the best novels ever written, and must be read by anyone who can access the book."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"Many consider Charles Dickens to be one of the greatest writers of all time; a master of tone, character, and humor. A Tale of Two Cities is a clear example of Dickens' mastery of writing, capturing the reader from the beginning with its famous paradox: \\"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times...\\". An intricate plot and interesting characters weave together to create a suspenseful recounting of the French Revolution through the eyes of a repentant aristocrat and his family. Throughout the book, Dickens' uses his remarkable ability to employ meaningful repetition, vivid imagery, and a variety of other literary techniques to capture the reader's attention and create a story that keeps the reader wishing for more.A Tale of Two Cities is a story of secrets, family, love, and renewal. Taking place during one of the most violent and bloody revolutions in history, Dickens shows readers the madness of late 1700's Fance, and teaches them to despise both the cruel nobles and bloodthirsty revolutionaries. Engaging characters such as the ruthless Madame Defarge, despondent Carton, and mysterious pasted Dr. Manette leave a lasting impression on the reader's mind due to Dickens' skill at creating memorable, lasting characters.However, this story is much more than just an interesting read; it teaches valuable lessons on the nature of humanity and resurrection. Dickens warns that when humanity is crushed \\"out of shape once more, under similar hammers ... it will twist itself into the same tortured forms\\". Readers see this point all too well as the peasants they once sympathized with rose up from the oppressed only to become the oppressors, initiating a new age of violence and struggle. Yet in the end, Dickens ends memorably on a tragic yet hopeful note, reminding the reader that with sacrifices, there is always a chance of renewal, when \\"the evil of this time and of the previous time of which this is the natural birth, gradually mak[e] expiation for itself and wea[r] out\\".Still, the book is not perfect. At times the \\"coincidences\\" made the story seem unbelievable. Similarly, some of the characters seemed unreal due to their \\"perfect\\" qualities; for example Lucie was depicted with no faults, and the nobles often evil to the point of incredulity. And truthfully, the beginning of the book seemed confusing, \\"dragged\\"; some passages were confusing and boring, seeming to have too much description. But overall, A Tale of Two Cities stands as a strong depiction of Charles Dickens' literary genius and is definitely worth reading for anyone looking for a good novel with engaging characters and thought-provoking themes."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"The novel, A Tale of Two Cities, by Charles Dickens represents the highest caliber of English literature. The tumult and turbulence of the French Revolution serves as a backdrop for the dramatic story that slowly develops between Dickens' cast of unforgettable characters. From its famous opening, to its tragic yet satisfying conclusion, A Tale of Two Cities captivates the reader. Starting with Mr. Lorry's enigmatic message \\"recalled to life,\\" the novel develops tension and mystery, forcing the reader to anxiously turn its pages. From then on the story builds to the frenzy and chaos of the French revolution, becoming more and more intense and intriguing as the story progresses. Throughout the novel Dickens portrays the two opposing sides of the revolution through his use of two classic characters. Dickens depicts the fury and brutality of the revolutionaries through the use of the notorious Madame Defarge. Dickens similarly depicts the gluttony and greed of the aristocrats through the use of the self-indulgent Marquis. Dickens creates for the reader a horrifying image of the French Revolution that is both vividly detailed and tremendously fascinating.However the driving force behind this novel comes from Dickens' memorable cast of characters. From the enigmatic Sydney Carton, to the kind and generous Lucie Manette, Dickens' characters serve to create a fascinating dynamic. Dickens' story develops with the use of two slowly converging parallel plot lines. On one end the reader witnesses Madame and Monsieur Defarge battling on the front lines of the revolution. Meanwhile, the French revolution slowly converges with the story of the Manettes, Sydney Carton and Charles Darnay, resulting in a dramatic conclusion. With this assemblage of characters, Dickens' succeeds in turning a historical account of the French revolution into an engrossing and dramatic tale. Throughout the entirety of this novel Dickens' composes a fascinating plot for any avid reader to feverishly enjoy. Anyone who appreciates reading must discover this fantastic piece of literature."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"A Tale of Two Cities, by Charles Dickens, contains endless motifs, literary devices, dynamic characters, and more. Dickens' use of connotative language creates a tone and atmosphere throughout the entire book that keeps the reader hooked. The beginning of the story starts out slow, but Dickens' careful use of foreshadowing hints to many dark events in the near future. As a light read, this book appears lengthy and dull. However, a deeper look into the story reveals layers upon layers of literary devices, each symbolizing and representing a different aspect of the book and the French Revolution. The vast amount of knowledge A Tale of Two Cities contains about the Revolution is astounding. Due to the fact that the book came out around 150 years ago, some of the language seems hard to understand, but still worth reading. A Tale of Two Cities holds exceptionally round and developed characters such as Sydney Carton. He ties the entire plot together and helps provide a shocking ending that leaves readers amazed. Lucie Manette and Charles Darnay also contribute to the plot and make the story a memorable one. Through the writing of this book, Charles Dickens creates a masterpiece that withstands the test of time. The various literary tools he uses in his writing all combine to make this book excellent."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"People often call A Tale of Two Cities, by Charles Dickens, \\"a masterpiece\\" and \\"a classic.\\" These titles are well-deserved. With both a captivating plot and numerous underlining details, this novel quenches the thirsts of a large variety of readers. A truly intriguing novel, it includes romance, tragedy, rebellion, passion, and power.Dickens captures the storyline between two cities, Paris and London, with his dynamic characters. Each of the characters undergoes a different experience which distinguishes them. There is Lucie Manette, the kind and sympathetic woman who is her father's last hope. Sydney Carton, the drunk and foolish commoner who hopes to resurrect himself and rectify his terrible decisions. And the sinister woman, Madame Defarge, who thrives off of fear and is associated with darkness. Every character adds a slightly different twist to the novel which makes it truly unique.The captivating plot consists of numerous twists and turns which provide a significant impact on the reader. At first, the aristocracy has absolute power. Aristocrats such as Old Foulon, who once insisted that the peasants eat grass, feel no sympathy towards the peasants. The peasants, dejected and deprived, live on the streets much like savages. Dickens depicts this image with the wine scene in which wine spills upon the ground and peasants immediately gather to drink the dirty treasure. Suddenly, the plot turns in on itself and the Storming of the Bastille occurs. The peasants gain power and they stop at nothing. Dickens, who favors the peasants at first, depicts the peasants as merciless savages. Dickens successfully incorporates his characters into this plot and brings the story to life.Analyzing this text can prove to be worth it since Dickens has embedded many literary devices. These include numerous themes, symbols, tones, moods, metaphors, dualities, and motifs. An example is the footsteps motif which provides a more in-depth description of the growth of the French Revolution. With the many hidden devices, A Tale of Two Cities offers both an entertaining and educational read.A Tale of Two Cities can satisfy the needs of a diverse variety of readers. It can be read just based upon the captivating plot or it can be read to fulfill a more educational purpose. Regardless of who reads it, this book leaves a lasting impression. It is definitely recommended for readers of all styles."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"Charles Dickens creates a captivating story about the French Revolution in the novel A Tale of Two Cities. Dickens uses numerous literary devices including mood, foreshadowing, and imagery to create a novel that captures readers from the beginning. The dynamic characters featured in the story, including Madame Defarge and Sydney Carton, help create a unique and exciting novel for that time period. Dickens creatively shows the horrors and tragedies of the French Revolution, while also describing the viciousness of the revolutionaries. The insightful quotes taken from this book prove that this is a timeless classic. The theme of resurrection and exciting twists to the plot up until the very end give readers a wonderful book to enjoy. What can be considered one of the highlights of the story, the vivid imagery Dickens successfully uses to develop mood, foreshadowing, and other literary devices and concepts make A Tale of Two Cities even more interesting. This deep novel takes much analysis to understand, but it is a worthwhile and important book that should be read."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"Charles Dickens' book, A Tale of Two Cities, displays qualities of a recommendable novel through the intriguing plot, beautiful descriptions, and shocking twists it displays.In A Tale of Two Cities, a intriguing plot uncovers itself at the start of 1775. In a synopsis, France and England struggle with thieves and chaos as Lucie discovers her father, in jail for eighteen years. Eventually, in 1781, Lucie marries Darnay, an aristocrat who renounces his title and money after the injustice he sees his ancestors commit on the poor. In an attempt to save his housekeeper from the blood-thirsty revolutionaries, Darnay returns only to tangle himself in a trial because of his aristocratic past. As the story flows, the revolutionaries condemn Darnay to death after an old letter, with the author of Lucie's father, reveals the cruelty of Darnay's ancestors to a peasant family. Carton, a man who too loves Lucie, breaks into prison and exchanges places with Darnay to save him. Doing so, Carton, who seemingly owns a wasteful life, gives meaning to his life through his death on the guillotine for Darnay and Lucie. Carton's most famous quote, \\"It is a far, far better thing that I do, than I have ever done; it is a far, far better rest that I go to than I have ever known,\\" thus comes about at the end of the novel to explain Carton's happiness and resurrection, or rebirth, through his death (Dickens 386).Throughout the book, descriptions fill themselves with immense amounts of detail. Examples of these descriptions shine in the Wine Shop chapter and at the Carmagnole, a insane revolutionary dance, helps characterize the barbaric revolutionaries and allows the reader to feel as if he/she watches a movie. For example, in the Wine Shop this portion of a symbolic description displays itself: \\"The wine was red wine, and had stained the ground of the narrow street in the suburb of Saint Antoine, in Paris, where it was spilled. It had stained many hands, too, and many faces, and many naked feet, and many wooden shoes\\" (Dickens 33). The Carmagnole too displays the Dickens' deep descriptions: \\"They danced to the popular Revolution song, keeping a ferocious time that was like a gnashing of teeth in unison. [...] as they filled the place, and stopped to dance about Lucie, some ghastly apparition of a dance-figure gone raving mad arose among them. They advanced, retreated, struck at one another's hands, clutched at one another's heads, spun round alone, caught one another and spun round in pairs, until many of them dropped,\\" (Dickens 288).Finally, Dickens' twists adds excitement to the book since these twists and turns of the novel connect at the trial and shock the reader. Finding out that Madame Defarge's psychotic and angry nature, as a revolutionary leader, fuels itself through Darnay's ancestor's injustice, shocks the reader. This shock comes about since this reveals the unlikely connection between the Manettes, who include Darnay and Lucie, and the Defarges. Another exciting shock finds its way to the reader when Carton heroically gives his life for Darnay and Lucie. These few moments exemplify the many other stunning twists and turns the novel offers. Thus, Dickens use of varying and deep characters, such as the heroic Carton, angel-like Lucie and the monstrous Madame Defarge, allows further entertainment and excitement to the story.A Tale of Two Cities, as a whole, allows a deeper sense of the revolution, for all readers, through the following of both the barbaric peasantry and the fearful aristocracy. Nonetheless, this brilliant novel satisfies analytical readers through the vast amounts of symbols, themes and literary devices.Therefore, through the intriguing plot, beautiful descriptions, and shocking twists, Dickens forms A Tale of Two Cities into a desirable book that deserves a complete five out of five stars."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"This book can be incredible. Charles Dickens weaves an intricate web of suspense, blood, brutality, and vivid imagery to create this masterful novel. Set in London and Paris, the book narrates the story of a family that is caught within the heart of the French Revolution, and describes the constant struggle of the bloodthirsty peasantry as they fight for their rights. Dickens is a master story-teller, and makes his plot and characters come alive with his influential tone, which often provides his insight into the matters at hand, and occasional sarcasm. He toys with the emotions of his readers, and makes them connect with the novel during scenes like that of Sydney Carton's speech, the Carmagnole, and the wine cask. His tone allows the reader to experience the dark and stormy mood of the French Revolution, which is recreated in a realistic and convincing manner. There are a few small annoyances through the book, such as the tiring stereotype of Lucie Manette as a symbol of purity and innocence, and the number of questionable coincidences that tie up the plot near the resolution of the book. However, they can be waived rather as Dickens's brilliance rather than his flaws, since they reflect the writing style of the time.This novel is highly recommended to all age groups. Every reader can find himself or herself in one of the characters, may it be the insolent-turned-heroic Sydney Carton, or the ever-dignified Charles Darnay, the quiet, humble Doctor, the ever-fiery Ms. Pross, or the charming, sweet Lucie. With a flourish, Dickens ends a complex novel that will take a reader on a journey through the chaos of the French Revolution."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"The classic novel A Tale of Two Cities by Charles Dickens personifies the historical significance of the French Revolution through a beautifully orchestrated story about love and resurrection. The author provides an in-depth narration of the French Revolution and its affect on the peasantry and the aristocracy of France during this time period. Along with the heavy historical background Dickens incorporates into his novel, he also develops dynamic, unforgettable characters such as the brave Sydney Carton, and coalesces his artistic literary elements into the unique plot-line.Without a thorough understanding of the French revolution, one cannot understand the events in this book quite well. To absorb the art of Dickens's writing, an in-depth understanding of the causes and important events of this revolution must be known.The vivid characters of this novel pose as unique individuals who suffer from their wretched pasts. These diverse characters entangle with one and another to create a marvelous plot-line. The two cities mentioned refer to London and Paris and how \\"it was the best of times, it was the worst of times\\". The story centers around the love of the tender Lucie Manette and the resilient Charles Darnay. As the novel progresses though, Dickens entangles this love story into a bloodthirsty feud amongst the enraged peasantry and the snobbish aristocracy. The heroic, yet sardonic Sydney Carton drives the story line further into the depths of the cruel French Revolution and shines as one of Dickens's most memorable characters. The dense story-line, bears a great deal of difficulty towards one's understanding of the novel though. Understanding the characters and fine details of this master piece takes a great deal of time, and patience.The thick vines of Dickens's masterful literary devices which run throughout this story pose as the roots to this novel. Several motifs, dualities, and types of imagery constantly embellish the novel. These literary elements although difficult to understand, make this novel a true classic.It takes a quite a few chapters for the novel to make sense and even start sparking interest. At times, Dicken's writing seems embellished with too much description and repetitive. Although this makes the novel hard to read, once the reader progresses farther into the book, the pace begins to pick up. The effort required in encrypting Dickens's gaudy style of writing may seem like too much at first, but the classic elegance of these story-line balances out this setback. Despite the minor setbacks of the dense language, this highly recommended classic prevails as a masterful work of art which leaves a mark on all who read it."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"As a high school curriculum, my teacher required my class to read A Tale of Two Cities. This book caught my attention starting from the opening sentence \\"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times\\" and kept me equally engaged till the last sentence \\"It is a far, far better thing that I do, than I have ever done; it is a far, far better rest that I go to than I have ever known.\\" Although, in the beginning, I found the book's language challenging that required me to read some passages more than once to draw essence, but after few chapters I fell in love with the book. This book contains multiple heart throbbing events that left me awestruck, such as the tragic peasants' sufferings, fierce mob scenes; brutality at guillotine etc. Dickens infuses the story with a variety of emotions, ranging from love to hatred, sacrifice to selfishness, kindness to brutality, nurturing to killing, joy to tragedy, generosity to greed, as well as romance and suspense. Dickens fully makes use of several literary devices, such as allusions and imageries to embellish the script. Not only that I enjoyed the book's fictitious story, but also the book enhanced my knowledge of the history related to French Revolution and England. In the book, Dickens exhibits the social and political condition of 18th century England and France; the story of A Tale of Two Cities takes place in two major cities of these countries, London and Paris. In particular, Sydney Carton, the most complex and dynamic character of the novel, touched me the most. He emerges from a weak and sensual character, initially described as a \\"man of good abilities and good emotions, incapable of their directed exercise, incapable of his own help and his own happiness, sensible of the blight on him, and resigning himself to let it eat him away\\" to a powerful character capable of making the ultimate sacrifice by giving up his life for the woman he loves. Dickens' illustration of Carton's death scene; his recital of the words \\"I am the Resurrection and the Life, saith the Lord: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die, \\"and the words \\"Twenty-three\\" impact me the most, causing me to shed few tears. The book possesses many other attractions such as duality of characters. Specifically, the duality of Lucie Manette and Madame Defarge permeates throughout the novel. Dickens portrays Lucie as a nurturing character who \\"ever busily [winds] the golden thread that bound them all together, weaving the service of her happy influence through the tissue of all their lives.\\" In contrast, Dickens describes Madame Defarge as a \\"ruthless woman, a strong and fearless character, of shrewd sense\\" who \\"was absolutely without pity.\\" A Tale of Two Cities provides both education and entertainment; I highly recommend this book to any avid reader who seeks a book filled with humor, emotions, romance, and tragedy."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"Being an avid Dickens fan means that I have become well-read in Dickens' works. I find that his seemingly most famous works - Olive Twist and Tale of Two Cities - are also some of my least favorite of his. Oliver Twist is a traditional Dicken's book, but Tale of Two Cities attempts to be historical. While most of his works take about a hundred pages to really get into, I found that Tale of Two Cities is less gripping than his other works, perhaps stifled by being accurate more than being descriptive. David Copperfield, Nicholas Nickleby, Chuzzlewit etc. have the distinctive elements of a Dickens novel. The humorous names, the humorous personalities and the wandering story-line because his characters are wandering people, all make a Dickens novel what we have come to expect. Personally, I think that you can gauge Dickens' writing style with Nicholas Nickleby, Oliver Twist and David Copperfield, but with Tale of Two Cities, it sounds like Dickens, but doesn't really have his passionate feel. Don't judge this author by this book alone."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"I have enjoyed this book.It was a good purchase and would recommend it to anyone.

The lettering is larger and easier to read then the schools old copy as well."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"Tale of Two Cities by Charles Dickens is a classic literature book set in the time of the French revolution. If I had to describe the book in a couple words I would label it as an \\"old-English soap-opera\\". I enjoyed the book very much but I feel unless you are a strong reader or good with old English the book would be boring and difficult to understand. Personally, I sometimes had to look up what was going on in the book online to follow along. There are a couple main and supporting main characters and the book switches between the point of view of the various characters telling the story from all sides. The book is known for its famous opening line \\"It was the best of times. It was the worst of times...\\" That line and the couple after hint to the plot/theme of the story. In the opening pages a mood is set, Dickens writes of a damp, dreary, cold, dark, night. Dickens writes in a very, how would you say, hinting way. If you look closely and pay attention you can catch little details that clue you into something that will be revealed later on. All in all the book was a good read, it was slow to start but picks up as you get father into the book."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"The book came just as advertised. It was delivered on time. The Tale of Two Cities is a great read. My son is reading it for Language Arts class and it has come in very handy because he can high-lite passages or place notes down the side."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"Charles Dickens is a master story-teller. Historians have classified this as his \\"least Dickensian\\" novel, and I think anyone who is familiar with his work would agree. There are very few light-hearted moments, and his symbolism comes across as rather heavy-handed. Still, he had reasons for all of this, and I think that this book should be evaluated in its own right, rather than in comparison to his other works.Dickens presents a world gone mad. There is no justice for the poor. They are abused and ill-treated by the aristocracy. When they finally have their revenge, they are like wild animals, and are completely consumed with their lust for blood.In the midst of all this is a family that just wants to survive, and a man who is secretly in love. He pledges that he would do anything to see his love happy, and in the end, keeps his promise.This is a beautiful story about the power of love, redemption, and the human spirit. Every word and every action has meaning. This is not a novel to be rushed; it is one to be savored and cherished."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"It's always been a mission of mine to re-read this one day, and now after many false starts I finally have. What puts me off \\"A Tale of Two Cities\\" are the opening chapters. Social order and the hierarchy of the day is explained beautifully but to the point of exhaustion. There is little to no focus on characters (unlike in my favorite Dickens novel, \\"Great Expectations\\") and it feels like Dickens is holding on to too many secrets, making it a battle to get through to the second half.But that second half is truly phenomenal. All little niggles fade away as the pieces are brought together and you find yourself taken by a true literary gem. True stories of the French Revolution, such as the raid on Bastille, are cleverly mixed in with fictional incidents. And the ending is a testament to Dickens' understanding of the capacity of mankind to do good and stand alone when all others have fallen away.I cannot say anything about this novel that haven't already been said, but out of everything I've read lately it truly affected me. Perhaps it will do the same to you."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"No more buying audio books anywhere else than on Amazon.com!

Do your best to make your english teacher spare you from reading this. Cliff Notes are even boring!"},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"A Tale of Two Cities was a great tale that was too confusing. With wonderfully developed characters, colorful setting, and interesting plot, A Tale of Two Cities had all of the makings of a great book minus clarity. Perhaps Charles Dickens was just too intelligent for most of the readers to understand his complicated dialogue and hidden metaphors. A book should be understandable without a handy dictionary and Cliff Notes.With a government that relies on the obedience of a dying class of people, France is headed for disaster. Led by the Defarge couple, the French peasants destroy all that the nobles hold sacred; their homes, their power, and their lives. Charles Darnay, a Frenchman residing in England, decides to leave his family to fight with his people, but he is considered a noble and therefore must die. When his family recieves word that Darnay will be executed, his wife, Lucie Manette, and her father, Dr. Alexandre Mannette, a former prisoner of the nobles and a heroic icon to the French, leave to free him. However, nothing can save Darnay except for his look-a-like and secret admirer of Lucie's, Syndney Carton. Carton will now take action for the first time of his life.This was truly an inspiring story of love, freedom, and war but the message of the book would have been more effective without metaphors that were so subtle and dialogue that was not explained.In the courtroom scene, when Darnay is being accused of treason, it was thought by some readers that the &quot;great blue flies&quot; were actually blue flies, not people.Also, when Carton and Barsad are sizing each other up, it is difficult to tell what they are talking about because the visualization is so unclear and mixed up with the metaphors.Although A Tale of Two Cities was thought provoking, emotional, and inspiring, a reader would need to read the book either very slowly and carefully or twice."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"Perhaps it's my lack of enthusiam for classic English literature, but I found this book dull and very unamusing. I purchased this because my English teacher wanted us to read it, and while I don't regret buying it, I highly doubt I'm going to read it again.Though, keep in mind I'm but a teenager, and not a fan of the classics. I'm sure if the classics are your thing, then you'll love this book. The included appendix and notes help out a lot."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"I chose this book to read as I recovered from surgery. I figured if there was ever a time when I would have the patience for a Victorian book that has been dubbed a classic by everyone, this was the time.I definitely needed the patience. The book begins with the famous line everybody knows, even if they don't know the source: &quot;It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.&quot; Unfortunately the book quickly mires down after that. It is not that little occurs; the book is actually full of action, side plots, etc. But it is also overfull of Victorian-era florid prose. The reader gets a full dose of adjectives, but those adjectives rarely add up to a vivid picture.Also, Dickens is a product of his times and the age-old Anglo-French rivalry is in full evidence in this book. The French people who have spent significant time in England are all good people. The French people who remained in France are uniformly evil. With one exception, the English people, be they drunkards, grave robbers or stuffy bankers are all noble at heart.However, the ending truly saves the entire book and turns my review from a pan to a rave. The ending is heartrending, beautiful, exciting, and bittersweet. The vivid imagery of people on the way to the guillotine, making their escape, or waiting to watch others be executed makes the picture leap from the page and makes the reader rip to the next page as one page comes to an end.I therefore recommend that you sit down with this book when you have large chunks of time to devote to it, don't give up on the book after the first hundred or even two hundred pages but keep reading. You will be rewarded."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"Carlton Millsap\\"Book Review of A Tale of Two Cities\\"Charles Dickens' A Tale of Two Cities is a unique piece of literature due to the widely varied opinions of its readers. Some readers have critically picked the book apart while others have gone as far as categorizing it as a great piece of literature. While I have mixed emotions towards A Tale of Two Cities, most of my thoughts fall on the critical side.Other than a few exceptions, Dickens' has failed in depicting the characters in A Tale of Two Cities. One example of Dickens' failure is Dr. Alexander Manette. Throughout this novel, Dr. Manette is a very confusing character because he drifts in and out of the shoemaker state. This shoemaker state is Dr. Manette's transformation back into the shoemaker that he was in jail. He made shoes for his daughter whom he had to leave after his imprisonment. Because of Dr. Manette's drifting in and out of the shoemaker state, the reader never gets a feel for who he really is. Another example that contributes to this confusion of Dr. Manette is the lack of background given for him as he is introduced.The best developed character in A Tale of Two Cities is Sydney Carton. Throughout the beginning of this novel, the reader sees Sydney Carton as an alcoholic who is lost and is suffering. His suffering mainly is caused by Charles Darnay because of the similarity between the two. Although Carton and Darnay may look alike, their lives have taken very different directions. Carton sees in Darnay what he could have been, and Carton feels very hopeless. Carton's life drastically changes after he meets Lucie Manette. Even though he is hurt by her decision to marry Darnay, he still loves her and is willing to do anything for her happiness. When Darnay is sentenced to the guillotine, Carton sees his opportunity to save Darnay because of their resemblance. Carton switches places with Darnay, and will be executed. As the guillotine lurks near, he doesn't have fear but happiness because he has found meaning in his life and feels proud to make the ultimate sacrifice for Lucie.The overall plot of A Tale of Two Cities is very dull and unentertaining. The beginning of the novel is very slow and confusing. Dickens begins the opening scene with Jarvis Lorry and Jerry Cruncher, as if it was the middle of the book. It is also very dark and vague and is filled with confusing dialogue. One of the most brilliantly written parts of the novel is Chapter 5, Book I. This is the first chapter that set in France in the St. Antoine District. In the chapter, barrels of wine have been spilled in the street, and the workers and their families have stopped to have fun and drink it. After the wine is finished, the people are reminded of the harsh reality of their lives and go back to work. As these people are going back to work, Dickens describes the poverty, oppression, and physical stress put upon this class of people. One of Dickens better jobs of foreshadowing is shown in this scene as a poor man named Gaspard writes, with the wine, BLOOD on the wall. This foreshadows the actual blood of the aristocracy that will eventually take the place of the wine on the street and on the people's hands and mouths. Dickens tells the reader this when he says, \\"The time was to come, when that wine too would be spilled on the street-stones, and when the stain of it would be red upon many there\\" (Dickens, 38). One aspect which significantly helped this novel was Dickens' view towards the mob and aristocracy. By taking a neutral stance, Dickens rules out the possibility of a biased novel. In this way Dickens wasn't afraid to compliment or demean either side.Although there are parts of A Tale of Two Cities which are exciting and well written, it is overall not a good read. The novel's intense vocabulary and slow plot leaves it's reader with a feeling of relief once he or she has finished it. This novel gives vague history for this time period and is not historically accurate. While some have thouroughly enjoyed A Tale of Two Cities, I would never recommend it to anyone or read it again myself."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"It takes the first two-thirds of this book to set everything in place for the rich action and powerful emotions of the last third. That is not to say that there are not a few interesting points, some entertaining action, and attractive character development early on, but most modern readers are anticipating the drama of the French Revolution, and this is a long, slow build-up. The action finally kicks off somewhere around page 200 - too late for the taste of today's bookworm.As in other Dickens novels, the young female is a weakly drawn character, not even the Agnes of David Copperfield. Why is it that we find Dickens able to create a Miss Pross or a Betsy Trotwood, but not a realistic and admirable young heroine?"},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"&quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot; is essentially good. I loved the plot. I especially enjoyed the ending, which was both sad and uplifting. This novel (originally a series) shows how good an author Dickens could have been.However, Dicken's style is really what costs him the 1.5 stars in my review. I dislike the amount of microscopic attention he pays to the most insignificant things. Luckily, for Dickens, this is not as egregious as it was in &quot;Great Expectations&quot; but its still there. I can't blame Dickens for this completely. This was basically a style forced upon him by his bosses in order to sell more newspapers. However, that fact does not mean I can just ignore it.

I first read it in English class about 7 years ago in high school. Like many other High School students, I did find it very wordy. However, I did not let that put me off from reading the book. Once I got into it, I found it to be an extremely moving story. When I finished it that first time in High School, I thought it was a very good novel, and I understood why it is considered to be a classic.However, I feel that in order to really fall in love with the story, it should be read again, outside of a classroom setting. In English classes, you have deadlines, and plenty of tasks to do in your other classes. You can't really take all the description and symbols in, you just have to get the jist of it.It wasnt until I was thoroughly bored on numerous trains across Europe that I discovered how wonderful this book can be. This book should not be sped through. Take your time, and think. After a while, you'll actually appreciate all the details, and will understand the characters better as a result."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"I must say that A Tale of Two Cities rekindled the flame for reading in my heart - but that only happened through the usage of CliffNotes. A Tale of Two Cities is a wonderfully written book that may be overlooked as boring because of its wordy and monotonous description of exposition at the beginning. After the first chapter, the story remains just as wordy but it becomes gradually more interesting. My only suggestion is to keep the CliffNotes handy - if not, at least keep your friend WEBSTER there right next to you.Once you get past the confusion with WEBSTER, the real forte of this piece is shown. Dickens is actually able to keep this story together over such a long timeframe. Dickens also gets credit for making sure that every single event in this story has a strong role to play (despite that role being written twice as complex than it really should have been).One big suggestion to any reader planning to read this book is to learn about the French Revolution or at least the Reign of Terror (an event inside the French Revolution which happens to be particularly important in this book along with our friend HISTORY BOOK). After utilizing the amazing knowledge you have on the Reign of Terror, you'll be able to make maddening connections that should please our other friend ENGLISH TEACHER.In short (and not altogether coincidentally, in closing), A Tale of Two Cities should be a worthwhile read if you can keep WEBSTER close, HISTORY BOOK closer, and ENGLISH TEACHER very, very far away (which is something you should do anyways out of general common sense)."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"I wasn't expecting to like this book at all, but I did. Like most people, I read it for school. Basically, most of a &quot;Tale of Two Cities&quot; builds up to the conclusion -- where all the many intricate pieces of the book fit together perfectly. The first 250 pages were extremely slow, and I admit I was tempted to skim through them. But DON'T. You'll miss alot of important - even if minor - things. Instead, I found reading Sparknotes on each chapter before I actually read the chapter was an excellent way to keep abreast of what was going on -- Dickens paragraphs are easy to get lost in. Overall they really helped me to get alot more out of the book.I thought the themes in the book were excellent, as well as the many symbols that Dickens puts in.If you read a &quot;Tale of Two Cities&quot; closely, there is a big payoff in the end. -- One which will leave you satisfied, and understanding why a &quot;Tale of Two Cities&quot; is truly a classic."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"I finished reading this book last week and I couldn't stop reading till 2 in the morning. This book has really inspired me a lot. The sacrifice of Sydney Carton reminded me of Jesus Christ, who gave himself up for the humanity. I think this book has really shown what Christianity is about. It's about being in a world without reason, a world where nothing sacred is left behind, and yet shining its light among the darkness. That is what Sydney Carton has shown us, that is what Jesus Christ has shown to the humanity. Sydney Carton gave himself up for three persons but Jesus did for the whole humanity. Dickens is surely one of the greatest writer in the world. When I was a kid I couldn't stop weeping while reading Oliver Twist, and Christmas Carol has also given me an inspiration in one Christmas night. I really love his work!"},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"A Tale of Two cities clearly exhibits the immense talents of its author, Charles Dickens. The storyline displays a superior understanding of word usage and grammar to create a riveting tale of suspense and wonder. I truly loved how smoothly the novel flowed, right down to its surprising conclusion. At first glance, this book may seem too long and bothersome to read, as I myself thought upon first receiving it for English. However, as I read it and got into it, i actually started to enjoy it. A superior book with a fantastic ending, sure to make any reader smile with glee!"},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"A tale of two cities represents a broad canvas that engulfs issues from social upheaval to personal tragedy to moral decency. It is the epitome if comparing and contrasting two separate entities. This book is filled with many deep undertones, and sub comparisons. It is difficult for me to truly explain the full scope of the novel, therefore I believe it would be more fitting to put the emphasis on how I personally perceived A Tale of Two cities, what I drew from the novel; however I feel partially awkward critiquing and dissecting a piece of literature so beyond me, so magical it is incomprehensible how one individual could materialize the richly intense and vivid story that has captured my mind. Immediately when the reader embarks on the journey through a tale of two cities Dickens' sets the stage for what is to come. He paints a preliminary picture of the conditions that existed in both France and England at the time. He compares the both sovereignties and their rulers. Early on one can see a literary device often used by Dickens' through the piece where he volunteers a physical trait of a character, which represents specific behavioral qualities; an example of this would be Dickens' description of the Monarchs of both countries as men with large jaws exemplifying the hollow words of both kings and their virtual interchangeability among one and other as harsh monarchs. Beneath it all A tale of Two cities is mainly about resurrection. The first Book \\"Recalled to life\\" could in fact serve as a fitting title for the entire novel. The main character Sydney Carter whose death is strikingly comparable to the death and crucifixion of Jesus Christ in more than one-way embodies resurrection. The background of the French revolution and the Social revolution occurring in England at the time is not essentially what the story is about. Furthermore the characters reaction to the above events is what Dickens captures so accurately, the human reality and emotion and sentiment is what this story embodies. The political happenings serve as a backdrop, an exterior to the suffering and all the emotion therein. All the characters, so complex so detailed, I could almost picture them in my mind. Dickens' allows the reader to paint a vivid picture of the characters. A Tale of Two Cities is an undisputed classic of monumental proportions. The climatic ending of this piece is truly heart wrenching; it is the finest example of self-sacrifice and human decency. The feeling of self fulfillment one gets from reading this book is unparalleled. The book is however very complex it requires much analysis and thought, I was forced read between the lines, cross-reference and take time to absorb the beauty of this true unparalleled classic. \\"It is a far, far better thing that I do, then I have ever done; it is a far, far better rest that I go to than I have ever known.\\" This memorable quotation ended A piece of literature that I think is the best book I have ever read, a piece of literature that contains so much human emotion- romance and tragedy, mystery and history, revolutionary atrocities and even humor. I consider myself fortunate to experience and comprehend the beauty of literature as a whole. Those who criticize, do not understand; I think that everyone could personally benefit from this book, it changes a person in a very personal way."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"the descriptions might have been written to fill us in and catch our attention, or they may have been written because Dickens was paid by the word.

Set aside some time, though..."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"Apparently, if I take the word of all the high school students out there, I was lucky that I wasn't forced to read A Tale of Two Cities during my adolescence. (I was forced to endure The Hound of the Baskervilles, which has made me hate Sherlock Holmes to this day). Anyhow, I read T2C a few years back by choice and kept getting reprimanded for taking long breaks at work because I was so wrapped up in the story. Don't resist the story because of the length (at 370 pages, it's actually pretty short) or because of Dickens' penchant for wordy sentences (you think that's tough, give Faulkner a try). Give yourself over to the story, the history, the characters, and you'll find a rewarding experience. And if you can find it, check out the Cliff Notes satire, Jump Off The Cliff Notes, which features a killer parody of T2C--and, of course, it helps if you've read the source. As an introduction to English Literature I'd reccommend T2C or The Mayor of Casterbridge, by Thomas Hardy."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"I was assigned this book for freshman english.

Dicken's portrayal of Sydney's love is one that very few writers can ever fully express in a character."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"I just finished reading this book. I thought it was incredible. Dickens has more talent in being able to paint a picture than any other author I've come across (Hemingway is close). In this masterpiece, Dickens doesn't waste a word; he brings the reader gradually up a hill of information and intrigue; then, all of a sudden, the story explodes at a thousand miles an hour, as he ties every chapter into an ending worthy of fireworks, and he leaves the reader blissfully stunned. A Tale of Two Cities is truly spectacular!!!"},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"This book is set in a time that seems far away and unlike the times that we live in.

Now, many years later, I pick up this masterpiece of subtle portraiture and marvel at Dickens' ability to take two diametrically opposed characters, have them represent the two cities of the title, London and Paris respectively, and yet make them more than mouthpieces for a melodrama set before and during the French revolution. Lorry is &quot;good&quot; incarnate; it is he who delivers a key character from the Bastille, reunites him with his daughter, and thus allows his story to foreshadow and develop the larger historical context into which it fits. It is Jarvis Lorry who introduces us to the story and its characters; but more than that, he introduces himself and his beneficence as the perfect counterpoint to the novels chief antagonist, Madame Defarge. Her name and her infamous knitting have become part of our language and lore: she epitomizes a just intent gone terribly, maliciously wrong. And for me, the second-time reader of this often neglected gem of a nineteenth-century British novel, the book's strength lies in this juxtaposition and contrast of two character portraits which reflect not only the disparities of the revolution and how revolutionary fervor can be the impetus for injustice at the very moment it seeks to bring a modicum of justice to those who have never known it, but also the disparities of human nature, and how two different histories, one English, one French, mold those two natures into a composite of all that is right and all that is wrong in humankind's desire to change society for the better. The larger story is important and must be known; the more intimate one that encompasses the art of Dickensian portraiture sticks in the mind long after the &quot;big picture&quot; has faded somewhat from view. This! novel is one we should all reread along with Crime and Punishment, Nausea, and Camus' L'Etranger."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"I recently read this book for my tenth grade English class, and was totally blown away. This is a great story, set against a very interesting period in history, the French Revolution. I admit the beginning is a little bit slow and confusing, but after reading about halfway through, I could not put this book down. The storyline is amazing, and I was very impressed by the way all the characters were linked together. The story also reminded me of my favorite movie, Casablanca. I hope that other people enjoy this book as much as I did. I reccommend it to everyone."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"It is disappointing to read such negative reviews of this book. Perhaps, when people are used to watching Mtv and reading books--if reading at all--written for those with short and shallow attention-spans, it is understandable that they may be unable to appreciate such a work as this; however, this book was not written for the Mtv generation. Not originally published as a Book, but as a series of segments (much like a soap opera or tv drama of the pre-tv time), one must understand that each chapter was created to captivate and entertain a reader with an imaginary world that could only be created on a strong foundation of detailed description. Are the streets and trees and people and smells and sounds and hopes and fears in our lives trivial and &quot;boring?&quot; No, these are the materials of our world, today... In the days before television, it was necessary to describe in great detail the rain, the earth, the dark walls and the rough cobble stones to give the reader a feel for the world in which the characters were working through their lives. The 'boring&quot; details create the foundation of the book, give context to the individuals that many a thoughtful reader has grown to care for at each turn of the page. This book is an exciting story set in one of the most exciting times of world history. Far from being boring, it is thought-provoking, heart-breaking, and elevating. Not hard to read, but hard to put down. I only hope the negative reviews will not be heeded and that the book will be allowed to stand on its own very strong merits."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"Dickens has written a beautiful tale about the human condition, in both its glory and its downfall. It is a quiet masterpiece that describes the things that people will do for love - for love of people, of country, of family, of themselves, and most especially for love of those who never know how much we love them until it is too late. I cried when I read the ending, a juxtaposition of beauty and of madness. I was both shocked by how horrible mankind can be in his need for vengeance, but at the same time amazed at the fortitude and generosity that can be instilled in an individual by devotion to something greater. A classic of timeless truths."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"I read this book my Senior year in high school. It takes about 100 pages to really get into the book but once your there you can not put it down. Dickens has an amazing way of puttting everyone together.

This will not be my last Dicken's book."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"Mr Charles Dickens is an exquisite author, whose works live on to this very day. A Tale of Two Cities is a historical novel of the French Revolution. The book is cleverly written using dynamic characters, incredible events, and unique overviews of the French Revolution. Though a great deal of the book is fictatious the novel holds true every historical event. The novel is so cleverly written you cant help but wonder &quot; Did it really happen that way?&quot;. A Tale of Two Cities tells the story of imaginative love, horrific death, and heroic courage.

We aren't robots. What appalls me however, is how often I hear many young people and adults for that matter, using the word boring when reviewing a book. I am so grateful that my parents didn't allow me to use that word without a reprimand. My mother, a voracious reader,always told me &quot;David, if you're bored your're boring&quot;. I always got on the defensive when told this. As I grew older I began to understand what she meant. On a planet with so many books to read and so many ways of looking at what the books are saying, how can anyone ever be bored?

As this book is not required reading at my High School I was forced to read on my own purly for the love of great literature. Dickens mannaged to elegantly depict the French Revolution with such style as to leave one speechless at the end. I am of the opnion that the reasson so many people have found this work either boring or complicated is becuse they have not taken the time to reasearch the subject further to find out for themselfs what exactly Dickens was talking about. I would be glad to recomend this book to anyone I meet on the streets and although only a Sophomore am disheartened at the many negative response it has recived."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"Dickens' usage of strong and sometimes graphic descriptions in A Tale of Two Cities added to the plot and enhanced the themes of his work. Graphic descriptions utilize symbolism, imagery, and details to express the intensity or severity of a situation. Often, simple words can be combined which have an effect that leaves the reader speechless and awestruck. Well-known authors possess a linguistic ear, and the ability to place graphic descriptions at the correct moments to emphasize key conflicts in the plot. In these passages, Dickens masterfully employed literary techniques such as foreshadowing and symbolism. Three strong and graphic descriptions in particular contributed to the effectiveness of the novel as evidenced by their reinforcement of certain themes present in the novel. &quot;Some men kneeled down, made scoops of their two hands joined, and sipped, or tried to help women, who bent over their shoulders, to sip, before the wine had all run out between their fingers. Others, men and women, dipped in the puddles with little mugs of mutilated earthenware, or even with handkerchiefs from the women's heads, which were squeezed dry into infants' mouths; others made small mud embankments, to stem the wine as it ran; others, directed by lookers-on up at high windows, darted here and there, to cut off little streams of wine that started away in new directions; others devoted themselves to the sodden and lee-dyed pieces of the cask, licking, and even champing the moister wine-rotted fragments with eager relish. There was no drainage to carry off the wine, and not only did it all get taken up, but so much mud got taken up along with it, that there might have been a scavenger in the street, if anybody acquainted with it could have believed in such a miraculous presence.&quot; (pgs. 59-60) This powerful description in &quot;The Wine-Shop&quot; foreshadowed an event and also symbolized a key theme in the novel. This scene effectively portrayed the misery and deprivation of the French peasants. The wine spillage had a double meaning. It showed that the people could not function any longer in the deprived state they were subjected to live in. Also, it foreshadowed the inevitable revolution which would attempt to correct the sins and malignancies of the aristocratic ruling class by publicly exterminating them in the streets. The color of the wine smeared across the eager peasants' faces represented their bloodthirsty, implacable pursuit of every aristocrat under whom they had suffered. This theme was also foreshadowed by the actions of a jest outside of the Defarge wine shop, &quot;...one tall joker... scrawled upon a wall with his finger dipped in muddy wine-lees - BLOOD.&quot; (pg. 61) Dickens' usage of highly descriptive, powerful words, and his masterful usage of symbolism, helped delineate this theme and set the tone for the upcoming events. &quot;With a wild rattle and clatter, and an inhuman abandonment of consideration not easy to be understood in these days, the carriage dashed through streets and swept round corners, with women screaming before it, and men clutching each other and clutching children out of its way. At last, swooping at a street corner by a fountain, one of its wheels came to a sickening little jolt, and there was a loud cry from a number of voices, and the horses reared and plunged. ...the carriage probably would not have stopped; carriages were often known to drive on, and leave their wounded behind, and why not?&quot; (pg. 140-141) This tragic death of a young boy in &quot;Monseigneur In Town&quot; complimented the outrageous attitudes and selfish tendencies of the noblemen, further exposing their evils. This grossly repugnant lack of remorse, and lack of regard for human life fueled the mounting anger in the peasants. The lords, such as the Marquis, did not consider the common people to be human beings. He was more concerned for his expensive horses than for the life of a common child. The attitude of the aristocrats was summarized in the Marquis' comments addressing the crowd after the incident. &quot;You dogs! I would ride over any of you very willingly, and exterminate you from the earth.&quot; (pg. 142) It was this blatant disregard for human life and attitude of supremacy which enraged the peasant class and drove them to revolt. The only pacification came when the last of the so-called \`elite' were nullified. &quot;I see the lives for which I lay down my life, peaceful, useful, prosperous and happy... I see that I hold a sanctuary in their hearts and in the hearts of their descendants, generations hence. It is a far, far better thing that I do, than I have ever done; it is a far, far better rest that I go to than I have ever known.&quot; (pg. 404) These heartfelt words Carton spoke just before his beheading in &quot;The Footsteps Die Out For Ever&quot; emphasized the theme of love and brought out one of the main character's true feelings eloquently. Throughout the novel, although Carton's passion for Lucie never drove him to extremes, this ultimate sacrifice truly demonstrated the loyalty and love he felt towards her. By sacrificing himself, Carton completed one of the themes, \`Recalled to Life.' The Darnay family, although indebted to Carton forever, had now closed a chapter in their lives. Charles and Lucie went on to continue cherishing their family, unplagued by the past of Mr. Darnay. Carton's act provoked admiration for his complacent heroism. This true expression of love provided for a peaceful close of many ongoing themes in the book. The chosen passages represented the feelings of the peasants, aristocrats, and Sydney Carton, as well as illustrated key themes in the novel. The spillage of the wine symbolized the blood-thirsty, famine stricken motives for revolution held by the demeaned peasants. The remorseless, immoral destruction of the child in the village depicted the opinions held by the aristocrats of their inferiors. The love Carton experienced was expressed magnificently in the compassionate words he conveyed just minutes before his death. All of these passages contributed to the effectiveness of the novel by their use of symbolism, foreshadowing, and elaborate descriptions."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"I first read this book over fifteen years ago and it says something about the potency of the story that I (who am usually bad at remembering names) can still rattle off the characters' names -- Sidney Carton, Doctor and Lucy Mannette, Charles Darnay, Madame DeFarge ... I began reading the book sitting outside on a hot summer day, but was soon actually feeling cold as I was drawn into the freezing rain and mud of the openning scene on the Dover Mail coach. This book has it all: romance and tragedy, mystery and history, revolutionary atrocities and courtroom drama, not to mention both openning and closing lines which are unforgettable and famous (It was the best of times, it was the worst of times ...). It's a book that truly transports you to another time, one of history's most terrible and frightening, as well as one of its most idealistic and noble. A word to all those kids who had to read it for school and gave it bad reviews: there is something about having to ! read a book for school that makes you hate it. Don't let that throw you. Read it again ten years from now, after you've had a chance to experience life (both the good and bad stuff) a bit more, after you've learned a bit more history so you can understand all the book's allusions, and when you (and this time not your teacher) are really in the mood to read, and you'll see why this book is considered one of the truly great classics."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"The pages are very choppy and uneven.

It's powerful and mindblowing, and made me stay up till midnight on a schoolnight just to finish it, when I had to wake up at five o'clock -- and I already knew the ending. It's that good.The characters are real and incredible; Dr. Manette is a doting father and strong person (the scene in which he tries to begin shoemaking again directly after Darnay's second imprisonment is miserable to read about, and sad in its own way), Lucie Manette is a courageous and strong person too, though not the focal point of the book, Charles Darnay, while not super-developed, is also realistic. But the character that truly makes this book a masterpiece is Sydney Carton. Melancholy, a drunk, almost friendless, in love with a woman whom he wants to be rid of him, and enigmatic, he is a fascinating and tragic person. Reading the scenes of him strolling around the streets the night before Darnay's to-be execution, brooding and silent, I wondered why they had been put in, but thinking back on it I know. It was essential to his character and the plot, like Jesus in the Garden of Gethsemane, preparing quietly and almost sadly, but with a fierce inner joy as well.The ending almost made me cry, it was that powerful.

If you are symbolism type of person and you find all the symbolism (although some of it is shoved in your face) it is very interesting (&quot;cool&quot; is the perfect word).Do not be put off by the first chapters, they're written to be cryptic. Keep ploughing away, because the story is fabulous when it is all tied together, and it has a really nice ending. Sob.

This novel does an explicit job of foreshadowing and portraying the French Revolution in the eyes of many different people.

For example, when Mrs. Defarge remained almost invisible, her stitching revealed a lot about who she was and what her plans were. This brought irony to the plot. I also enjoyed the symbolism throughout the story. It was thought provoking. When I read the story for the first time, I thought some situations were unnecessary and were dragged on, but as I furthered into the book, every detail that previously occurred started to make sense. It is amazing that an author could make all of these details have parallels and with so much precision. I also liked how he formed the characters. Many of the characters within the novel were clearly described for a good reason. Most of them had one other character that they paralleled with. It is not easy to develop characters that are similar to one another, yet also opposite.

The opening and closing lines are some of the most famous in all of literature and while other reviewers have commented on the slow start of the story (which I do agree), the last two-thirds move at breakneck speed. Other reviewers have also commented on the length of the descriptive prose but this is one of the most beautiful parts of the story. The plot itself could have been easily condensed but then it becomes nothing more than a television show. It is by the words that the author employs that makes the reader become part of the story, so much so that you can see the streets and feel the wind cutting through your bones.While the main female character (Lucie Manette) is rather a cardboard cut-out of an idealized Victorian woman, the other female lead Madame Defarge is a study of bitterness. Her cruelty seems to know no bounds until we find out the reason for her feelings, then it is easy to understand and in a way sympathize. The male characters of Dr. Manette and Sydney Carton are extremely well done, the very embodiment of human frailty while Charles Darnay remains something of a female version of Lucie, almost too good to be true.I would recommend this book to all readers and hope that they can enjoy the prose as it was meant to be enjoyed, long before the 5 second sound bite and the 30 minute sitcom conditioned us to expect immediate gratification."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"Although some may find the beginning of A Tale of Two Cities rather dull, it is my humble opinion that if you take the time to appreciate the genius Dickens infused into every sentence, you'll find yourself suitably enthralled.

I think that the final chapters of this book are some of the most masterfully crafted ever written. Every detail seems to enhance the tone and draw the reader into emotional turmoil: what you want to happen, what you know needs to happen... inevitability vs. unfounded hope. Ah, Dickens, does he ever acheive less than perfection? I think not, and that is why I wish everyone could experience the sheer bliss of reading his work, and enjoy it as thoroughly as I know I have.Also, anyone else wonder why Dickens gave Darnay (who I despise) the same first name as himself?

The pieces all fit together in the end and everything is put in its place. Another good thing about this book is the ending and the beginning. A couple of places actually made me cry because they were so touching. Lucie can annoyingly good, but the other characters make up for it. Miss Pross is one of my favorites, especially at the end. Darnay seems to be a shady character at first, but then everyone ends up falling in love with him. A great book!"},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"Charles Dickens is a great writer. This is my favorite Dicken's book. Let me tell you about this: The first time I read it, I struggled with it up until the end. Some of my friends have never made it past the second chapter. Keep up with it. It may be a challenge to read, but it is the most rewarding book to finish. I have read it three times now. Every word is a savory, sweet and succulent experience. I have never came across another book with the same quality. I highly, highly reccomend it."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"A tale of two cities is one of my favourite novels. It contains some of the best blood -chilling action and drama of classical literature. A first rate thriller with an ingeniously crafted plot abounding in twists (which are never accidental), suspense builds upon suspense leading to one of the best resolutions of one of the most terrifying climaxes I've ever read.There are certain flaws - the characters are oversimplified bromides: they lack the psychological complexity,depth,fullness and uniqueness of the characters of the other novels of Dickens.For example,Sydney Carton's character is incomplete and unconvincing (why is he wasting his intelligence , competence-and life? The author never answers.). However, Doctor Manette's (sporadic)strange,almost insane behaviour is heartbreakingly touching, bringing into full focus the consequences of the atrocities of the nobility in pre-Revolution France.Further, Dickens has not focused explicitly on any important philosophical issue whereas, the French Revolution can provide a lot of scope for in-depth philosophical investigation and study. In a rather generalized manner he has alluded to certain aspects of the Revolution - symbolizing them in terms such as Death , Vengeance etc. and has given a profound spiritual dimension to a particular situation , referring to The Bible (which I mention later in the review) but he has not tried to give any profound analysis of any aspect.Read Victor Hugo's \\" Ninety Three\\" and you shall understand what I mean when I say that, had Dickens integrated some significant philosophical issue of the French revolution with his story, he could have created a masterpiece of the highest order , which, \\"A tale..\\" is not (and which \\"Ninety Three\\" is).Nevertheless, the events, in themselves, reflect an important aspect of the revolution - questioning and denouncing (implicitly) the means by which the revolution sought to bring an end to injustice and oppression.The theme of this novel, simply put, is : Love versus Hate. Set in the savage , frightening background of the French Revolution, in an atmosphere in which Bitternes, Hatred and Vengeance , as a result of years and years of oppression and exploitation by the elite, have pulverized Compassion, Justice, Reason and Humanity, where injustice is being \\"corrected\\" with greater injustice, bloodshed and cruelty, which shall triumph- Love or Hate ? Dickens shows which.One of the things I loved most about this novel is Sydney Carton's love for Lucie Manette. It is true when a great writer said that it is the great artists(that is,the great authors of world literature) have TAUGHT mankind what great love is- otherwise mankind would never know what it is. In his depiction of Carton's passionate love, Dickens equals the emotional intensity of Thomas Hardy , Victor Hugo and Ayn Rand, though he was not the kind of writer to carefully the nature of love .Almost impossible to find, Carton's love for Lucie is what , I think, every woman would yearn for.Another aspect which made a great impact on me : I'm not a Christian and properly speaking, do not even believe in God (and still don't). But Dickens, has brought into focus, and by thus isolating it has infused with tremendous psychological, emotional and spiritual meaning a few famous words which ,in my opinion ,do not create the similar impact in The Bible itself . For the first time I understood the power and force of religion-the words have a grand sense of drama and show how religion might provide courage , hope , and a sense of uplift . The words are ( I shall never forget the in the context of this novel):I AM THE RESURRECTION AND THE LIFE"},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"A Tale of Two Cities offers a swift, exciting story and an unforgettable rendering of the French Revolution, in a lethal, vengeful and exiguous Paris and a tranquil London. This novel as Dickens's most memorable effort to see a world in a very confined space indeed: a work very short by its nature and yet in which hundreds, even thousands of people do appear in a state of belligerence. The book is riddled with the howling mobs, epic scenes and tightly packed incidents that concentrate on a few central characters. It is an intimate piece of work, which somehow deftly evokes the epic presence of crowds and the vast movements of history, as well as the engrossing terror and compassion of individual characters.Within the condensations of historical time, the lives of the characters play themselves out. Besides the dreadful Madame Defarge of whose power derives from her surreptitious but all engrossing lust for vengeance on the Evremonde family (aristocrats), Dickens is particularly concerned with three men, all obsessed with the same dreamy, beautiful and svelte figure of desire: Lucie Manette. Doctor Manette, who had been for 18 years jailed by the Evremonde in the Bastille to cover up its atrocious crimes, reveals much more fully his character through actions than by mere dialogue and introspection. Realizing his tormented imprisonment that has thrown him into a delirious repression as strength, he announces himself to the Revolutionists and pleads for Charles Darnay's life and liberty.An heir of the Evremonde family but lives under the name Darnay in England, his ambiguous historical guilt is converged through a crucial historical ellipsis. The other central figure is Sydney Carton; a lawyer with thwarted ambition that takes on a mythical aspect at the end to save his friends and so to fulfill his promise. If Charles Darnay is the society's innocent victim who suffers because of the sins of his forefathers and of Madame Defarge's inveterate hatred of the aristocrats, Sydney Carton, who suffers from an inexplicable melancholy, is the sacrificial hero who redeems those sins in an re-enactment of Christ's expiatory death.The novel is also redolent of the theme of resurrection: the release of people from the realm of death and from their own morbid isolation. The novel begins with the rescue of Doctor Manette from the proximity of the Bastille. Apprehension, repression and revulsion weigh in his mind and make it difficult for him to utter a word upon the topic that oppresses him. There has always been a strong and extraordinary revival of the excruciating train of thought and remembrance that are the first cause of his malady. Charles Darnay, who is accused by being a traitor and forfeit to the French people, has to be rescued from the realm of death, or more precisely, the wrath of Madame Defarge by, ironically, Doctor Manette. Imbued from her childhood with a brooding sense of wrong, she is utterly implacable and inimical. She is intransigent to recognize in her determination to exterminate the entire Evremondes insanity. The inveteracy of her pursuit is unfathomable for she is completely deprived of pity and compassion. Her surreptitious, conspired management of Charles Darnay's arrest is cunning but not without immense cruelty. The scheme manifests in a woven form, or knitting, which represents calculation, patience, pertinence, and an urge to retaliate.The doctor realizes that up to that time, his imprisonment and repression have been associated in the minds of others with his personal affliction, deprivation and weakness. But he feels now, that his suffering is strength and power with which he can deliver Charles Darnay. The urge to returning to France has passed through his mind often as he cannot help thinking and having had some sympathy for the miserable people. Letter from an old servant who is in peril rouses the latent uneasiness in his mind to a vigorous resolution. One can immediately discern Darnay's futile attempt to save the servant and win influence with the revolutionists in order to do good, for no sooner has he arrived in Paris than he languishes in jail. The lack of reason and pity on Madame Defarge'' behalf is exposed to the fullest extent as one realizes how she has cunningly managed and manipulated the actions behind the scenes by letting Doctor Manette expend his force in a mock victory, accusing Darnay and re-arresting him, arraigning him to a new trial, and using the doctor's own manuscript on which written his confession and curse of his persecutors hidden in the Bastille against Darnay. All this Madame Defarge has premeditated in order to lure Darnay back to Paris and put whom on trial as a former aristocrat and a member of the very culpable Evremonde family who also happens to wrong the doctor.The root of all the terror and bloodthirst, or even the Revolution, under Dickens's hand in this novel, is Madame Defarge's hatred for the Evremonde who had caused the death of her family. She is therefore the revolutionary impulse incarnate who is held together by class-hatred. Stony, absorbed in her knitting, seemingly unobservant, she is in absolute control of the mob. With her indomitable will she seem less a person than a force of destiny. She might have imbued the mob with her incendiary speeches but the real diabolism of the revolutionary mob rests in its overweening arrogance, its god-like assumption of power over the lives of the French people. Portrayal of the Revolution is achieved through an acceleration of events such as the arrest on mere suspicion, the mock trials and sheer murderousness.Lastly the concept of martyrdom contained within the novel is to a good deal paradoxical: a Christianly, self-sacrificial death with a resurrection context and a prophetic countenance that brings together and contrasts ideas of justice and mercy. It echoes with the opening paradox \\"it was the best of times, it was the worst of times....\\"2004 (45) MY"},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"What an interesting thought.If it was possible for Dickens to write something that was less Dickensian than the rest of his impressive body of work, \\"A Tale of Two Cities\\" would qualify as the least Dickensian of them all. An absorbing historical work, a sharply moving forward tempo, little if any comic relief and a minimum of florid prose (at least relative to his own characteristic standard of an abundance of unnecessary embellishment) make A Tale of Two Cities a tense, somber, compelling and moving piece of work that is the shortest, yet perhaps most well known, of his major novels.The characters, as one would expect from Dickens, are still ambitious, magnificently described creations - Charles Darnay, son of the Marquis Saint Evr&eacute;monde, who moves to England and disowns his heritage as part of the ruling French aristocracy; Darnay's look alike, Sydney Carton, a hard-drinking ambitionless lawyer who comes at last to the realization that his life has been wasted; Lucie Manette, the typical Victorian heroine, who lives and loves with a faint heart, teary eyes and heaving bosom; her father, Alexandre Manette, who barely survives a long imprisonment in the Bastille and recovers his health and his reason only in the nurturing environment of his family in England; Jarvis Lorry, the man of business, the Tellson's Bank representative in Paris and the steadfast family friend of the Manettes; Ernest and Th&eacute;r&egrave;se Defarge, the maniacal, metaphorical representatives of France's working class who evolve (or might that be devolve) into the citizens and citizenesses of a post-revolutionary French Republic; and, of course, Jerry Cruncher, a close to the edge Londoner, who makes his dubious living as a \\"resurrectionist\\", that is, a procurer of recently deceased corpses for medical research.Covering the history of London and Paris during the period from 1775, just prior to the onset of the American Revolution, to the storming of the Bastille in 1789, the height of Robespierre's Terror, and the daily bloodshed of the close shaves of France's barber, Madame La Guillotine, A Tale of Two Cities dwells on a multiplicity of themes - romance; unrequited love; altruism; the terrors of revolution; the evils of class distinctions; the power of friendship; the terrifying ability of power to corrupt; and the amazing ability of a faith in God to comfort through troubled times.If you're already familiar with Dickens, but have yet to read \\"A Tale of Two Cities\\", run to the nearest library or bookstore, curl up by the fire and read it as soon as you can. If you have yet to try your first Dickens novel, this is a fine place to start. Compose yourself and relax. Be patient and take the time to discover Dickens' style of writing. With the possible exception of Wilkie Collins, I don't believe there's another author who could have got away with writing complex, enormously lengthy paragraphs that, upon hindsight, the reader will discover were but single sentences. Of a sudden, you'll discover you're at the end of the novel. And, I defy you - I defy you - to read the last chapter of \\"A Tale of Two Cities\\" without finding a lump in your throat.Paul Weiss"},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"By the year 2006, can Dickens' novel A Tale of Two Cities still hold relevance? The answer is a simple yes. It is a great tale of how love, revolution, and chaos can all fall into place at the same moment. But the most interesting topic that he addresses is the theme of rebirth or revolution. This rebirth is not only that of France, but of Dr. Manette, Charles Darnay, and Sydney Carton. All of them are changed by the events happening during the time of the novel. They reshape their ideals, reintroduce themselves into the world, reinvent themselves, and revitalize their spirits. That is way resurrection is the most noticeable subject in this novel.France is about to undergo the bloodiest revolutions that Europe has ever seen. The peasants of France revolt in hopes creating a government that will take care of their needs. They have little food and the food that they do have is rotten. Dickens does an absolutely amazing job of describing the peasants' awful situation. However, he only depicts the tragic peasants with only a negative depiction of the aristocrats. A great example of this is the way in which he descries Monseigneur's massive house and he's chocolate eating, \\"Monseigneur, on of the great lords...he must have died of two. (122-123)\\" This is a very critical view of a man with power because it never shows another side to him. This implies that he is always greedy and only looks after himself. Another bias view of the wealthy is seen in Marquis. Who is shown as a selfish, non-sympathetic man who gets what he deserves, death. \\"It is extraordinary... The horses there: are they right? (129-130)\\" With no positive view of an aristocrat, it is impossible to make a fair judgment about the rich, or the poor. Dickens goal is to justify a revolution based on poor character of the rich ruling class. He succeeds in doing so at the cost of the aristocrats of France.The most obvious character to undergo change is Dr. Manette. As the very first chapters show, he is \\"recalled to life. (14)\\" in the course of the novel. In the literal since, he is taken out of a wrongful imprisonment of 18 years with no contact with the outside world. But on a much deeper level however, the book focuses on how he comes back into the world. He transforms from a weak, feeble shoemaker to a strong character that's able to control crowds and lead them towards the greater-good. The only fault in this complete change is that he does occasionally go back to his old ways in making shoes when he becomes depressed. But these episodes are too brief to change the fact that Manette has a complete turn around from who he is at the beginning of the novel to the end.Charles Darnay also exemplifies a person who recreates himself in order to use the second chances he gets in life. Born into wealth, he sees the maltreatment that the rich shows towards the poor. That is why he revokes his power and rights in order to live a regular life. But after he is nearly sent to jail in England he reinvents himself as a lover as he falls in love with Lucie. However when the opportunity comes for him to save the day, he puts on his hero cape and goes back to France. Again he is arrested, but this time his life is in jeopardy has he faces the gallows. And only help from Carton is he saved from the clutches of death.Sydney Carton is the most interesting characters in the novel because of the drastic changes that he undergoes. Dickens shows Carton as a worthless drunk with no future \\"Sydney Carton, idlest... that humble capacity (102)\\". As time goes on, he falls in love with Lucie but doesn't allow his feelings to interfere with her life. That is until Darnay's life is in danger. Carton gives up his life in place of Darnay. This clearly shows that he makes a major change in his character. This change happens because he wants to make up for the wasted life that he has lived by sacrificing himself to save another. This brings about a sense of peace in him that he has never felt \\"It is a far... I have ever known (443)\\"With so much change and unstableness going on in the novel, it is easy to understand why the country and the fore mentioned characters of Manette, Darnay, and Carton undergo such dynamic shifts in their personas. France has its revolutions, Manette is recalled to life, Darnay is reborn twice, and Carton is resurrected as a hero and martyr. That kind of writing leads me to the conclusion that life is all about second chances and renewal. This was Dickens' purpose in writing a novel like this, and that is why A Tale of Two Cities is a book that stands out amongst the greatest literary pieces of all time."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times. This is the opening famous line of A Tale of Two Cities. This opening sentence sets up a story of love, life, friendship, and equality for the French citizens. This book had a wonderful story line that brings many people together after setting the reader up to believe they will never find out how these people connect. The stories main character is Dr. Manette, he is the single character that brings all of the others together. Based during the French Revolution, we find out that Dr. Manette was a prisoner of the bastille for 18 years, which later in the story gives him great authority over the French citizens. His daughter, Lucie, is the golden hair girl that catches the heart of all the men she meets. Her devotion to her husband, Charles Darnay, brings her great sadness when he is imprisoned for his secret life of being a French noble. Darnay's family was the one that put Dr. Manette in jail, and took the life of two innocent people, leaving a lonely woman to fend for herself. She is Madame Defarge, who throughout the entire story is trying to get Darnay and his family put to death by the guillotine. After Darnay is sentenced to death only one man can save his life. Sydney Carton, who looks like Darnay, takes his own life so that the love of his life, Lucie, will be happy. He knows that she will never want him so he feels the only thing he can give her is happiness. This book was very enjoyable and exciting. Although it is rather wordy and the beginning seems to be endless and boring. However,during the second half you learn how everything ties together. Every chapter is needed in this book and the time must be taken to read it thourouly to find out the exciting ending. The dramatic ending gives a sense of saddness and relief all at once. Which is why A Tale of Two Cities is a great book. Bringing love, friendship, and the battle for equality during the French Revolution, together suceeds in making this an excellent book."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"A Tale of Two Cities by Charles Dickens is a captivating novel that takes readers back to a time of turmoil and distress in both France and England before and during the French Revolution. From the beginning, Dickens catches the reader's attention with the strange and mysterious list of dualities that initially seem to make no sense. Yet as the story progresses, this and other vague ideas begin to clear, and develop into a clear plot. This plot shows the hatred between the peasants and the nobles of France, without having to explain it himself.Dickens is able to create a plot around this period of time in a way that does not make it seem like a documentary that details the events of the Revolution. Instead, he integrates static and dynamic characters into the novel, each with their own significance and purpose. Although these are not typical people of the time period, they are purposely used to embody different aspects of life. Madame Defarge for instance, is portrayed as a bloodthirsty and heartless revolutionary, who is only concerned with the death of the aristocracy. By creating a character with these values, Dickens can show the discord between the peasantry and the aristocracy through the words and actions of Madame Defarge. The incorporation of fictional character and historical events makes for an interesting and some-what factual novel.By analyzing this novel, one can see Dickens use of symbols and other literary devices to convey information to reader. For example, the broken wine cask in the poor streets of a French town was a symbolic scene in foreshadowing the rising of the peasants against the nobles. This and other literary devices give subtle hints of what is to come in the novel. Though it may not come to ones attention immediately, carefully looking for these devices helps to clarify the story and well as foreshadow the future chapters of the novel.This novel is something that could and should be read by anyone looking for an interesting spin on history. Given that it will take longer for some to understand then others, by reading carefully, it can be a very enjoyable novel. Charles Dickens novel A Tale of Two Cities is definitely a novel worth taking a look at."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"A Tale of Two Cities, by Charles Dickens, is a chronical of the lives of the aristocracy and the lower class through the times leading up to and during the French Revolution. It Is a tale of both London and Paris, but I found that the real story happens in the latter of the two. The theme of two's is used frequently throughout the story. There are people living double lives-going by secret names. The story shows both sides of the French Revolution; It shows the lives of the rich and poor. The theme of being resurrected and being condemned to death go hand in hand throughout the story. The main theme, that also has two sides, is that of love and hatred. I saw the powers of hatred break apart families and condemn men's lives; I saw the power of love ultimately defeat hatred and restore those condemned lives. I really did enjoy reading this book. It touches very deeply on the the victory of love and how love can change. It is a story of change. I didn't think I would enjoy it when I first started reading the book, but it hooked me and changed the way I felt. It is right around 400 pages, and there are footnotes to help in the understanding of the history of the story."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"Unlike in David Copperfield or Great Expectations, Tale of Two Cities is not woven around one central and well defined character. In fact, character development does not really start until almost one hundred pages in - after several important and plot defining events. This made the reading difficult for me at first, since all of the characters seemed sinister and blended into one another. My advice is to stick with it and pay close attention to the treason trial in London. It is here that most of the critical characters are introduced and it contains vital keys for the full enjoyment of the rest of the book. This failing is why I rank the book only a 4 star story. The late character development does not undermine the book but it does not enhance it in my opinion. Although Dickens does bring all of the pieces together with traditionally astounding skill, I was still left vague as to why some things early in the book happened or at least why they happened when they did. This is unusual for a Dickens novel and surprising.That being said, Tale of Two Cities blossoms into a wonderfully told story with the traditional rich Dickens characters and, expectedly, defies a one line description of the plot. When a son of an Aristocratic French family renounces his lands and titles and makes a new life for himself in England, he is unexpectedly called into harm's way when he must return to clear the name of an old servant being held by the new French Republic for crimes he did not commit. Encountering more trouble than he expected, it up to his father-in-law, a celebrated Patriot and ex-prisoner of the old regime, to find a way to save him. However, when the truth comes out about the father-in-law's imprisonment, it does not appear that even true love can save the well intended son-in-law."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"This is no doubt an excellent book, and the last 100 pages or so will simply dazzle you. As you read, you will feel the terror that accompanied the French Revolution, and understand the forces that led to the upheaval and chaos. I felt that Dickens' portrayal of the politics was suprisingly evenhanded. Dickens shows flashes of brilliant prose throughout, and his character development is simply unparalleled. Unfortunately, there are places where the story drags, and while some of these &quot;dead spots&quot; make sense later, many do not. This was the only flaw, and for this reason I gave this otherwise outstanding book only 4 stars."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"I had a bad experience with Dickens. 2 years ago I tried reading Oliver Twist, after seeing the Disney movie, but after going through 3 chapters that took up 40 pages each - but consisted of only 2 paragraphs each, just for Oliver to be born and named, I gave up. Now I'm in 8th grade and as a language arts assignment, we were to read a Dickens novel. It was either A Tale of Two Cities or Great Expectations. I saw the Wishbone summary of A Tale of Two Cities and thought it had a nice plot but was dreading going through Dickens's lllooooonnnggg drones.This time however, Dickens secured my interest with the ideal beginning of &quot;It was the best of times, it was the worst of times . . .&quot; I was immediately drawn into the story of mystery and splendor. The characters didn't suddenly multiply like they did before and I got to understand each and every one - from pretty Lucie Manette to the harsh Monseigneur the Marquis.Dickens's drifting speeches improved as well: turning out to be quite dramatic and interesting. Maybe the book could have been a lot shorter - but it gives you something to think on. And it's definitely better than just having an author say, &quot;okay, this is the story and that's the end.&quot; Instead, he gives you a suspensful novel that you are never bored with. You have to carefully follow the story and see how the threads tie together in the end.. . . Prepare to be amazed!"},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"Having read Les Miserables and the Scarlet Pimpernel, I thought I must read this one. Although by far I enjoyed Les Mis much more, this book gives an objective view. Dickens describes both the sufferings of the poor before the revolution and the injustice done to the nobility under the Republic. Dickens' writing style is fascinating, I loved it. Yes, it's difficult and tedious; I'm a bit slow myself but enjoyed it far too much to give it up. The descriptions of the misery of the peasants, the attack on the Bastille, the murder of the nobles, the thirst for revenge, are all painfully expressive. Dickens often uses dark humour and irony, it makes it all funny and painfull at once: \\"who kissed La Guillotine, looked through the little window and sneezed into the sack.\\" What a picture!But it is mainly a story of love, revenge and self-sacrifice rather than a commentary on the revolution. Dr. Mannette is released after being unjustly imprisoned for 18 years, and he finds he has a perfect angelic little daughter, Lucie. Charles Darnay is a young, dashing, but good French aristocrat who reliquished his title in France, and is exiled in England. Sydney Carton, the \\"idlest and most unpromising of men,\\" has become one of my favorites in literature. He's an unhappy alchoholic, who appears incapable of achieving anything good. I liked him from the first, because he didn't like Darnay much and, neither did I! Carton is in love with Lucie, unrequitedly. Lucie marries Darnay. Darnay's antipathy towards Carton becomes of major significance at the end. As the French Revolution erupts in France, duty calls Darnay back to Paris, where he is captured and tried. The ending is the grandest I have ever read; poignant, tearful, prophetic, bittersweet. It takes days to recover! It ends in perhaps the most unselfish, heroic of sacrifices in fiction. With Dickens' beautiful use of prose this becomes truly unforgettable. I recommend it for everyone, young and old, as long as you can handle the language. I can't believe I waited this long to read it!"},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"This book ought to be the required reading for every student.

When I ran across the following revelation about Sydney Carton I was filled with a sense of gladness and wonder that such a character could spring so true to life on the page:\\"Sadly, sadly, the sun rose; it rose upon no sadder sight than the man of good abilities and good emotions, incapable of their directed exercise, incapable of his own help and his own happiness, sensible of the blight on him, and resigning himself to let it eat him away.\\"As far as I'm concerned that's exactly it right there in a nutshell and who better than old Charlie to set it down so surely. I must admit I was instamatically fascinated by Mr. Stryver's blighted jackal and not just because a Carton is some kind of Box either. There's a strong strain of Eugene Wrayburn about the old chap only much more satisfyingly moreso, if that makes any sense. To me at least this fellow of no delicacy is completely and utterly credible as a human being and my reaction to the book he's so much a part of might best be summed up in a slight paraphrase of the great Denis Johnson: It felt wonderful to be alive to read it! I've gone looking for this character everywhere. Come to think of it another reason I feel decidedly drawn to Sydney Carton is that the blighter turned up as one half of a priceless comparison made by Bertie Wooster in the first installment of Wodehouse's inspired Totliegh Towers tetralogy. If that isn't a recommendation in itself I hardly know what is.Plus anyway A Tale of Two Cities isn't all oppression, misery and tumbrils of the Revolution either coz Jerry Cruncher for one cracked me up consistently. Taken for all in all, then, I reckon that even in the realm of stone cold history Boz is the bloody bleeding business."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"This version was no better than the previous word to text system on the kindle.

Something about the way he wrote causes difficulty in reading comprehension; I often found myself rereading sentences or paragraphs to discern what was happening in the scene or what the characters were trying to convey with their speech. Aside from the language style, the novel holds up brilliantly on all other aspects to be judged. The characters are strongly developed, the descriptive narrative paints the picture of scene well, and the plot is engaging. It's also a happy bonus for me when the story teaches a moral lesson in parallel with the narrative unfolding and that is just what AToTC accomplishes.

This electronic book contains not only the text, but is a very nice edition of Dicken's classic that I will enjoy a long time."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"Back in my high school English classes, I often didn't care much for the assigned reading. However, one book that I did really enjoy at the time was Charles Dicken's 1859 classic A Tale of Two Cities. Having not read it since, I decided to pick it up again and see how it stood up. I once again enjoyed it, but not as much as I did back then. This is, largely, because I'm not the same person as I was back then (thankfully), leaving one of the main threads of the book to speak to me less than it did then.The novel spans from 1775 and the outbreak of the American Revolution and its effects in London to 1793 and the height of the Reign of Terror of the French Revolution in Paris. As is typical of Dickens, there are a lot of characters. The main four are Sydney Carton, English lawyer and ne'er-do-well, Charles Darnay, a French noblemen who dislikes the actions of his class and lives in London and - it just so happens - looks just like Carton, Dr. Alexandre Mannette, just released from 18 years of unjust imprisonment in the Bastille, and Dr. Mannette's daughter Lucie, who helps him recover, later marries Darnay, and is the subject of Carton's unrequited love.Of these main four, Carton and Dr. Mannette are interesting characters. Carton struggles with trying to make something of his wasted life, and with his affection for Lucie. Dr. Mannette and his return to himself is likewise an interesting character arc. Unfortunately, Darnay and Lucie are less compelling. Darnay is mostly just kind of \\"there\\" with no real highlight except for his confrontation with his evil uncle the Marquis, and an unfortunate lapse in judgement that leads him, a member of a noble family, to go to Paris in 1792. Lucie doesn't stand out much. She cares for her father and, later, daughter, and is the object of Carton and Darnay's affections. She doesn't really have much character of her own.The secondary character are almost universally compelling. The Defarges, a winemaker and his wife in Paris, are leaders of the revolutionary patriots, with complex stories of their own. Madame Defarge, in particular, pretty much steals the scene whenever she shows up. Jarvis Lorry is a banker and friend of the main characters, and he's brave, savvy, loyal, and more world-wise than most. Jerry Cruncher and Miss Pross aid our heroes, and each have moments of brilliance. An unnamed seamstress appears late in the book and has more pathos in her short appearance than many books have between their two covers.A Tale of Two Cities being Dickens, there are a ton of plot twists an unexpected revelations. Sometimes they seem to be a stretch, but, well, that's just how Dickens works, and pretty much every twist in fact is connected to a previous character or scene that comes back to be vital to the story. So, while it might be hard to believe that all these connections and surprises can fit into one story, Dickens makes them exciting and does a good job of justifying them in the buildup.Dickens' language is fantastic. His description of the French Revolution and the Reign of Terror is particularly excellent. There are times he veers towards the wordy - though, by 19th century British standards, not especially so - but so often there are great lines, descriptions, phrases to be found in his prose that it's well worth it.So, as I said at the opening of this review, I liked A Tale of Two Cities this time around, but less than when I read it in high school. The main reason, I think, is that a major part of the novel revolves around unrequited love. Now, you can imagine why this would be a topic that captures the attention of a teenage boy. It certainly did for me. However, at this stage of life, after being with my wife for over fifteen years, I am amply requited (is that even a real word?). So, some of the raw emotion of the book just doesn't work for me the way it did back then (which, really, I'd call a good thing, personally). This might not matter to anyone else, but it took me a while to put my finger on just why I wasn't as into A Tale of Two Cities as I was the first time I read it, and I think it's interesting how a book can speak to the reader in different ways depending on where they are in their own lives.I listened to Simon Vance's reading of A Tale of Two Cities. Vance is one of my favorite narrators, and he does another fantastic job with this book. He does great voices for each character. He has such a broad range it can be hard to believe at times that the elderly man of business Jarvis Lorry, porter and honest tradesman Jerry Cruncher, and the gentleman Charles Darnay are all being voiced be the same narrator. I definitely recommend Vance's reading to audio book fans. Also, by odd coincidence, I had just read Vance narrate another tale of the French Revolution before this book - Rafael Sabatini's Scaramouche, which was also a great book, well-narrated.A Tale of Two Cities is a very good book, and a well-deserved classic. I recommend it to anyone curious to give Dickens a try. The plot is exciting, the language is compelling, and most of the characters are very interesting. I may not like it quite as much as I did as a teenager, but I still think A Tale of Two Cities is an excellent book, well worth reading."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"A Tale of Two Cities is the only Dickens book I've read. I've never been one to enjoy \\"Literature\\" as classic novels seemed pretentious at best. Yet, I find myself drawn to them for their surprising abilities at concretizing themes, ideals, and personalities. A Tale of Two Cities is a very good showcase of Dickens' views of the French Revolution--simultaneously sympathizing with its causes while condemning its methods. It is also superbly written with passages that brought tears to my eyes for all their nuance and emotion.However, A Tale of Two Cities has the air of a (superior) political pamphlet rather than a novel. The entire work seems foreshortened, storylines abbreviated, characterizations deliberately distorted for their symbollic value to the plot, and a set of coincidences worthy more of a daytime soap opera than fine literature. On the whole, the plot itself is too obvious. It's major themes are hammered out repeatedly as if Dickens was afraid his readers might not understand what he was trying to say. I felt that Dickens tipped his hand too far and revealed too much too quickly.Criticism aside, where A Tale of Two Cities shines is in its execution. If you ignore the over-simplified flatness of the story and look at how expressive and thoughtful Dickens words are, nearly any shortcoming of plot seems trivial. That is a definite mark of a great talent--where even flimsy stories take on a breadth and timbre worthy of the best books of any age, and leave our modern authors looking like a bunch of overwrought dip sticks."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"\\"A Tale of Two Cities\\" is one of Charles Dickens' greatest and darkest novels. Set in the final quarter of the 18th century, Dickens presents to us the brutality that led to the anarchy of the French Revolution, as seen by Britons and by the Revolutionaries themselves.Today's readers may seem put off by the overwhelming amount of coincidences that occur in the book, but no one I know of thinks it made the story suffer. I have taught \\"A Tale of Two Cities\\" many times and not one student had a problem with this. In fact, very few students disliked the book.Which brings me to another point: the Dover Thrift Editions are great money-savers. For two and half books, they get a well-bound and printed, quality paperback that won't hurt their already financially-strapped wallets.Rocco DormarunnoCollege of New Rochelle"},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"This was Dicken's only historical fiction novel, but it was one of the best ever. This is one of my favorite books, and Dickens is one of my favorite authors. Dickens weaves a thrilling story of romance, conspiracy, and danger during the French Revolution time. Lucie Manette's father is finally freed from prison with the help of enigma Mr. Lorry. Then Englishman Charles Darnay is accused of treason. During the trial it is pointed out that he looks just like Sydney Carton, the defense lawyer, so he goes free. Then he, Carton, and another lawyer, Mr. Stryver, all go for Lucie Manette's affections. Darnay marries her, but all does not go well. The French police return and call Darnay to another trial, where he is pronounced guilty. The rest is for you to find out. If you like the book too, I also recommend David Copperfield."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"This book is for anyone who ever tried to have a deeper understanding of A Tale of Two Cities without great success. I will use this book for my ESOL students. One is reading A Tale of Two Cities and finds it quite a chore. When I read this retelling I also got more out of the story than I had before. I highly recommend these retold stories."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"Although the book was a bit confusing and required some concentration in order to follow the story, it was a very good book. The two plots that are carried through out the book are interwoven at the most interesting places and at the end everything finally falls into place. A Tale of Two Cities, is a book that is well worth taking the time to read. The reader gains a great insight into the horrors of the French Revolution, yet one can see that it is possible to turn your past pain and suffering into a deep rooted strenght, such as Doctor Manette does as he tries to rescue Chalers from prison, that will carry you and the ones you love to the otherside of an extreme problem. The book covers a wide range of human emotions from extreme sorrow to profound joy to deep respect. It is so heart warming to see such family devotion, as Lucie shows in her care for her father, as well as to see a desire to go against the odds to protect those which you hold dear, even when it means giving your life for the sake of someone else.Dickens brings the reader into the very pages and events of the book which such descriptive language that the reader is able to see everything in its most intimate details. He gives the Defarges the most distinguishable little quirks that make them stand out in your mind. The other characters have their own little ways about them to make them unforgetable. The story shows just how ironic life can be in all of its small twists and turns, such as Doctor Manette's manuscript is the evidence that gets his much beloved son-in-law sentenced to death; even when he swore to never have anything to do with the Evermonde family ever again, his duaghter marries one, and he becomes greatly endeared to the doctor's heart. The want of revenge and protectiong is what drives the book all the way through and under it all, some of the charcters wish only to find out what they are truly capable of and want to make something of thier lives. All of which is still true to this day.~A Merch High School Student"},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"A Tale of Two Cities is a remarkable novel that gives a great insight into the French Revolution. Dickens's style of writing is rare, unlike most authors who do away with violent scenes in order to not upset their audience. Dickens stays true to his audience by describing every dreadful, horrific, and frightening fact about the French Revolution just as it had happened.In his works Charles Dickens tends to \\"Beat around the bushes.\\" Instead of getting to the plot of the novel, he moves away from the plot, and adds chapters such as \\"The Honest Tradesman,\\" a chapter that is in no way related to the plot of the novel. The Honest Tradesman is an entire 10-page biography on Jerry Cruncher, which is simply unnecessary, because Cruncher is neither a main character in the novel nor does he play a major role in the novel. The \\"Fellow of Delicacy\\" is another chapter that is used as an alibi for Dickens to take up space. The chapter describes the escapades of Mr.Stryver, a lawyer who is one of the many suitors of Lucie Manette and is trying to ask for her hand in marriage. Chapters such as these neither add to the plot of the novel nor help us further understand the novel. Visual imagery is also another problem in the novel. Dickens's visual imagery seems to take up entire chapters at times, which needless to say, causes disinterest in the readers. For example in Chapter Seven Book II, Monseigneur in Town, Dickens used five out of eight pages to describe Monseigneur. These descriptions mainly consist of irrelevant things, such as the furnishings in Monseigneur's home and his visiting the Comedy and Grand Opera. It will be reasonable to conclude that Dickens seemed pressured to have a full length novel at all cost, compelling him to elaborate on the unnecessary.The title of the novel is a Tale of Two Cities, which means the novel will revolve around these two cities. However, the transition between the two cities is unclear at times. So the reader finds themselves struggling to understand the intricate language of the novel and at the same time wandering whether the chapter they are currently reading is set in France or London. For instance in Book II Chapter Twenty - four, \\"Drawn to the Loadstone Rock\\", the novel begins with \\"In such risings of fire and risings of sea - the firm earth shaken by the rushes of an angry ocean which had no ebb, but was always on the flow, higher and higher, to the terror and wonder of the beholders on the store - three years of tempest were consumed. Three more birthdays of little Lucie had been woven by the golden thread into the peaceful tissue of the life of has her home. Many a night and many a day had its inmates listened to the echoes in the corner, with hearts that failed them when they heard the thronging feet. For, the footsteps had become to their minds as the footsteps of a people, tumultuous under a red flag and with their country declared in danger, changed into wild beasts, by terrible enchantment long persisted in\\" (232). In this part of the novel, one can assume that with the name of \\"little Lucie\\" being mentioned in a sentence, the setting is in London, but with the phrase \\"their country declared in danger, changed into wild beasts, by terrible enchantment long persisted in,\\" one can also infer that the author is talking about France. While Dickens tries to compare and contrast London and France, and combine London and France. Dickens fails to differentiate between the settings of these two cities.If readers don't remember half of the things that happen in the novel due to the tendency of the author to dwell on the unnecessary, they will remember the characters. Dickens develops memorable characters, characters who will live on through history as if they were actual beings. Sydney Carton is the epitome of a \\"memorable character.\\" Just like an angel that was sent from God, he delivers Darnay from the evil of the Revolution. Perhaps the most memorable aspect of Sydney Carton is that he laid down his own life for the happiness of Lucie -- the ultimate act of love.While A Tale of Two Cities doesn't have that many aspects about it that set it apart from most classic British novels, it should be considered great literature because of the incredible moral lessons it teaches. Sydney's final words resonate even today: \\"It is a far, far better thing that I do; than I have ever done; it is a far, far better, rest that I go to than I have ever known\\" (367). These words will forever live on until the end of time, because of their combination of immense bravery, extreme sorrow, and undeniable joy that Sydney and the readers know will be attained by his sacrifice."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"A Tale of Two Cities is a magnificent novel. The novel started out slowly and was hard for me to understand. But midway through the second book, Dickens grabbed my attention and did not let go; I finished the last 150 pages in under three hours, while the first 200 took all week. The old write style is the only difficulty I had enjoying this novel. The plot is very good.What happens? The novel is based around the French Revolution. The first novel deals with the release of Dr. Mannette and his reunion with his daughter. The second novel deals more with the Doctor's life in England, the interactions of his daughter with Sidney Carton and Charles Darney, and Mr. Lorry's business. One piece of advice I have is remember every name, no matter how insignificant it seems. Characters emerge in book three that seemed unimportant. Darney is a French noble who returns to France to help a servant in danger by the Revolution. Charles Darney is taken prisoner and book three deals with the year and some months he spends in prison.The novel is excellent and I recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"A tale of the French Revolution, the Guillotine, the hysteria, the indifference of the spectators, the gossipy knitting women enjoying the view and counting the fallen heads... the inhumanity is overwhelming..I found this book very, very difficult to follow at first... but I am glad I persisted in reading it to the finish...

And as is always true when radical change comes to pass with a bloody revolution, there are men and women who are willing to risk everything, love unconditionally and sacrifice all for the good.

This is the sort of book I want in a bound sewn together book instead of glued together. If you are in school and have to read a classic I say get this one. If you're sick of the junk that's out there, tired of your computer screen, tired of your endless choices on satellite tv, and want to sink into an oldie, get this one. Once you get into the lingo of the language you just zoom away. A little period music in the background couldn't hurt. &quot;Let Them Eat Cake&quot; was never more distinct although I don't recollect a direct quote from Marie on the matter."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"This is Charles Dickens' best book. The plot is masterly; he squeezes so much story and characterization into this fairly short book that it is truly amazing. Some of his other books are a lot thicker, but this does just as much, if not more, in much less space.Sure, there are a LOT of details and subplots, and some don't have any real relevance to the story (Dickens was paid by the word after all), but so be it. It's worth it in the end.Speaking of the end, this has possibly the best ending ever. It is at once beautiful, poignant, and poetic. Indeed, the ending is so famous that you will almost certainly know it before you even start reading it, but the greatness will still hit home."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"There are many people in this world who seem to think that Charles Dickens spent too much time focusing on the development of his characters. But without this description, the book would not have the same effect. For example, Lucie Darnay has a child and Mme. Defarge does not. This is because Lucie represents love, life, and forgiveness and Mme. Defarge represents vengeance. For her to have a child would not fir into the story. I thought the development of the characters was the best part of the book because Dickens knew what qualities each person had to have and which qualities they could not have. One other great part is when Sydney Carton sacrifices himself for the girl that he loves, Lucie."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"A while back I decided to expand my knowledge of literature so I started reading A Tale of Two Cities. The first part of the book is somewhat difficult to get through because it is so dry. But after you get past the boring part it really starts to get good. My main complaint was that Dickens spent too much time giving detail to objects and people. If you are patient and looking for a good book, than the A Tail of Two Cities would be a good novel to read."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"This book is absolutely the best book I have ever read. I was &quot;forced&quot; to read it, like many high school seniors, for my English class. When I opened the book, my first impression was, &quot;This is going to be the longest 400 pages I have ever read,&quot; but I soon was hooked, and, as mentioned in many other reviews, I found myself staying up until the wee hours of the morning. I could not put it down! It may take some concentration at first, but this book is well worth it. This book changed my mind about classical literature, and now I can enjoy many other great authors as well."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"Charles Dickens again succeds in bringing to readers another classic tale - this one about France during the Revolution, and the lives of a few particular people affected by it. Dickens intricately develops the storyline, and creates some of the most memorable and characters and quotes in literature. While leading the reader through a world of drama and suspenseful action, Dickens adheres admirably well to historical details and events. This is an incredible book and a must read for almost anybody. I only gave it four stars, because in the beginning, the story is somewhat confusing, since Dickens is throwing out a lot of strings which he creatively weaves together as the story progresses. This, however, can be justified, for the original publication was in serial form; thus, Dickens needed to keep the readers in suspense in order to keep them reading it. Overall, though, this truly was a pleasure to read."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"It was a very nice book"},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"When I was given this book to read by my grade eight teacher, I was excited at being given the chance to read a real &quot;classic.&quot; However, I soon changed my mind when I got into the long decriptions just after the beginning of the book. I was optimistic in the first few chapters, hoping that a real plot would soon develop. I soon realized that there was no such hope. I have never heard about Dickens being paid per line, but that would certainly make sense. With the exception of Sydney Carton, the characters were flat and too good to be true, especially Lucie. The redeeming feature of this book was the ending, which, I admit, made me cry."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"I admit it ...

The ending had such an effect on me I cannot describe. I unfortunately, identified with Sydney Carton and the sad tragic life he lived. In fact though, it was inspiring. If someone reading this has not read the book I would not want to give away the ending. Beyond that it is an historical novel of immense foresight. We can look back on it when reflecting on modern political crimes on humanity and see that it can and still does happen. But as simply a literary novel, nothing compares as far as I recall in my readings."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"I'm in 9th grade and I had to read this for school. Dickens, apparently, is one of those authors who sacrifice brevity for the sake of drawing you into the novel, letting you experience it. The first book is boring, and pretty much incomprehensible, but it does get much better as it goes along. This isn't for people with short attention spans, but overall, the writing is strong and powerful. None of the movie versions have had the same impact on me as the power of the novel's ending."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"I had to read this book for my history class.

I was both surprised and satisfied, and everything tied together."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"Charles Dickens' A TALE OF TWO CITIES is one of the best books I have read. In English we read an abridged version of it and watched the movie. I bought the whole book and read it and it was great! From Lucie Mannette to Madame Defarge to Carton and Darnay all of the characters made the story more interesting. I highly recommend this book to any reader."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"I recieved this book, and my eyes crossed at its 360 some pages - nonetheless, I began reading it, and I was immediately captured by Dickens' descriptive writing style. The book was published as a magazine serial, and many readers consider this the books wordy downfall. However, I believe it allows the reader to truly glimpse inside the author's mind...making the book actually MEAN something. The book contains two main ideas which, as a reader, I love: The theme of resurrection and the fact that nearly everything in the book has an opposite. The latter I found quite interesting, and I spent many a night looking for the correlations. In fact, this once again allows the reader to deeply understand the novel - Dickens' main literary asset. In short, I enjoyed this book for its descrptive nature, the opposites, and the underlying themes which Dickens excellently crafted."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"I read this book for my freshmen AP English class. I was expecting it to be some incredibly hard reading, and it was, but it was also an excellent book. It was a great example of a classic, it told of a important historical event, but at the same time it was a suspenseful and romantic novel by a great author. Although it took patience to read the unabridged version, it was definitely worth it, and I would recommend reading it to anyone."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"I had to read this for my Freshmen Honors English class two years ago. The ending did, and still does ring a bit false to me. However, it is put together masterfully, if a bit verbosely. Nonetheless, this book is not my favorite of all time and my rating reflects that."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"I read this book, like many other reviewers, in high school. To say it was really easy to read would be lying. It is a complex book, but worth reading and understanding to the fullest! The plot was beautifully concieved, and nothing will ever beat its magnificient ending. To the high school students...this is what reading is about. You need to learn to read between the lines to get the full affect of the story rather than complaining about too many details. Whether you read it for honors or AP courses is irrelevant if you don't have the comprehension and patience to read a story like this. It was books like this that inspired me to read more of the classics and eventually earn my degree in English. I only wish there were more authors like Charles Dickens in this day and age."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"A Tale of Two Cities is a great historical novel. I recently read it for school, and had some trouble beginning it. Once I got into the flow of the novel, it became an easy read. If you plan to read this book, definitely finish it. The last fifty pages make the long read worthwhile."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"I had to read A Tale of Two Cities for school, and if I wasn't assigned to read it, I probably would have never finished it. This was written in a time when authors got paid by the word, and you can easily tell that. That, and the language level make this book very hard to read. But, I am glad I got a chance to read it. I understood the book pretty well, and Dickens does a good job of illustrating the cruelty of the law at that time. The ending of the book is so sad. I cried when I finished reading it. This is really a great book if you have to read it, but a rare person will finish it without being forced to."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"Ambrose Bierce once quipped that a novel is a short story padded. This was never more true than in Victorian England, where authors were paid by the word and being long winded was the best tactic for an author who didn't want to starve. The result of this trend is A Tale of Two Cities one of the greatest short stories padded in the history of English literature, a great forty page novella tacked on to the end of a mediocre 300 page epic. Indeed most of the parts set in revolutionary Paris are quite interesting, but unfortunately these are overshadowed by the fact that the vast majority of the story takes place in London, where astonishingly little happens. Still if you like your action and plot twists served with a large helping of melodrama then this is probably the book for you."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"While I was reading this book, I found that it was very hard to follow if you are trying to read it in a short amount of time. I Also could tell that it was an excellent story and very interesting and thought provoking. I firmly believe that if you have the time to do so this is definately one of the best books you can read. Without a time limit that you have to finish reading it by this could easily be anybody's favorite book."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"This was an excellent book. It is my favorite of all of Dickens's books, and is extremely interesting. It is, however, not an easy read and those who are looking for a book that will not take them a long time to read should probably consider another book. The book is about the French revolution on a large scale, but if you go in to depth then you will be able to learn a lot about human relationships and human nature. A strong and eloquent book, I greatly enjoyed this Charles Dickens classic."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"This book virtually had no recognizable point for the first several hundred pages. When a distinguishable storyline actually appeared, I was able to follow, but had absolutely no clue who the characters were. I admit the last 1/3 of the book was very intriuging, but it could be severly condensed. Too much plot excess."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"I had to read this book for my English class and it was a pretty good book. It's kind of hard to follow through with in the beginning but once you get going on the book, it was pretty good. If you're interested in the late 1700s and 1800s, it's a book for you. It has a lot about the Bastille and Gullotine It seems like Dickens runs his mouth on and on though about a lot of nothing sometimes but it turns out that the book isn't that bad. My classmates made fun of his writing, they say that he gets paid per word that's why he writes so much and elaborates on every single chapter. This is a book that you need to read and find out for yourself if you like it or not."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"I just read 'A Tale of Two Cities' in my high school gifted English class. I must say that I loved it! Not only did Dickens capture the &quot;truth&quot; of the French Revolution, but also the culture of the time. How Lucie faints(which &quot;ladies&quot; of the time did), the horrible judicial conditions, etc. It was also interesting that Dickens separated the book into 3 different parts. Some authors do that to symbolize past, present, and future. Also the fact that most of the characters have a twin(Carton and Darnay, Lucie and her mother, etc). The many references to religion and the bible[Jerry Cruncher compared to Jesus Christ(JC)-not a coincidence]. I do agree though that the beginning of the story was a bit slow, but so was the beginning of the revolution.

A Tale of Two Cities is very &quot;wordy&quot;, not unlike many of his other books. However, the deep meaning that Dickens conveys cannot be missed. He wanted to expose the social injustices that happened around him as well as to him when he was a boy. He is the ultimate advocator of the poor and thus respect should be given to both him and his work. His charaters are some of the deepest and most developed that I have seen in literature"},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"I didn't know what I was getting into when my ninth grade Honors English teacher assigned &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot; to the class.

I'm sorry, but I am not a fan of extremely intricate plots and multiple themes and allusions gallore. &quot;Why did I read it then?&quot;, one might ask. The answer is simple...school. I disaprove of the way literature is taught in high schools. Reading is a must, but, in my opinion, the subject should be completely up to the student. This is most certainly not a book for younger readers, with all it's confusing elements and violence. People who heave completed their education might enjoy this book...or not.

It is a very depressing story, but is also a story that illustrates the power of the human sprit wnen ordinary people do extraordinary deeds. The depressing lives of the poor people who live in the slums are very well described, and are compared to the extravigant and opulant lives of the \\"Aristocrates\\" who would view a poor person in the same light as they view a stray dog. Human life has no value. When the poor begin to rise up againist their oppressors, the poor treat the aristocrates in the same way as they were treated, namely with the gillotine. Bloodshed, death and unfairness are the three words that describe this book. I enjoyed this book, but I will not read it again.

There the lives of two very different men, Charles Darnay, an exiled French aristocrat, and Sydney Carton, a disreputable but brilliant English lawyer, become enmeshed through their love for Lucie Manette. From the tranquil roads of London, they are drawn against their will to the vengeful, bloodstained streets of Paris at the height of the Reign of Terror, and they soon fall under the lethal shadow of La Guillotine.Disclaimer: Well this review is a tad bit different from my others. I wrote this originally for extra credit and to fill my time in one of my classes. So in the review I am pretending to be a reviewer when the novel was first published!Book Review for the Times of London.The latest installment Dickens has added to his repertoire of novels is A Tale of Two Cities. The novel takes place in two cities London and France The Tension is thick in the opening scene and the air of mystery you could cut with a knife. As always the twist you won't see coming and Dickens makes sure you shed a tear or two.The novel has a great flow and the amount of quality writing is very much appreciated. Their is a scene with a wine cask breaking that foreshadows the coming French Revolution and the blood that will be shed throughout the story. The last novel that Dickens wrote was a complete flop but this one was something I found to be a complete gem. Dickens left the reader guessing through most of the book, but it wasn't annoying for he added incredible imagery describing events and scenery. the foreshadowing made me have so many questions and my answers were time after time incorrect.Sydney Carton was my favorite character. In the beginning I didn't enjoy reading about him. At the end though and I guess I could say the middle as well where he really grew as a character. I haven't yet read or met a more dynamic character like Sydney that was this heroic in Dickens's writing yet.Charles Dickens did more character development with Sydney in two lines than most authors ever are able to pull off in a whole book.Dickens tended to be a bit of a drama queen at parts and I found myself doing many mental eye rolls. I really did not like Darnay and Lucie. They stayed static and flat (Packet 11). Their is no change, and I honestly have no idea how anyone could think Darnay was a protagonist (Packet 65). I would have like to see more relationships grow. Also to help that out and in general, I needed more dialogue. While there was some present the use of extra would have held my attention even more. It was evident that Jerry Cruncher was supposed to be funny and he was, but as a woman and man making his wife cower in fear is no laughing matter.Overall Dickens has created another timeless classic for his readers. I think you will find this historical novel surpasses the last one by the height of a mountain. The vocabulary and language of the novel will be great to use to impress the others at the next opera or ball. On your next trip in to the shops skip the cigars and ribbons and pick up A Tale of Two Cities."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"Dickens can be a little hard to read, but I really love this story and downloaded it to my Kindle to read again. I would like to read it yet again in the plain English version that I found online."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"It was a great download; i did not have any trouble with it and i have it in my kindle whenever i want to read it."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"It is typical classic but still interesting and Kindle is good economical and physical solutions for we Japanese to read good English classic titles"},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"The only reason I gave this book two stars instead of one is because I AM actually very interested in the French Revolution (and this book almost killed that for me). But I just COULD NOT get into this book! I tried very hard, but ultimately, I had to toss it. The language.... .... everything. Its so boring and wordy! I just cannot understand how this is considered an amazing piece of literature. I feel very guilty about this review because society has made me feel as though I should enjoy reading a Charles Dickens' \\"classic\\"... but I cannot deny it any longer. This sucked."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"Charles Dickens wrote many classics and this is one but it very much needed a good editor to put most of it on the chopping block.As many know Charles Dickens was payed for each word, this causes overly drawn out descriptions every detail, freckle volume of laughter is described. Many of these things are then repeated. The dialogue also tends to be overly verbose. This causes the reader to get BORED.Difficulty wise this book is hard for those who are not proficient or advanced readers not only because of the confusing old style language, but also because of those long drawn out passes Plot is pretty straightforward and predictable throughout the book. The positive is Dickens did capture down and out London and as a period piece it is compelling. He also is able to build some suspenseful and intriguing scenes involving getting people out of prison or simply staying alive. The madness of mobs was potrayed well too. Just wish it was half as long."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"reallt it is a nice book .. so long and exciting ..

Together, the three of them are trying to live a new life in London. But they find themselves drawn back to Paris during the Revolution and learn the hard way that the new rulers of France are at least as dangerous as the old ones."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"Everybody Loves LucieIn psychology, a theory called Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs explains the steps to reach self actualization which is a state similar to nirvana. The prerequisites are steps of \\"love or belonging\\" and \\"esteem\\". \\"Love or Belonging\\" refers to caring and having a stable relationship with friendship and family. The step \\"esteem\\" explains that one has confidence, respect by others and selfless character. Though Charles Dickens was not a psychologist, he created a set of characters that proved Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs more plausible. Furthermore in A Tale of Two Cities, Doctor Manette, Sydney Carton, and Mr. Lorry were evident characters who reached self actualization through resurrection by Lucie.Once Lucie helped resurrect her father, Doctor Manette consequently became more alive and aware of life. Doctor Manette returned from the dead, after eighteen years in solitude prison. Doctor Manette was described to have \\"sunken cheek, cadaverous colour, emaciated hands and figures\\", which illustrated how dead he became through those years. His social skills were lost and he easily isolated himself from society as shown through his acquaintance with Mr. Lorry. When Mr. Lorry asked business questions to Doctor Manette, \\"the faintness of [Doctor Manette] was pitiable and dreadful\\" as he replied to Mr. Lorry. Accordingly, he cannot continue conversations and also draws from society by making shoes. However, Doctor Manette shows the life he most likely had before imprisonment when Mr. Lorry introduced his long lost daughter, Lucie. Contrasting to the indifferent responses from Doctor Manette in Mr. Lorry's conversation, Manette has \\"some pleasure in the mere sound of his daughter's voice, and invariably [turns] to it when she spoke\\". As life becomes more valuable to Doctor Manette with his daughter in his life, the gloomy shadow upon his face gradually faded. He finally has a family to care for and loves, and consequently cares for others as he was \\"thus steady and confident\\" to defend Charles Darnay in his second trial. Also his mysterious work of shoes ended which connected to his dead and isolated experience in prison. In the end, Doctor Manette reached self actualization in effect of his resurrection with the help of his daughter's presence.In addition, an alcoholic lawyer, Sydney Carton, is resurrected from a self centered and jackal life to a life in self actualization. Sydney Carton had no purpose in life regardless of his superior educational and occupational background. He lived with a firm belief that he cares \\"for no man on earth and no man on earth cares for\\" him. Obviously Mr. Carton lived in a self centered life and cared not for a social life. Charles Dickens not only illustrates Mr. Carton as a lonesome and emotionally insecure man, but as repetitious. Due to the lack of aspiration, Carton is \\"an amazingly good jackal, and that he rendered suit and service to Stryver in that humble capacity\\". As Mr. Carton silently works for Stryver, Mr. Carton seems as he does not control his life completely. Along with his negative characteristics, he is inept to fit with society socially. Mr. Carton stood alone excluded from the circle when the men congratulated Darnay outside the court even though Darnay's release was made possible by Mr. Carton's help. Fortunately, Carton revitalizes his life when he is acquainted with Lucie. Regardless of Stryver's advice about marriage, Sydney Carton finds love that ultimately allows him to arise from his lifeless years. He changed from being self centered to \\"embrace any sacrifice for [Lucie] and for those dear to [her]\\". In the end, Carton chooses what he truly wants for himself, which is not his repetitious routine, and takes a risk to save Darnay. All in all, Sydney Carton, who initially was lifeless being self-centered, repetitious and a jackal, was resurrected to a true life by his love for Lucie.A similar character to Mr. Carton, Mr. Lorry, a man of business, found self actualization through resurrection, which made him selfless as a character. Mr. Lorry could be interpreted to have a dead life, unlike Doctor Manette with physical appearance, but more similar to Mr. Carton, who had internal conflict. His problem was as confessed his character as \\"a man of business\\" and therefore he \\"has no time for them, [and] no chance of them\\". Throughout the beginning and even the middle of the novel, Charles Dickens emphasizes the business characteristic of Mr. Lorry. Even when he shares a conversation with Lucie, his business character shows and excludes emotions. Dickens portrayal of Mr. Lorry as a robot who is too involved in his work suggests a way of life that is undesirable. Eventually, the relationship between Mr. Lorry and Doctor Manette along with Lucie resurrects Mr. Lorry from his insignificant life to a life full of purpose and selflessness. Evidently, Mr. Lorry makes \\"arrangements to absent himself from Tellson's for the first time in his life\\" to supervise Doctor Manette, which shows his interest in people, not business. Mr. Lorry, whose thoughts were all about work for Tellson's Bank decides to devote his time and attention to Doctor Manette and Lucie. Therefore, Mr. Lorry surpassed his selfishness and business character by resurrection with the help of his relationship with Lucie, and in effect found self actualization.Though the early lives of Doctor Manette, Sydney Carton, and Mr. Lorry are considered undesirable because of their fatigued physical appearance or self centered, selfish, isolated characteristics, they changed to have a enhanced life, measured by the stages of Maslow's Hierarchy theory. The characteristics in the early lives of the characters are closely related as if they were dead, because of their undesirable traits. However, Lucie helped resurrect Doctor Manette, Sydney Carton and Mr. Lorry to realize the value of life."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"I have already heard several reviews for this book, hearing of those who hate it and those who love it.

I like American authors more. To be even more biased, I like 20th Century American authors (Hemingway, Henry Miller, Fitzgerald, Michener, et cetera). Dickens wasn't completely talent-free, but for pete's sake, this book wasn't all that good.I'd feel much more enriched if we'd spent a month in my sophomore year studying &quot;A Farewell To Arms&quot; than this, if we have to stick to books about wars.

You could take out the entire middle of the book and still know exactly what the plot was.

I bought this for my 13 year old since she likes to read and hopes she enjoys it as much as I did."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"A magnificent tale!'A Tale of Two Cities' is one of my favorite Dickens' novels. Although set in London and Paris, most of story deals with the turmoil in France in the late 1700s. The glory days of Louis XIV are over and the starving populace is not only out for food, but also for revenge after years of abuse and virtual slavery. Unfortunately, as is often the case in perilous times, many innocent people get caught up in the conspiracy theories of the revolution's overzealous patriots; and thus the setting for the heroes of this tale is set.Well written and evenly paced, this novel will hold your attention through to the very end. Character development is superb as Dickens able to create real-life characters not only for the wrongly accused, but also for those caught up in the 'meting out of justice'.A sad, but beautiful novel; a tale of hope and tragedy, in this most infamous period of French history. 5 Stars."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"Charles Dickens, who lived from 1812 to 1870, is the best know male English writer of the 19th century. He authored 22 novels plus numerous short pieces. Most of his writing was first written in serialized form, later published as single novels.A young Dickens at the age of 12 had the unenviable job of attaching labels 10 hours a day at the Warren's boot blacking factory. That experience shaped much of his writing career. Still in his teens he became a law clerk, then later in his twenties a journalist. The last job as a reporter led to the serialized writing of his novels. His works were social commentaries with larger than life characters, or colorful caricatures, living in the slums of London. He was a critic of poverty, social injustice, and the slow moving court system.Those themes permeate most of his novels. A few novels are different, including the present A Tale of Two Cities, written towards the end of his writing career. This is a historical novel set in England and France during the years leading up to the French Revolution, starting around the year 1775. At first glance it appears less complicated than his other works, but on closer inspection one will find that the novel is relatively complicated. It is a three part story with time shifting and with many characters, and with lots of intrigue and drama.Without giving away critical plot elements - and it is a complicated plot which most will have trouble remembering anyway - the story opens in England as a bank representative, Lorry, travels to Dover to meet a young woman, Lucie Manette. They proceed to Saint Antoine near Paris in search of Lucie's father, Dr. Manette, who was in prison, but who has now been released. During the incarceration, he has lost his mind.Action then shifts back to England, five years later, to the trial of Chalres Darnay for spying. Lucie and her father testify at the trial. Darnay is acquitted and released. In Paris, Darnay's uncle, the Marquis, is involved in a street accident and other plot elements. Back in England, Darnay marries Lucie. Then, Darnay returns to Paris to help a friend of the Marquis and is imprisoned as an emigrant or aristocrat. The rest of the novel involves the return to Paris of Lucie, her father, and Lorry, and their struggle to get Darnay released. Will they be able to free him from prison or will he be executed?Beyond the intrigue and drama, the novel is a vehicle for Dickens to describe the horrors of the French Revolution in a serial form, later made into a novel.I enjoyed the read and would recommend the book."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"Dickens's prose is a pleasure to read; it almost makes the story worth reading independent of ... the story. Thankfully, his large cast of characters is interesting and well developed (and some of them are even admirable), and his story inspires. The novel opens with a French doctor being released after many years locked in the French Bastille (for reasons unknown) and reunited with his daughter who thought he was dead. Years later, when the French Revolution begins, they and their loved ones become deeply involved against their will.The author vividly paints a picture of the violent spirit of vengeance felt by the poor at the time of the French Revolution. Juxtaposed on this is a tale of love and - most powerfully - of redemption, of someone becoming more than he'd ever been before in the service of a greater good: \\"It is a far, far better thing that I do, then I have ever done.\\"I found one part (when a couple of French characters are introduced) somewhat confusing, but that didn't hinder my grasping the gist and thoroughly enjoying this tale. Although the story isn't tense throughout and occasionally his flowery descriptions tire, Dickens builds our apprehension throughout the final section of the book to a breath-taking and moving climax."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"In Charles Dickens' novel, A Tale of Two Cities, he makes it clear as to what his views are of the revolution with his ample descriptions of the crowds of revolutionaries, but what readers may fail to see is how he incorporates the revolution into each of his characters. True, some of the crowd's actions were savage and brutal, but given the period, I would say that Dickens gives a rather balanced and insightful perspective from both sides of the revolution. The first and most notable being that of the disgruntled citizen willing to participate in a governmental reform, and the other the pompous rich upper class, or the aristocrats, who wish to keep their corrupt form of politics. In this novel Charles Dickens shows his audience that everything has a purpose and whether they have come to a realization of that purpose or not, they are willing to sacrifice their lives for that purpose.Dickens' use of arguments on both sides of the revolution are acted upon two chief characters, the first and foremost being the mobs of revolutionaries, who dedicate themselves and bleed for their idea that their blinded by the rashness of their actions. These people are also so fickle in their loyalty that they will turn on anyone who opposes their ideas. When the revolutionaries gain power in Book the Third, there now exists such violence and madness displayed by them, that I see them more as beasts then people. Dickens says, \\"False eyebrows an false moustaches were stuck upon them, and their hideous countenances were all bloody and sweaty, and all awry with howling, and all staring and glaring with beastly excitement and want of sleep.\\"(3.259) This quote symbolizing two aspects in my opinion, the amount of bloodshed they are willing to sacrifice for their ideals and their madness in accomplishing their task. The second being that character of Charles Darnay, a man so doomed by his family's actions that his innocence represents that which may have lain underneath the foul aristocracy. Darnay renounces his family status and wealth just so he can prove that he was no friend of the old government. Nevertheless, through the crowd's rashness Darnay ends up getting the short side of the stick, being arrested twice and be doomed to the guillotine. Darnay may also represent the hopelessness of any uncorrupted soul of the former government, and Dickens portrays him well enough to get his point across.Dickens uses a character's sacrifice to explain that everything has a purpose in life. When Dr. Manette is \\"recalled to life\\"(1. 8), he is given a new purpose to live by Dickens, the purpose to fight for both his sanity and to help Darnay. Manette's character is an intelligent one, encompassing the aspects of a citizen who doesn't much care for the way things are done, but when it comes to his family, he will fight until every breath in his body is gone. Sydney Carton is a dynamic character in this novel because he recognizes his purpose and acts on this recognization to save the lives of those whom he cares about. Each character is able to recognize their purpose regardless of which side of the revolution they are on and because of it, as a reader, I can see their though processes in their actions.I believe this novel adequately portrays the revolution from both perspectives and tracts its movement through certain characters in this novel. Dickens novel may have been confusing and full of unneeded dialogue at a first glance, but as I looked deeper I saw the true meaning he was trying to get across. Sacrifice, for their own ideals, that's what he wanted people to see, how to stay on the right path in accomplishing their goals."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"Along with reading, we listened to several of the audiotapes.

I read this story in high-school and didn't enjoy it much at that time, but reread it recently (15 years later). I appreciated it much more the second time.

Dickens' writing is precise, descriptive and resonant.Starting with arguably the most well known opening paragraph in literature, TOTC has some memorable characters: the Defarges, the Jacquerie, Lucie & her father, Darnay, etc. Dickens' style - formal and detailed - characterises the \\"season of darkness\\" and \\"winter of despair\\" during the French revolution.I found this more serious than Dickens' other works. Darker, and lacking the humour of the characters who struggle from the streets and orphanages to riches. This doesn't diminish the quality, but don't expect a cheerful, uplifting read."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"The beautiful intricacy of the plot, the daunting scale of Carton's task, the selfless sacrifice of a man deemed irredeemable, the last words spoken in a breath of glory, the disappointment of Lucy's husband or the man who was very bit redeemable, the gentle acceptance of a hand scorned by compassion...these are breathtaking elements that Dickens wrote and that I love. I will admit that the first few chapters seemed to never end and were confusing. Yet when you read that last line, when you finally let your breathe go, when you realize that this book is not words on a page but the puzzle of life's quest for hope and worthiness, those first few chapters are but boons from literature. This book is worth it. It is worth the time and the confusion and the frustation because of the realization."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"A Tale of Two Cities was the first difficult book I have ever read. At first I couldn't understand what was going on. Dickens' use of imagery clouded my mind. However, upon reading it further, the book started to flow better. I actually read ahead of the class because the story started to become interesting. My favorite thing that Dickens does is the way he puts something in the story that doesn't seem very relevant at the point, but turns out being very important such as Madame Defarge's \\"knitting.\\" I also liked his way of foreshadowing like with the street lamps in the beginning.This book even helps with history and the French Revolution.

It's also a stellar historical novel with its backdrop of the French Revolution.A Tainted Dawn: The Great War (1792-1815) Book I"},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"I feel that this book is not viewed as being one of the top tier of Dickens works due to the fact that it is thrust upon grade 9 students as an introduction to literary classics and, being so, its impact and overall cultural power has become diluted due to the audience that initially received it. It is not in regards to the content of the work itself. The intellectual abilities of students of this educational level are not able to understand the historical era, appreciate the fluent descriptive nature of the writing nor to comprehend the literary nuances that the author presents. In sum, it starts out with a less than average evaluation, by a less than receptive audience, and never fully recovers from it. A similar writing that undergoes an equally unfair youth-driven summary is that of \`Silas Marner'.\\"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times. etc....\\" Dickens in his introductory remarks clearly lays out the tone for the rest of his historical novel; everything that is presented has two different and opposing definitions depending solely on how one views life's occurrences. What appears to be a revolution to overcome decades of elitist oppression to some, appears to be a retaliatory blood bath to others and who the people that appear to be the heroes of a just and timely uprising to some, appear to be no more than blood thirsty criminals to others. The contrast that Dickens verbally paints for us goes that much deeper; the calm and serene life in England vs. the agitated emotional level of Paris, the significant differences between the French and English Tellson Banks operations, and the respect of the ruling elite of London for the utter disdain for Paris's monsignors. Couple these contrasts with Dickens's literary description of the guttural smells and aromas of death and revenge, the pathos and vengeance felt throughout Paris and the contrasting peace and calm experienced in London and you have a novel that highlights the dichotomy that life was during this era. The dividing line to how one viewed life was simply from where you viewed it. The English Channel was the line of demarcation and it solely depended on which side of it one resided to determine how one defined life itself.\\"It is a far, far better thing that I do than I have ever done. etc....\\" Dickens closes his tale in the same manner in which he began it; contrasting definitions. Sidney Carton, the drudgery of mankind who overdrinks, sells his soul to the highest paying litigant and resides in the gutters of society is the man who sacrifices himself for all that is pure, loving and honorable in life. He gives up his life such that the woman from whom he experiences unrequited love may go on and obtain the life that he realizes that he would never have.No, this is not the tale we thought it was when we were forced to absorb its contents during our early high school years. But, yet, the overall opinions regarding this historical novel reflect our early formed and juvenile opinions. This, instead, is one of Charles Dickens most powerful and engrossing tales of human existence, belonging to not only a tier#1 level of Dickens's novels but a tier #1 level of all English literature.It is always the best of times.

This Dickens masterwork is filled with all the elements of a great redemption story. The novel is set in Paris and London during the French Revolution, spanning from 1775 to 1792. Prior to the revolution, the French aristocrats abused and suppressed the poor at every opportunity. Rather than using their positions of power and wealth to care for the poor, they showed themselves to be animals. During and shortly after the revolution, the pendulum swings. The blood-thirsty peasants, drunk with the power of the guillotine, massacre anyone and everyone with the slightest link to the former aristocracy. There is daily bloodshed as people loose their heads, often the result of sham trials. The people sing and rejoice as the blood flows in the streets. In their lust for power and in the name of egalite, the peasants show themselves to be even more barbaric than the aristocrats.Amid all of this bloodshed, malice and destruction, Dickens paints a marvelous picture of redemption. He shows it for what it truly is - brutally complicated and sickeningly messy. Just before the revolution, a young aristocrat named Charles Darnay denounced his aristocratic lineage and moved to London where he became a teacher of French language and literature. In his new, modest life, he married Lucie Manette, the daughter of a French medical doctor. Lucie and her father were also living in London. Dr. Manette had previously and wrongly been imprisoned in the Bastille for eighteen years. For various reasons, the three find themselves back in Paris in 1792 right in the middle of the post-revolution bloodbath. Darnay's family history is discovered and he is quickly imprisoned. He committed no crime. He was imprisoned simply because of who he was. Dr. Manette, beloved among the republicans because of his Bastille experience, offered testimony in Darnay's defense. Darnay was set free. In a sense, you could say that Darnay was redeemed by the pain suffered by Dr. Manette. But, the redemption was not a lasting redemption.Before the family could leave Paris, a particularly evil person (referred to as the daughter of the Devil) brings a new set of charges against Darnay. This time, the good doctor's testimony is not sufficient to save him. No, in this case, the only way Darnay can escape his sentence is for a substitute to stand in for him - a Redeemer. In the end, Dickens masterfully tells this story of redemption and of the redeemer, an unexpected person who willingly stands in the accused's place at the guillotine and takes the punishment for him. It is a brutal and disturbing story. Man is shown at his best and worst. The reader is left in wonder at the power of redemption and shocked at the grand divide between good and evil."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"We needed this for a prop for our play.

If you like the challenge, this book is for you and the pay off is worth it. Classic characters who are symbollic of love and sacrifice contrast with those who are the personification of revenge and hatred and all its damaging effects.

The novel was first published in 1859 in a serial fashion and it starts out exemplifying the evils of the French nobility in 1775. A former prisoner from the Bastille is displayed and shows him being rescued from France, calling it a rebirth. Dickens was born in 1812 during the Napoleonic Wars, he must have known of the Seven Years war, in which France lost and also lost most of its North American holdings. France won most of its battles during the Napoleonic wars until it attempted to invade Russia, it was forced to retreat and later lost the decisive battle of Waterloo. Then there was the French revolution, seeded during the American revolution, and culminated with the beheading of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette in 1793. The novel does not progress thar far, it only extends to 1789, 1790 with the storming of the Bastille and abolition of titles of nobility. Reign of terror starts.The story contrasts the life of some of the people of the two cities. London plods on its own way, upholding the rights of its citizens and its laws. Paris is a whirlpool of violence, disregard of law and order, trial by citizen courts with no set rules, no admission of evidence and the belief of the poor people's statements over anything the nobility could do to contradict these statements. At least according to Dickens. First he shows absolute power of the nobility, then he assigns this power to tribunals and spies.The rebirth at the start is followed years later with a member of the nobility killing a child, then is himself murdered by the child's father. In between the nobleman and his nephew have a fews words, the nephew has renounced all claim to the title and estates, his uncle sneers at him for doing so and is murdered that night. The murderer is caught and killed horribly, the story reverts to England and the nephew marries the daughter of the man introduced in the beginning as a rebirth. Later, due to the renunciation of his claim to nobility by the now wedded man, he decides to go to France. When he does so he is imprisoned and tried as an emigrant. When found guilty his father-in-law uses his respect gained from being a freed prisoner from the Bastille to obtain his freedom. But he is rearrested, retried, and sentenced to death. He is unable to obtain his freedom legally under the new rules, his father-in-law is helpless, even is a plaintiff against him. But a lover of Lucie's, Darnay's wife, sacrifices himself to give a great British ending to the story."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"This classic novel begins with the most famous opening paragraph in all of literature and ends with the greatest closing lines as well. What a story of intrigue, history, romance and redemption!"},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"Having read &quot;Bleak House&quot; and &quot;Great Expectations&quot; for fun, and &quot;Hard Times&quot; for class, and having loved all of them, I was expecting that this would be equally good. But no - I ended up bogged down in a shapeless morass of obscure minor characters and plot details. In fact, believe it or not, I ended up going through about ten pages at a time, getting frustrated, and turning it back to reread the end of the chapter &quot;Still Knitting&quot; (some of the finest prose I've ever seen, in spite of its origin).In short: five, ten, a hundred stars for the characterizations and the wonderful prose! Zero stars for the plot - or, more accurately, for the plot if you read it too quickly. I'm sure that it's comprehensible if you read it nice and slowly.I'm going to give it another go - maybe I'll enjoy it more this time. All I can say is, TAKE IT SLOWLY, and make sure you catch every detail; reading for meaning is most important here.

The opening paragraph is one of the greatest in all of literature and it sets the stage for an unforgettable tale. The plot is amazing and Dickens seamlessly incorporates the violence of the French Revolution into the story. This novel clearly illustrates the causes of the violent upheaval and yet presents it with the charm and life of a Victorian novel. The uncontrollable passion of Madame Defarge is frightening yet understandable and of course Dr. Manette and Lucie are the ideal father and daughter. And Carton, who can forget him! Dickensian imagery is always captivating, but never more so than in this story. The first few chapters seemed a tad confusing, but the entire thing nicely connected together at the end. Darnay seemed overly idealistic, after all who in the right minds would risk their lives to save some servant. But barring that minor flaw, this book is one of the world's great masterpieces."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"I'm 36 and just read this book for the first time! I believe I will be crying for years! I enjoy looking for the Christ references and symbolism in so many of Sydney Carton's scenes. For instance: the last chapter is called, &quot;The Footsteps Die Out Forever.&quot; I wondered, the footsteps are those Lucie fancied would come into her and her father's life -- why should they die out with Carton? If you look back into the footsteps chapter in the house in Soho, you see that Carton says of those footsteps, &quot;I take them into mine! I ask no questions and make no stipulations.&quot; When he dies for Darnay, he takes the fury of the mob onto himself, out of love sparing Lucie and the lives she loves. When Carton is sitting by the fire with Mr. Lorry, in the moments after he has made the deal with Barsad, the description of his appearance -- dark, long, shaggy hair; very pale; the wasted look; the handsome features; the expression of a prisoner -- are surely meant to evoke Christ. Even the white topcoat and boots -- the paleness of the shoulders and feet -- are surely meant to evoke the image of christ on the cross, don't you think? And, when Carton is comforting the little seamstress as they wait on the scaffold, she practically makes the identification, saying he seems to have been sent to her by heaven, and enables her to think of &quot;Him who was put to death.&quot;Are there many, or even any, thoughts, incidents, descriptions, or images wasted in the book? Nothing there, it seems, but that it is significant. The theme of Carton's life, death, and resurrection (you might say), are elaborated a hundred ways as he ruminates during his last solitary walk around Paris: each experience, each thought he has, each remembrance is meaningful. I cannot even think of these passages during my workday without a swell of emotion.I could not make a thing out of Carton's name, until at last I read that &quot;Sydney&quot; is derived from St. Denis, itself derived from Dionysius. In addition, St. Denis was the patron saint of Paris, who died from beheading. Can anyone corroborate this?This is the book for someone seeking great and profound themes, characters (Carton, at least,) so real you could touch them, considerable artistic merit, and possibly a refreshed or even changed outlook on life!"},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"I was required to read this book in a class I was taking.

The story line, which at times is complicated, manily focusus on one man, Charles Darnay. Darnay's life is not an easy one. It begins in France where he resided with his uncle. After a dispute, Darnay leaves his homeland, his family, and part of himself in France while he moves to England. There, he met and fell in love with Lucie Manette, a young woman who cares for her mentally ill father. They began their own life together until the revoulution began. Then, it was trouble. But thanks to the courage and strength of a lonely man, Sydney Carton, things work out for the best. At times the book drags on. With a total of 45 chapters divided into three books, A Tale of Two Cities takes time, patience, and concentration to read. The book brings out various emotions. At time the reader may feel happy for all the postive things, sadness for the pain and suffering of the characters, or even anger for the deadly outcome of the revoultion.

Readers must keep in mind that the intention of Dicken's in this book was that the historical events would create the story not the characters. That is why this book in a way is his most descriptive book, as far a describing or creating scenaries. So that the reader should feel and picture himself as if present during the French revolution which in itself is no less a duanting task and a work of art. Anyone who is a bigfan of classics or Dickens especially the victorian era should read this book. It contradicts some of the literary critics who accused Dicken's to have flat characters, Sydney Carton was definately not a flat character. It should be a rewarding experience to read this book for a reader of the classical mindset."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"On a whole Charles Dickens once again has mastered the literary aspect of a novel. The &quot;Tale Of Two Cities&quot; was a Filled with twists and turns and with every new chapter the plots depth deepened. Madame Defarge was a bitter women and her need for revenge was in evidence through the entire book. It struck me as a horrible thing to be so filled with hate that it would spill over to people that were so evidently pure of heart. But that is what happens when you let yourself become so blinded with hate. Sydneys Life went from a charachter of self-centered living to one of sacrifice and love for others what a woderful witness. An example of what some people think was Christ's life and death. But in the end good does prevail. Good things can and do happen, but not without a price."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"A Tale of Two cities was boring until you got to about page 300. At that point, all the information that you have come across earlier in the book is tied together and suspence is added. I recommend the book to those who have time on their hands and an extended vocabulary."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"I think the book was very complex and hard to start off, the book continually rotated settings from London to Paris and Paris to London. But as the book continued the it becomes more interesting and the plot connects together, putting suspense and the utter most thrill in the story.Dickens made the book very discriptive so that everything can set out in your mind. He made the characters individually have their own personality, some good, some bad, and even ones that change drastically and unexpected which would probably be the reason that the book was so rividing. I felt as if the French Revolution came alive with its violent reflection of the revolting of the lower class and the DeFarges, expecially Mrs. Defarge and the other women who had more rage in them, because they were also looked down upon men. Also the relationship of love and hate expressed in all the characters in the story, made the book easier to understand how they felt."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"I read this novel during a class on Victorian Literature some time ago. It turned out to be the last novel we read for the semester and I was not looking forward to it after trudging through Thomas Hardy and other intensly depressing authors.However, Dickens surprised me. I should have known, since Dickens is a brilliant author - proven by time.Anyway - &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot; is a wonderful novel. The character development is extraordinary and one can't help but feel sympathetic towards the characters. This novel will keep you involved 'til the end. It being the first Dickens' novel I read, inspired me to read several more and I would recommend each, but especially &quot;A Tale of Two Cities.&quot; It is by far my favorite to date. Dickens is simply a master of story telling and &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot; is one of his greatest works.Again - I strongly recommend this book to anyone who is looking for an intriguing novel written by a brilliant author."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"This story occurs during the terrible time of the French Revolutionary War where corruption, bloodshed and poverty run rapid. The story takes place in two countries, England and France. It all started in England when Jarvis Lorry, the businessman meets with Lucy Manette, a beautiful young lady, to tell her that her long lost father had been found. Doctor Mr. Manette was a prisoner of the Bastille for eighteen years and this gives him great authority over the French prisoners later in the story. The phase, \\" recalled to life\\" is used as a code to refer to the release of Mr. Manette. Two men by the names of Charles Darney and Sydney Carton also fell in love with Lucy Manette but Lucy ended up marrying Darney. Her devotion to her husband, Charles Darney, brings her great misery when he is imprisoned for his secret life of being a French noble. Charles Darney's family was the one that put Dr. Manette in jail and took the lives of two innocent people, which are the father and brother of Madame Defarge. She being a revengeful person tried her very best to get Darney and his family put to death by the guillotine. After Charles Darney was sentenced to death, only one man can save him that is Sydney Carton who looked exactly like Darney. He decided to use his life for the happiness of the woman - Lucy Manette, he loved deeply and for his friend, Darney.A character in the book I like most:The person, who I admired and who left me with deep feelings, is none other than Sydney Carton. He was a great man who sacrificed his life and everything for the woman he loved. He was intelligent but due to his laziness and constant drinking, he had not been a success in life. Being pessimistic, Carton thus thought that he was useless and that he had never done good for everyone. He was wrong. In the trial of Charles Darney in the earlier part of the story, it was his ingenious idea that saved Darney from being imprisoned. He and Darney were so alike in looks that everyone on court was shocked and due to this, the judge had to release him because of the lacking in evidence. His devotion to Lucy Manette was indeed admirable. He loved her so much that he promised he would die for her and in the end he really did. When Lucy Manette and Charles Darney got married and had their first child, Sydney Carton though heart-broken at first, came to their house very often, buying gifts for the child and playing with him for hours. This shows how caring and generous he was. Towards the end, he cunningly use John Barsad who was a spy to help him get into the dungeons to save Charles Darney who was sentenced to death for being a noble. Carton forced Darney to take off his clothes and change into his. Then, he knocked out Darney and called for the guards to take him out. He wanted to replace Darney and to die for him! Reading at this point, I was deeply touched and impressed by Carton's actions. He wanted to die for Darney so that Lucy will be happy. He sacrificed his life for his friend and his love! He was a genius and if he not been so pessimistic and so lacking in confidence, he could have made a great name for himself. Forgiveness, sacrificial, devotion... In my life, I had never seen someone like Sydney Carton or even close to him. In this selfish and materialistic world, when most people are pursing money and fame to the extent of backstabbing each other, how many will give up their lives for a friend? How many will have the courage and to give up everything and accept absolutely nothing in return?MINI DATACharacter Study: Physiological Characteristics: - Intelligent - Tall - Devoted - Handsome - Faithful - Young (middle-aged) - Caring - Fit - Generous - No facial hair - Courageous - Short and neat hair - Pessimistic - Lack of confidence - SacrificialReview of the book I had read: \\"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.\\" This is the famous opening line of the great novel, \\" The tale of two cities.\\" Charles Dickens, in this book more than any of his others, twists and sews the plot in circles, keeping the reader in suspense and a state of unknowing--all while the tension continues to build to a climax. Love, betrayal, drama and suspense, the makers of a great novel, are also found in the story. This book starts a little vaguely at first so it's hard to understand what's going on. Some might stop reading at this point but do not do that because you will learn that everything ties together during the second half. Every chapter is special and time must be taken to read it thoroughly to find out the exciting ending. The plot was also very interesting because Dickens mixes fiction, historical facts and events together. Furthermore, the story is well written with fantastic descriptions, making the characters come alive as if the whole event is happening right in front of our eyes. The dramatic ending, which is emotional and powerful, will leave the reader proud of the decision made and sad as it took such a painful price. After reading the story, a clear understanding is achieved of why Charles Dickens is such a renowned author. This classic novel is a unique and great masterpiece of literature. People of any race, age, and gender would definitely enjoy reading it but I think the older readers might be able to interpret the story better as Charles Dickens uses old English to write the story."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"Many of us were forced to read this book in school. Most of us were too young to fully appreciate it. Read it again as an adult. You will savor every moment. The story, the history, the writing style all meld to create a wondrous book.

Upon purchasing this book, several years ago, I admittedly procrastinated when approaching it and I wholeheartedly regret that decision ten-fold. It may not be the most exciting read for most people but the literary content overshadows what in may lack in the thrills department.With lines like &quot; It is a far far better thing I do then I have ever done..... and so forth ( I don't want to ruin it for you ), this Dickens novel greatly enriches the mind and gives the reader a great sense of accomplishment and enlightenment at stories end. To avoid this book would be a tragedy. To read this book will be an experience.

It's one of the greatest books I've read so far. It has everything: love, suspense, drama, politics etc. The way Dickens describes his characters and surroundings is amazing. You can actually feel the atmosphere in those poor streets of Paris. You can feel the fury of the revolution. I've heard so much about this book before, and now I know why it is regarded as a real classic. But reading this won't help you and it certanly won't do the book justice.

This is a very moving story."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"\\"A Tale of Two Cities\\" is a novel many have read and others have claimed to have read, but is completely appreciated by few. A work of historical fiction, this may be Dickens' best known work and most often quoted work. Where \\"Great Expectations\\" lacks realism, \\"A Tale of Two Cities\\" follows a record of historical events. Being so well crafted, it is remarkable the novel was written under the duress of constant deadlines. Following the deadlines of a serial, it would seem easy to digress into fluff.Protagonist Charles Darnay is caught between the parallels of England and France, nobility and peasantry. Though the wording is very plodding at times, readers will expect some twists and be surprised by others. Taking an unlikely bride, Darnay would seem to have reached an equilibrium. But two trials for treason lead to revelations that threaten to tear all that is sacred from him.Known as the villain, Madame Defarge may hold a reputation with some before reading the book. Yet plot details are able to reveal her as a sympthetic character. However, the vile nature of her plotting ultimately corrupts this glimmer.With themes of social justice and the French Revolution in the background, historians have come to aprreciate this work. Those who read the book with less appreciative eyes may overlook the biting humor in the novel. Omitting this aspect is allowing one's self to miss a highlight of the book. It is a novel that has greatness hidden in many places."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"Charles Dickens brings a reader into the midst of war, famine and corruption in his novel A Tale of Two Cities. This story is not the typical heroic rebellion of a wronged people who bring peace to their society, but a bloodthirsty revolution of a desperate, starved peasantry. The detailed imagery of the blood and death of the French Revolution draws a reader into the plot. In the midst of the chaos, Dickens portrays one family, the Manettes, as the pure and innocent contrast to this degraded society. As Dickens writes in a poem of his, \\"the pure, the bright, the beautiful...shall never die\\". In this novel, though a wronged and betrayed group of people take a passionate revenge on its enemies, Charles Dickens never fails to portray the light and hope that survives among the people through his subtle themes of life and redemption. From the \\"digging up of graves\\", (which is really the revival of long forgotten prisoners), to the honest \\"fishing trade\\" of Jerry Cruncher, (the digging up of dead bodies), Dickens reveals the idea of resurrection and restoration to love, light, and human companionship.The characterization Dickens creates through his descriptive imagery is what makes his book unique. Charles Darnay, husband to Lucie Manette, is accused of treachery because of a family connection that the revolutionaries despise. The sinister, unsuspected Madame Defarge, along with her husband Defarge, are merciless to anyone whom they declare an enemy to the revolution. The drunken, wasted Sydney Carton, beyond all hopes of redemption, is in the end brought back to a sober, purposeful life. These unforgettable characters make this tale not only about a war but also about Dickens' view of human nature.The ending of the novel deviates from the revolution itself. It is expected, yet also an abrupt cessation to what is originally a war story. It is argued that Dickens wanted the story to end not with the end of the revolution but with a thought of hope for an end to the war. To find out what the ending is, one must read the book."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"If a book's value can be measured by the opening line's familiarity, this book would be deemed a classic of all time: \\"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness. . .\\" And deservingly so.The two cities are London and Paris. One delivers the best of times, the other the opposite. In fact, in Paris, where much of the last half of the book transpires, very little is good, and very much is the \\"worst.\\"Female characters in books of similar time usually coquettishly observe from the background, occasionally talk amongst themselves, and have little to be deemed great story unless they are coming of age and can discuss their efforts to \\"land a man.\\" That is not true for Madame Dufarge, who packs a pistol and a knife to handle her business. Her daytime highlight is watching the guillotine slaughter others for no particular purpose other than allowing the meek to inherit the Paris in which they had observed obedience for generations.The twists and turns of the plot involve a young couple whose relatives had effectively burdened the other with great emotional stress and hardship. Totally oblivious to their ancestral misgivings, their love continues unharmed by the elders' potential bias. But, that bias can be repressed where the times are best, not where times are worst.And, so the plot continues with more twists and turns, irony often contradicting seemingly vivid reality, through the famous ending when one main character brings forth another great quoted passage with his last words: \\"It is a far, far better thing that I do, than I have ever done; it is a far, far better rest that I go to than I have ever known.\\"Chock full of quotations equally poignant and everlasting as the few displayed here, this book resonates as strongly today as it did centuries ago. Maybe more so as critics of the time did not enjoy this novel as much as schools and teachers do today. This is one book that probably should not be missed."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"This was my first Dicken's novel and was convinced upon completion that it would not be my last. Having done some background reading on the French Revolution was very helpful as well as having an edition that provided endnotes to shed light on the many historical references and nuances that Dicken's masterfully places throughout the book. Without this help, I would not have have understood or experienced the full depth of this story or the message that Dicken's conveys which is one more concerned about the human response rather than the historical impact of the French Revolution. This is not an eaasy casual read. My reccomendation is to do your homework on the French Revolution, reread portions when necessary (don't skim),try to capture and understand the many nuances and references, and most of all savor the wonderful writing. Do this and you will be astounded with recognition of why Charles Dickens is one of the greatest writers ever lived."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"This may be one of the best Dickens novels. Shorter and less character-populated than any other of his books that I've read, it was also the most political. The theme centers around the French Revolution and the complete chaos in Paris at that time - Paris being one of the two cities referenced in the title, the other being London - and how the Revolution affects the lives of four primary characters: a young Englishwoman named Lucie Manette, her father Dr. Alexander Manette, Charles Darnay, a French aristocrat who rebels against his family heritage, and Sydney Carton, an English lawyer. The story begins with the reunion of Lucie and her father after the latter's long political incarceration, and the love that develops between Lucie and Charles Darnay, whom they meet on the journey home from France after Dr. Manette is released. As the Revolution ramps up, Charles also faces incarceration due to his family heritage, even though he had renounced it. Sydney Carton is an assistant to Charles' attorney. Sydney, an embittered man for reasons not really clear, also comes to love Lucie although he realizes that Charles is a better match for her and that her love lies with him. Ironically, the two men bear a strong physical resemblance to one another, a trivial fact that becomes very important later in the story.Just as things seem to be going so well back in England in spite of the turmoil in France, the Revolution soon catches up with the family again, and this time they're ensnared even more firmly than before - in part thanks to a clever but malicious Frenchwoman and revolutionary, Madame DeFarge, who has a serious axe to grind with the family.What stood out the most to me was the evocative portrayal of the social upheaval in Paris during this time. Scenes depicting the storming of the Bastille and the rage-fueled murders of jailed French anti-revolutionaries by peasant mobs were particularly powerful, and really brought that time and place alive for me. Having never looked at the French Revolution and the infamous Reign of Terror through the eyes of the common person on the street, it really illustrated well the fear and distrust everyone had for one another, even neighbors and family members.The ending is one of those that you hope will turn out some other way, yet it also leaves you with a deep appreciation of love and self-sacrifice."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"A Tale of Two Cities is a story about a family and friends dealing with the events of the French revolution. It spans from 1775 to 1793. The main focus of the story is the events before and during the early part of the French revolution. This is what brought my attention to the book in the first place and did not disappoint. Dickens weaves an elaborate plot together between London and Paris (hence the Two cities). Some of the best parts of the book take place in talking about the conditions in France. Dickens gives a fair account of the absolutely poverty the French underclass was made to live in and the obvious anger that it aroused. I also found the storming of the Bastille one of the most exciting and engaging parts of the book. Having not read Dickens in years I had forgotten how magnificent of a writer he was. His descriptions are some of the best you could ever find.That being said, overall I was not a big fan of large parts of this novel. As another reviewer said, it is a classic and is meant to be a character study. I would agree with that but it seemed like one of the most important characters (Sydney Carton) is hardly in large sections of the book. As you reach the end of the book, I find it hard to really sympathize with him. I think Dickens spends too much time in the middle on Dr. Manette and Lucy.I would defiantly recommend this book. I am glad I read it but I do not really have any desire to read it again."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"When it comes to A Tale of Two Cities by Charles Dickens, I was amazed at how many details were put together to form a story that will live on for centuries.

There were many twists and turns in the story that mad me want to keep reading until I reached the end. The end of this magnificent tale was worth all the wait. The story finally made sense.

Thus, as characters are unmasked and their secret connections laid bare, the 21st-century reader may find the plot too convenient. A Tale of Two Cities is no different. Should one possess the capacity to look beyond this, however, one would find that Dickens has masterfully captured the bloodlust of the French Revolution from the both the bourgeoisie and plebeian views.One family must face the barbarous, slaughtering revolutionary mob to save a former aristocrat. The villains are supremely villainous, the hero supremely heroic. Dickens captures the squalor of backstreet Paris, the murderous obsession of its citizens, and the utter helplessness of it's erstwhile elite. It is all tied in a bundle too convenient, but suspension of belief is no hardship given the strength of the story told. A Tale of Two Cities is at one time a history lesson and a powerful literary achievement. It is, as such, required reading and easily merits 5 stars."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"I read the one-star review and was hesitant to purchase this product, but the price was compelling enough, and I bought it. I have been pleasantly surprised by it's quality.The narrator is Frederick Davidson (1932-2005). His back-of-box bio reads: \\"He was born in London, trained at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts and performed in BBC radio plays before coming to America in 1976.\\" He has earned multiple awards, including the Golden Voice Award, numerous AudioFile Earphone Awards, and a Grammy nomination for his readings. His reading of this novel goes beyond simple narration, as opposed to the monotonous readings of other narrators of other audiobooks. He immerses himself into the reading and assigns various tonal qualities & vocal patterns for the various characters, including French and British accents. It is a dramatic performance rather than a simple reading. I continue to find it a delight to listen to while reading my textual copy.As for the one-star rating given before, I cannot understand the comment, \\"He does not vary his voice sufficiently to make it interesting\\". The fact that he DOES take on the different roles in unique vocal patterns and rhythms totally contradicts that claim. Davidson also provides a smooth flow throughout the chapters, providing not just narration, but a dramatic monologue that is reminiscent of Patrick Stewart's one-man-show, \\"A Christmas Carol\\". I have given it only a four star rating due to some background noise I heard in the various discs. It is not terribly noticeable, but does exist nonetheless.All in all, I'm pleased with the price and performance."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"A Tale of Two Cities paints a beautiful while dark story of the French Revolution and how it affects an English family. It is, by all standards, a classic. Yet, if you decide to read it and are younger than a high school senior, I suggest reading it with a good dictionary by your side. It is written in the English of over one-hundred years ago and so I would also recommend a version that includes notes on what certain phrases mean as well as a guide to the allusions used in the story. I am not recommending the abridged version, though. Reading it as it was written gives a much different experience that seems more genuine. The copy of the novel that I read was published by Pocket Books and includes explanatory notes and more which I found very helpful.As I read I saw examples where Dickens (the author), implied satirical messages and themes relevant to the time when the book was written. Then, the situation in England resembled pre-Revolution France. Also, 1848, was known as the \\"Year of Revolutions\\". He may have been trying to discourage revolution and encourage solutions through political change, not violence. Dickens also implied, through his words, that a revolution could happen anywhere, even in England. He encouraged his message frequently but it never got old and wasn't monotonous. By using a variety of different situations, Dickens kept his message in the reader's mind. For example, at a burial of a spy in England, a mob forms and turns the burial into show of irreverent mourning and violence. He is implying that under the right conditions any group of people can turn into a violent mob. He also writes that history will repeat itself under the same circumstances. This message would have been very pertinent at the time. These messages about the state and flaws of society were frequent but were well integrated into the story. Many were fun to read due to Dickens' good use of satire and humor.One complaint that many historians, literary critics, and others have had about A Tale of Two Cities is that the characters and depiction of the social classes are too unrealistic. I, too, thought that some of the characters were somewhat unrealistic, yet I don't believe that Dickens made them that way without reason. One example is in a moment with a member the French aristocracy. While riding at breakneck speed through downtown Paris, this noble's carriage hits and kills a child. In response, he turns to the grieving father and coolly tosses him a gold piece and drives off. I saw this action as very unrealistic, but this isn't supposed to be literal. This noble's action is part of his characterization that is just supposed to show that he is very cold. It is also supposed to symbolize the oppression of the peasants by the aristocracy. The lower class had been oppressed for so long and Dickens sums up their oppression through this one noble's action. Still, some of the characters' actions are unrealistic. After a condemned man is read his condemning sentence, he is perfectly composed and shows no signs of anxiety or emotion but love for his wife. There is no way that any human could be unafraid after that. Despite some unrealistic moments in Dickens characters, his description of the classes and their struggles is excellent. This is probably because of his experience. As a boy, Dickens was a peasant, which explains why his descriptions of peasant life and their strife are so detailed. I personally found Dickens' characters very appealing and his description of French society very enthralling.If you are unsure if you want to read this book, my advice to you would be: definitely read it. Dickens creates a capturing world with a deep plot, exquisite use of imagery, and striking characters, all in one of the most exciting times in history. Pick it up and you won't regret it."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"I purchased this because it advertised a free audiobook link.

A Tale of Two Cities is not my favorite Dickens novel. Harold Bloom refers to it merely as one of his \\"entertainments.\\" Unlike the best Dickens novels - Great Expectations, David Copperfield, Nicholas Nickleby - there is no central character here for the reader to latch onto. As is the trouble, the \\"good guys\\" in the book are a bit boring. Sometimes Dickens has a social axe to grind, and I find those novels less interesting. One of the problems here, which is attendant upon the lack of a central character, is the lack of a focused plot. Only towards the end of the novel, do we get a sense of what the point is.On the other hand, a lesser novel by Dickens is better than most other authors' great novels. Even though there is no central character, it is filled with a host of unforgettable lesser characters - especially the diabolic Madame DeFarge. Dickens captures the corruption of the Ancient Regime and then the corruption of the Reign of Terror that followed it. After all, this is THE NOVEL of the French Revolution. It also contains some of Dickens's best narrative descriptions and may possibly possess the greatest opening and closing lines of any novel: \\"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times,\\" and \\"It is a far, far better thing I do...\\""},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"For anyone who has ever felt that his or her life has had no purpose, or who has not been successful, or for anyone who just &quot;couldn't get it together,&quot; this book gives hope and a kind of release from worry. It shows that in just one moment, a whole wasted life can be made worth while. One fantastic thing about the book is that it appears to be just a historical novel, especially at first...&quot;It was the best of times, it was the worst of times&quot;...and so on. It is certainly historical, but towards the end, one experiences the triumph of the individual soul over the outside world. It is as though the surroundings disappear, and the reader gets to experience death along with the protagonist, the English lawyer in France who doesn't really belong in the setting...like us, the readers. I saw a film version when I was halfway through the book, and knew what to expect, but I still cried for a while after reading the last page. I would recommend the book to anyone, with two suggestions: first, have some idea of what it is about (not all readers are experienced enough to catch the abundant foreshadowing--look for it!); and second, watch the film with Dirk Bogarde as Sydney Carton--it's an old black and white film, but it gives you the best sense of what the book is like, and it's very moving."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"I was prompted to write this review for a pretty silly reason. You see, I was on Amazon to buy some scripts, and I stumbled across the page for 'A Tale of Two Cities' and started casually reading the reviews, and one reviewer a few months back stated that the chapter 'Monseigneur in Town' was far too long, and, well, I was mortified. Apparently this, probably the most important chapter of the book, was overdrawn in its description of the Monseigneur. What this reviewer does not seem to grasp is that this 'minor character' not only sets the entire plotline of the book into motion, but also is a symbol for the depravity of the society that the rebels overthrow. This overwrought portrayal of his lifestyle is what allows us as readers to sympathize with the cause of the new government, which is absolutely necessary to the overall book. Without that feeling of camaraderie with the french underclass, how are you to feel the deep betrayal that comes apparent with the end of the story? The injustice of it all is just so much more poignant, and, well. Gosh.I suppose I'm prejudiced. This was my favorite book that I read in class throughout High School, which was surprising, since I'm usually more of a 20th Century American literature kind of a boy. So what attracted me to this particular book over, say, 'The Catcher in the Rye' or 'The Great Gatsby'? It's hard to say. It's just a story that's not only fun to read, but is also extremely well written, and is good for you to boot. Don't get me wrong. This is by no means the best book I've ever read. But it will forever hold a place in my heart. And I hate Dickens. So, I guess what I'm trying to say is this: give it a chance, ok?"},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"This is an extraordinary book!But,it isn't surprising,after all it's Dickens.This book starts a little vaguely at first so it's hard to understand what's going on.Some might stop reading at this point-DON'T DO THAT!The book starts a few years before the French revolution and the story accelerates with every page,until it reaches the revolution itself.It tells the story of a few people that are strangers to each other at first but their destinies become entwined later on.I learned a lot about the French revolution at school,saw many movies,but nothing made me understand it better than this book!Dickens manages to put you right in the middle of it.You feel as if you see it with your own eyes,as if you experience it yourself.Dickens also does another amazing thing-he doesn't take sides!he describes the horrors of the aristocracy towards the common people to explain why the revolution took place but,he also describes the great horror of the revolution and what happens when anarchy and chaos take control.He shows how people become complete beasts and loose every trace of humanity,how insignificant life can become.The ending of the book is a great peace of literary work even though it's not very realistic ,it's still amasing.I recommend this book to everybody."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"Hard to start then hard to put down.

During an early visit, he becomes guardian of Lucie,the orphaned child of the unjustly imprisoned Dr Manette. A broken man on release,Manette is cared for by his old servant,Defarge who returns him to his daughter and Lorry where he recuperates in England. There, another French exile,Charles Darnay marries the Doctors daughter and all seems bliss. But Darnay is the decendent and heir of the cruel Marquis Evremonde-a title he has relinquished,and France undergoes a revolution. Called back to Paris on a mission of mercy,Darnay is imprisoned and sentenced to death by the guillotine. Lorry and the Doctor-a hero as an ex prisoner of the Bastille-can do nothing to save Lucie's love...but the depressive alcoholic Sydney Carton believes he can....For Dickens, a short novel, but one packed with plot,passion and incident;historical fact and different from the expected Dickens fare.There are characters-as opposed to the usual caricatures(save maybe Stryver and Cruncher)and the novel never moves away from viewing the revolution (with its-by now-cliched tenent of 'freedom' 'equality' 'brotherhood')as simply replacing one tyranical despotic regime with another;thus making the freedom slogans nothing more than hot air.Its an enlightened view bourne out by history.What beyond tyranny for tyranny did the Russian/Iranian/countless African states 'revolutions' do?Dickens never offers a political solution to the ills of his times;rather he preaches humanism;that goodness will reap goodness in the same way as tyranny reaps tyranny.Naive,yes, but in truth politics has always failed one way or another to deliver mans most precious goals.'A Tale of Two Cities' is different from Victorian literature;it has a hint of modernism about it;it is a bench mark for the historical novel. Please note I say 'hint'! 'Two Cities' is still riddled with that most irritating of Victorian literary devices-coincidence (Lorry knows Defarge who knows Manette who is imprisoned by the whim of Evremonde who is Darnays father whom Lucie.Lorry and Manette defend in an English court and of course Defarge's wife is another one with a grudge against Evremonde.......) and the love scenes between Lucie and Darnay are mawkish and so chaste you wonder how they ever had a child.That this is Dickens's favourite novel, and that the most famous beginning and ending lines in literature open and close this book (It was the best of times.....It is a far far better thing....) and that it is the biggest selling book of all times bar Bibles/Korans says more than I or anyone can in favour and praise of this book."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"I have just started this book and I do like the fact that I can read to my self, along with the narrator and/or word for word with the narrator if my grand child is visiting.

Dickens captures the span of the French Revolution through his novel. A Tale of Two Cities is one of the most sold pieces of fiction literature, making it a necessity for high school students to read.A Tale of Two Cities makes students think about what they are reading. Every high school student should read it. It is suitable reading material due to the complex and paralleling stories throughout the novel, not only is it a love story, but it is also a call to arms for the peasants during the French Revolution. The writing is original such as the difference in sentence length, one sentence being thirteen lines long, gives students a new perspective on syntax.Charles' Dickens novel is important to read, however it wont change a student's life. It is a classic that should be read, but only for the literary merit. When students put forth the effort to understand what the text is saying, it makes them smarter due to the fact that it is teaching the students how to think instead of just reading words on a page. It is helpful for college because it is more than simple literature, it is a tough book to read, which will help students in the long run by teaching them ways to interpret text and be more erudite in the subject of English. Students are positively affected by reading A Tale of Two Cities, because not only is it a good book, it has a good message.Dickens employs rhetorical devices to inspire the French Revolution and to affirm how important it is to fight. In doing this, Charles' Dickens writes a classic novel that should be read by students of all facets of education, since it is both inspiring and complex."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"This book was as informative as anything I had read regarding the cause and onset of the French revolution. It tied the era of the 1750's in France and England together in ways that greatly informed my knowledge of those times.It horrified me in that, so late in the cycle of world history, laws regarding modes of execution were so inhumanely dreadful. It was hard to believe that peoples who no doubt thought of themselves as 'modern' could have retained and acted upon legal systems as brutal as these.I had known to some degree of the excesses of the revolution in France, but the sheer numbers of those who died by the guillotine, and the minor aspect of many of their crimes presented a picture I can't get out of my mind."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"Flowery and plain, that's the problem with this book. It's best moments are when the narrative is plain, its worst is when the esteemed Charlie speaks so figuratively that it's hard to know what he's actually directly referring to, and most of all in the opening chapters. However, this does ease as the story progresses and improves a hundredfold. All in all, an averagely-good yarn. Whether he actually 'nailed it' re the terrible back-droppy events (and head-droppy perhaps): well, some say he did, such as Schama and Chesterton, others, too many to name, say he didn't. I don't suppose that matters now that much, it is after all a novel, around a century and a half old, and not a direct source for history or constitution studies. For new Dicko' completists, nothing will stop you getting this, and that's fine, for those wanting an engaging read, save it for the worst days of January and February, I think a hot June day with the kids yelling for a jar of lemo' and a game of frisbee throwing would see the book hit the back of the couch and drop behind a cushion."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"Excellent story. Very hard to get into at first. I used [...] to assist me in understanding the historical references. By the end of the first section, I was hooked.

Very interesting and sad time in history."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"I really enjoy listening to this book through the Whispersync product.

Enjoyed every word written."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"Even though Tale of Two Cities was required reading in my senior year of high school, I decided to give it another read. This time it was far more meaningful, and I couldn't help marveling at the genious of Charles Dickens. He had a phenominal ability to paint a picture with his words. While the style may be a bit archaic for today's readers, it is well worth the time. Highly recommended for anyone interested in the history and times of the 19th century."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"After determining that I would read, and would finish, this 19th century classic, I realized that I had a long walk to walk. However, &quot;A Tale Of Two Cities&quot; has so much to offer, to reject it as tedious would be saying too little. Dickens pokes fun at France and glorifies England as we are engaged in the story of a husband, a wife, their banker friend, their maid, and the wife's newly returned father. Dickens builds two main settings, a dirty corner of Paris with its wine shop and French Revolution supporters, and the the home of the protagonists in the equally minable London. And before the wineshop's owners let the axe fall upon them and their friend's head, there is much for them to do, and many decisions to make. Dickens spends the first two parts introducing characters and loose ends, the deepening them. We can't truly understand his reasonings until the 3rd book, but when he pulls them together and rides to a climax, the effect and ending are something to remember. Not to say there is nothing in the rest of the book - from the verbose / English virtuoso contrasts of beauty and filth to the characters and the real places they frequent - but it certainly is the plot that 20th century writing has established. One critic referred to this Dickens selection as &quot;his most busy,&quot; and it brims with meaning, substance, and scenes that you will remembers as yours, but it doesn't feel like the serial it was. Nothing wrong with that, though. There are far, far better things here than I have known..."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"This is my true introduction to Dickens (yes, I had to read A Christmas Carol ages ago, but I hated it with a passion.) This book was truly well done, and rightfully and lasting classic. The span of characters was vast, and the story well told. One of few criticisms I could find with this book was that I found most of the emotional value of the story fall flat. The only emotional scene that really caught most of its capability to move the read was one of the last.... This is, otherwise, a very entertaining and well done read. Be warned, however, that it WAS written in Victorian England, so if you have difficulty reading older dialects of English you may have some trouble with this book."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"&quot;It was the best of times, it was the worst of times,&quot; this is the beginning of the classic of the classic novel A Tale Of Two Cities by Charles Dickens. This novel occurs during the terrible time of the French Revolutionary War, where corruption, bloodshed, and poverty runs rapid. Amongs all of this, love and family develops and struggles to go on. It breaks through sickness and inprisonment to survive and perservere. This classic novel takes place in two countries, England and France. Its starts off in England, when Jarvis Lorry, the perfect business man, meets with Lucy Manette, a beautiful young women, to tell her that her long lost father has been found. Later in the book, a men by the names of Charles Darnay and Syden Carton both fall in love for the same women, Lucy, but Darnay ends up winning. In France, the country is run rapid with corruption and poverty witch starts a bloody revolution. Darnay goes to free a former servant in this bloody mess, and in the procces, gets locked up himself. The end of the novel focuses on the Manettes and Lorry going through trial and tribulation to get Darnay out. A Tale of Two Cities is a well written novel that involves War and Rommance. The characters are very diverse. The character, Madame Defarge, is a very vengeful character that will kill anybody in her path. At one point, she knits the letters that get Darnay in trouble, &quot;The chateau and all the race?&quot;. She is also the one that kills a surplus of people with her hatchit at the Storming of the Bastille. On the opposite end, Charles Dickens creates a character like Doctor Manette. He is a very diverse character that goes through spells that make him at one point normal, and at another point, is called &quot;hopeless and lost creature&quot; by the book. Charles Dickens also has a great, complexed plots. For instance, the novel explains and intertwines two characters at the same time. Also, the characters are very complete, each having there own problems. For example, Carleton is depressed about his job and the love of his life. The book is very intericate and well written, but there are couple problems with in it. The biggest problem is the setting of the two places. While the setting goes back and forth from England and France, Dickens does do a very good job at telling the reader, wether they are in England with the Manettes or in France with the Defarges. These problems are rare in the book. Most of the book is a great masterpiece of literature. It is a classic novel with everything including the kitchen sink in it. People of any age, race, or gender would defenitly enjoy reading this novel."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"&quot;It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.&quot; That is what it was like in the time of A Tale of Two Cities. Set in the time of the French Revolution, Dickens depicts the thoughts and feelings of the Revolution. Doctor Manette was a prisoner in the bastille for 18 years when he finally got out. His daughter Lucie fell in love with and married a former French Noble named Charles Darnay. In the height of the Revolution, Darnay is found and sentanced to death by the ruthless Madame DeFarge. Despite the fact that his father-in-law, Doctor Manette, is a dear friend of the Revolution. There was nothing he could do, his fate was in the hands of friend and look-alike Sydney Carton. This phrase also relates to the book itself. It was the best of books, it was the worst of books. Some parts of this book were great which made it seem like the best book ever written. Other parts, however quickly became boring and lost the reader's attention. The first two books were possibly the worst part of a book ever written. Although they were absolutely necessary to make the third and final book such a success. The first two books have little or no action to grab the attention of the reader. The most exciting thing is reading about a trial of a person that the reader does not even know yet. Also, the language is confusing and hard to understand. It is written in the old English dialect of the time. It should not be a struggle for a reader simply to understand a sentance of a book. The action really picks up in the last part of book two and all of book three. So much is going on that the reader quickly becomes interested. It makes the book very hard to put down. This was the best ending of any book ever written. There are so many things that make this so great. First of all, after reading the first half of the book, the reader is finally used to the language and it is no longer a struggle to read. Also, everything that was unknown or confusing from before all comes together. For example, Madame DeFarge is a person of the Revolution who is extremely ruthless especially towards Charles Darnay. The reader finds out that it is becuase she had experienced first-hand the terror that his father and uncle had caused. At the end, The reader is overcome with a feeling of friendship, loyalty, love and just a general good feeling because a life is given to save another. A Tale of Two Cities is one of the greatest books ever written. Although the first book and a half are boring, They are absolutely necessary. They lead up to the phenomenal ending that could not be undestood without them."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"With the concluding sentence &quot;It is a far,far better thing that I do, that I have ever done...&quot; Sydney Carton demonstrates his courage and love for Lucie. Dickens develops his characters and has something about them that stands out from the rest. For example, Lucie is recognized by her blonde hair, just as Mr.Lorry is a &quot;business man&quot; and Mme. Defarge is always seen knitting. The story takes place in 1775 during the French Revolution, and tells a story of sacrafice, courage, love, and revenge. Lucie and her family struggle to stay alive as Mme.Defarge and the Vengence threaten to destroy them. Dickens takes the experience of the Revolution and turns it into an exciting and twisted story with great deal of suspence and vivid characters. For example, Jerry Cruncher's rusty fingers, Mr. Lorry's &quot;recalled to life&quot; and Mme. Defarge's knitting adds suspence and excitment to the story. The book also was good because throughout it, they were many side stories and then at the end they all came together really well. For example, Jerry Cruncher had rusty fingers, and his job was &quot;fishing.&quot; The only thing that was confusing was about the book was the first few chapters. since they were hard to undestand, it was really hard to get into the novel. Also the constant switching between the two cities was confusing and hard to follow. Even though the book did have its low points, the book had great characters, and exciting plot, and a surprise ending."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"I understood this book but as to why everyone thinks it is so marvelous eludes me.

My teacher explained to us this year that Dickens was paid by each line he wrote.

If you got paid by each line you wrote, you would have used extreme amounts of detail too!!!!!"},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"I realize that at times during the French Revolution (like during the Jacobin Reign of Terror), violence did get a little out of hand. Still, the book presents a very rare case: a noble, who did not want to even be a noble, is being unfairly held by the peasants who have seized control of France and demand that all nobles be killed. The book also can be confusing at times. This is basically, (in my opinion) like all Dickens' works, average."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"I guess A Tale of Two Cities is considered a classic because it's long, boring, and deals with an important event in history, IF YOUR FRENCH. Isn't that the criteria for a classic? I think adults are just fooling themselves when they read a book like A Tale of Two Cities. I think they say, &quot;Oh, this was written before the 1900's. It's long, it's boring, it must be a classic.&quot; English teachers love presenting &quot;great&quot; literature to their unsuspecting students.

Dickens weaves a story which takes place during the brutal French Revolution and conveys the inexorable methods of the peasants to annihilate the aristocrats in order to gain equality. Simultaneously, Dickens composes an affectionate love story between the admirable and delicate Lucie Manette and the gallant and heroic Sydney Carton.Dickens constructs this novel using numerous literary devices which classify the story as a difficult read and one must fully indulge them self in the plot to comprehend the multiple story lines occurring. The sinister Madame Defarge captivates the attention of the reader as she \\"knits her patterns of death\\" and contributes to the suspenseful plot line as the dynamic Sydney Carton's devotion and love to Lucie Manette bestows a sympathetic connection between the reader and Carton. One must also have a valid knowledge on the French Revolution to interpret particular events in the story and cannot simply pick up the novel and read leisurely. The diverse allusions and motifs enhance the significance of the events and the emotional ride readers experience. The intensity and aggressiveness of the peasants coalesced with the tender love story between Carton and Lucie produce a classic novel.This novel is recommended for those who do not read a book merely for the gist and pleasure of reading it, but read a book to conceive the deep, intricate, and encrypted meaning. One must devote them self to focus on the allusions and development of the plot as it is hard in the beginning chapters to catch on with the story line. Dickens spawns a classic tale which will leave the reader astounded by the vast imagery and captivating characters."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"Charles Dickens created an intricate classic that describes the French Revolution in his book, A Tale of Two Cities. The complex plot with all of its twists and turns not only provided ample suspense, but it also made me think. Dickens did not write a story that is easily read. To fully understand the novel the reader must have an understanding of the peasants' rage towards the oppressive aristocracy which ultimately culminated in the French Revolution. In addition, the subtle hints dropped by Dickens in the forms of imagery, motifs, and recurring themes, are what makes this novel a timeless classic.Not only has Dickens created a plot that intertwines the fates of two families living in different countries, he also created one of my favorite, and of the most well developed villains in all of literature. With most villains, the reader never understands why they act the way they do. However, with the sinister Madame Defarge, a woman who takes a sadistic pleasure in watching prisoners getting beheaded by the Guillotine, the reader knows why her whole life seems to center around the revolution, and why she stops at nothing to kill the Darnay family.On the opposite side of the spectrum, Dickens also creates a selfless hero in Sydney Carton, a man who performs the ultimate sacrifice for the woman he can never have. Although at first, Carton may seem like a moping and depressed loser, he comes to his full potential when the lives of his loved ones are put in danger. Sydney Carton dies for the woman he loves and in turn has become one of the most beloved characters in the book.A Tale of Two Cities is recommended for anyone who wants to read an intense novel, that contains some very well developed and passionate characters. This book is not a quick read and requires some thought, and anyone who considers themselves up to the challenge will greatly enjoy Charles Dickens' masterpiece."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"Somehow I managed to get through Junior High, High School and even College (as an English major) without ever reading A Tale of Two Cities. Since I'm about to graduate, I figured it was time to read this classic and see what it's all about. I knew from a high level that it was about some of the dynamic between London and Paris at the time of the French Revolution, but not much beyond that.I can honestly say that I wanted to give up a few times as I started. The famous opening lines were interesting (\\"It was the best of times it was the worst of times...\\"), but as the story went on, it was a balancing act. For the first 50 or 60 pages, I had to readjust myself to Dickens style. I had to try to care about a myriad of characters without knowing who was going to be important or what their importance would be. I was tossed around between a few locations and seemingly random stories. The writing was gorgeous, the characters were full and the situations were interesting, but the overall pacing of the story felt like it was crawling very slowly. I felt like I was turning page after page and gathering data that felt insignificant. I felt as though I had no clear understanding of the overall plot or the prospective arc of the story and thus I had no way of knowing how quickly (or if at all) I was progressing along that arc towards any type of intrigue, climax or conclusion.Still, I loved the language and I was intrigued by the characters and wanted to find out how they would interact and where their paths would lead. So, I pushed through. As I passed into the 100+ page mark, I had a clearer idea of the relations of the characters and could start to guess at upcoming events. Halfway through the novel, the intensity really took off and for the last 150-200 pages, I had a hard time putting the book down because I was so invested in what was going on and truly NEEDED to know what was going to happen.I felt that Dickens did a wonderful job creating vibrant characters that I could intimately invest myself in. I felt great compassion for Doctor Manette and Lucie. I had genuine concern for Charles. I literally shuddered as I got closer and closer to Madame Defarge. Even the peripheral characters and their more minor stories were engaging. I was worried about Cruncher and Miss Pross as they tried to escape Paris. It was interesting the way seemingly minor characters would wind in and out of the story taking on larger roles at times and even becoming highly pivotal characters.In addition to the wonderful tension in the story and the amazingly vivid characters, I think one of the amazing aspects of this novel is the portrayal of the French Revolution itself. I'm not a historian by any stretch. My knowledge of the Revolution is largely limited to a brief history lesson in High School and reading and watching The Scarlet Pimpernel and Les Miserables. (I kept expecting the Pimpernel to swoop in and save the day...alas, he didn't)So I have no idea how accurate Dickens portrayal is. But I did find that his descriptions of the buildup and eventual explosion of the Revolution is amazing. I loved that he showed some of the actions that led up to the hatred. As the book went on, the atrocities of the upper class became more and more heinous to the extent that I could relate and empathize with the Revolutionaries to some degree. But as the powder keg erupted into the absolute thirst for blood and vengeance, it became frightening how all-encompassing the hatred was. I really felt the sense of the flood that flowed through Paris and the absolute horror of the thing. While this is a work of fiction, I think this portrayal of the Revolution was absolutely amazing.Now that I've finally read this novel, I feel really bad that it took me so long to get to it. I also feel like, now that I know the trajectory, the first ~50-100 pages would be more intriguing. I can truly understand why this book is considered a classic and is so open for discussions. It provides plenty of conversation about humanity and history. It also displays lots of intriguing literary techniques that are very cool.I absolutely recommend that everyone makes time to read this book at least once in their life.*****5 out of 5 stars"},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"This version has been abridged so it is easier to understand and keep up with the plot better. In this book there is a lot of difficult vocabulary and the abridgment makes it easier and more fun to read.A Tale of Two Cities has multiple plots that eventually all relate, and each plot has an entire different mood. When I read this book, I felt as if I knew the characters in real life; I was happy, sad, angry, and victorious with all the characters I love. Charles Dickens is an amazing writer and if you enjoy historical fiction and you're ready for the book of a lifetime, then I'm sure you will love this book as much as I have in reading A Tale of Two Cities."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"The story itself is great, but I was not so thrilled with the narrator of this audiobook. When he read the parts spoken by Ms. Manette he sounded like Harvey Fierstein in drag. I wish I had returned it and bought a different edition because I love listening to the story."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"I have to agree with Charles Dickens. A Tale of Two Cities is an incredible book. I do not wish to ruin this story (and this would be quite the book to summarize), so I will not reveal much of its plot. I will merely say that it is set in both England and France during the time just before and then the beginning of the French Revolution. The political details are quite accurate, the characters (even secondary ones) are well developed, the narrative is amazing (uplifting, depressing, humorous, terrifying, and poetic), and the love story is pure and beautiful (i.e. marriage), not something obscene and disgusting.'It was the best of times, it was the worst of times...'Those immortal words describe this book.You will (probably) enjoy the best of times while reading this book.You will miss out on one of the best of times, and thus almost suffer the worst of times, if you pass on this story.Ryan RobledoAuthor of the Aelnathan:"},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"Tale Of Two Cities represents a change for Dickens. Considering the story a short exposition on the French Revolution, Dickens avoids much explanation or background on a multitude of characters that are trapped in the world pre-french Revolution and yes this is a problem.The tale opens up with the rescue of Dr. Manette. It's hard to care for Dr. Manette as he comes across as both eccentric and quirky and nothing else. We also don't know his past or his motivations or even why he got locked up in a French prison. His daughter Lucie comes across as a one dimensional soap opera character and Mr. Lorry is a cardboard cutout completing the triangle. Such is the start of the adventure. To be honest, you may struggle since Dickens demands a proper stage to be set introducing character after character without so much as an explanation why we are meeting them and it can seem frustrating. Dickens does this for a reason which is to provide a great deal of twists and turns at the conclusion (all is not what it seems).Once the conflict kicks in -- Charles Darney (Lucie's husband) must go to France and now the Revolution has kicked in and it becomes a gripping page turner. Dickens is a master writer and creates mood over action and it works. As already mentioned, the plot twists do kick in and there is an obvious feeling of 'forced and contrived' in some instances but the emotions are real, the situations are frightening, and no other book I have read captures the French Revolution in such a personal level as this book. I just finished it tonight and I'm still processing it. If you chose to read it, try to not focus so much on character but situations and the times they are set in and you will more appreciate how wonderful this story really is even to today's modern audiences."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"This is not the most entertaining book ever written, but I am so glad I read it. I've been reading 'literature' on my own, mainly because I no longer am forced to read it and do have a certain respect for some of the writers in which I have been previously forced to read. This review is intended for those of you who might be in the same position as myself - reading the book just for the sake of reading it.Yes, the story is about the French revolution, blah, blah, blah. The point is, I did not know much about the revolution before I read it, nor was I truly interested in learning more. Regardless of your curiosity on that period of time, Dickens will teach you something about it.For me, the more interesting aspects of the novel are his use of literary devices to create meaning and absolutely wonderful, fresh ways of looking at the world. Just for fun, imagine rain as the sound of hundreds of stampeding feet....4 stars? While the language is great and the story interesting, I do not think the book is a very compulsive read. I was only able to read maybe 10 pages at a time, tasting it a little here and there to repair my deteriorated intellect. Don't go into the book expecting to finish it in a few hours, or you'll miss a lot of what makes this book worth the read!"},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"Yea, Charles Dickens can be a bit drab at first but the plot and underlying story is great. NOthing at all of wwhat I expected. Most of my classmates didn't like it --partly becuase they gave up at the begining. After you get a sense of the characters and the whole message--its a great book."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"A Tale of Two Cities by Dickens is a book that you actually live as you read it. So much detail and suspense puts you right in the position of the characters. While it is a little slow to start, it illudes to a much deeper plan. It really gives you prospective on the capabilities of man, both good and bad. From human sacrifice to corruption by power, the book gives you so much contrast that the reader and actually look at the characters as people they might know. I thoroughly enjoyed this book, and hope that you will too!"},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"Although most high school students complain relentlessly about the assignment of this book, I (being the book-loving nerd that i am) was glad to have an oppurtunity to read this classic. What I got out of it was more than i had hoped for.The kids in my class that complained about its boringness and lack of excitment were obviously missing the point. This book isnt about plot, its about charcters and relationships. (although Dickens does a terrible job of showing affection. &quot;o, my life&quot;- who says that?)Of course the beginning of the book was &quot;boring&quot;! Deep, thought provoking charcters were being established. Dickens is truley a master of words, and has no reserve in showing it. Although some complain his sentences are too lengthy and lose the readers intrest, if your reading carefully, you'll catch all sorts of hidden symbols and meanings, as well as the ocassional joke. The charcters can easily be related to, and the ending is wonderful. EVERYBODY shoudl read this book."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"\\"Controversy\\" is an excellent word to describe feelings about Charles Dickens novel, A Tale of Two Cities. Some may think it is an exceptional, timeless classic; for others it is a dreaded, tedious bore to read. Either way looked at, both sides have the essential arguments.One area of contention is the novel's plot. Its unstable plot provides for an interesting read, forcing you to really think while reading the book. In another sense, capricious plot and scenes makes the story quite confusing. It randomly jumps from one character, scene, or even location to another, leaving uncertainty about the transition. This is shown when Carton leaves to go to Paris to help a fellow companion, however the story lagers behind in England with Lucie and Dr. Mannette; then skips completely to the Defarges and their contumacious lives of the Revolution. The book also begins with one story of Dr. Mannette's recovery, and ends with another of Sidney Cartons death. Although having some connections to each other, it is yet a different story.Another argument is Dickens's choice of point of view. He choose third person. This is a brilliant choice for the large amount of characters, because third person allows you to see everyone's emotions and feelings. You are able to understand all the characters views on conflicts, and all their individual actions. However, if Dickens had used an actual character's identity in the first person the novel may have been less perplexing. First person would keep the plot from jumping around so much and changing scenes so frequently. As the book was written the scenes moved from London to Paris repetitively. If the author had written it in first person, then the book would have had more defined scene locations, making a smoother transition.The topic of characters is brought up as controversial. Dickens has many distinctive, fascinating characters. Some include, the melodramatic Lucie Mannette, who finds her father after so many years of his isolation in shoe making, and then living a life with her wonderful husband and new child. Other characters include the indestructible Miss Pross, the heroic Sidney Carton, and the unstable minded Dr. Mannette. Dickens does have a weakness of forgetting his characters. Main characters in the fist part of the book with the Dover mail are forgotten towards the end with Sidney Cartons self-immolation. Mr. Jarvis Lowry and Jerry Cruncher, are rather important in the beginning of the novel, but as time goes on are slowly left out of the plot.Dickens complicated writing is portrayed throughout the novel. This is excellent because it shows his spurious vocabulary and writing skills. His ability to start with two completely different stories of, such as Dr. Mannette and the Revolution in France, and bring them together in the end demonstrates his complex writing. Dickens is also able to make you truly think throughout a novel about the conflicts, and maintain a neutral side in all arguments, such as the rich versus poor in the French Revolution. In spite of this, his styles of writing create confusion for the average reader who can not comprehend these complicated writing techniques. Many people are dumbfounded at the vocabulary used and the old English dialect. They find themselves missing out on the original story because the accent distracts them and exacerbates an already confusing novel. Words such as the buzzing of the blue flies, felicitously, obsequiousness, mused, convey, equipages, methodically, and immemorial are prime examples.Dickens's artistic merit is also to question in this novel. There is a sense of confusion throughout the novel, although, at the end most conflicts are resolved and figured out. Some people read it thinking it's a beautiful love story in the French Revolution, others a complex story of dreary lives, and deaths. This story was a debacle in the sense of an enjoyable, good feeling book for all readers, though those who are able to read and understand it remember it forever, giving it great permanence. Despite its unstable plot, lingering characters, complicated dialect and lackadaisical seriousness; it has been paraded as a superb piece of literature in the world of \\"English scholars\\".

The main characters are: Mr. Lorry, a bank owner, Dr. Mannette, an ex-prison mate, Lucy Mannette, the daughter of Dr. Mannette, Charles Darnay, who looks like Sydney Carton and is in love with Lucy, Sydney who is a drunk and loves Lucy but isn't right for her, and the Monsigneur, a wealthy noble who hates peasants.Mr. Lorry tells Lucy that her father is in prison. When he is freed after eighteen years he find s that he has lost his memory, his name and his life. Lucy helps him get back on his feet and they help the cause of the French Revolution. The Monsigneur was one of the focal points of the revolution because the peasants wanted to kill him. He was the protector of the nobles, he was the nobles. The book tells about the conflict of the aristocrats and the peasants and the revolt that happened.I think the book starts out slow and then the action builds up when the people start to revolt. It is a very complex novel and in my preference is too complex for my liking. Other people who have read more books and have more experience probably love the book. You have to keep track of the characters to follow the plot."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"I am currently in the middle of reading this book for my english class and it is very confusing which makes it very boring.

I considered taking another stab at it since everyone else seems to be so passionate about it but I just couldn't put my self through such tortue."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"&quot; The Tale of Two Cities,&quot; was a book of many twist and turns. It clearly demostrated both suspense and Irony. This book was overwhelmed with action and emotion. It is easy for readers to be drawn in.As a reader, I never expected Charles Darnay, of the Evremond House, to fall in love with and marry Doctor Manette's daughter. Especially, since the Evremond House played a key role in Doctor Manette's capture during the French Revolution and his loss of sanity (excessive shoemaking and forgetting who he was or the fact he even had a daughter). However, I feel the most suprising event throughout the story, was when Sydney Carton(alcholic lawyer) realized the only way he could be happy was to sacrifice his life to insure the Darnay's happiness. I find this ironic because it was obvious throughout the story that Carton was in love with Miss Manette and dispised her husband (Darnay). You would assume that he would have loved to seen Darnay killed in prision, so he could pursue his love for Miss Manette.The entire book was ironic and the ending completely unpredictable."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"This story occurs during the terrible time of the French Revolutionary War where corruption, bloodshed and poverty run rapid. The story takes place in two countries, England and France. It all started in England when Jarvis Lorry, the businessman meets with Lucy Manette, a beautiful young lady, to tell her that her long lost father had been found. Doctor Mr. Manette was a prisoner of the Bastille for eighteen years and this gives him great authority over the French prisoners later in the story. The phase, \\" recalled to life\\" is used as a code to refer to the release of Mr. Manette. Two men by the names of Charles Darney and Sydney Carton also fell in love with Lucy Manette but Lucy ended up marrying Darney. Her devotion to her husband, Charles Darney, brings her great misery when he is imprisoned for his secret life of being a French noble. Charles Darney's family was the one that put Dr. Manette in jail and took the lives of two innocent people, which are the father and brother of Madame Defarge. She being a revengeful person tried her very best to get Darney and his family put to death by the guillotine. After Charles Darney was sentenced to death, only one man can save him that is Sydney Carton who looked exactly like Darney. He decided to use his life for the happiness of the woman - Lucy Manette, he loved deeply and for his friend, Darney.A character in the book I like most:The person, who I admired and who left me with deep feelings, is none other than Sydney Carton. He was a great man who sacrificed his life and everything for the woman he loved. He was intelligent but due to his laziness and constant drinking, he had not been a success in life. Being pessimistic, Carton thus thought that he was useless and that he had never done good for everyone. He was wrong. In the trial of Charles Darney in the earlier part of the story, it was his ingenious idea that saved Darney from being imprisoned. He and Darney were so alike in looks that everyone on court was shocked and due to this, the judge had to release him because of the lacking in evidence. His devotion to Lucy Manette was indeed admirable. He loved her so much that he promised he would die for her and in the end he really did. When Lucy Manette and Charles Darney got married and had their first child, Sydney Carton though heart-broken at first, came to their house very often, buying gifts for the child and playing with him for hours. This shows how caring and generous he was. Towards the end, he cunningly use John Barsad who was a spy to help him get into the dungeons to save Charles Darney who was sentenced to death for being a noble. Carton forced Darney to take off his clothes and change into his. Then, he knocked out Darney and called for the guards to take him out. He wanted to replace Darney and to die for him! Reading at this point, I was deeply touched and impressed by Carton's actions. He wanted to die for Darney so that Lucy will be happy. He sacrificed his life for his friend and his love! He was a genius and if he not been so pessimistic and so lacking in confidence, he could have made a great name for himself. Forgiveness, sacrificial, devotion... In my life, I had never seen someone like Sydney Carton or even close to him. In this selfish and materialistic world, when most people are pursing money and fame to the extent of backstabbing each other, how many will give up their lives for a friend? How many will have the courage and to give up everything and accept absolutely nothing in return?MINI DATACharacter Study: Physiological Characteristics: - Intelligent - Tall - Devoted - Handsome - Faithful - Young (middle-aged) - Caring - Fit - Generous - No facial hair - Courageous - Short and neat hair - Pessimistic - Lack of confidence - SacrificialReview of the book I had read: \\"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.\\" This is the famous opening line of the great novel, \\" The tale of two cities.\\" Charles Dickens, in this book more than any of his others, twists and sews the plot in circles, keeping the reader in suspense and a state of unknowing--all while the tension continues to build to a climax. Love, betrayal, drama and suspense, the makers of a great novel, are also found in the story. This book starts a little vaguely at first so it's hard to understand what's going on. Some might stop reading at this point but do not do that because you will learn that everything ties together during the second half. Every chapter is special and time must be taken to read it thoroughly to find out the exciting ending. The plot was also very interesting because Dickens mixes fiction, historical facts and events together. Furthermore, the story is well written with fantastic descriptions, making the characters come alive as if the whole event is happening right in front of our eyes. The dramatic ending, which is emotional and powerful, will leave the reader proud of the decision made and sad as it took such a painful price. After reading the story, a clear understanding is achieved of why Charles Dickens is such a renowned author. This classic novel is a unique and great masterpiece of literature. People of any race, age, and gender would definitely enjoy reading it but I think the older readers might be able to interpret the story better as Charles Dickens uses old English to write the story."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"A TALE OF TWO CITIES is a classic from start to finish. Charles Dickens was a rare author of both great commercial and critical success in his day and this book remains a staple of required school reading lists.

You'll have plenty of time for that later. Read it for the pure pleasure of the prose. That is why Dicken's wrote it (in addition to making a few pounds, but that's another story).

Mr. Carton was not such a good person in the beginning of the book and then turns around to be a very nice person giving up his life for the sake of Darnay and Lucie's love for each other. Lucie is a person that everyone in the book loves. She has blonde hair and is a kind person to others. In the beginning of the book Lucie has no idea about her father. Mr. Lorry knows where Lucie's father is and takes her to see him. He had been a prisoner, but now her makes shoes in his room above a wine venders place. He does not even know who he is anymore. When he sees his daughter it reminds him of his wife and he recognizes her. Lucie and Mr. Lorry take her father back home with them. Lucie ends up marring Darnay, and he goes back to France to help an old family helper who is now in prison, and he gets locked up in prison also.

Mr. Carton goes to the prison and switches places with Darnay so that Darnay can be with his wife and daughter.

I don't understand the fascination with his writings. In my humble opinion, his style just isn't enjoyable. So this year, for tenth grade, I had to read Tale of Two Citites, I was disappointed. This seemed very boring in the begining, but since I had to read it, and I love history, I kept going. Around the last 20 chapters or so I got a suprise; I couldn't put the book down! Needless to say I think the ending was amazing, regardless of what I think of his style. I recommend the book just for the ending, but for an overall entertainment value I suggest Crime and Punishment."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"Charles Dickens' A Tale of Two Cities is arguably one of his best novels. It is his only attempt to write a Historical Fiction novel and it is very successful. A Tale of Two Cities takes place during a time of chaos known as the French Revolution. Entwined around a historical base, A Tale of Two Cities follows a French doctor once political prisoner of the Monarchy, his daughter Lucy, Madame Dafarge, Charles Darnay, Sydney Carton, Mr. Lorry and his entourage. Throughout the novel many comparisons are apparent; from the first lines \\"It was the best of times, It was the worst of times\\" to nearly the last \\"Six tumbrils carry the day's wine to La Guillotine.\\" Wine and blood, London and Paris, many of the comparisons have great contrast between them. Ms. Pross and Madame Defarge, the Lion and the Jackal, Darnay and his parents, each have different views of the times and the world. Similarities also appear throughout the book, Lucie and her daughter, both bearing the same name and the same appearance, the almost identical appearances of Carton and Darnay. Even more themes are wound around the contrasts and similarities in A Tale of Two Cities. All themes one would expect to find in a Dickens novel are present; greed, vengeance, rebellion, love and sacrifice being most predominate. Both fate and past actions spell out doom for the characters in the book. Lucie's father witnessed the killing of a young man by Darnay's family. Mr. Defarge an acquaintance of Doctor Manetee happened to find a note regarding this during the storming of the Bastille. The man killed happened to be the brother in law of Madame Defarge. All these events lead to one thing psychopathic revenge on the part of Madame Defarge. Charles after his arrival in England meets and falls in love with Lucie, the Doctor's daughter. After marrying and having a child he travels to France. On his journey, the Republic passed a law barring foreigners from entering the country under penalty of death. In Paris he is imprisoned by the Republic and scheduled to go on trial later that month. His new family and friends are notified that he was arrested and come to support him. Using influence gained by being a prisoner of the Bastille and the fact that Darnay relinquished his nobility in France years ago, Dr. Manette is able to give Charles his freedom. Unfortunately his efforts are worthless, the day Darnay is released he is once again arrested for a crime not committed by him, but his parents. His new accusers: Citizen Defarge, Citizeness Defarge and Dr. Manette, Lucy's father. Defarge kept the letter written so many years ago and used it to have Darnay arrested. Will Charles face the ultimate penalty, or once again gain his freedom? In conclusion A Tale of Two Cities is Dickens' best book. It has enough fast paced action to keep anyone interested if they can get past the first 60 pages. The hardest reading of the book takes place in this first section but is also very rewarding reading. This detailed filled section gives the reader knowledge of past events, which greatly enhance the plot. The first sixty pages are filled with foreshadowing which enhances his novel making it his best. If you want to start reading Dickens I suggest you begin your epic by reading A Tale of Two Cities. If you have already read some of his previous works you will love this book. When I began reading A Tale of Two Cities it seemed boring and slow like Great Expectations. Once I read Book the First, I began to appreciate Dickens work much more."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"This is one of the best books I have read in a while!!! Sure it seemed a little too tedious, and boring at some points (because some chapters were utterly useless-- or so I thought...) As one reviewer put it &quot;everything ties in together&quot;, which is a very true fact; thus my reason for reiterating the point. I absolutely loved this book and hope everyone at least tries to take up the 'challenge' for reading this masterpiece. I assure you, when you finish reading it, you will be very proud of beginning it in the first place!! Oh, and one little suggestion: Make sure you have a dictionary around you somewhere (because you will need it with Dickens' superfluous use of archaic vocabulary)."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"First and foremost, I thought this was a great book. I am in eighth grade, and we were told to do a book report on a historical book. I chose A Tale of Two Cities after a recommendation from my mother. The opening line was great, but for the first chapter of two I was really confused. After I got the thing sorted out, I started to really get into. I really loved the compassion for Doctor Manette from Lucie. I also thought at the very end that Sydney Carton was a hero instead of a depressed, unexiting character as I once thought him to be. I must admit that at times I was lost, confused and bored, but those times were not nearly as frequent as me being enthraled in the book. I truely recommend this book."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"I read this book when I was 12 or 13 years old and I loved it! In the beginning, it was a little boring, but as I got more towards the middle, I couldn't stop reading, The excitment just kept me captivated. I felt like I was really there in the middle of the revolution. Of course, the ending was a little sad as in most of Dickens' work, but the story is just great! I'm not usually one for revolution and sad endings type of books, but this was a wonderful book!"},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"The sharp blade of the guillotine comes crashing down. The creaky tumbrils come through the town carrying their scared prisoners. The Bastille is being stormed by angry french citizens. This is known as the French Revolution that Charles Dickens magnificantly describes in his book, &quot;A Tale of Two Cities.&quot;The book is very well-written. It goes into great details. The story is romantic and it contains death, which are topics two different types of people would be interested in. The characters are romantic, evil, saddening, and heroic. People all over are interested in at least one of these types of characters. It is hard not to like a book made for all different types of people.The book goes into great detail of the French Revolution. Dickens describes &quot;the death-carts rumble, hollow and harsh&quot; very well. He describes the &quot;cold female&quot; guillotine throughout the book, so you can picture it in your head. He describes how the citizens sharpen the female most of the time due to how many prisoners' she has beheaded. Dickens is very good with giving detail.Dickens also went into great detail with his characters. Lucie Manette's golden hair, the business man, Mr.Lorry, The heroic but drunk Sydney Carton, and the shouldering through life C. J. Stryver. Those all are one of the many descriptions/tags Dickens has given his characters. When introducing his characters he goes deep into their description. Such as the case with Lucie Manette. Lucie was &quot;a young lady of not more than 17 in a riding cloak, and still holding her straw traveling hat by its ribbon in her hand. As his eyes rested on a short, slight, pretty figure, a quantity of golden hair, a pair of blue eyes that met his own with an inquiring look, and a forehead with a singular capacity of lifting and knitting itself into an expression that was not quite one of perplexity.&quot; Obviously, Dickens knew how to describe something to the point where you can picture it in your mind.The story Charles Dickens so beautifully and descriptively wrote, takes place during the French Revolution. The story covers the many lovers of Lucie Manette has and the one she marries. It covers how Lucie Manette is reunited with her Bastille imprisoned father, Alexander Manette. Lucie Manette's husband, Charles Darnay, hands over his title of Evremonde, the Marquis, which only his uncle knows. So, thinking that if he, Darnay, returns to France, the french citizens will think him a hero, who gave up his title to take the side of the french peasants. When Darnay goes to France, the peasants arrest him for being an Evremonde and throw him in the prison, La Force. Dr. Manette's influence gets Darnay out of prison, but again he is thrown in a prison, the Bastille. Dr. Manette's influence can not get him out this time, but Sydney Carton, who swore Lucie his love and to do anything for it, including dying for her, switches places with Darnay in the Bastille.The story is very well-written with great descriptions. It contains both death and romance. Two different types of topics for two different types of people. It is something everyone can enjoy!"},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"When a dream of change for the peasents comes true The nobles are in for a rude awakening.

We do a classic read twice a year and have found it to be a wonderful experience. It's amazing how your perspective changes from high school to adulthood. I had felt like I'd read it as I knew some of it's more memorable lines but I was unprepared for the actual story.It takes place during the French Revolution. I kept thinking that it was the same time that we were starting as a country so it gave me a different perspective. First of all, let me tell you those Europeans are quite creative on how they kill people. It actually made me ill when they were cutting off their hands and ears, blinding them and then drawing and quartering them. What was so bad about just killing them without the torture? Yuck. I don't remember Americans ever doing that so I am grateful for that. Still, Americans were not oppressed the way these French peasants were. I can't blame them from revolting and exacting their revenge but the lengths they went to were awful.I had trouble getting into parts of it because the language was so flowery. This was especially true when writing about Lucie. Everyone seemed to worship at her feet and language was quite laudatory. Once I got past that, I was OK. The story was quite mesmerizing and Madame Defage has to be one of the most memorable characters in fiction.There's a reason why we read Dickens all these years later. There's a reason why adults should go back and remind ourselves of that. It's a gift to give ourselves."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"This book is still as wonderful and when my wife and I read it years ago. I reminded my wife that in the olden days Charles Dickens was paid one penny for each word--this explains the detail taken with every description. This book is a wonderful way to take one's mind back to one's own good old days. When my Wife read this book on her kindle--she could not put it down. She only stopped reading the book when the Kindle Fire Second Generation had to be recharged. We want everyone reading this to know how fortunate each of you are to own a Kindle--my Wife's best friend is a scientist and her Husband purchased a Nooke from Barnes and Noble several years ago--she had a terrible time figuring out how to use it. Several weeks ago I encountered a woman reading a Nooke in a waiting room--she said that she liked it; notwithstanding she had to drive a distance to attend classes at a Barnes and Noble Store to learn how to use it. She added that when she purchased the NOOKE, this device could procure books at no charge from the public library--NOW THE KINDLE CAN DO JUST THAT--she further mentioned that if she had it do do all over again, given CURRENT circumstances--THE KINDLE would be the device of choice. My dear Wife is a very determined person and has always considered me to be the computer literate person in our household; however, I still cannot figure out the things that she is doing with her Kindle Fire second generation. I have found Amazon to be very helpful. My belief is that if AMAZON.com is selling an item; then one can trust in it--AMAZON has never let me down. My wife is so happy. This book was free and since then other books were purchased; in the alternative none has had the significant impact of a \\"Tale of Two Cities.\\" AMAZON.com is so wonderful--if I wer not married and AMAZON.com were a girl; I would marry her--probably against her will--just joking. Amazon.com has more integrity than any company I have every encountered.

Charles Dickens is timeless, entertaining, and one of my favorite authors."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"A Tale of Two Cities is an entertaining novel written by Charles Dickens in 1859. Dickens writes in a sentimental, sympathetic, sarcastic, horrified, grotesque, and even a grim tone. The books setting is from 1775 to 1793 in Paris, London, and their outskirts. Though A Tale of Two Cities has a sad, sweet, and thought-provoking ending, the beginning and middle of the novel is about the sufferings of Doctor Manette, a Bastille prisoner.One night in November 1775, a mail coach was going from London to Dover. Jerry Cruncher is one of the two men in the mail coach. Jerry receives a message from a man in the distance, Mr. Lorry, by hollering to see who the man in the distance was. Mr. Lorry sends the message stating \\" Wait at Dover for Mam'selle\\". Jerry responds to that message with \\"recalled to life\\". The setting shifts to Saint Antoinette, in the outskirts of Paris, for a moment. There we witness a terrible accident in which wine bursts onto the streets. All of the poverty of the town immediately rushes to the wine and drink, sopping it with rags and feeding it to their children. One poor man rubs his finger in the \\"muddy wine-lees\\" and scribbles the word \\"blood\\" on a wall. This foreshadows the deaths that are to come during the upcoming time period.Meanwhile, Lorry and Lucie are led up a dangerously steep rise of stairs by Doctor Manette to visit a shoemaker. When the shoemaker is asked his name, he replies \\"One Hundred and Five, North Tower\\".The setting is now moved to 1780. Jerry Cruncher scolds his wife for \\"praying against him\\" because he is a grave robber. Charles Darnay is then charged for divulging information to the king of France. Darnay is also charged for passing English secrets into French hands. Darnay is released, but then charged again, almost immediately, for knowing too much information.Madame Defarge knits as a hobby. She knits, everyday, names into her piece of work. We later realize that these names are the names that Madame Defarge is planning to condemn. Her knitting symbolizes the kindness and innocense of a kind old woman knitting in her chair. Ironically, she is to hatefully condemn whomever's name she knits into her piece of work.Finally, Darnay is found guilty of knowing too much and is sentenced to death by the guillotine. Carton feels that he must allow Darnay to live by sacrificing himself in Darnay's position. He believes that the people of the town will think that he is Darnay because the two men look similar. We are told that Carton must die so that Darnay may live happily with his newly wedded wife. As Carton is led to the guillotine, he tells the reader that \\"It is a far, far better thing and a far, far better rest that I go to\\".This novel is very entertaining to the reader. Dickens did a wonderful job foreshadowing the blood that is yet to come with the wine cask. Dickens thoroughly explains all of his characters throughout the novel, allowing us, as the readers, to believe as if we, ourselves, are one of the characters. However, Dickens does give us a fabulous ending, but he takes his time in getting us to the ending. His style of writing is very old fashioned, making the novel a little more complex, and a little more complicated to read at times."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"I bought it cuz the cover was cool but didn't read it..yet..It has a beautiful front page.

I think Dickens was a bit absent minded in the first two books, because the plot is quite weak and flickering. In book three the intensity grows and resembles more a normal novel. The content of this novel is the most commonplace sentimental trivia. But apparently it has met the tastes of the audience at the time. Dickens is supposed to be a great writer, right? It's quite amazing that he could pour out this kitschy sentimental romantic trivia. Was he just calculating on the limited minds and romantic dispositions of his female audience to increase his sales? Or was he, after all, not that great a writer?"},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"I have to read a tale of two cities for english class and i think it isnt a easy book.

His work is a mix of revolting sentimentality, unbelievable contrivance, and overly simplistic themes; we can see this clearly in 'A Tale of Two Cities.'The novel was written in serialized form for sheer entertainment value, and it shows. We are expected to believe a multitude of completely implausible coincidences, all leading up to a ridiculous ending in which every piece of the puzzle fits together precisely. Entertaining? Maybe briefly, but the enjoyment is superficial. We realize that real life does not tie up every end so neatly, and we are left feeling manipulated.In Dickens' world, good is unquestionably perfect and bad is utterly evil. There are no shades of gray. Lucie Manette and Charles Darnay are paragons of virtue: neither displays one identifiable fault throughout the entire novel. They are flat, boring characters; it is not possible to identify with them or to have any measure of sympathy for them. Even Sydney Carton, a slightly more rounded character, undergoes an unbelievable redemption by the end of the novel and becomes almost a Christ figure. Meanwhile, the evil villains, of course, get their due!I must say that Dickens occasionally shows a gift for description. He is at his best when he uses extended metaphors, recurring symbols, and detailed descriptions. The scene in which peasants in Saint Antoine drink spilled wine in the street is eloquently written and filled with haunting imagery: it is one of the few passages that manages to convey the atmosphere of revolution. However, these passages are few and far between.If you are one of those people who delight in discovering yet another connection among characters, or if you really want to believe that love always triumphs over hate, Dickens is the way to go.

I had to read the book my freshman year in high school. Now that I've graduated and look back on all the books that I have read it was one of the most boring books on the face of this earth!! Teachers and schoolboards must use this book as a touture method in school. Another boring book is Wuthering Heights, I won't even discuss that one."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"Charles Dickens crafts a beautiful and highly enjoyable rendition of the French Revolution in this fast-paced novel. He begins with a line that will go down in history as one of the greatest openers of all time: \\"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times...\\" The novel then steadily progresses, introducing insightful characters that readers would like to call their friends. Among these are the loyal Mr. Lorry, golden-haired and tender-hearted Lucie Manette, the fragile and broken Dr. Manette, and wild but hilarious Mrs. Pross. Charles Dickens quickly matches these kind and benevolent characters up with one of the most sinister characters in historical fiction...the dreaded Madame Defarge who, with her knitting needles and calm demeanor, even sends a chill up the spine of the reader. Of course the ingenious writer did not forget to create a character or two that embodied the courage, sacrifice and beauty found in a favorite idea in literature--love. The virtually flawless Darnay is every girl's dream come true, but the real hero and tear jerker of the novel is the beloved, although troubled, Sydney Carton.With such a cast of characters, and the chaotic streets of a little French town as a back drop, Dickens brings to life the frightening yet monumental French revolution. He carefully intertwines the lives of the Manettes and Defarges with historically accurate events of the French revolution, driving along the complex plot of the novel while also entertaining now-a-day readers with a quick history lesson. This is not any ordinary history lesson however; Readers find themselves submerged in the upturned life of the Manettes and all their devoted friends. Readers find themselves widening their eyes at the bloodthirsty actions of the revolutionary remarks. Readers find themselves smiling thoughtfully with every ray of hope that enters Dr. Manette or Darnay's life. Readers find themselves shaking in fright as Madame Defarge rasps her plans of vengeance to her authoritative revolutionist husband.This novel is truly a work of historical fiction. This novel molds the events of the French Revolution with heavy moods, oppressive settings, exciting action, memorable quotes and lines, and of course a brilliant cast of beloved characters.Readers will find themselves falling in love with this great imagery master's works as they experience firsthand the genius storytelling of Charles Dickens in this easily readable novel. I highly recommend A Tale of Two Cities for historical understanding or just general reading."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"Charles Dickens' book, A Tale of Two Cities, may seem boring and monotonous, but the entire story combines to create something magical. His ability to create characters that intrigues and fascinates the reader is unmatched. He devotes the first half of the book solely to develop characters. At this point, details might seem incessant and pointless but overall, it creates a complete familiarity with the characters. He describes Mr. Jarvis Lorry as a man of business with \\"no time for [feelings]\\" and \\"no chance for [feelings]\\" (27). The unique personalities of every character appeals the reader as they feel empathetic towards every character and truly care about their fate. Dickens' ability to engage the reader is unparalleled.Dickens' use of plot twists and historical references keeps the story interesting throughout. Dickens uses historical events, such as the Storming of the Bastille or the execution of the king and queen, to give the book a physical reference. The reader can connect to the story when it takes place during a time when the French Government oppressed the peasants into revolt. The anger of the peasants rises like a \\"sea of black and threatening waters\\" (226). This \\"remorseless sea\\", swirling with \\"voices of vengeance\\" cannot be swayed by the \\"touch of pity\\" (226). Dickens characterizes the anger of peasants as vengeful and bloodthirsty. He conveys that it is right for them to usurp their corrupt government but he is disappointed at the cruelty expressed by the peasants. Dickens' use of opinionated tone, history and characterization allows the reader to understand all aspects of the book.One thing that Dickens fails to accomplish is allowing the reader to connect with one main character. This novel consists of many characters, each with pivotal roles, but Dickens fails to let the reader follow one character from start to finish. In the end, Dickens allows Sydney Carton to take on the role of the dynamic protagonist but his status is not known until the plot unfolds. The lack of a main character is detrimental towards the novel but the broad character descriptions allow the reader to understand the entire plot.Charles Dickens' book, A Tale of Two Cities, is an excellent book filled with exciting history, deep mystery and an unforgettable ending."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"Dickens uses the French Revolution and its battles as the setting for this classic novel. However, the true story lies in the personal battles of the characters with either themselves or others. Dickens wonderfully creates the characters in A Tale of Two Cities. One of the main highlights of the book lies in Sydney Carton, who Dickens created magnificently. Carton experiences a brilliant transformation, and commits an astounding act of self-sacrifice at the end of the novel, which will leave a lasting impression on the reader. Moreover, Dickens' characters highly vary in personality. For instance, Madame Defarge has a truly evil and bloodthirsty nature whereas Lucie Manette displays consistent kindness. Dickens gradually develops these characters as well as the plot and connects everything together, successfully drawing the reader's interest.It takes quite a few pages for the novel to become truly engaging, which is one of its downsides. Further, although the descriptions of the revolutionaries, aristocrats, and other figures enrich the novel, Dickens sometimes seems to use too much description in various places which can bore the reader. Also, if one does not analyze the content and read carefully, it may be difficult to pick up on some of the motifs, symbols, or metaphors. Similarly, the length of the novel and the author's style of writing can make this book hard to read. Therefore, it might be better to read this novel if you have a good amount of time.This book is recommended to the reader who is looking for a deep novel and not just a quick read. A Tale of Two Cities is filled with great characters and although it takes time, Dickens develops the plot enough for the story to become interesting."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"In the text, A Tale of Two Cities, Charles Dickens cleverly crafts the story of a family struggling through the grasp of the French Revolution. This tale makes the gruesome events of the Revolution approachable. The characters of Lucie and her family and friends all exhibit qualities that render them life-like. Lucie's undying love for her family, innocence, and her job of keeping her family intact contributes to the sympathy readers feel for her. The heartbreak of the Manette family at the persecution of Darnay gave readers insight to the conflicts of the Revolution at a personal level. Overall, the characters of the novel add a sense of connectivity to the novel. Dickens astoundingly, blends timeless feelings and emotions with an historic event, making A Tale of Two Cities relate to people of all ages and a book that is highly recommended."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"Charles Dickens gives life to the French Revolution in his classic novel, A Tale of Two Cities. The story centers around a significant historic event in the history of France, but shows a more sinister setting than what one can depict of aristocratic and peasantry life in the late 1700s. To enjoy this book, one would need to understand the events which occurred around that time and how the estates of France(the social hierarchy) led their lives. The book describes the impact of the revolution on characters in the book. With compassionate aristocracy such as Lucie Manette, who show warmth and gratitude towards others, to revenge-seeking revolutionaries such as the notorious Madame Defarge, Dickens portrays a unique and memorable set of characters that defy stereotypical visions of the personalities of people at the time. However, the paragraphs are often incredibly descriptive and wordy. The chapter titles propose an enigma, and, if one is not fully aware of what is happening, it would be wise to reread. If Dickens were not paid by every word he wrote at the time, this book would have been both shorter and more captivating to the audience. Nonetheless, A Tale of Two Cities provides a muted romance, suspenseful adventure, and a piece of history in one novel."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"Dickens wrote a classic when writing A Tale of Two Cities. Focused around the time period of the French Revolution, this novel's interesting storyline captivated me from the beginning. It is surely one of the best novels he wrote.Perhaps my favorite character, Madame Defarge was clever, cunning, and quick. She personifies rebellion and resistance, which adds to her dark persona. Her, along with The Vengeance, are not typical female characters and are especially different from Lucie; Madame Defarge speaks her mind and gets her hands dirty while fighting for something she believes in. Powerful and well respected, Madame Defarge significantly adds to the novel.As the novel progresses, France plunges deeper into revolution with the hopes of executing all aristocrats. Sydney Carton saves Charles Darnay, whom the French people wish to see killed, as per a previous promise to Darnay's wife, Lucie. Sydney goes on to die for Darnay, feeling satisfied with his death because he wants to see Lucie happy. Sydney, the opposite of Madame Defarge, represents the good in the world and the sensitivity that some people have. His actions are loving, caring, and kind.The numerous descriptions of the mobs and the aristocrats add to the depth of the book. While Dickens characterizes the mob as the dirty, uncivilized, and poverty-stricken peasants of France, the Monseigneur, who needs four people to feed him his chocolate, represents the aristocrats as a whole. The wide contrast in social class and the detail that Dickens uses to describe it leads to further events, which make the plot more interesting.The end of this novel shocks the reader, although the reader will surely remember it. This novel is definitely one to pick up again and read for pleasure, and to relive the numerous scenes that define the story."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"A Tale Of Two Cities, a classic novel by Charles Dickens, highlights the ups and downs of the French Revolution, and how it affected the people in France and England. The dynamic personalities of the characters and how their fates intertwine, with the fascinating description of the mobs and the revolutionaries, together combine a masterpiece of vengeance, love, and hate.Themes of resurrection, secrets, dualities etc. create twists to the plot of the novel, gripping the reader into the story. However, sometimes the descriptions can become a little tedious, as they sometimes reiterate the same idea/concept.The most intriguing character in the book is Sydney Carton. His inhibits a complex personality as he undergoes significant transformations. The character of Carton lays down the entire foundation of the ending of the novel, as he concludes the book with \\"It is a far, far better thing that I do, than I have ever done; it is a far, far better rest that I go to than I have ever known.\\"The revolutionaries and the mob in Paris were bloodthirsty, violent, and aggressive. Madame Defarge, leader of the revolutionaries, possessed a merciless quality, seeking revenge against the aristocracy.This novel definitely is a good choice as it displays many captivating factors, however it may appear to be slightly hard to understand in various parts or a little boring to some people. But overall it is a great, highly recommended classic."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"The novel, A Tale of Two Cities, by Charles Dickens stands as one of the most exciting and interesting books ever written. Dickens delivers a complex story with multi-dimensional characters. Although the characters do not replicate typical people, they do help develop the plot and enrich the story. This story stems from the hate of the peasantry for the Nobles during the era of the French Revolution. The hate of the peasantry drives the novel forward and into scenes like the Storming of the Bastille. Dickens effectively captures true history into an otherwise fictional tale. Reader's will enjoy the vivid action scenes and learn about the horrors of the revolution through the dark tone set by Charles Dickens. Whereas history books may just explain the battles of the revolution, A Tale of Two Cities exposes the personalities and lifestyles of the peasantry and the aristocracy.This story lives and breathes because of the characters involved. Dickens makes all the characters unique and significant to the novel. The characters all attribute specific personalities which makes the novel seem diverse and intriguing. Readers will enjoy following the actions and behaviors of each of the characters as they interact with each other in the novel.Dickens chooses characters like Lucie to embody goodness and light, but on the other hand, characters like Mrs. Defarge carry a wicked and dark persona. Meanwhile, other characters like Sydney Carton lie as mysteries. The characters of the novel really color in the book and help develop the plot. Without them, the book would drag on, dull and lifeless.Along with the characters, Dickens uses symbols and metaphors to engage the reader into the novel. In order to really appreciate Dickens work, the reader must think deeply and analyze the text. Throughout the novel, Dickens gives clues and hints about future events. In the beginning, he consistently mentions footsteps which symbolize the revolutionists to foreshadow the coming of the French Revolution. With his clues and hints, Dickens makes reading the novel interactive and fun.Any reader looking for a book to digest should choose this book. This novel will certainly keep any reader entertained.Charles Dickens creates a brilliant story based on the French Revolution.In Fact, even after finishing the book, readers will return to absorb the symbols and hints they missed in their first read through."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"Charles Dickens presents a long, but interesting tale filled with suspicion, brutality, and romance in his book A Tale Of Two Cities. This story which took place during the French Revolution, a very captivating time period, was difficult to get into for me because the plot in the beginning did not capture my attention. There were many unexplained mysteries and Dickens' writing was so vague that I thought I would never uncover the answers. I was assigned to read this book for school, (it was my first Charles Dickens novel) and I had been told that it was long and boring by upper-classmates. At first the novel seemed the way I had been hinted it was because many characters were static and uninteresting, Lucie, the only woman in the book was sweet, but hard to enjoy due to her lack of independence and strength, and Dickens' style of writing was difficult to understand and overly descriptive. I felt that he was so descriptive it took away from the interesting plot he unfolded little by little. Finally, when I had become further into my reading, the plot developed intensely and the detail blurred into the background, I could understand his style better, and I enjoyed more of the newly discovered characters. The book became more bearable to read and I found myself starting to enjoy it. Sydney Carton (the protagonist) took a place in my heart because of the misunderstood and unique hero he was. I kept reading more than I was assigned trying to find out what would happen in Carton, Darnay and Lucie's complicated love triangle, and how other problems in the book would be resolved. The vengeful revolutionaries disgusted me and it was impossible for me to imagine how any person could be as bloodthirsty as the visual imagery Dickens used helped me visualize the fighting scenes. When good won out over evil (Miss Pross and Madame Defarge struggle), I started happy dancing, showing how into the book I had become. The ending to this novel, in my mind was unforgettable, and the ultimate sacrifice Carton made out of love held a place in my heart. I will always remember the outcome of this book, and the classic beginning and ending lines of this classic book."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"Charles Dickens' \\"A Tale of Two Cities\\" is a novel filled with luscious detail, deep plot and intriguing characters. The plot centers around Lucie Manette and her love Charles Darnay, who attempt to avoid the wrath of the French Revolution. Initially, it seems that there are too many characters and the plot is complex as well, but as the novel progresses the readers learns how everything is actually connected. All of the peasants help depict the wretched conditions of France before and during the French Revolution era, and Madame Defarge represents how truly vicious they are. Sydney Carton is one of the most interesting and dynamic characters in the novel, changing from an alcohol induced good for nothing to a heroic, Christ-like figure. Dickens tone towards the French Revolution makes it an interesting read, as at first he seems to support the French citizens and their cause, yet later shows them to be bloodthirsty animals. All of the themes he expands upon really make the reader think of human nature and how ruthless a person can be, in addition to how loving and caring a person can be. His use of imagery and various literary devices aid the novel in being memorable and fascinating. Even though Dickens writing style is rather wordy, it is a truly action-filled and exciting novel, as long as you take the time to truly read it and not just skim through; do that and you will be lost within the first chapter."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"A Tale of Two cities is a vivid story of the French Revolution filled with imagery and motifs that are thick in the literature. So many stories collide in as the numerous characters are all connected some way, some how. There's a dramatic love triangle, a revenge story, a recovery from an eighteen year imprisonment and much more.Charles Dickens writes as someone from his day would, filled with commas and metaphors. For children under thirteen this might be inappropriate, not because of content, but because they might not understand it enough to appreciate all it has to offer. It shows the immoral side of humanity, even though revenge isn't the only purpose. The aristocrats were mercilessly taken from there homes and to La Guillotine.Motifs such as The Sea, Redemption, Secret Sins, Letters, and many others reinforce what is trying to be demonstrated. They are occurring events or ideas that keep the book interesting. So many of these characters come to their doom and it the affects the reader just as it would if you were actually watching it. Dramatic foreshadowing is also very affecting, but the actual events are even more thrilling.Overall, I recommend this book to all willing to read, it's a wonderful book to enhance your literary vocabulary. It has tastes for men with its brutal wars and battles, but also has a sense of feminism as the love story will interests the women."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"I was not familiar with the general plot of the story when I started reading, and so was completely in the dark about what would happen in its course. Usually I can predict what will happen in a story quite early, but this has so many twists in plot, I did not figure it out until quite late. I like that a lot. Dickens invests a great amount of time in developing and establishing characters, and not just a few, but many. It is a tragic sort of story, but that's usually what makes the best books beautiful.It is not one of the books that have something mysterious in it that make me read it over and over. That being said, I am very glad I read it, and have already recommended it to others."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"This is one of the classics. It was required reading when I was in high school, back in the 60s. I have read it several times since, but I wanted a new copy for my library. It is beautifully written. It offers a good review of early times in French history and the descriptions are vivid, poetic and visceral in the way Dickens writes. He makes you feel just like you are there amongst the locals. He lets you feel the fear, the suffering, and lets you smell the smells of the streets of France in the time of their revolution. The book is so worth reading if it is new to you or rereading if you have read it before. I just love it."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"I cant begin to explain how powerful and dramatic this book was for me to read. I cant wait to read it again. The style of writing is older but that is what I came to love about it. I can hardly bear a modern writing style any more. After reading this I found it impossible to read some of my previous favorite books simply beacause the language is so modern and simple. I have since read many of the classics (as I would call them) from the 18th and 19th centuries. I am about to read my second Dickens novel and I can only hope it will inspire me as much as this book did. I have always enjoyed reading but this book takes my enjoyment to a whole new level. I havent stopped reading since I finished it. I also must admit, I stayed up all night reading the last part and cried like a girl after finishing it. I just sat my kindle down and had a serious reflection on what it is to be human.

This story is made of long sentences, full of dependent clauses that can make reading seem laborious for some readers because they have to read to the very end of the sentence carefully (and perhaps slower than usual) to grasp it's meaning. Similarly, the story deposits a plethora of seemingly superfluous details, but as the story unravels, those details ALL become connected and begin to matter.

Tom Baker is magnificent.He's Tom Baker.His voice is deep and rich and pleasurable as the center of a dark chocolate truffle.

Innocent people on both sides of the English Channel are swept up in the current of seething passion and agony, from one capital, across water and beach, to yet another capital, in a demented attempt to appease long-denied justice. It is unfortunate that the excesses of the Privileged are counterbalanced by the atrocities of the Oppressed, as centuries of aristocractic abuse are purged in a national bloodbath of revenge run amuck.This tale (originally serialized in newspaper installments) presents a twist on the eternal triangle plot; father-daughter-suitor/husband, as the three men who love Lucie Manette deeply-- but in different ways--struggle to protect their adored angel.Forged over a few decades, the inevitable chain of events which results in the ultimate sacrifice of self, is revealed in various poignant links--albeit not in perfect chronological order. The sins of the past are revisited upon the innocent (or barely guilty) heirs, as two letters written from prisons produce cataclysmic social results. Devotion, treachery, honor and pitiless vindictiveness are the threads which the author has knitted into his literary Register of personal tragedy which is inextricabley woven into a national horror. This novel provides a great study of the vicious, remorseless cult of the guillotine, along with Dickens'usual parade of memorable primary and secondary characters.

It begins very obscurely at first, but that is only an exception so keep this in mind because you might be tempted to quit reading.

That, as they were not so decreed, he probably would not have one.\\"This is a funny line from the first trial of Charles Darnay, in Book the Second, Chapter Three. Dickens is criticizing the law system. This entire speech is given by the \\"Attorney General\\" and he goes on and on about the love of his witness's country. The second witness is the servant, whose patriotism \\"forced\\" him to search Darnay's papers. The cross-examiner finds that the first witness served time in debtor's prison and gets in trouble for cheating at gambling. The second witness is also found to be untrustworthy. Such great humor can be found in the book, but more has to do with its drama and character study.In character study, when it comes to Darnay and Lucie Manette, there isn't much to study. They never change, they're still good and brave, etc., until the end, just the way they started. If you're looking for the study of a character who hides behind himself, suffers unseen scars, (in other words a hemingway character that lost his way in a Dickens book), you can read about Sydney Carton. Dr. Manette is also a fascinating character who suffers through 18 years in prison and gradually recovers with the help of his daughter, and by the end is a strong, helpful character. Mme. Defarge is interesting partway through the novel, but at the climax all she represents anymore is pure evil, which is probably the point Dickens was trying to get across.If you're looking for a weird character, like in most Dickens novels, you still have Jerry. He's pretty weird.And if you still don't want to read this book, at least try it until chapter 8 in the second book, where you can read about how the Marquis needs assistance of four men just to drink hot chocolate. It shows the power, but ultimately helplessness of the French aristocracy.And if you're looking for historical stuff, it's covered in here, but it's merely a conflict with the characters."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"This is a good book set around the time of the French Revolution and subsequent disturbances. The story is of a transcending love. Recommended."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"This is possibly my favorite book. The most significant highlight which piqued my greater appreciation were the detailed and short glimpses of larger stories. Dr. Manet is my favorite character, and probably the one that I relate to most above all literary characters. This book is absolutely inspiring and makes me want to be a better writer. Charles Dickens is absolutely brilliant. His depiction of the human struggle and condition throws a spectacular look at man's psyche."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"Looking for a classic that you will actually &quot;enjoy&quot; reading? I recommend A Tale of Two Cities highly."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"I love the classics. So many are just great stories with interesting characters, whose lives are spliced together usually in one way or another to add to the complexity. But with this one, I had more than a few issues.Coming off of reading Hugo's &quot;Les Miserables&quot; (an excellent book, go read!), I expected more of the same from Dickens, the subject matter is much the same. But this book was just so *dry*...don't get me wrong, Dickens has a very good way of describing events and people, albeit it he's excessive about it. An earlier post said that he spent 3 pages describing Lucie's furrowed brow upon discovery of Charles incarceration in France. This is very true. I remember 5 pages being spent reading about the weather and road conditions early in the book and thinking &quot;couldn't he have just abridged it a bit&quot;?Sydney I guess is supposed to be a hero of sorts, and while what he did in the end was a noble thing, I couldn't help but be annoyed by the guy. He spent the entire book lamenting himself, and I just don't like spending my time feeling sorry for people who are more than capable of helping themselves. The language can be very confusing, but I am happy to say that grabbing Cliff's Notes never entered my mind.I guess you should read this thing, but only if you have a lot of time on your hands...if nothing else you'll be able to tell your friends, &quot;Yup, I read A Tale of Two Cities&quot;. Then put it back up on the shelf and let it collect dust."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"While cultural pundits try to convince you that some literature is better than other literature, the truth is that all art is relative to individial tastes. Thus, it doesn't make any sense to think that a novel like this one is really any better than say, Michael Crichton or Stephen King. Aesthetic standards can't be grounded.Thus, don't listen to anyone who tries to distinguish between &quot;serious&quot; works of literature like this one and allegedly &quot;lesser&quot; novels. The distinction is entirely illusory, because no novels are &quot;better&quot; than any others, and the concept of a &quot;great novel&quot; is an intellectual hoax."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"Tale of Two Cities overall is a poorly written book. Charles Dickens way too much time adding detail and excess bagage to the story. However, I do understand that Dickens wrote this book in the 1800s, when books were too expensive for most people to afford. Dickens wrote this story in different segments. Wanting to keep the people interested, Dickens added many details and cliffhangers to the book. Now that the different segments of the story are put together, the details make the story seem neverending and almost tiring. Despite the excess writing, the plot of the book is readable. It contains a conflict and resolution. The ending of the book is excellent and it makes all of the time the reader spends getting to the end worthwhile. Also, the characters of the novel are great. Sydney Carton invests much drama and conflict into the story and ties the storyline together. On the otherhand, Lucie Manette is a pathetic character. She adds a stereotype into the novel, being that women are weak and are unable to handle hard situations. She is too perfect and almost reaches the point of annoyance. Overall, I rated the book with two stars based on the storyline of the book."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"Tale of Two Cities overall is a poorly written book.

Perhaps it did not occur to the readers that occasionally effort is required to enjoy any particular activity? T2C is not only fascinating, but it resonates with detail, generates unforgettable characters, and illustrates equally the horrors before AND after the Revolution. Granted, the first chapters are tedious, and coincidences are occasionally a bit too opportune, but on the whole this is a stunning work of true merit. I admit that the book is also much more enjoyable if the reader has access to someone who knows the book (an English teacher for instance!). Incidentally, I am 17, and would gladly read this instead of another paperback thriller or cheap romance any day!"},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"I love this book.

You get an inside view of what it must have been like to live during the &quot;Reign of Terror&quot; in 18th Century France, and see the inner workings of the minds of revolutionaries.

The one being displayed most of the time is completely false. The second picture is what you're actually getting, which is more of a plastic covered elementary school rental. I would have returned it, but shipping would cost as much as I paid for the book. Should have known better."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"It occurred to me that although I had been working my way through the classics, I had never read a \\"real version\\" of a Dickens novel. Oh sure, I had read the children's version of \\"Oliver Twist\\" and have been to see the play of \\"A Christmas Carol\\" probably 15 times... but I had never actually sat down and tried to read any real Dickens. Now I don't know if this is a good place to start or not... but this is where I started.It took a while to really get into the book, the language was a bit overbearing at first, and the characters were a bit hard to keep sorted out in my mind. But then we get to the release of the good Doctor Mannette things pick up... I was trucking along, managing with the language and then in the middle I became bogged down with confusion... I struggled for a chapter or two and then hit the last quarter of the book... and let me tell you, all of the confusion was worth it if only for the last chapter.Dickens main characters are actually rather flat and one-sided, however he makes up for it with the power and intrigue in his supporting cast. Some of the supporting characters in this novel are among the most interesting and either lovable or detestable that I have encountered. With the engrossing backdrop of the French Revolution, and heads being lopped of by Lady Guillotine every other moment... this book really focuses not on the revolution, but on the effects of the revolution on a select group of people. The Title implies that this will be a tale predominantly about London and Paris, but in reality the title is very misleading. The crux of the true story is about Paris, and our character's attempts to remove themselves from it.I hate to say more, I went into this book knowing nothing about it, and because of that I was able to be shocked and almost brought to tears by the beauty and power of the ending. I highly recommend it, even though many will struggle through the middle, know that the ending is well worth the struggle. There is a reason this is listed one of the \\"1001 books to read before you die\\" there is a power to this story that will resound with you long after you close the book."}]`),x={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:R},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:D,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(s=>setTimeout(s,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},S={class:"card-container"},L=["disabled"],E={key:0},M={key:1};function B(s,e,n,c,r,a){const f=w("PoemCard");return t(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=o("div",{class:"top-banner"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),o("div",S,[(t(!0),i(g,null,y(a.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(t(),p(f,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),a.hasMorePoems?(t(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>a.loadMore&&a.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(t(),i("span",M,"Loading...")):(t(),i("span",E,"See more"))],8,L)):b("",!0)])}const O=u(x,[["render",B],["__scopeId","data-v-b60fb554"]]),j=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"drive/45.md","filePath":"drive/45.md"}'),q={name:"drive/45.md"},P=Object.assign(q,{setup(s){return(e,n)=>(t(),i("div",null,[v(O)]))}});export{j as __pageData,P as default};
