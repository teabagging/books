With so many characters and so much attention devoted to the \\"strange\\" Savannah, Deborah's strengths take a backseat. Among all the interesting facts about the High Point Market, Deborah is not the warm character I've come to appreciate."},{"Title":"Killer Market","review":"I've long enjoyed Margaret Maron's books, and especially the Judge Knott series. However, I'm disturbed to see a common theme of prejudice against asians--some incidents more subtle than others. Why is it every asian character in the books apparently assumed to be foreign born/speaking and ignorant of the customs and laws of this country. In one book, one of the story threads deal with a Vietnamese family who are hard working, but use their gardening business as a means to steal pets to eat. Judge Knott says, it isn't called prejudice to address cultural differences, and I agree...but, why is every asian reference negative? In another book, it is the adopted asian baby that was killed in a car wreck (disposable?). In the Killer Market, there are two references. One where the good judge is surprised that an asian woman speaks english without an accent; and another incident where she feels an asian man seated next to to at a dinner party for a group of judges is treating her like a \\"party favor\\". In explaining this treatment, there are also references to the asian prostituion in explaining his treatment of her (as if this was prevalent and exclusive to the asian cultures). There is not one single positive reference. Now I don't expect my characters not to have faults, but when your main character is inspired to become a judge after seeing unfair, prejudicial treatment to other minorities (blacks and hispanics), I'm disappointed. Actually, I'm more than disappointed, because this trend keeps reappearing in Margaret Maron's books. I don't expect EEO quotas on the treatment of asians, blacks, hispanics, and rednecks in books or anywhere else for that matter, but the consistent negative references offend me."},{"Title":"Killer Market","review":"#5 of the Deborah Knott mysteries. My opinion of this author has not changed after reading this one. I think Maron has a very unique style of writing. I love the education a reader gets on a specific industry of North Carolina. In this one it was the furniture/decorating business. She takes an actual real life industry and weaves a mystery in it. Not only is a reader getting a fun mystery, but they are learning something about North Carolina. This is great, especially if you live in the state. The problem I have with her writing is, I find it difficult to follow her characters. I think Maron could add a few more pages to her books to give a recap of Deborah Knott and her character, as well as, more memorable information on the characters particular to the story. I find myself having to go back to figure out who is who and what part do they play in the story line quite a few times. If she did this, the rating would go from a 3 to a 5 in no time."},{"Title":"Killer Market","review":"This author is remarkably easy to read and her Deborah Knott series always extremely entertaining. Usually Deborah's adventures are set in her home town among her large family. This homespun feel adds a lot to the attractiveness of the series. This was necessarily missing in this installment as Deborah travels to another town to help out a fellow judge for a week. Also, the author chose to centre the plot around an international furniture market being held in the same town that week. While the change of settings added novelty, the furniture market setting was a bit distracting and confusing. Nevertheless, as with all books by this author, it is very highly recommended."},{"Title":"Killer Market","review":"Dunno why but this installment of the the Judge Deborah Knott series left me cold. I did not find the High Point setting to be interesting, or terribly realistic. This is the only one of her usually VERY FINE books that drags. Deborah, stay in your home county!"},{"Title":"Killer Market","review":"I am an avid reader that enjoys many different approaches to a good mystery. I read often and love discovering an author I have never read before. I have never read any books by Margaret Maron so this book was an introduction to both the author and an the established character, Judge Debra Knott. After reading Killer Market I intend to pursue and read other books by Margaret Maron. Her style is crisp and intriguing. You find your self being drawn in to the story early on and she succesfully keeps you there. So why the medium rating? More my fault possibly than the author's or Judge Knott's ability to keep your attention. The Debra Knott character is so well written you find your self wanting to know more about this female judge-amateur sleuth. Questions arise that were undoubtably covered in earlier adventures. I suggest therefore reading the earlier books with Judge Debra Knott. Background info will make this read much more enjoyable and the reader will be less distrated by questions that may crop up. Another point should be noted as well. There were alot of side plots to the main that brought depth to the book overall. I however found the final solution a little wanting for something more in the end. I don't know exactly, maybe a little Perry Mason laying down the facts type scenario to catch the culprit. After alot of twists and turns the climax was kind of flat, wanting of more drama and emotion. Over all the book was enjoyable and Margaret Maron has snagged a new fan."},{"Title":"Killer Market","review":"Margaret Maron continues her Judge Deborah Knott series with KILLER MARKET.

But parts of the book was okay. But the story drag on for too long. But the ending more than made up for the plot. This was not her best series. the ending was superb."},{"Title":"Killer Market","review":"Maron's Southern mysteries are just terrific; from the accurate descriptions of the courtroom scenes, the &quot;hearty&quot; Southern food, the family, and the country, it is obvious that Maron has either lived through these experiences or has done some really good research. I started the series with this book and have gone back and forth in the series until I finished them all. This one was possibly my favorite, in that Maron posed so many possible suspects with so many possible motives that it really was hard to tell who the murderer was (although some of my friends claim that they spotted the murderer right off the bat). In any event, Maron does keep you guessing. My only complaints, and they are gentle ones, is that the chapter headings seem to have no bearing on the story itself and simply serve to bog the reader down. Additionally, it seems as though the later books in the series presuppose that the reader has read the previous ones; some characters and relationships just &quot;appear&quot; and are not explained in enough detail to determine their relevance to the story or to Deborah. Otherwise, an excellent book and an excellent series."},{"Title":"Killer Market","review":"Being a native North Carolinian and a lawyer, I've enjoyed reading about Judge Deborah Knott from Colleton County, but the Judge in this book was STUPID. She goes to High Point during the furniture market without a room reservation. N.C. District Court judges have access to a sec- retary who would have handled any reservation. Maron doesn't even discuss Knott staying in the home of the Judge for whom she's subbing. It is inconceivable to image a Judge sleeping on a stranger's couch. She could have slept at the courthouse. Opps, no story! So we have an implausible story with cutsy dialogue. Upon meeting someone who recognizes her, Judge Knott replies &quot;You have the advantage of me sir&quot;. Yes, all Tar Heels speak this way, just as a District Court Judge will take up with a stranger at a mall and follow her all over High Point. Please, some- thing better next time!"},{"Title":"Killer Market","review":"Killer Market, by Margaret Maron, continues the crime solving adventures of Judge Deborah Knott. As usual, Ms. Maron, captures the essense of the South.

I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Killer Market","review":"I have read all of the Maron's and I enjoyed this one...it was a fun and rather wicked look at the furniture/decorating world and a good plot that was not overly contrived."},{"Title":"Killer Market","review":"Once a year, the population of High Point, North Carolina doubles as thetown hosts the International Home Furnishings Market trade show.

Deborah gets lucky when an elderly citizen, MatildaJernigan, invites her to stay with her. The desperate judicial officialquickly accepts. However, before long, Matilda disappears along withDeborah's purse. Day one in High Point may have been one of the low pointsin Deborah's life.Day two proves to Deborah that day one was, in deed, a high point as thepolice question her about them finding her purse near a murder victim, ChanNolan. Deborah realizes that she either solves the murder or comes up with analibi to keep the police away from her. Deborah works with an old law schoolcrony, Chan's mother-in-law in an attempt to uncover the identity of thekiller. It does not take long for Deborah to realize that Chan had manyenemies with strong motives for eliminating him. Deborah has to wade througheach individual's motives and alibis if she plans to discover who did it.The fifth entry in the Deborah Knott series is not up to the excellenceof its four predecessors. Deborah seems out of her element in her first bookoutside of her hometown and the solution appears to pat to satisfy fans ofthe series. Anyone who wants a taste of how good Margaret Maron normally is,needs to pass on this book (except for furniture lovers) and try any of theother entries.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Killer Market","review":"I have looked for this book for a while.

There were many twists and turns and I was unable to solve the mystery. Worth reading."},{"Title":"Killer Market","review":"After reading a serious history of World War I, I needed something light and fun and who better to turn to than Margaret Maron. I love her books and have been saving a couple I found at a book sale.Judge Deborah Knott not only has a huge family, she has many friends throughout the South, and occasionally is sent to fill in for a vacationing judge in some interesting little town. This time she's been sent to High Point, North Carolina and doesn't realize until she arrives and finds every motel filled that it is Market Week. That's the week when everyone who is anyone in the furniture business arrives in High Point to sell, steal ideas, entertain, and oh yes, there's a murder.Thankfully Deborah runs into an old friend from law school who had to drop out when her daughter was severely injured in an accident. Dixie then wound up in the furniture design business. Her best friend and neighbor Pell Austin, has a spare bedroom Deborah can occupy. That good news is clouded by Deborah finding the murder victim who happens to be Dixie's son-in-law.The story is convoluted but easy to follow with the fun mix of characters that we've come to expect in a Maron mystery. One of them is a woman who was a brilliant designer until she fell victim to bipolar disease; she won't stay on her medications and so is believed to be a crazy bag lady.Through the story we learn a lot about the ins and outs of furniture design and marketing. It appears to be a more cut-throat business than I would have thought. This is a good story, a fun read, and one I recommend."},{"Title":"Science on Stage: Expert Advice as Public Drama (Writing Science)","review":"This is a sleeper of a book I was fortunate to run across even though it has been in print for some time. Hilgartner uses a dramaturgical model to help understand how science is produced both on the front-stage to the public and the undisclosed back-stage actions particularly of the National Academy of Sciences. Hilgartner provides case studies of diet and health issues brought before the National Academy of Sciences, complete with a metaphorical Greek chorus, scripts, and backstage maneuvering that contradicts the front stage picture we are led to believe. Anyone who has followed pronouncements of the Academy on such issues as perchlorate or other environmental issues will find this book revealing.

I was writing a book that featured adventures on all seven continents, looking for rare and interesting wildlife. Of all the continents, Europe gave me the most trepidation. Where would I go to get away from humans and get closer to animals?When I read the most popular travel guides, all I could find were tips on touristy locations--the exact opposite of what I wanted. Eventually I discovered the \\"Wild Guide\\" series, put out by Interlink Books. Perfect!By using books in the Wild Guide series, such as Wild France, my wife and I were able to explore great out-of-the-way places that featured stunning landscapes and abundant wildlife. The end result was an outstanding adventure that became one of my favorite chapters in my book (which I appropriately titled \\"Surprisingly Europe\\").Unfortunately the Wild Guide series has not been updated, and books such as Wild France are likely in short supply. If you have interest in the natural side of Europe, snap-up these guides as quickly as you can.

A great resource, it exhaustively and authoritatively chronicles all known mammals preserved as fossils from that period of earth's history. In addition to the well known megafauna such as mammoths, mastodons, dire wolves, ground sloths, and giant bison, Kurten and Anderson detail animals nearly always ignored in popular works, such as rodents, bats, and insectivores.The book begins with a thorough listing of all known sites of Blancan, Irvingtonian, and Rancholabrean faunas throught the United States and Canada, with each site sorted by state or province, its location noted on a map (and in detail in the text), and notes included on general nature of the site, species recovered there, and often notes on its general importance. Nice black and white illustrations of some of the faunas are interspersed in this section of the tome.The bulk of the book though is the exhaustive listing of fossil mammals, each chapter organized around a particular order, and the chapter subdivided by family. Each species has common, alternate common, genus, species, and alternate (and no longer valid) genus and species names (such as in the case with the Jefferson's Mammoth, Mammuthus jeffersoni; it has also been called the Columbian Mammoth and the Imperial Mammoth, and seven other scientific names have been ascribed to it).Entries vary in the detail to which the species is described, though many are given several paragraphs devoted to description, life habits, and speculation as to the reason for extinction. Black and white illustrations of fossils are included in each chapter, and a small number of extinct mammals are shown as how they appeared in life. Occasional maps illustrate sites of major finds.Though not really a book one can sit down in a nice chair and read, it is interesting to flip through. Though more of a scholarly resource, it gives one pause to consider just how many mammals are no longer present on this continent. North America not only had the infamous &quot;sabretooth,&quot; the dire wolf, the mastodon, mammoths, tank-like glyptodonts, and the exotic ground sloth, but it once had scores of camels and llamas, a bewildering variety of horses, as well as giant beavers, yaks, cheetah, giant marmots, and possibly even pandas."},{"Title":"Pleistocene Mammals of North America","review":"As one fascinated by the Ice Age, especially vanished megafauna, I looked for a long time for a comprehensive book on vanished Ice Age animals of North America. This is it.The treatise is exhaustive in terms of what was known up to the publishing date. If it is read carefully, it will impart a knowledge of these interesting animals and also give the reader an excellent backgound on the Pleistocene ice advances. The authors' discussion regarding the breakdown of time periods is excellent.Even though the passage of time and new findings, particularly in Florida, have lessened the value of some of the data presented, the book remains a peerless review of a dynamic part of Earth's history.Caveat: The reader should have some background in zoology and anatomy, otherwise constant recourse to a dictionary may be required."},{"Title":"Pleistocene Mammals of North America","review":"This book has the most information that a paleontologist can find about North American mammals in one place. It is an exhaustive text book chock full of facts about all the mammals from that continent that have lived in the last 3 million years. As a layman interested in paleontology I found the book fascinating and easy to read. The book is seperated into two main parts: first chronology of faunas, and then than a discusion of all the orders of mammals , species by species. The book also discusses possible reasons for extinction. The only flaw in the book are some of the reasons given for extinction are contradictary. For example the extinction for the giant beaver was supposedly caused by competition with the modern day beaver, yet they coexisted for 2 million years, and the dental patterns suggest that they didn't have the same habits. Modern day beavers probably even created habitat that was favourable to prehistoric giant beavers."},{"Title":"Introduction to Computer Engineering: Logic Design and the 8086 Microprocessor (Book/Disk)","review":"This book is a good start to learning to design logic gates and digital circuits.

Since the writer of the diary and the author of the book are not of the Jewish faith, it lends much credence to the events that took place. Readers with high blood pressure and a weak stomach must exercise caution when getting involved in the atrocities that took place during the Nazi regime in Germany. There is much blame to go around, but the failure to prosecute these sadists who escaped the hangman's noose and fled to a life of luxury is extremely galling. This book is definitely a page turner and very dificult to put down as the process for hunting down some of these killers gets underway.

While it is written as fiction, it portrays in all too real terms the horrors of the Holocaust. However, it goes beyond a re-telling of this darkest episode in human history. The protaganist has devoted his life to helping people in crisis. Early in the book, he recounts his experience in Rwanda at the beginning of that genocide. His point is clearly that, while the Holocaust occurred in the mid-20th century, there are other instances of this type of horror occurring today. Just as in the 1930's and 1940's, millions suffered and died because \\"good\\" men and women remained silent or even wittingly or unwittingly aided and abetted the murderers. Written before the current crisis in the Sudan, I have no doubt that this would have been the most recent example used.

At the age of thirteen, Malcom Loring loved Jessica Ramsey; even then he wanted to share his life with her. Now 23 years later, his dream has flatlined, Malcom and Jessica are best buddies, and he is dating Jess's best friend. The irony is neither has been involved in a serious relationship; they are committed to their careers.Malcolm is the Sheriff of Codell County and is pleased with his life career wise, but is wondering where to take his personal life. Jess teaches at Codell elementary school and is finally on track; she is preparing for some private time in her new home. But nature has other plans; the weather channel reveals that much of Codell County is under a flood watch due to the impending hurricane, and Jess lives in the middle of the flood zone. Determined to ride out the storm, Jess ignores Sheriff Loring's threats to physically remove her from the property, until she realizes he is serious.As they seek safety, Mal is confronted with personal and job related situations that drain him mentally, but give new life to his emotions. First, a trip to rescue his girlfriend reveals something he has ignored far too long. Second, when Jess is separated from him and her life is placed in danger, Mal looses his composure and is forced to reveal his true feelings. But has he wasted too much time?Geri Guilliaume has written a Contemporary Romance heightened with the drama of a natural disaster. She removes the facades and forces the characters to admit the inevitable. The message is that life is to be lived to the fullest, and love is too deep an emotion to be washed away by shallow waters. With solid characterization and a tight storyline, LOVE RUNS DEEP reads like more than a romance.Reviewed by aNNof The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers"},{"Title":"Love Runs Deep (Arabesque)","review":"This was a touching story of when people wait too long, hold things in past the point of combustion and surpress true feelings. I learned four important love and life lessons from this book...1. There are some rules women need to always adhere to. If that friend of yours is truly a friend then when you said you were interested she should have backed off. When she didn't, you knew then she wasn't a friend. Competition for a man's attention will surely ruin a friendship. Once you call dibbs that was it, clase closed, she should have moved on.2. Lesson two; if that man refuses to commit to you but seems to be a little too \\"Captain Save A Ho\\" with another female, let him go! There is a connection between him and that \\"friend\\" that will not be disconnected no matter how long you push, pull or try to cut it...he is not worth your sanity, walk away. Bringing it up, telling her or arguing ain't gonna change nothing...pack your bag and move on.3. Third lesson; being stubborn because it is the thing to do is for the birds! When good advice comes, take it. Only a fool stands in a thunderstorm holding a broken umbrella. People are placed in your path to help you along, know who to listen to and then take the advice. Nothing wrong in admitting your wrong, you need help or someone to lean on. At times I wanted to shake Jessica myself.4. And finally...when a man is frantic about the one he cares for (especially when he's finally stopped running from what he feels and admits it to himself and her) and feels things are far beyond his control, move the heck out the way or you might get your face smashed in!! Myles should have heeded this warning (hehehe, I was secretly glad he hit him...chicken)Great read...lots of fun with the lessons. Exciting from the beginning all the way to the end."},{"Title":"Love Runs Deep (Arabesque)","review":"I actually liked the story between Jessica and Malcolm. The fact that the story was written in the first person versus the third person point of view, made the story very unique. I enjoyed learning about their past growing up together being best friends. I would have given this story 5 stars, but it should have expanded over a longer time period instead of a few days. Everything seemed to have happened over time, but when you sit and actually analyze the book, you realize that the entire book takes place in a few long days. I also wish that Jessica and Malcolm's first love scene would have been more drawn out. It was not what I expected compared to the chemistry that they had throughout the book. Overall, it was a good story though."},{"Title":"Love Runs Deep (Arabesque)","review":"It is one thing to be stubborn, but it is quite another tobe just plain stupid. She got on my nerves so bad that I justhad to read to book in spells. The river is flooding and allshe can think about is her house. It was like she put herselfin harms way just because she wanted to. It was also sillyhow she kept depending on him to always rescue her. That, Ithought, made her seem helpless and needy. I just didn't likethis book at all."},{"Title":"Wait Until Midnight","review":"Amanda Quick has gone forward in time to the late Victorian era with her latest romance and she does a good job of it. Adam Hardesty and Caroline Fordyce each have secrets that could cause problems with their families if they were to be told. Adam is being threatened by a medium to keep his secret. When the woman is discovered murdered, Adam has only one lead and it leads him to Caroline Fordyce, author of serials in the tabloid newspapers. The two join forces to find the murderer and to protect each other, when another medium is murdered. The characters are multi-dimensional (though I miss the humorous aspects of earlier Quick books) and plot intricate. The identity of the villian is not apparent until the end. Overall, Quick has written an entertaining romance and an intriguing mystery."},{"Title":"Wait Until Midnight","review":"I love all of Amanda Quick's books so I'm not an unbiased reviewer.

Highly recommend."},{"Title":"Wait Until Midnight","review":"This was the first book I'd read by this author (under any of her many pen names!). So, with no expectations or comparisons to make regarding her previous work, I enjoyed 'Wait Until Midnight' as a good stand-alone romatic suspense story. While not a classic, it was an entertaining period piece, with many nods to the Victorian adventure yarns like those written by 'Mrs. Fordyce).Neither the mystery nor the love story aspects overwhelmed the plot, and while each of these had a mix of strengths and weaknesses, the book did its job as light entertainment. I'd look into the follow-ups to this novel by 'Amanda Quick', though I'll probably skip the 'Jayne Ann Krentz' library."},{"Title":"Wait Until Midnight","review":"I always eagerly await the newest Amanda Quick/J. Krentz books. They never fail to please. Such a light touch! While this one does not offer anything new, still an enjoyable read. Caroline and Adam are another great couple. The hardcover is available now from amazon.co.uk. (Come on guys, don't edit this out--it's all in the family.)"},{"Title":"Wait Until Midnight","review":"A quick read - couldn't put it down. A bit of a hint of Amelia Peabody style to the characters."},{"Title":"Wait Until Midnight","review":"I'm sorry to all the fans of this author, but I've read a lot of romance novels, and this is at the bottom of my list. This is a very boring book, and the writing is pretty bad. The romance is as passionate as watching the grass grow. Just to sum it up, the book is so dry and not interesting that I skipped most parts. They only reason I've read this book is because I moved to a new place and didn't have any TV or computer or radio with me, and this was the last resort. Dry Dry DRY! I give it 2 stars because I'm sure with a lot of concentration, the book is bearable, but I just really didn't like it."},{"Title":"Wait Until Midnight","review":"This book was so bad I read it for sheer entertainment value. Whatever you do, get it from the library if you really want to read it. Her books used to be funny and sexy, with real heroines and plots. Not anymore. I read this hoping to get away from the continuing series, but it was just as bad. So many Startling Instances and really bad prose. Whoever this Harriet Klausner is, she writes reviews for every book and praises them. I think she works for the publishing companies, because it's really hard to find an awesome romance novel lately. If you're looking for real romantic suspense with curl your toes sex and an interesting plot, go get a Karen Marie Moning or Josie Litton book......Or even an old Quick book, like Rendezvous or Mystique."},{"Title":"Wait Until Midnight","review":"Circumstantial evidence points to Adam Hardesty being a medium's murderer. He turns to the one person who might have clues that could refute this idea, Caroline Fordyce, a young woman masquerading as a widow and hiding her career as a sensational romance writer. Initially, Adam's main appeal for her is as an anti-hero in one of her stories, but as they work together, it grows to more, on both sides. The intrepid pair follows rabbit trails and red herrings in search of true clues all across Victorian London, one step ahead of danger as they fall in love.* If you've read Ms. Quick's other books, then you basically already know everything that will happen. A mismatched hero and heroine unite to clear one's good name. At least one is encumbered by a set of loveable, eccentric relations, and both are hiding some terrible, in their opinion, secret that no one must know. Usually, the daffy relatives are more entertaining than in this book, and make it more interesting. Unfortunately, the eccentrics fall down on their duty this go round. *Reviewed by Amanda Killgore, Freelance Reviewer."},{"Title":"Wait Until Midnight","review":"This is one of Amanda Quick books that I really liked. I do enjoy most of her books. Loved both the hero and heroine in this one."},{"Title":"Wait Until Midnight","review":"Another hit by Amanda Quick. I couldn't help bursting out laughing in some of the the scenes at the beginning of the book. Caroline is one of my all-time favorite characters. The very first scene were Adam and Caroline meet is amazing. This book was a lot of fun to read although it did slow down in the middle. I loved Caroline's work as a sensation novelist. Love it."},{"Title":"Wait Until Midnight","review":"If you have read Amanda Quick under any of her pseudonyms, you will enjoy this book.For the uninitiated, this is a romance/suspense set in Victorian London. The main characters, Caroline and Adam meet shortly after the first murder occurs, and resolve to work together on solving the murder, even though this is most inappropriate for a woman to do. The book takes you through the color of London streets at all levels, from that of prostitutes through the aristocrats, and it seems that both Caroline and Adam have secrets that they need to hide from the public, and also from each other.But there is a spark, as there generally is in Quick's writing, and within 100 pages, the two have exchanged their first, very hot, kiss. It seems that these two are meant for one another, once they sort out their feelings, but there is still a murder to resolve.It is hard to tell much more without spoiling the surprises. I really enjoyed this book, and if you enjoy historical fiction with a romantic flair, you will too."},{"Title":"Wait Until Midnight","review":"Wait Until Midnight by Amanda Quick is sort of like a cup of hot chocolate on a cold night. As a widow, Caroline Fordyce can get away with doing a lot of things socially unacceptable for a Victorian era woman, including writing serial mysteries. The character's natural independent nature is a refreshing change from the dependent, provoking and quarrelsome wannabes that too often find their way into romance novels.As the member of an old and revered family, Adam has to hide most of what he does from polite society. What's surprising about this character is his honesty. He may hide things about himself from outsiders, but he doesn't hide things from the people that matter to him.When the murder of a psychic brings them together they soon learn that neither of them are what they seem. In this tale everybody has secrets and the secrets say a lot about who they really are. There are some twists and some surprises, but overall it's the character's courage to be who they are and the unquestioning support of their families that gives the story body. Like hot chocolate, it's not outrageously exciting, but satisfying just the same."},{"Title":"Wait Until Midnight","review":"I bought Wait Until Midnight in the form of an audiobook. I highly recommend doing so as the reader, Anne Flosnik (in my opinion) made the novel so much more enjoyable. The main characters, Caroline and Adam were likable enough, but if I had bought the actual novel to read, I wouldn't have finished it as the story and romance were a bit mediocre. Listening to Ms. Flosnik made it more interesting and gave it some edge so for that, I gave it 4 stars. So I will be picking up more of the Amanda Quick novels in the form of audiobooks. This is definitely a good book to listen to."},{"Title":"Wait Until Midnight","review":"Weak, boring, annoying, false notes galore, a complete absence of character development, no chemistry, no tension, simplistic, stale, formulamatic.I did NOT enjoy this book and had to force myself to finish it. Perfectly wretched."},{"Title":"Wait Until Midnight","review":"This one just missed the mark for me. Probably a little too much \\"supernatural\\" stuff. And while the main characters were mostly in the business of debunking those psychics, it still left a little too much wiggle room for me. I did like the characters, and it kept me reading - but I wouldn't say it was her best work. I was a little disappointed, considering some of the other books I've read by her. Overall it was a good book with a decent plot - and if you like psychic shenanigans in your romance novels, this would be the book for you."},{"Title":"Wait Until Midnight","review":"Amanda Quick (the pen name of Jayne Ann Krentz) writes historical mysteries that are light on facts and heavy on story. She is of the minimalist school, and \\"Wait Until Midnight\\" is as grounded in the late Victorian period as Quick's previous books were in the Regency, which is to say not much. In fact, if you didn't know, they could have taken place in the same year, so similar they are in its preoccupations with the Quality, its balls, its carriages, maids, and romances.In \\"Wait Until Midnight,\\" Caroline Fordyce supports herself and the two aunts who raised her by penning \\"sensational\\" novels for a newspaper. While researching the spiritualism craze for her next work, she encounters Adam Hardesty, who's hunting for a diary that reveals his family's secrets. His trail crosses Caroline's as well as two mediums, one of who is found murdered, wearing a wedding veil and found beside a crushed watch, its hands stopped at midnight.Where Quick excells is in her plotting, throwing in curves that freshen the standard story. Caroline is a popular writer with a secret past, and who masquerades as a widow but in reality a virgin. She is pursued, first as a suspect, then as a lover, by Adam, the brooding, virile hero who lives by his own rules, but is startled, then discomforted to discover that she's been strip-mining his personality to create the villain of her latest penny dreadful.Given these limitations, Quick keeps the plots spinning, the romance heated, and manages to come up with an appropriately creepy climax."},{"Title":"Wait Until Midnight","review":"While Queen Victoria grieves the loss of her beloved Albert and the members of Polite Society emulate her wearing mourning jewelry, physical research is the rage. When Adam Hardesty enters medium Elizabeth Delmont's home, he finds her dead, her skull crushed by a poker. She is wearing a wedding veil and brooch with a broken pocket watch nearby stopped at 12 o'clock.The next day Adam visits Caroline Fordyce who attended a s&eacute;ance at the victim's home just hours before the murder occurred. He asks Caroline if she took a diary that belonged to the medium because he does not want secrets about his past to come out. Caroline insists she does not have it and fears her secrets will become known. She persuades Adam to allow her to join him on his investigation. When a second medium is murdered, the broken watch left behind at the crime scene has Adam's name on it. Caroline provides Adam an alibi. As they continue to make inquiries, they become lovers and try to keep the other safe struggling with the case.Amanda Quick is deservedly respected for her terrific Regency romantic suspense novels, but in WAIT UNTIL MIDNIGHT, the talented author switches settings to the Victorian era yet maintains high quality of her previous historical romantic mysteries. Her latest tale has a gothic feel to the plot, but as expected the hero and heroine are likable characters whom readers will become absorbed in their investigation as much as their evolving relationship that ultimately turns to love, danger, and risk. Regardless of the time period, Ms. Quick provides a fabulous tale that seems always to land on the keeper shelf.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Wait Until Midnight","review":"Wait Until Midnight is another Historical Romance from Amanda Quick, penname of Jayne Ann Krentz. Her Quick books have been somewhat of a let down for this diehard JAK fan. She is formula whether in Contemporary JAK or the Historical Quick. A formula I adore, so I often forgive her things (such as a feel of word padding) I might not of another author. I have been reading her and have everything she's ever written and until the last five years I would call her books \\"Keepers\\". I'm not sure where the formula went \\"off\\", but it has in several of her books, especially her Historicals. After reading Wait Until Midnight, I am glad I waited until paperback release instead of hardback. It's not bad, and for any Quick/JAK fan it's a nice enjoyable visit to an \\"old friend\\". But the formula lacks it's usual JAK dazzle. She seems to hit and miss in the 2000's. One powerhouse novel such as JAK's Falling Awake, then a so-so. This is the so-so. Enjoyable but soon forgotten.It has all the right Quick elements, just the mix doesn't gel with the perfection of other JAK novels. Adam Hardesty comes into Caroline Fordyce's life, dark, dangerous and meaning business. He's on the trail of blackmailer, who has turned murderer - or possibly a murderer who kills a blackmailer and intends to pick up blackmailing. Adam is determined to find out which and put a stop to the threat to his family. Caroline is the only link to the murdered Elizabeth Delmont, a medium in Victoria's England. The diary with holds the threat to Adam's siblings is missing from the dead woman's home, and the only clues left behind - the corpse was wearing a wedding veil and a brooch pocket watch. Nearly crushed in the killing blows from a poke, the watch is stopped at 12 o'clock. The trail leads Adam to Caroline, since she was at the seance the night of Delmont's murder. Caroline, too, is hiding secrets so Adam's forceful presence alarms her, despite the man himself intriguing her.Soon a second medium is murdered, with a broken watch left as a clue on the scene. Only, this watch has Adam's name on it. Fortunately for Adam, Caroline provides him with an alibi. The mismatched duo of opposites attract (typical of all JAK heroes and heroines!) join forces to solve the murders, remove the threat to their families and fall in love along the way.Quick fans will enjoy this, though will hardly call it a \`keeper'. It's a nice enjoyable read, that could have been improved by tighter editing to speed the pace. In the first 100 pages, Adam and Caroline are rarely in each other's company. Also, JAK needs to rediscover the passion in writing romance, not just turning out her next book. When she hits the target no one can touch her. This one is just a little right of bull's-eye. Not-devoted-fans, might want to give this a pass as they will be less pleased with this effort. If you have never read Quick before, I recommend reading any of her earlier Quick novels for perfection to see JAK at her prime."},{"Title":"Wait Until Midnight","review":"Caroline Fordyce writes sensational romance serials for one of the newspapers in London. Three years earlier she had to change her name and find a way to support herself and her two aunts. The Great Scandel, as she calls it, has killed all hopes for her marriage and happiness. Although she changed her name and moved to London she stays clear of the ton so no one will recognize her. Living on the outskirts of society with her aunts is a very quiet life. She is involved with the Society of Psychical Investigations. She plans to put a medium in her next serial. While she lives a quiet life, she has a hunger for a grand adventure.Adam Hardesty is a member of society who has a secret. He is trying to protect his adoptive siblings from exposure in a stolen journal. The journal is being used to blackmail him and his family. It has somehow fallen into the hands of a medium named Elizabeth Delmont. When he finds her dead in her house, he searches for the journal. Unable to find it he starts to investigate the people who had attended her last seance. One of these is Caroline. And before you know it they are deeply involved in the murder and mysteries going on in the Society.With humor and wit we enjoy their adventure and the inevitable romance that developes.I love Amanda Quick and this is a wonderful story."},{"Title":"Wait Until Midnight","review":"I really liked this newest edition from Amanda Quick. I am a huge fan and found this latest edition to be just what the doctor ordered for a night of fun, romantic reading. I liked everything about the book from the characters to the plot. I did not find it lacking and I really like it when there is nothing in the way of the hero and heroine getting together. I prefer to read about other circumstances outside the romance. I want my characters to have immediate chemistry and move forward from there. I dont' need suspense or guessing when it comes to them falling in love. Let the mystery come from other characters, throwing the hero and heroine together and in danger. But they should always trust eachother and stand up for eachother. This was definately the case with Wait until Midnight. When the time came to stand up for him, she didn't hesitate and he did the same for her. I liked Adam a lot. I liked his makeshift family. I found him very sexy. I didn't want the story to end."},{"Title":"Wait Until Midnight","review":"Reading one of Amanda Quick's books is like cuddling under a really soft blanket in front of a magnificent fire. I can never put her books down and I couldn't wait to order more of her books. I had six AQ books on my Christmas List!I may actually try one of Jayne Ann Krentz's books once i finish the Amanda Quick catalog. I happened upon one of her books and she's been on my favorite romantic authors list ever since.Great book!"},{"Title":"Wait Until Midnight","review":"Has Amanda Quick lost her touch? As an enthusiastic reader of her previous books, I certainly hope not; however, this latest offering makes one wonder. Completely lacking the sparkle and charm of earlier Quick works like \\"Deception\\" and \\"Mistress\\", this book falls victim to recycled plot devices and stock characters. For example, readers are introduced to a pair of lesbian \\"aunts\\", the heroine is a virgin posing as a widow, and the heroine has a creative career....all ideas used constantly in her other books. Nor would I have a problem with the romance being secondary to the mystery, as indeed it is. Yet this romance is so uninspired and flat, it is not even remotely believable. Adam and Caroline seem to kiss in the first few chapters because that is what Amanda Quick charcters always do, and not because the reader feels there is any genuine desire between them. The rest of the love scenes are just plain boring and trite. Even Caroline's oppostion to marriage echoes that of a dozen of other Quick heroines. I am glad I just got this from the library and didn't waste my money on it--indeed, I think if you read this you will understand why it was released only as a paperback and not as a hardcover, because the hardcover expense would not be justifiable. Having said all this, if you have not read other Amanda Quick romances, please treat yourself to early gems like \\"Mystique\\" or \\"Mistress\\". These books, while light and quickly read (for those days when you want something light and quickly read) are witty, fun, and cute."},{"Title":"Wait Until Midnight","review":"Amanda Quick serves up more of her tried-and-true formula. An intelligent, spunky heroine, a stoic, strong and silent hero, a mystery with a little twist, and the requisite tender love scene. I admit I love the formula. Mainly because the heroine is intelligent and spunky and usually has an interesting occupation. In this case, Caroline is a serialised novel writer who has to invent a history for herself to escape a Great Scandal. There are some tender scenes between her and Adam as they share their respective checkered pasts. They are both likeable. The mystery trots effortlessly along to its conclusion, with a nice little twist. Of course, after a while, all the Amanda Quick romances tend to blend into one another, but they're very enjoyable in the process."},{"Title":"Wait Until Midnight","review":"Quick intoduces Caroline and Adam to each other in such a bazaar manner, that you see Quick's creativity and taste the ironical in a most entertaining way. This book is best enjoyed on the unabridged Audio CD, in case you missed it in the book. Quick deviates from her simple sweet humorous though quick paced style to murder, suspense and intrigue with a dash of humor. The development of this love affair has some unexpected twists in the plot and the actors on the audio CD portray the story with fast moving reality. This book is easily Listened To over and over. Its a fun book, a fun read."},{"Title":"Wait Until Midnight","review":"If you expect more than a love story reading don't read this book. If you want to read an 1800's year s&eacute;ance love story this is the one. No eerie or spooky at all, just a love story. This book is to relax and read. You'll never be thrilled by its story but it'll keep you reading all the time. Sometimes you'll want to read it and sometimes you'll want to watch TV.

I have had very mixed feelings regarding her more recent works. I enjoyed the Paid Companion and sicee this wasn't part of the recent series, I picked it up, but I wasn't holding my breath. I loved this book. The begining was a littls slow going. But as the main characters got to know each other I really enjoyed the connection. I found myself smiling in the middle of it. I really liked that the mystery aspect was not overly obvious (although I was reading it as a romance novel, not a mystery, so I wasn't really trying to solve the mystery). I also liked that the mystery climaxed at the very end of the novel. My biggest complaint is that two of the characters are named Julia and Julian. Granted, these characters are never together and it isn't too confusing, but of all the names in the world to come up with it seems strange that they would do this. The psychic aspect of the novel was interesting. I loved learning the history of our hero and his unusual family. I loved Quick introduced us to some shady characters just to throw us off the real villian's trail. Good read. I am probably givig it such a high rating because I am pleasantly surprised after some of Quick's other, recent books.

There's no faulting that McLuhan is well read, but as contemporary commentators do, quoting Shakespeare and calling forth your understanding of Ancient History is neither science nor philosophy it is simply thevery grandest of intelligent 'small talk'. Informative, of its time, not history, sticks to a single thesis without any attempt at offering an alternative or balanced view. And when it comes to his catchphrase, 'the medium is the message' I disagree - the message is far more important and ultimately whereor how it is recorded, delivered or shared is irrelevant. The fact that the Ten Commandments were written on stone is irrelevant."},{"Title":"THE GUTENBERG GALAXY : The Making of Typographic Man","review":"Marshall McLuhan was nothing less than a 20th Century prophet! So much of what he articulated in his various works has come to fruition in the Information Age. The reader who truly understands \\"The Gutenberg Galaxy\\" will come away with a much deeper understanding of our world and how the media we employ affect profound transformations in culture. I consider it essential reading for the educated reader.\\"The Gutenberg Galaxy\\" has had more of an impact on me than any of his other works and more than just a handful of other works of any genre - period. Essentially, McLuhan describes the enormous effects the advent of the printing press had on the Western world as it was transformed from an oral, manuscript culture to a visual, print-based culture. Personally, I would have preferred a different medium of presentation because it's easy to get lost in what McLuhan says. In this particular work he employs what he calls a \\"mosaic\\" approach to his topic, employing an enormous amount of data and quotations that stand alone and are stitched together a little by McLuhan, but chiefly by the reader as the reader is forced to discover what McLuhan is getting at. Also, the chapters are episodic and nonlinear and must be read in a different way than we're used to reading. It is a challenging work because of this but worth every moment invested in it. While this was a relatively revolutionary way to write non-fiction back in 1962, it resembles the way that people who use the Internet and social media actually think and learn. In this way, it appeals to the postmodern mind.The book should be read together with Understanding Media, in which McLuhan develops his theory of media more systematically.I want to conclude my review by cherry-picking some of the most profound and provocative quotations from the work, which illustrate some of the radical ways that the printing press has revolutionized the world we live in. Serious scholars of just about any discipline (my fields are Christian education, theology, and pastoral ministry). Here are the quotations, with page numbers from the edition I own. Read them and then be mesmerized and amazed at both McLuhan's wisdom and the way in which the world has changed.

Basically McLuhan assesses how European civilization went from an ear-touch (listening) oriented mode of receving information to an eye-oriented (that is, reading) mode of receiving information. Recalling that for McLuhan, the medium IS the message, so the invention and dissemination of printing-press technology and the sharp rise in literacy it occasioned therefore brought about a major seismic shift in Western thought and all that goes with it--language, mores, dress, politics, etc.Another way of looking at this is to say that in McLuhan's view, history is not determined by politics or economics or weather or science per se so much as by our media--the &quot;extensions of man.&quot; This book is a must-read followup to anyone who liked &quot;Understanding Media&quot;; it's also a great book to cut one's teeth on before reading &quot;Understanding Media&quot; because it's a more traditional (i.e., formal and linear) type of academic work. And undeniably brilliant. For what it's worth, I was a communications major at the University of Virginia in the mid-1970s when reading McLuhan's work was rougher than it is now; many of his concepts like &quot;global village&quot; have since filtered thru society. But I read all of McLuhan's media-oriented writings, wrote term papers on him, and feel as though I benefited as a result--he's the main reason I'm a writer today.Allen; charless@ync.net"},{"Title":"THE GUTENBERG GALAXY : The Making of Typographic Man","review":"This book expands on the views of McLuhan's teacher Harold Innis, who distingusihed oral and written cultures. The book argues that oral cultures are synaesthetic and work with synthetic logic, while cultures of writing push the mind toward singulation of senses, logic and 'perspective'.McLuhan 'glosses' through a wide range of scattered historical pieces of information to show how oral, written and print cultures have different patterns. He ably shows how printing also transformed art, architecture, society and industry.The book is thoroughly historical, dense and rich in informative detail. It forms the foundation for McLuhan's clearer theoretical articulation of his ideas in 'Understanding Media', but is more accessible to the layman.This book belongs to a pantheon of books that revolve around similar ideas like Harold Innis's 'Empire and Communications' & 'The Bias of Communication'; Walter J. Ong's 'Orality and Literacy' and William J. Ivins's 'Print and Visual Culture' and 'Art and Geometry'. But this is the most sweeping, convincing, dramatic statement of the common theory proposed by these various writers.And for those who love theory with a dose of history, this makes for really delightful reading."},{"Title":"THE GUTENBERG GALAXY : The Making of Typographic Man","review":"Other Amazon readers have commented that this is McLuhan's most accessible early work, and one called it a ' pre-quel' to 'Understanding Media' the work he is best known for. I remember reading this work with a mixture of amazement and bafflement, with a sense that something truly significant was being said without my being sure that I got it. The literary critic McLuhan as cultural critic was making all kinds of connections, and using all kinds of sources I knew nothing about. The whole business of the era of print, being the era of the eye of the spectator and passive audience, and the previous era being one of the ear did really go down well with me. The implication that the activity I most loved, reading. was in some sense about to be put in a lesser place by the new electronic communication did not please me at all. For as I understood it,and in a way still understand it ' reading' is the activity which really requires creative participation if it is to be done right, and the ' electronic watching television' requires much , much less.But despite my objection I understood that McLuhan was saying startling new( for me anyway) things in a brilliant way. He was connecting fields of endeavor exhibiting a kind of thinking, I could only admire. I might not understand the epigrammatic flashes he scatters throughout the work but I had a sense of them being deep and profound. In another sense it was clear to me McLuhan was the cultural critic who himself is a remarkable kind of creator.Now it is over forty years since this book was published and we live in an Internet era in which the degree of participation of individuals in producing material for a wider public is far greater than before. This small review is evidence of that for it can conceivably reach any of millions of Amazon readers. In the past I could write such a review for myself and put it in the drawer. Or try to get it into a magazine where it might be read by a few hundred or maximum a few thousand before being forgotten about.Yet just as it is possible to have great reservations about what has and what is going to happen to the overall intellectual development of Mankind( thanks to the Internet) so it is possible to have reservations for the electronic age global community which produces hate- literature and pornography in vast quantities ( not to speak of millions and millions of mediocre pages which no one should be asked to read )This book does not as I understand it hold the key to the Age we live in, or to the human future.

It is full of interesting observations (and the usual collection of his favorite Joyce quotes) and more accessible than many of his later works.Highly Reccommended!!"},{"Title":"THE GUTENBERG GALAXY : The Making of Typographic Man","review":"This is the first McLuhan book I read, back in the late 1960s. It took me about a month to get through, because each short chapter contained so many new ideas and insights I had to think about them before going on. I didn't always understand them, but what I did comprehend was intoxicatingly exciting.Many readers of McLuhan treat his probes as absolute statements of truth. Then, if they disagree with him, they reject his whole approach. One important fact to keep in mind while reading this or any of McLuhan's books is that he himself refers to the clever slogans which sum up many of his insights (\\"The medium is the message\\" being the best known, of course) as \\"probes\\", not facts. Their purpose is to explore an idea in order to stimulate thought. Even if you ultimately disagree with the concept set forth, if it makes you think about it, the probe has accomplished its principal purpose."},{"Title":"THE GUTENBERG GALAXY : The Making of Typographic Man","review":"The Gutenberg Galaxy, McLuhan's second book, is one of his best, but the reader should be forewarned that it is also one of his most difficult to read and does not make a good introduction for the beginner. One of the reasons for this difficulty is that it is written in mosaic style, in which McLuhan -- like Walter Benjamin's Arcades Project -- creates a text that is largely composed of quotations from mostly obscure authors stitched together with his own commentaries in between. These quotations are from works written in classical academic style, and none of them are easy reading. They require concentration and the book itself takes time to read carefully.The book is a cultural archaeology of the effects of the rise of print upon Western society in the period between 1450 - 1850. It is concerned with analyzing the new kinds of social and cultural structures which typography brought into being, such as nationalism, the concept of individuality, the idea of authorship and intellectual private property, new genres such as the literary essay and the novel. The rise of the printing press, McLuhan points out, was coincident with the rise of the mastery of depth perspective in Renaissance painting, and this is not an accident, for both the new Euclidean space conception and typography had in common an emphasis upon the organization of the world around the eye favored as a sense organ at the detriment and exlusion of all the other senses. During the manuscript culture of the Middle Ages, the senses were still synesthetically woven together like a tapestry, and no single one of them was favored to quite the degree of exclusion which the favoring of vision brought about in the Renaissance. Illuminated manuscripts, according to McLuhan, have a textural feel to them that still relies heavily on the sense of touch, and Medieval art, with its disproportionate sense of space in which one character -- such as Christ -- will be represented as larger than everyone else primarily due to the emphasis upon his spiritual importance rather than his inclusion as one individual among many occupying the same field of homogeneous space, is similarly haptic. Gothic lettering, he points out, is hard on the eye and difficult to read because it is tactile and still appeals to the sense of touch. Roman lettering, together with Arabic numerals, was favored by print, and this had the effect of streamlining the ability to read such that silent reading became common. Printers began to do new things like number the pages, create indices and Tables of Contents, and this had the effect of emphasizing authorship since it now became possible to track citations properly. Typography, McLuhan never tires of pointing out, favors the eye at the expense of all the other senses, and it tends to favor an abstract view of space as a container within which objects are placed in an arrangement that takes all spatial relations into account.All of this began to change in the nineteenth century with the rise of electric technology and the favoring of discontinuities brought about by the telegraph and the newspaper. This kind of syncopated feeling for space, in which each object begins to occupy its own space no longer held in relation to other objects, began to erode and change the old typographic world of the Gutenberg Galaxy. Electric culture, which McLuhan does not discuss much in this book, favors tribalism, spatial discontinuity, erosion of individuality and the rise of corporatism, decentralization and so on.This book should be read together with Understanding Media, for the latter volume picks up where The Gutenberg Galaxy leaves off, at the threshold of the Electric Society.It is a masterpiece of scholarship by one of the greatest intellects America has ever produced, an intellect that easily puts the French po-mo philosophers in the shade. You will get more useful ideas out of any one of McLuhan's books than you would out of a whole crate of books by postmodern French philosophers.SEE ALSO MY YOUTUBE VIDEO \\"MARSHALL MCLUHAN CULTURE WITHOUT LITERACY DISCUSSION BY JOHN DAVID EBERT\\"--John David Ebert, author of \\"The New Media Invasion: Digital Technologies and the World They Unmake\\" (McFarland Books, 2011)"},{"Title":"THE GUTENBERG GALAXY : The Making of Typographic Man","review":"What makes this book, like almost all others of McLuhan, is that an extreme amount of background is NOT necessary to draw from McLuhan's insightful observations.

The book is filled with great understanding and insight, often packaged as gnomic utterances but rarely without substantial scholarly support behind them. He stole from the best and without shame and put ideas together like no one else. Not so much an original thinker (for which we can be grateful given some of his crackpot ideas) but a chemist experimenting with the works of others to great effect.

Amis is often as outraged and funny as in his best fiction (especially in the letters to Larkin). Often in literary appraisals he is acute, and he always seems true to something in himself, so that even when one disagrees--i. e., T. S. Eliot is not simply a pretentious bore--one goes along.Good as this correspondence is, it isn't up to Larkin's letters because Amis doesn't believe or feel as deeply as Larkin does, nor does he have as focussed a perspective as Larkin, so the humor isn't set set off in such sharp contradistinction to a fundamental seriousness. Yet you keep reading because the book clears away cant and intellectual fustian so vigorously. Moreover, it gives just enough glimpse of Amis's biography: a sad, messy counterpoint spreads out in the background: the meanderings of a brilliant man with a zillion reactions and nothing firm to attach them to.Larkin's parody of his own poem &quot;Days&quot; on page 1040 is not to be missed; it's in one of Leader's helpful footnotes.This book weighs a couple of pounds, so is hard to hold--to be read at table rather than in bed. Couldn't the publisher have used lighter weight paper and given us smaller type and less margin?"},{"Title":"The Letters of Kingsley Amis","review":"Kingsley Amis is one of my favorite post-war novelists. I had not before read a collection of letters, and I confess there was a time when I would have thought the idea of actually reading through someone's lifetime of letters just plain idiotic. But in fact I found these fascinating -- interesting to read for the biographical details, hints of the creative process, discussion of his works and Philip Larkin's works in progress -- as well as often very very funny and sometimes eyebrow-raisingly nasty.Zachary Leader has chosen about 800 of several thousand surviving letters. The great bulk are to the poet Philip Larkin, his closest friend. Another huge chunk are to another very close friend, the writer and Sovietologist Robert Conquest. He also corresponded a good deal with my favorite novelist, Anthony Powell, another good friend of his (though Amis betrays a certain lack of confidence in his friendship with AP -- I sense that he was intimidated by Powell's upper class background and lifestyle, by his rather mandarin literary taste, and by his age). There are many letters to his second wife, Elizabeth Jane Howard, as well as a rather unfortunate set of nasty comments about her in other letters after their rather ugly divorce. Lots of letters to agents and publishers -- these rather interesting from the writing business point of view. Quite a few responses to fan letters -- these generally quite gracious and often offering interesting answers to questions about Amis' books. Unfortunately no letters to Bruce Montgomery (&quot;Edmund Crispin&quot;), another of Amis' special friends: they cannot be inspected until 2035! Hilly Bardwell Amis Boyd, Lady Kilmarnock, his first wife, burned all his letters, perhaps understandably, after he left her (or she left him but because of his affair with Howard) in 1963. Amis in his life was reluctant have any of his other letters to women lovers printed, and Leader either didn't track down any such, or chose not to print them. As for his children, Philip did not keep his letters, Sally did not want them published, and Martin could find only a postcard or two (though apparently there were many more).Highlights? His early letters to Larkin, with their complexabbreviations and injokes, and the talk about poetry. The cattiness he displays towards writers whose work he disliked, such as most obviously John Wain, his fellow &quot;Angry Young Man&quot;. Amis on &quot;Old English Literature&quot;: &quot;The prose is admitted even by initiates to be stumbling and graceless; the verse is shackled by continual repetitions of idea ... This is the echo of an Age stated but not shown to be Heroic whose literature carries neither primitive insight nor civilized assurance.&quot; (and more) The general funniness of things, even though occasionally mean.Certainly an amusing and interesting angle from which to consider a great writer."},{"Title":"The Letters of Kingsley Amis","review":"Volumes of letters should be judged by their editing as much as their content, hence the five stars. Z. Leader is thorough, intelligent, impartial, and exact. There is sufficient scholarly apparatus to guide the working academic and the demanding lay reader. As for the letters, well, there are a lot of them. Despite his professed laziness, Amis cranked off an immense amount of smart, thoughtful, scurrilous, and funny correspondence in the 50+ years recorded here. Exemplary funny bits are on pages 276-277 in a 1952 letter to Philip Larkin. If you laugh, buy the book. If you don't, don't. If you're shocked by cruel, rude jokes between close friends, don't. Amis demanded, and often provided, hard thinking, precise expression, and blunt honesty. His staunchly conservative, sometimes reactionary, views contrast interestingly with his drunken philandering, which should provoke thought among those readers who enjoy thinking at all."},{"Title":"The Letters of Kingsley Amis","review":"To anyone interested in Amis, these letters are indispensable. The core of this 1200 page book is his correspondence with Larkin. At some point Amis says the only pleasures in his life are talking to Larkin and listening to jazz. I am not a fan of Larkin's and haven't read his poems or any biography or letters so I am only getting Kingsley's side but what comes through is enormous enthusiasm and joy and brilliance in language play and especially a completely unsnobby love of the written word.Amis doesn't like Chaucer, Milton, Keats, Shelley, D H Lawrence, Nabokov, Dylan Thomas and a lot of other lesser writers. But his written testimony for the trial of \`Lady Chatterley's Lover' puts in the most cogent terms what he thought Lawrence was about and the moral value of it. Perhaps surprisingly made a trustee of Dylan Thomas's estate, there are here printed several letters in which he staunchly defends Thomas's caucus from attempts to commercialise it.Amis once said in here that he would prefer a world in which there was too much reason rather than one in which there was too little, and perhaps he dislikes literature he sees as undisciplined - although in music he seems to have different tastes, liking Tchaikovsky and early jazz, for its tone if you don't mind. In literature he likes poems which are intelligible and he appreciates formal values. He is less vocal about what he does like but the list includes Graham Greene, Raymond Chandler, John Dickson Carr, Dick Francis, Shakespeare, Yeats, Wordsworth, Edward Thomas, A E Housman and of course Larkin. Don't mention Ted Hughes.If you enjoy Amis's unbelievably funny novels, you will have trouble putting this down. You will also have trouble picking it up but unlike one reviewer I had no problems with the binding of my 1200 page hardback."},{"Title":"Confucius Said","review":"Hi, Readers, I am the author of this book, Confucius Said.When I first came to the United States in early 1960s as a foreign student, I sometimes heard quotations which were said to be the words of Confucius. Being a graduate of National Taiwan University majoring in the ancient Chinese literature in Taipei, Taiwan, I told my American friends that, as far as I knew, Confucius had never said those words. I was then asked what Confucius had said. That was indeed a big question!I am glad to answer this question four decades later today with the publication of the book, Confucius said.Confucius (551-479 B.C.)is the greatest of all Chinese sages. After his death, his disciples and disciples' disciples collected all of his sayings and some of his outstanding disciples' sayings as well as the conversations between them and compiled them into a book called ANALECTS OF CONFUCIUS. Years later, the book became a required textbook in all of China. For more than two thousand years, all the Chinese students were required to read the book and memorize the sayings of Confucius and his outstanding disciples. And a Chinese man who wished to become a senior government official had to pass the official examination of the book in order to qualify for appointment to the office. This situation was finally changed when the Chinese republic was established in 1911.Today, Analects of Confucius is studied in many academic institutions all over the world as a main resource for Chinese cultural research. This book, Confucius Said, is my English translation selected from the original Chinese language version of Analects of Confucius to make the non-Chinese reading English-speaking people easily get a better understanding of what Confucius actually said.Although Confucius died some two thousand five hundred years ago, his philosophy regarding how to deal with people and how to build a better relationship between families and friends is still regarded as one of the best teachings even today. Many scholars think if Confucius' philosophy could prevail again, the increasing rate of crime in the world would sharply decrease...."},{"Title":"Treasures of the Tropic Seas","review":"From the moment I opened this book I was entranced by its luxurient pictures.

Unfortunately, the text doesn't follow the same sequence as the pictures, and often there are a couple pages to flip in order to reference a figure.

After having had our little one sleep with us for a year, a friend of ours told us about this book while we were visiting family in Spain. At first, I was very skeptical. However, after seeing how happy and well adjusted her 10 month old was, I thought we should give it a try. She bought the book for us and just asked us to read it and determine if we wanted to try it. I must say, EVERYTHING it said NOT to do, we were already doing. Once we put this book into action, we stood steadfast! I wish there were an English version so I could share it with some of my friends here. Bottom line is that IT WORKS! You are TEACHING your child how to sleep and setting him up for a lifetime without insomia. Which seems to be a trait on my husband's side of the family. After not sleeping through the night for over a year, I cannot tell you how happy we are to have found this lifesaver!!!

I made several of the sewn items: the angel's nest, the shamrock outfit and the bear bag. The items all turned out beautifully. I found two problems with the book. The patterns are printed on both sides of the paper. So if you want to use the patterns on both sides, you have to trace the one you want onto tissue to avoid damaging the patterns on the other side.Secondly, the translation from the French is so poor that the sewing instructions are almost useless. On all the pattern sheets, it says that the seam allowance is included. In the book, it says that you have to cut an additional seam allowance. You actually have to make an item to find out that the seam allowance is NOT included. When you are using expensive Italian linen to make an outfit, this is not the kind of information you want to get after cutting out the pattern. Anyway, if you are an experienced seamstress, you will be able to figure out the patterns and put them together without much help from the book, but if you are not, I recommend you stick to the non-sewn items."},{"Title":"Everything for Baby: Projects to Make Yourself","review":"As you can tell from the title of my review, I'm very satisfied with my copy.

This book offers me 33 wonderful and darling projects. Granted I'm not going to do half of them, I still enjoyed skimming through the pages and looking at the designs. I love how the author has divided the projects into easy to view sections. ie: Mealtime, Bathtime, clothing, etc. I also love how the author listed the degree of difficulty and the time needed for each project. Now I can just tackle the project that I feel I'm capable of. Another added bonus are the patterns that come with the book inserted in the back pocket of the book.

This is not, however, one of those stuffy books which are so hard to understand by anyone with less than a PhD to their name. Certainly not! This is a book for those with an interest in the Rainforests of the world (which should be all of us!) and is written in a variety of styles - each of which will allow expert and layman alike to appreciate the various messages which are here to be learned.Packed with some of the most exciting photography I have seen in a long time (I especially liked the picture of the Giant Fruit Bat in flight), this is a book which is so expertly put together, I didn't find so much as a minor fault anywhere. For those readers who (like me) do not fully understand and appreciate the overall subject matter, the book commences with an excellent overview, which explains the Rainforest exactly as it should be explained. Then, having so skilfully set the underlying scene, each different contributor adds their own particular expertise on different aspects of the Rainforest until, segment by segment, we are presented with a complete understanding \\"and\\" appreciation, of what is probably the most important habitat on earth.Rainforests of the world is a large subject which, in this case, is professionally and cleverly described and I congratulate the team on an excellent authoritative work.NM"},{"Title":"Benang: From the Heart","review":"If you have any affinity for the song lines of Australia and history of the Aborigines, this book will move your soul."},{"Title":"Benang: From the Heart","review":"Having read Kim Scott's first book, True Country, I was keen to read Benang. The style of narrative requires some adjustment and makes the reader work rather than read passively . Scott's characters are well developed as slowly the layers of the story form. Some of the content is shocking, however, Scott shows by omission and then inclusion of more facts further on, weaving everything together for the final revelations.

When I 1st opened it's stiff pages for just a peek before bed, I found myself still engulfed an hour later. Yet I felt deep disappointment.I have been writing short-story porn-erotica for a few years, successfully. What I had hoped to glean from this book were the nitty gritty details of actually getting published, as the title clearly promises. I looked for the all important contract examples, publisher contacts (at the very least addresses to write for guidelines) &amp; sources with addresses for publishing short-story erotica. None of these promised components were included in this book! I'm not sure how the author can justify his claims to helping anyone &quot;get published&quot; through this book.If you already know how to write, skip this book &amp; find one that includes publisher information at the very least. This author's excuse for not including the vital information for which I bought this book, was that guidelines change quickly. This doesn't excuse the fact that addresses of publishing houses rarely change so quickly &amp; should have been included so that writers could request the latest guidelines. Instead I am left to either search for another book that delivers the information it promises to, or do the research on my own.I didn't need to buy or read this book to learn how to write erotica (although I am always open to learning new techniques), nor to read the obvious well-known industry tidbits. Almost everything in this book was useless to a writer who actually wants to publish their work.As to the writing style, I find no fault. This book is an easy, quick read with writing exercises at the end of each chapter. It does very briefly (less than a paragraph each) cover such issues as using a pseudonym &amp; literary agents but again, writers are expected to find the actual information on their own. This book does NOT provide ANY actual information on how to get published. I truly feel that the title is misleading, false advertisement.I wanted to give this book a 5 rating but obviously it doesn't deliver the goods, which would place it at a 2 rating in my opinion. The reason I rated it a 3: for people who don't know anything about writing erotica, Writing Erotic Fiction : And Getting Published (Teach Yourself) by Mike Bailey, will at least get you started."},{"Title":"Writing Erotic Fiction: And Getting Published (Teach Yourself (McGraw-Hill))","review":"Mike Bailey has loads of experience as an editor for numerous publishing houses that publish erotica/smut/porn/one-handed reading material - use your favorite genre descriptor. Having published four such novels myself I can say with confidence that his advice is excellent - especially for the person trying to break into what has become a highly competitive field. The writing advice is practical, and budding authors of all genres would do well to pay attention to his hints. In addition to making a specific point, many of the illustrative excerpts from published erotica also highlight some of the shortcomings of what has already made it into print, thereby serving as great examples of common mistakes and how to avoid them. The exercises he suggests are good, especially if you're in the middle of a nagging edit, and aren't sure how to add just the right erotic touch to your work. I was keen to read this book because Mike has so far rejected all my submissions. I think I now have a better insight into the types of material and the slant he prefers. This intelligence should help me - an already published author - with my next offering. I'd say there's something in this book for smut-peddlers of every experience level, style and ambition."},{"Title":"Writing Erotic Fiction: And Getting Published (Teach Yourself (McGraw-Hill))","review":"When I first read this, I felt a bit insulted, as though somehow erotica is less than other forms of writing. But upon a second reading I realized that much of what I was offended by might be the &quot;Britishness&quot; of the text and author, and that is something to keep in mind, what may be published in Europe and liked in Europe but not sell in America, or Asia, or elsewhere. The chapters are short, I think they might do nicely for first time writers, and the harsh facts about not deluding yourself when you write could be good for those embarassed by their writing. But frankly some of us do write others types of books and we don't think of our erotica as taking any less skill or talent. Since erotica is about a very personal matter -- intimacy and sexuality -- it should be something that writers and readers spend time and talent on whether for private use or public consumption."},{"Title":"Writing Erotic Fiction: And Getting Published (Teach Yourself (McGraw-Hill))","review":"I bought this book thinking highly of it, i was pretty dissappointed with the way the book carried itself.mr.bailey didn't really give me any information i could really use. and he has a &quot;10 commandments of erotica&quot; in this book that covers some of the ideas i use in my stories. he is informative but this is the kind of book a novel writer should buy and not an amateur like myself,i give him some credit, but i would not recommend this book to anybody."},{"Title":"Writing Erotic Fiction: And Getting Published (Teach Yourself (McGraw-Hill))","review":"I was looking for more technique advice.

As a consequence it's worth taking his pithy but to-the-point remarks on board - particularly if you're new to the business. I've published four erotic novels and still found his remarks relevant, both in and out of erotica. It's obvious from some of the comments below that the 'Britishness' of the text is a little bewildering for US readers accustomed to how-to authors dotting every I and dotting every T.

My copy is 1999, and I am surprised that I have such a new book on such an old topic. The critics only provide a few pages each on five poems. William Carlos Williams praises Poe for his detachment from the ordinary use of language. You should feel \\"the first need of his time, the escape from the formless mass he hated.\\" The popularity of Poe is a mystery to Bloom, except in times of hysteria when people become \\"unable to function in a normal social capacity.\\""},{"Title":"Edgar Allan Poe (American men of letters)","review":"This book is shallow, judgemental, poorly researched and an insult to any the intelligence of any thinking person. There are some marvelous biographies about Edgar Allan Poe (The one by pulitzer prive winning biographer, Kenneth Silverman, is the best.) To call this a STUDY guide is absurd. It's a slanted, bias, narrow minded piece of propoganda."},{"Title":"Edgar Allan Poe (American men of letters)","review":"This book dissects the personality of Poe from his works and since it is a biography it deals with some of the more negative aspects of Poe as well as the positive one's.There are alot of reproductions of letters written by Poe in regard to his personal life as well as letters written to him.Some very flattering others less so,as if he may have had a \\"mood disorder\\".His criticisms of others works the author defends as almost entirely just, but it is also pointed out Poe was occasionally susceptible to flattery,particularly if there a financial renumeration or a\\" well turned ankle\\" involved.This is one work where Poe's use of laudenum(a mixture of opium and alcohol) receives attention.apparently this drug was a common stock at the doctor's office(not to mention the street vendor)and was used and prescribed for alot of people.\\"Opium dreams\\",a common phrase,could have been one of Poe's inspirations,a mind of his calibre would certainly remember and be able to profoundly describe those visions of paradise(and horror)!!it is obvious to me that the author of this book admires and respects Poe, but keeps his distance for the sake of his interpretation of the truth.The 1840's with no copyright laws and high illiteracy would not make much opportunity for men like Poe other than \\"free lancing\\"an open invitation for \\"economic violence\\".Woodberry's book reads smoothly and pretty much gets to the essence of Poe in my opinion."},{"Title":"Edgar Allan Poe (American men of letters)","review":"a pretty good book. it's definently a good read for those interested in poe."},{"Title":"Edgar Allan Poe (American men of letters)","review":"this book is a good information sorce on the american poet edger allen poe. it talks about his life and his poetry. verry cute."},{"Title":"Husband Of A Fanatic: A Personal Journey Through India, Pakistan, Love, And Hate","review":"Amitava Kumar is an Indian Hindu literature professor teaching in a college in the East coast of America, in his early forties, and married to a Canadian-Pakistani writer of Muslim heritage. And this brief bio matters as the subtitle of his book makes clear - A personal journey through India, Pakistan, Love and Hate.Kumar revels in sharing his reading and travelling experience organised around the theme of the Hindu-Muslim border. But this isn't the physical border that divides India and Pakistan. Instead these are the invisible lines of control that regulate, constrain and deform relations between peoples of similar cultures.Much of Kumar's book occupies itself with exposing the shallow, unexamined and compensatory machismo of the Hindutva ideologues who dominated Indian political life in the 1990s. Kumar tracks down their representatives in the US, and even provides some frightening examples of how American Hindutva ideologues have squared the American dream with the Hindu meme.Kumar makes a virtue of the technique of testimony, and an extended section of his book is dedicated to reproducing letters between young Indians and Pakistanis on the state of bilateral relations (Kumar actually ferried the letters).Kumar provides important reminders of the fusion between Muslim and non-Muslim culture in India before and even after Partition. For example, it is forgotten that before the Partition, Muslims made up many of the shabad singers in Sikh Gurdwaras. And even today, Pakistanis and Indians revere the same local South Asian saints. Kumar visits one of these shrines on the Indian-Pakistani border, and his description of his visit, what he sees and hears, stands out in this travelogue.Kumar's choppy transitions are one of the major weaknesses. Others have criticised his cut and paste approach, but that a flaw and not a fatal sin. He makes up for it with his inclusive humanism, his wonder at what he calls the \\"enchanted civil society\\" and his welcome highlighting of the inter-confessional cooperation of Indians in the South African anti-apartheid struggle.Also welcome is Kumar's habit of mentioning key sentences and phrases in Hindi (with translation) which allows Hindi-speaking readers a deeper register of meaning.But perhaps the shallowest part of the book is Kumar's highlighting of his wedding and his 'half-conversion'. The way it is described smacks of hucksterism, but that is less a criticism than a comment. Perhaps he had his reasons, and honestly, in the clamour of reportage on the rising elephant called India, you have to ride the wind."},{"Title":"Husband Of A Fanatic: A Personal Journey Through India, Pakistan, Love, And Hate","review":"The title of the book is deceptive and am not sure whether it adds any value barring catching the attention of the would be buyer. Or it is a clever play on the word 'fanatic' as the book demonstrates the many facets of fanaticism that he encounters. I found the book to be interesting but it did leave me with an ambivalent feeling as huge chunks of the book are devoted to retelling of stories from other writers..I found this to be particularly disturbing when reading the section on Gandhi in SA and was struggling to understand how this long section added any value to the text. The same applies to the extensive citing of authors and books written by them and then a synopsis of the story is embedded in the text. Felt that this could have been eliminated as this was not an anthology of stories but the writer's exploration of the impact of fanaticism, social exclusion and the rise of anti-secularism. The jumps in chronological time can also intrude as when he is in Pakistan you expect a coherent account of this: instead one flips past and forward which detracts from the main objective.An intriguing read but it does leave you somewhat bemused!"},{"Title":"Husband Of A Fanatic: A Personal Journey Through India, Pakistan, Love, And Hate","review":"This is one of my favorite books. Though I have looked far and wide, this is the only book that I have found that begins to explore the complexity of the causes of the ethnic violence that plagues nearly every corner of the modern world.

Marrying a Pakistani Muslim, he feels he hasn't converted to Islam but has no guts to stand up to his convictions when being forced to change his name to a Muslim one. Despite acknowledging the Official ban on Hindu-Muslim marriage in Pakistan and unbroken legacy of forced conversions, he has the gall to spend 99% of the book criticizing India's openness and secularism (however flawed) & Hinduism in general hiding behind the excesses of RSS, Shiv Sena and BJP. What is sickening is that he feels very little compunction to apply the same standards to a much more closed and brutal society and religion in Pakistan.So here is one more spineless Hindu intellectual essentially apologising to his \\"superior\\" Muslim Masters and in the mean time collecting a few more browny points with the appeasing Liberal Intellectuals in the West. Very depressing indeed."},{"Title":"Husband Of A Fanatic: A Personal Journey Through India, Pakistan, Love, And Hate","review":"Title is provocative but deceptive and in no way connected to the story. It looks like author wrote this book to prove something to his muslim wife(a Tajmahal ???). He seems to somehow feel guilty for being a hindu; which lot of left liberals do. The stories he recounts may be true but they are one sided and biased. He completely ignores equally horrible stories of hindus as victims in Kashmir. He sure wears very thick left liberal glasses. I wonder if he is doing this out ignorance or on purpose. But He does come out as much more sincere and genuine than the likes of Teesta and other leftists. He keeps interviewing some uneducated right wing fringe or riot affected muslims to soft-pedal his view point, instead of honestly presenting equally if not more terrible acts by muslims.Part of what he writes might be true but mostly it his own understanding of the hindu muslim divide and lacks in depth undestanding of the subject. Perhaps not being from a place with substantial muslim population is the cause (Bihar is not one of those states).

Then it gets stuck in a number of scenes that are too slow, and a description of a villain who is supposed to be provocative, but turns out to be a bitter and disappointing stereotype. I realize that because this is a book about a murder, whoever the author picked to be the culprit wouldn't be nice at all. Still, some of the passages which explain the criminal's character could have been pulled from any cliched argument on temptation and related topics. Another series of scandals, another person who thinks he or she is justified because they were frustrated, and so on. Meanwhile, the countless men and women who don't scoff at their commitments and don't wind up murdering anybody, don't seem to have novels written about them. Pity, that."},{"Title":"Dead Irish","review":"John Lescroart's introductory novel to Dismas Hardy shows the character at the nadir of his life. As if he hadn't sunk low enough, we meet Hardy aboard an airplane that has just dropped three-thousand feet due to wind shear, a backwash...the pilot explains the technicality of the precipitous event. Everyone aboard is naturally terrified but fifteen minutes later they make a safe landing in San Francisco. Hardy has been on the wagon for two weeks while on a vacation in Cabo but goes into the airport bar for a drink.Although shaken, he mulls over the thought that a crash might have been not so bad. His parents were killed in a plane crash when he was nineteen--\\"symmetry\\" there--and he is still struggling to come to terms with his life. Several years earlier he and his then-wife had lost their infant son in a freak accident. Hardy is an ex-cop, ex-Marine, and ex-assistant district attorney. Now he tends bar for a friend, Moses McGuire, whose life he saved in Viet Nam. He lives alone. He's all right but just spinning his wheels.An incident in Candlestick Park puts Hardy in touch with his old partner, Abe Glitsky. The two men had walked a beat together, many years ago. Glitsky is called away to investigate the murder of an Edward Cochran who, as Hardy fears, is the husband of his friend Moses's sister, Frannie.There follows a complicated plot involving the young Eddie; a dishonest publisher of a Spanish-language newspaper; another publisher with a young trophy wife and a daughter who is only slightly younger than the wife and who is not the sharpest tack on the board. There are Eddie Cochran's mourning parents and siblings, as well as a priest who is very close to the family, a lifelong friend. Eddie's young brother Steven suffers deeply in his own way.To make things worse, a cryptic message has been found in Eddie's car that looks like it might be a suicide note.Although no longer with the police or justice department, Hardy pursues a personal investigation on behalf of Moses McGuire so that suicide can be ruled out and Frannie can inherit the payment from her husband's substantial insurance policy. For this, McGuire offers Hardy a one-quarter interest in his bar.The book's pace is fast but not so fast that we don't get to meet the characters and weigh their personalities. Along the way, we learn about police politics as a promotion to lieutenant looms for one lucky person. Only one person, as the police department has been undergoing cutbacks. Morale is low.Lescroart deftly ties up all these ends and more as the book heads relentlessly towards its powerful finish, never letting up on the suspense. His characters are real and well drawn.At the end of the story, I was so happy that there were still more Dismas Hardy books that I had not read yet. I plan to read the rest in order. If you haven't read them yet, I suggest you do too."},{"Title":"Dead Irish","review":"In fact, way too many of them. Lescroart is so busy marching people on and off stage that he forgets to get the plot going for way, way too long.The Dismas Hardy series does get better.

This marks the first appearance of series character Dismas Hardy. This murder mystery is set in San Francisco and the surrounding bay area towns. Living in Northern California, and having been to San Francisco on numerous occasions, Lescroart (of Northern California) does a masterful job of describing the settings and taking the reader right to the scene. Dismas is a very compelling character as a current bartender and former cop; who has also passed the bar exam. The mystery surrounds the death of one of the guys that has grown up in a tight Catholic community. Cochran leaves behind a pregnant wife, Franny. If his death is ruled a suicide, which it could be by all appearances, than the wife is left with nothing. Dismas is called in to investigate if it was murder or suicide. Dismas runs into his ex-wife and we learn the compelling back story of his life and a family tragedy.This is enjoyable reading and rates 3.5 stars [I'll give the nudge and mark 4] simply for its place in the series. As a Lescroart novel, it is a good peek into the greatness to come.For those new to this outstanding series, the order of books is as follows:Dead IrishThe VigHard EvidenceThe 13th JurorThe Mercy RuleNothing but the truthThe HearingThe OathThe First LawThe Second ChairThe MotiveBetrayal& A Plague of Secrets [scheduled for release in July 2009]I personally recommend reading them in order for the best experience.

It was fast paced and interesting, highly recommend if your a Dismas Hardy fan."},{"Title":"Dead Irish","review":"I enjoy every Dismas Hardy book. Some are a little slow, but I enjoy the characters and am quite willing to accept the changes in Mr. Hardy's life. I originally entered the series around 1998, so I missed a lot of the early stuff. I wanted to go through the whole series on Kindle, but it took forever for book 2 The Vig to become available. And now that it has, the price is a shock. This is an *old* book and pricing it over 10 bucks is nuts. I checked Dead Irish, the first in the series and one I bought last March and I paid $6.39 back then. The price has almost been doubled also, to over 10 bucks. The publisher is simply gouging, and I'm not impressed. I can wait a long time to get these prices back to something reasonable. So on to other authors for now ..."},{"Title":"Dead Irish","review":"Dismas Hardy is an ex-Marine, ex-cop, ex-attorney, ex-Catholic, ex-sharkwalker, ex-husband...

What really stuck out for me as one of my biggest gripes was that the characters really felt set in stone. I never felt like they were growing from one book to the next. I also felt alot like Lescroart was writing the same story over and over again with slight variations. So in my mind I was viewing Lescroart as a talanted mystery/thriller writer who was trying too hard to write for an imaginary audience whom he felt wanted an exact sort of book from him and that he had become too attached to his characters to alow for them to undergo changes.Thats why I think I felt that Dead Irish was such a refreshing Lescroart book for one who has basically worked backwards along the series arc. In Dead Irish the characters are just being formed, given substance. Its interesting to see the long standing friendships that would later come to be take shape.The story itself is also pretty interesting, though nothing earth shattering. What I like about it is that all in all it is a fairly simple plot, no mass killings or huge rampages. Instead this book is about the small things. Dismas' friend is killed or has commited suicide and he takes it upon himself to uncover exactly what occured.This is one of the best Lescroart books. I would say you should read this if you have not yet done so and have previously read others in the series. However, if you are looking for something earth shattering in this genre I would suggest that you turn instead to Cormac McCarthy's 'No Country for Old Men'."},{"Title":"Dead Irish","review":"This was our first exposure to author Lescroart and his ex-cop, ex-everything else, Irish bartender, Dismas Hardy. Indeed, we must wait til nearly the mid-point of the book before we learn the personal tragedy that has caused Hardy to largely drop out of life. Meanwhile he leans on his old cop connections to fish out clues and check out suspects as Hardy helps investigate (at the request of the family) the questionable suicide of Eddie Cochran. For half the some 400 pages, the cops, Hardy, and worst, we readers, tire of the efforts to uncover clues and chase potential murderers. When the action finally heats up during the second half, we figure out long before the professionals do the probable villain; fortunately, a couple more killings finally lead to the real bad guy and things get tidied up near the end.We feel little incentive based on this novel to pursue the rest of this series, although other reviewers suggest it might be one of the weakest in the set. For our money, existential writing is fine, but probably not in a whodunit when the audience is panting for some sort of gripping action to make the pages turn. Apparently this average to mediocre example of the Hardy set might as well be skipped by all but the author's ardent fans."},{"Title":"Dead Irish","review":"Dead Irish is the introduction, published in 1989, to the now popular Dismas Hardy/Abe Glitsky series. Diz is down and out, holding things together by tending bar, drinking, and perfecting his darts game. Ex-cop, ex-lawyer, ex-husband, he was thrown for a loop by the accidental death of his infant son, and decided life wasn't worth playing anymore. The bar owner, Mose, brings a request to Diz to look into the case of his brother-in-law Eddie. His death appears to be suicide, but the family simply cannot accept that. In a \\"why not\\" sort of mood, Diz agrees, but without current creds, is forced to work on the periphery, pestering former partner Sgt. Abe Glitsky to keep him apprised of what the cops are thinking. The waters are soon very murky, muddied by a major drug deal, two additional suspicious deaths, and a brutal attack on Eddie's younger brother. It it only due to Dis's dogged persistence that the truth is eventually uncovered.An obvious freshman effort, Dead Irish lacks the tension necessary for successful mysteries, and is fairly easy to figure out. But it's interesting to learn the back story, a couple of elements fall into place in Diz's life, and the psychological interplay among the various characters is well done."},{"Title":"Dead Irish","review":"This review has more to do with the series than with Dead Irish. Working my way through the Dismas Hardy novels. Unlike many current detective writers, Lescroart eschews the charismatic psychotic serial killer and his/her elaborate, shocking crimes - burned, hanged, flayed, dismembered, et al. - and offers rather average folks - cops, secretaries, lawyers, etc. - caught up in difficult and unusual circumstances but trying to deal with the challenges of everyday life - work, family, friends.His characters' reflections on these challenges are simple, poignant, thoughtful evocations of the issues that we all face, and Lescroart does a superb job of coalescing the vapors, giving voice to our ruminations and fears.His work reminds me of the writing of James Gould Cozzens who won a Pulitzer Prize and was considered for the Nobel Prize. Writing during the middle decades of the 20th century, Cozzens was attacked by critics for being hopelessly out of date. His heroes are quite ordinary men, living quite ordinary lives and find themselves in the midst of a crisis that tests their moral and ethical beliefs. Like Cozzens' characters, Lescroart's heroes stand near us, offering the opportunity to reflect on our own lives.The plots have the requisite twists and turns and tensions to keep them moving briskly, but it is the thoughts and feelings of the characters that lift these books well above the general run of detective/thriller/mystery novels. The layers build as the series progresses so stay the course and enjoy the books - it's definitely worth it."},{"Title":"Dead Irish","review":"Ok, I don't understand why everyone thinks John Lescroart is a great author. I found this book to be extremely boring and the twists in it almost didn't make sense. It was a real stretch. I didn't think the characters interacted very well at all. This is the first book that I've read of the author. Maybe I should have started at the beginning of the series, but when I read the reviews for it they said that this book explained a lot of the beginnings of his main character, Dis Hardy. I just felt that the action was very stilted and that the author made the police very stupid. Like they couldn't do their jobs so they had to turn to an outsider that had been away from it for over 8 years. I just found the book to be very unbelievable from the get go. I would hope after several murders that are tied together that the police would be a little more interested. Just found it to be unrealistic. I did like the premise of the book and that the author explored the main family in the book but he seemed to forget some characters after introducing them until the end and it was wrapped up in a nice little package. Not sure if I'll try this author again or not. Also, don't think I can recommend this particular book to anyone."},{"Title":"Dead Irish","review":"It's always good to read the first book of a series as it lays the groundwork for the characters and their relationships. This book did a very good job of creating the defining the principal characters by making them interesting enough that I want to read more about them. The setting was well done. However, the story had too many red herrings and I found myself disappointed by the ending."},{"Title":"Dead Irish","review":"Dismas Hardy is a brooding Irishman who wears the pain of his personal losses like a costume. He is a former marine, policeman, attorney, husband and father and each of these past roles - and their attendant disappointments, pain and loss - play a very big part in his solitary and aloof approach to life. He tends bar at one of his closest friend's, Moses McGuire, neighborhood bar, plays a fairly decent game of darts, and drinks too many Black and Tans. He is a bartender who will listen to your sad tale, provide some bar-side philosophy with a bit of Irish cynicism and take your keys when you have had too much. He is in a slow spiral down until Moses's brother-in-law, Eddie Cochran, turns up dead. The first thinking is suicide but all those who know Eddie are convinced it was murder. Dismas makes it his business to find out.This is a fast paced novel with many interesting, fully developed characters and enough questions on each page to keep you turning."},{"Title":"Dead Irish","review":"Several reviewers have compared this novel unfavourably to later examples of the Dismas Hardy/Abe Glitsky series. But the book is the first of the series, and although it's weaker than later examples, it's a good read, with very sympa characters. And as always, the essence of San Francisco is bottled in some very evocative descriptions. So, fair plot, good characters, excellent setting. Well worth a look, and the later books in the series just get better. Press on....."},{"Title":"Dead Irish","review":"This is my second Lescroart novel and so far it's nothing compared to Guilt. I enjoyed some of the characters but the plot was really thin and not really that much of a mystery at all. Just a by the numbers detective story.

Too many characters and subplots that don't have much bearing on the actual mystery was rather confusing to me at times."},{"Title":"Dead Irish","review":"A good book always has a hook. It may be as simple as \\"Gregor Mendel awoke to find himself changed into a giant insect...\\" or the like. But, John Lescroart's \\"Dead Irish,\\" has a boxing glove at the end of a spring, like those old Warner Brothers cartoons. The hero, Diz (for Dismas, a name attributed to the good thief on the cross) Hardy is a bartender, an ex-cop, ex-attorney and divorc&eacute; who gets bribed into investigating the death of a young man, his boss's brother-in-law, an apparent suicide for a partnership in the business. The story goes down from there. We get exposure to cop-infighting, petty jealousies and one of the most unfeasible plots since Phantom of the Opera. The setting is San Francisco, which is described as being \\"hot,\\" [well, I remember it getting up to almost 90 one summer in the city] and uncomfortable. The action in the story is convoluted, and we are exposed to shifting points of view, confused and confusing characters and one non sequitur after another. The writing drags and even at the climax, there is little pick up in the pace of the story. The ending, burdened with an unlikely motive and MO, essential in a mystery, unravels into a frazzled mess of unresolution. All in all, a very disappointing read."},{"Title":"Dead Irish","review":"I listened to the audio version, and was pretty disappointed. I'm hoping some of the problem is the abridgement. While the book is ostensibly about Hardy, he didn't really seem to play a major role. It was just a grim tale about a LOT of people messing up their lives, and killing a lot of other people in the process.In the middle, Hardy gets some romantic action, after reminiscing about the death of his baby, for which he feels responsible. From his description of events, he IS responsible, so that did nothing to endear the character to me.I saw every plot twist a mile before it happened, and I consider myself a pretty naive reader, so that's not good.I gather this book is one of a series, and wonder if maybe the author is counting on us to already like his principal character. I'll try another Lescroart book, but if it's like this one, it will be my last."},{"Title":"Dead Irish","review":"This is a great thriller.

Middle-aged Theodore Colville falls in love with young and pretty Imogene Graham. The relationship borders on the ridiculous, but it's only when Imogene falls for a younger man that Colville calls it all off. One wonders what took him so long. The dialogue, especially when Colville is involved, crackles with wit. This is Howells's own favorite of his novels. It is extremely entertaining, one of Howells's very best books, and one of the best novels on the American bookshelf, regardless of time period."},{"Title":"Indian Summer","review":"An American middle-aged man returns to Florence, Italy - the scene of a heartbreaking romance twenty years earlier. There he meets an old friend from those days, her daughter, and her twenty year old female protege. Slowly a surprising romantic relationship develops; but is it really what both people want? Great dialogue, wonderful character development, and a happy ending."},{"Title":"Indian Summer","review":"When you think of chroniclers of love, life and American society during the Gilded Age, you automatically think of Henry James and Edith Wharton.But while W.D. Howells never quite reached their levels of prominence, his similar works are full of quiet introspection and evocative, vivid prose reminiscent of Wharton at her best. And \\"Indian Summer\\" is one of his better works -- a lush, colorful exploration of 19th-century Florence, and a love triangle of Americans who are taking a prolonged vacation there.After a disastrous career loss, Theodore Colville is vacationing in Florence, and promptly begins a massive midlife crisis. But he perks up after encountering Lina Bowen, a widowed ex-flame of his who is also staying in Florence with her young daughter Effie. And at a party that evening, Lina introduces him to the young, vivacious Imogene Graham.Soon Colville is squiring Effie and Imogene around Florence, and even taking all three women out to the carnival. Naturally, Imogene develops a crush on the kind, cynical Colville -- but her innocent liking alarms Lina, who still is carrying a flame for him, and Imogene's well-intentioned errors tie her in society's web. Noow Colville must decide what he wants most, and which woman truly loves him.At heart, \\"Indian Summer\\" is basically an exploration of a love triangle between an older man, a slightly younger woman, and a girl young enough to be his daughter. That's a delicate situation at the best of times, but this was also the Gilded Age -- codes of conduct were strict, and feelings were expressed in a dance of words and gestures rather than outward displays.But to frame the story, Howells creates an elaborate portrait of how wealthy Americans lived and saw Europe. In between parties and meditative conversations, there are vivid looks at the Florence of the time -- he fills it with dusty chapels, quiet hostels, walks in the rain, meditations in cafes, gorgeous old buildings and a wildly indulgent carnival full of masked flirtations.And all this is painted with a lush, detailed style that walks the fine line between sensuality and propriety. Like Imogene, it's full of passion and beauty, but not enough to get swept away. But also through the book is a sense of autumnal regret about youth's passage and the question of what happens after that.Most of that midlife crisis angst comes from Colville, who has just suffered a public humiliation and had to sell the paper he once ran. So unsurprisingly he's a bit depressed, and ends up being inadvertently torn between the affections of two women -- one is his equal in every way, and the other makes him feel old, yet he likes her youthful vibrancy. Lina is a fairly solid character, but Imogene's naive delight in Florence and in an older man's friendship is excellent.\\"Indian Summer\\" in Florence is apparently a pretty nice time to be there, unless you are locked in a love triangle of manners and hidden feelings. A lushly-written look back to a much more complicated time."},{"Title":"Indian Summer","review":"Dull as dishwater. It appears that Howells had nothing to write about and did so for roughly 400 pages. The conversations, especially those with the Reverend Walker and more especially those about Savanarola, are dreary, virtually pointless and meander on for an eternity--filigree and no more. The descriptions of Italy would have been best left to travel books and those of the carnivals are ordinary at best. The conflicts confronting Colville, while typical of the literature of this period, seem as forced and artificial as his surrounding characters. Altogether, the novel has no spark and had I not decided to read all of Howells' novels, I would have put it down long ago.\\"The Ambassador\\" leaves this work decidedly in the dust."},{"Title":"Indian Summer","review":"Howells' Indian Summer is probably the finest work of art ever created about a man's mid-life crisis (right up there with Visconti's film 'The Leopard'), and Howells' book is all the more charming and admirable for approaching its subject with lightness and humour. Theodore Colville, 41 and still unmarried, sells his newspaper business and heads on a whim to Florence, scene of a youthful heartbreak some 17 years earlier. As all men of his age, he finds himself both more relaxed and amusing around women than he was when he was in his 20s, as well as far less interested overall in the entire process of romantic love than he was back then. A funnier, and more reluctant, romantic leading man is therefore not to be found in all of literature. Despite its seemingly simple structure (the classic romantic triangle), Indian Summer is never predictable, and I would even suggest that there's a fourth corner to this triangle in the character of the child Effie, whose unconditional affection for Colville may ultimately be a bigger influence on Colville's middle-aged, comfort-seeking heart than landing a beautiful young bride. Howell's novel is as focused on the finer details of human motivation as the best of Trollope or James, but moves with an unrivalled lightness of touch to a surprisingly surprising conclusion. And the dialogue of Howells rivals that of the finest dramatists. I can't think of any writer of fiction whose characters converse more naturally, with all the branching flows and misfiring jokes of common speech. Indian Summer, as a comic novel, will never quite be recognised, alas, as what it is: one of the handful of great masterpieces of American literature."},{"Title":"Indian Summer","review":"Theodore Colville, a 40-year-old retired newspaperman from Des Vaches, Indiana, disenchanted with American politics, has returned to Florence, the scene of a failed youthful romance. Here he re-encounters Mrs. Lina Bowen, an enchanting American hostess and her beautiful young prot&eacute;g&eacute; Miss Imogene Graham. Miss Graham is 20 years old, beautiful, fascinated by literature and the arts, and considered a bit of an intellectual by the mindless young men who pursue her. Colville finds her utterly charming but extremely nave, and not nearly as bright as she imagines herself to be. For her part, she is fascinated by the older man's knowledge and experience, and is greatly moved by his romantic history. Colville's behavior is scrupulously correct, even refined, but Imogene's fondness for him breaks through his reserve and they reach an understanding, after which things begin to unravel. Having had his heart broken in Italy decades earlier, will Colville allow history to repeat itself?Howells is very fine writer, perhaps admired more than he is actually appreciated. He has Henry James' knack for intimate character study, without the run-on interior monologues that frustrate some of James' readers. Howells himself even makes the comparison, and wittily points out through one of his characters that if this were a Howells novel, \\"nothing would have happened\\". Certainly little enough actually happens considering just how long this novel is, and the dearth of action will not set well with many. Further, any book of the 19th century has an other-worldly quality to it that makes it challenging to relate to on a personal level. Still, Howells' characters are pleasant and engaging people to spend some time with, and the exquisite descriptions of Italy are an added bonus. But if you don't feel you can identify with the plight of a middle-aged man entranced by a much younger woman, this book probably isn't for you."},{"Title":"Indian Summer","review":"In his novel Indian Summer, William Dean Howells presents a mellow but realistic story that has the complete feel of that delightful time of the year, although the plot actually spans several seasons. The Indian summer aspect applies to a sophisticated gentleman, Theodore Colville, who has just entered his middle years as he returns to a scene, Florence, Italy, that played an important part in his early manhood. It was here twenty years earlier that he first fell in love, seemingly successfully until a sudden and harsh rejection. Now, after a once profitable career as a newspaper editor has ended, he is barely ensconced in the Italian city when he meets a lady from his past, a close friend of his lost love. Lina Bowen, now a widow with a young daughter, is an attractive and charming socialite among the American and English residents of Florence. Also living with her at this time as a temporary ward is a beautiful young girl just blossoming into womanhood, Imogene Graham.Colville, although he still hides a shy nature, has become an exceedingly witty and entertaining conversationalist. He quickly becomes a favorite with young Effie Bowen and Imogene Graham. Miss Graham indicates a disdain for the shallow young men that she has met and is highly attracted to the urbane, intelligent Mr. Colville. Mrs. Bowen invites Colville to become a regular guest in her home, and for a time the little coterie is delightfully congenial, but then an emotional triangle begins to develop. Imogene seems to be too devoted to this older gentleman, and Colville does not discourage her. Mrs. Bowen, who apparently is captivated by his charm as well, begins to feel overshadowed by her lovely young ward. This is the core of the intriguing plot.Howells' characters are totally believable in their thoughts, their motivations, their words, and their actions. The dialogue is delightful, both in the lighter conversations and in the more passionate speeches. Aided by the social milieu of expatriates in a historic city of art and culture, the story moves at first slowly and pleasantly, but begins to build inexorably toward an emotional crisis. As the whole plot unwinds before us, we can eventually see that there is really no other way that the events could realistically move. This novel is a very engrossing and satisfying tale of people that we become truly interested in."},{"Title":"Clinton for NYC mayor?(Editorials)(Former president hasn't said no)(Editorial): An article from: The Register-Guard (Eugene, OR)","review":"and one reason only since beame and that is to help the Real Estate industry...Real Estate is the main industry and they ofcourse litterally own the city..Dont get confused Bloomberg appointed himself Real Estate czar and has had no opposition no critism from the ewish media ewish opinion makers just as bloomberg has given total control without transparency to Darth vader kelly so the white and ewish community has given free reign to the mayor and alot of people have made lots of bucks..Amanda Burden the woman reeks corruption and dishonestyif Teddy Rosevelt were president or governor he would have these folk investigatedif Moshe Dyan where president he would be laughing from reading this till supper time..FBI was set up to investigate dirty politicians , plutarchs and anarchist.. all equally danererous to a healthy democracy society..

These books are also for historians, drug counselors, people who write laws associated with drug use, those concerned with the impoverishment of countries invaded by world-based industrialized corporations, and drug users. Think you aren't a drug user? Other than tea, coffee, chocolate, wine, beer, the paregoric my mother fed me as a child, and the aether and morphine I ingested at different times as a hospital patient, neither am I. Incidentally, paregoric and morphine are related to opium and it's offspring heroin.Pendell suggests the reader can begin anywhere in either of his two books and arrive at the same place. I read the sections that interested me most and then backfilled. I ended up reading all of PHARMAKO-DYNAMIS (the second volume) first. This volume includes essays on coffee, tea, chocolate, kola, betel, Ma Huang (Ephedera), Khat, Coca, and Nutmeg. Nutmeg?? Yes, nutmeg is a \\"drug\\" or herb of choice for some. You probably knew the poppy seeds on your bagel could lead to a positive on a drug test, but you might not have known that nutmeg in the proper doses could lead to euphoria, delirious visions, or headaches. Pendell says he prefers his nutmeg in eggnog.Pendell writes provocatively, \\" Billions of dollars are spent to keep adults from having access to methamphetamines, while Adderall (amphetamine) and Ritalin (methylphenidate) are widely prescribed for children.\\" Many of the plants with \\"suspect\\" pharmaceutical uses have been cultivated for thousands of years. Coca has been around for five to seven thousand years, and until the drug czars cracked down, it was an ingredient in Coca-Cola. The soft drink no longer includes it's namesake, but devotees can find the real stuff without a great deal of difficulty. Pendell characterizes the attempt by governments to control \\"drugs\\" as a continuation of the 19th Century Spice Wars, and more or less an unmitigated disaster (and given the recent news the Columbian drug lords may have links to terrorism, one must be concerned about this).My favorite drug, or drug of choice is tea (Camilla Sinensis). Fortunately, all sorts of benefits are associated with tea drinking. Another favorite is cacoa, a favorite drink of shamans and Goethe, who had a life-long interest in both the drink and the mysticism. Goethe once wrote...\\"Four epochs of the sciences: childlike, poetic, superstitious; empirical, investigative, curious; dogmatic, didactic, pedantic; and ideal, methodical, mystical.\\" Pendell covers each with the plant substances he explores."},{"Title":"Pharmako/Dynamis: Stimulating Plants, Potions, & Herbcraft (Pharmako Vol II)","review":"Dale Pendell's &quot;Pharmako&quot; series is an excellent resource for those interested in the relation of human cultures to plants, especially plants with consciousness-changing properties. The author devotes sections to each of a wide array of different plants, as well as sections dealing tangentially with aspects of the &quot;Poison Path&quot;. One of the most refreshing aspects of the series is the way it deals with the whole spectrum of these plants - coffee, chocolate, marijuana, opium, tobacco, wine and beer, cocaine, and many others, on the same footing. One of the few other books to take this perspective - Terrence McKenna's &quot;Food of the Gods&quot; - is also well worth reading, but is shorter, deals with a narrower range of &quot;allies&quot;, and lacks some of the poetic and stylistic verve of Dale Pendell's books.Another comparison - to Hoffmann and Schultes' &quot;Plants of the Gods&quot; is in order, as both have encyclopaedic range, but the Pharmako series takes a more integrated viewpoint, and (again) is longer. When the series is complete (with Pharmako/Gnosis) I expect it to be one of the fullest and most useful references on this fascinating subject.One feature which recommends this series is the variety of perspectives which the subsections of each chapter bring to each plant: we learn about botany, about pharmacology, history, religious uses, personal views of the effects, poetic odes, esoteric commentary, and more. The author takes seriously the question of how to report on plants whose effects involve changes in consciousness: he lets the narrative voice reflect some of the kinds of awareness associated to each (one reason the book on stimulants ended up being so long that the two-book series turned into a three-book series!)If you interest in these plants is scientific, historical, religious, or whatever else, you'll surely find facets of this multi-sided work that appeal - and you may discover an interest in the others. If you merely want to see an innovative kind of reportage, you may even discover an interest in the subject.Warmly recommended."},{"Title":"Pharmako/Dynamis: Stimulating Plants, Potions, & Herbcraft (Pharmako Vol II)","review":"a wonderfully creative book - in design and content.

The title is somewhat misleading, as all of the plays were presented at the Peacock, the Abbey's new writing stage. Its main purpose is to make the plays available to readers and potential producers, and in this it succeeds admirably, although there are a couple of notable plays from the period that didn't get included, presumably because they were already available elsewhere. (This makes the volume somewhat unrepresentative.) The plays themselves are of varying quality. Michael Harding's &quot;Hubert Murray's Widow&quot; is an interesting, darkly funny tragicomedy (or comitragedy) about a dead gunman and the events surrounding, and after, his death; Donal O'Kelly's &quot;Asylum! Asylum!&quot; is a characteristically angry piece about the treatment of an African refugee, written some time before the number of refugees in Ireland skyrocketed, and thus anticipating a major current social issue. Tom MacIntyre's &quot;Sheep's Milk on the Boil&quot; is an impenetrable scrap of whimsy, and Niall Williams' &quot;A Little Like Paradise&quot; is a sentimental mood piece about the West, the kind of play that has since been stamped into a bloody pulp by the erratic genius of Martin McDonagh. Neil Donnelly's &quot;The Duty Master&quot; is dull but worthy, a portrait of an Irishman teaching in an English public school, and about as exciting as it sounds. There are some excellent production shots, but one is not told which actor played which role and thus identifying what scene is being depicted is not easy. Plus, the American editor suffers from a too-misty-eyed appreciation of Irish drama and the respective qualities of the plays, and tries to hard to fit them into the familiar canon. But a useful book, especially for those that want to put the plays on."},{"Title":"The Comancheros","review":"Fictional history.The history about the Texas republic and Sam Houston are accurate but the story itself is fiction.I enjoyed the adventure and the characters. The movie starring John Wayne was an interesting movie and did the book justice; not making great changes in the storyline.It was well written and interesting to the end."},{"Title":"The Comancheros","review":"If you saw the John Wayne movie you might be interested in further reading if so this is your book. The screen play followed the books characterization fairly well, although the main protagonist is Paul Regrett not John Wayne's character. Either way it's a worthwhile read if your a western fan."},{"Title":"The Comancheros","review":"Once in a while I will read a \\"typical western\\" either in hardcover or paperback. I found the paperback version of this novel and was happily suprised due to a great plot and interesting characters. The novel takes place throughout Texas, when Texas was still a republic and the list of historical names blends well with the fictional characters.I find the book more interesting than the movie starring John Wayne, and that is a high compliment from me since I truely enjoy John Wayne movies. If you are in for a great western novel, then this is a great read.Highly Recommended!"},{"Title":"Pocket Guide to the Birds of the Indian Subcontinent (Helm Field Guides)","review":"This is the most perfect book. It takes you to every country in the area with detailed maps for every of the 1200 species that\`s been recorded. The plates are excellent with no exceptions and every bird are depicted more than once."},{"Title":"Pocket Guide to the Birds of the Indian Subcontinent (Helm Field Guides)","review":"I have been living in this region for the last 6 years, and I have used several guides. I recently returned from a trekking trip in Nepal and I was not happy with this guide. For starters, it is very heavy - even though it is a field guide. The most irritating part, however, is the lack of detailed information about the birds' behaviour and habitats. Providing a description of their markings doesn't really help when I also have the picture there. If I am having a hard time identifying the bird with only its physical appearance, I want information about flight style, habitats and - especially for Nepal - altitude! Given that the guide covers so many countries, you will find pages of warblers and finches but without sufficient information to identify which one you have seen. My final point of frustration is that the distribution maps are rarely on the same page as the pictures and descriptions. Given that the area is really big, I can't really expect very detailed distribution info, but at least then provide altitude and habitat! But the maps are often several pages before or after the pictures, which means you have to keep the bird number in mind, the Plate number in mind, as well as the page number of the map - so that you can flip back and forth - really time-consuming and not at all practical if you are trekking (maybe easier if you can sit still, but then of course it isn't a 'Field Guide').I was lucky enough to be travelling with someone else who had the Nepal guide (Field Guide to the Birds of Nepal), so I could quickly check when I was uncertain. That book is basically the Nepal version of the larger book with the same pictures, however, is much lighter with better descriptions and would have been a better guide for my trek. I would also recommend the Oxford Sri Lanka guide. There is also a Bhutan guide (again by the same authors with the same pictures), which is also very easy to use."},{"Title":"Pocket Guide to the Birds of the Indian Subcontinent (Helm Field Guides)","review":"One of the best bird guides I ever had. Very good book for a birder with some experience. I would not recommend this for someone just starting bird watching, since this book covers the whole subcontinent. For a starter I would recommend a country specific bird guide."},{"Title":"Students with Special Needs: Categories, Characteristics, Instructional and Behavioral Strategies That Work","review":"Educators frequently express concern about not being trained in the area of special education. They often times do not feel prepared to teach students with special needs because they aren't familiar with their characteristics, and have limited instructional and behavioral strategies that work with them. The more teachers know about their students the confident they are in responding to the students' needs.This guide is designed to provide teachers with a quick and ready use resource to address the student needs on a daily basis. It highlights various categories and characteristics of students with special needs, along with key instructioal and behavioral strategies that work.

Of course, Frank and Joe jump at the chance, and the fast-paced excitement begins.But that's only part of the great story here. The House on the Cliff, referenced in the title, is an obvious metaphor for all human endeavor. The house is located there because it affords a commanding view of the bay that Bayport is named after - Bayport Bay. This allows any occupant, from almost any room, to see water.But it does not end there. The real action happens along the Bayport's bustling waterfront, Bayport Bay Port.You see, the original of this story was written before the repeal of prohibition. Rumrunners and bootleggers abound in lawless Bayport. However, two noted vintners (a thinly disguised characterization of Ernest and Julio Gallo) continue to ferment their matchless heavy wine there: Bayport Bay Port Port. How these honest, well-intentioned artists meet their comeuppance has, as you'll see, everything to do with the view afforded by the House on the Cliff.I won't spoil the ending for you. My only remaining unanswered question is, why not title this wonderful mystery \\"Busting Bustling Bayport Bay Port Port?\\""},{"Title":"The House on the Cliff (Hardy Boys, Book 2)","review":"I really liked this book as my 12th book. It was good because I like houses on cliffs, or anything like that. I also like cliff climbing, and thw whole thing is as good as cliff climbing. It was a lot to read about, so I can't remember much. But this was a very good book. So for major, major mystery and action, The House On The Cliff is that book of dreams."},{"Title":"The House on the Cliff (Hardy Boys, Book 2)","review":"The House On The Cliff was a great book it didn't have any boring parts not even one sentence was boring. It always left you on cliff hangers and you would not want to leave the book, or if you already have you would want to come back very very soon. It is very unpredictable and mysterious becuase it is a mysterious book. The book is the best I have ever read in my life and I've read tons of books. There are no bad parts that will make you bored or feel stupid reading this book. There are only good parts that are fun to read and I really truthfully recommend this book to anyone who can read."},{"Title":"The House on the Cliff (Hardy Boys, Book 2)","review":"Daniel Dipesio11/5/12The House on the CliffThis book is a mystery that Franklin W. Dixon wrote very well. He leaves you hanging at the end of a chapter, but picks up where he left off. He makes you feel like you're in the book with the Hardy's and their friends Chet Morton, and others. They all love solving mysteries together.The boys and their father are on a case of missing supplies off of a ship. the police can't figure it out, the great detective Fenton Hardy is called on the case. His sons witness a man trying to be killed by the smugglers in a boat chase. The man ends up in the water from an explosion. The Hardy boys and their friends swim and row their way to help the man in the water. they get him and bring him to an old farmhouse nearby and they take him in and help him out.The next day the Hardy boys go and check on the man, they find the owners of the farmhouse tied up and the man gone. when they untied the farmers, they told the Hardy's that people came in and took the man and drove off about ten minutes before they got there.The Hardy's drove after them, but saw no vehicles on the beach, plus the smugglers had ten minutes on them.I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys mysteries and want a long series of books to read. The book says that it is for younger people, but I think it is for anyone who wants to read good books that have some suspense. These books are good for almost anyone."},{"Title":"The House on the Cliff (Hardy Boys, Book 2)","review":"The book was in perfect condition and was exactly as advertised. It came very quickly.

Once inside, they hear a shriek which scares all but Frank and Joe out. The Boys investigate but find nothing. They leave but a storm forces them all back to the house. They hear more shrieks, get locked in and part of the house starts to collapse! They finally get out but have problems with their motorcycles and find their tool kits stolen.They are distracted by a boat chase out on the bay. There are shots from one boat and the other boat explodes! The Boys row out to save the pilot of the boat. Finding him injured, they bring him to a nearby farmhouse to recuperate. The man gives his name as \\"Jones\\" and claims \\"Snackley got me - the rat!\\" The Boys return home and Fenton tells them that Snackley is an infamous smuggler.The next day, the Boys return to the farmhouse only to find the farmer and his wife bound and gagged. \\"Jones\\" is missing and the Boys give chase but lose him. Returning home, they find that Fenton has disappeared and a forged note left behind. They start a search and a truck driver reports he saw Fenton walking out by the Polucca place.The next day, the Boys, accompanied by Chet, Biff, Tony and Phil, go out to the old home but find it's now occupied by some seedy characters. The occupants claim ignorance but Franks spots Fenton bloodied cap hanging inside the house!They report their findings to Chief Collig, the fat, pompous leader of the Bayport PD, and his moronic sidekick, Det. Smuff. The cops dither and the Boys have to shame them into making an investigation. Reluctantly, the Chief agrees to go the next day and, of course, discovers nothing.Fed up, the Boys take matters into their own hands and go out with Tony on his boat, \\"The Napoli\\", to explore the cliffs by the Polucca place. They find a hidden cove but are chased away at gunpoint by Snackley. Hanging around nearby till after dark, they overhear the smugglers. Frank and Joe go ashore and find a hidden cave entrance. They discover that it leads all the way to the cliff top and the smugglers are stashing their booty there.Overhearing Snackley threatening Fenton, they attempt a rescue and are captured. Snackley threatens to send the Boys out to a watery grave with his partner-in-crime, Li Chang.Later, Fenton overpowers the guard and they escape, only to be spotted and chased into the Polucca house. There's a running gun battle and Fenton and the Boys are recaptured. Suddenly, the state police show up and everything is thrown into turmoil. Fenton and Snackley have a life-and-death struggle and the gang is finally rounded up.The Boys and Fenton split a $5,000 reward, we find out that Snackley was Polucca's nephew and that he had murdered the old man. With some of that 5 grand, the Boys throw a big dinner party for their pals in the barn behind the Hardy home.Comments: The best story in the canon! A dark, violent tale of smuggling, drugs, kidnapping and murder! None of the other stories can match this one for sheer exciting adventure! I've always thought this tale would make a great Hardy Boys movie. The Boys show plenty of guts and good detective ability in this one. Fenton plays a major role here and he works well with his sons. The gun battle and fight at the climax is the most thrill-packed prose in any Hardy story. If you read only one Hardy Boys book, it should be this one.Rating: A+"},{"Title":"The House on the Cliff (Hardy Boys, Book 2)","review":"Hardy boys The house on the cliff was a suspense-filled mystery that kept me at the edge of my seat.

Unfortunately, in my youth I read the 1960's version, but this version, written in the 1920's, is much much better (I'm 39 now and read it to my son).I think the most interesting thing about this book is that a lot of the problems that today's parents/teachers/politicians complain about are the main topic in this story. Without giving away the storyline, it has drug running, gangs, crime, violence and murder. I guess it just goes to show that the good old days weren't always what they seem to be.A nice bonus for this book is that for those of you who always wanted to know about Franklin W.

It is a reproduction of the original publication of this book. The original copyright is 1927 (though this Applewood edition bears a 1991 copyright). Books 1-38 of the Hardy Boys were revised beginning in the early 1960s. Some of the revisions were primarily intended to modernize the stories. Others resulted in substantial change in the plot and narrative content. This re-print of the original 1927 book is significantly different in narrative content from the revision. Having said that, the basic plot premise is still the same. In this book, the Hardys uncover a smuggling ring. But the real treat is the fact that the original text of \\"House on the Cliff\\" is probably the very best written of the Hardy boys series. The plot, and the narrative tension are quite good---especially when you consider that this was intended to be a mass appeal series book. I originally \\"stumbled\\" across the original text House on the Cliff in my school library. I kept asking to go to the library so I could read the book (no one had checked it out in years).

It develops and moves beyond the character introductions of the first book and quickly unfolds a plot involving smugglers, mysterious dwellings, sudden dangers, and, of course, detective work. It is a fun and exciting read.It's age is perhaps reflected in the villains who threaten but avoid doing too much more, but also by a strong affirmation of family bonds and especially father-son relationships with the heroes openly proud and protective of their parents, and the parents regularly affirming their boys.

Dixon. It also was too much detail. Some of the detail was hard to get. This book also doesn't take long to read so if you like good short stories, this is one of them. It was a very exhilarating story also. You wanted to read the book and you don't. I think Franklin had a good picture in his head when he wrote it also because the story kept flowing. The story on the other hand was predictable and you could tell nothing bad was going to happen to someone and in the end they will all be together and capture the bad guy. I give the book eight and a half out of ten because of Franklin's detail, thought put into it, and the story's plot line. This is a better book for young children and I recommend it."},{"Title":"The House on the Cliff (Hardy Boys, Book 2)","review":"I bought this book from the kindle store. And I like it because it has a lot of action.I liked it so much I would recomend it to anyone."},{"Title":"The House on the Cliff (Hardy Boys, Book 2)","review":"I had expected the second installment of The Hardy Boys to be not unlike the first. However, I was pleasantly surprised at the differences between the two books. Whereas the first book moved at a moderate pace, the second moved much quicker as there was a tremendous amount of action and even suspense. The Tower Treasure dealt mostly with a passive mystery which the Hardy Boys were following, picking up clues as they went. Here, in The House on the Cliff, the mystery is quite active and the boys are participants in its various stages pushing it along to its conclusion.The scene is slightly removed from their town of Bayport. An old, abandoned house looms over a cliff is where Mr Hardy suggests is a good place for his sons, and their friends, to set up a telescope to keep an eye out on the ocean to try and spot traces of a smuggling ring. No sooner have the boys done this but they begin to hear screaming from the abandoned home. The mystery is off and running...Characters such as Callie, Iola and Mrs Hardy take on a much lesser role than they had during the first book, while Pretzel Pete and a few other interesting figures are introduced. The disappearance of Mr Hardy, attempted murder, lots and lots of mayhem, culminate in a hostage situation that includes the boys, but in the end the bad are caught and the good go on to figure out...The Secret of the Old Mill."},{"Title":"The House on the Cliff (Hardy Boys, Book 2)","review":"This set of six books is a great way to start your Hardy Boys Mysteries collection. The first six books, while dated, are some of the best books in the series. Here is a brief synopsis of each of the six stories.\\"The Tower Treasure\\"In this introduction to the Hardy Boys series, bonds and jewels have been stolen from Mr. Hurd Applegate. Mr. Applegate thinks it is Mr. Robinson, the gardener and general handyman. Fenton Hardy, the boys' father, Frank and Joe Hardy and all their friends do not believe that Mr. Robinson had anything to do with the robbery. The Hardy Boys begin their very first case!After a series of events, including the recovery of Chet Morton's stolen car, one of the boys nearly plunging to his death in Mr. Applegate's house, and the actual death of a criminal, the boys suddenly realize where the jewels and bonds might be found.\\"The House on the Cliff\\"In the second book in this series the danger is increased. Famous detective Fenton Hardy invites his sons on a case. This time Frank and Joe accidentally observe smugglers attacking a man on the ocean. Before the boys can see what happens to the man they hear a cry from an abandoned nearby house, which is perched on a cliff overlooking the ocean. Their search is fruitless, and on returning where they had left an expensive telescope, they discover the eyepieces are missing. The mystery begins.The smugglers are bringing rare drugs into the country, by means unknown. Fenton Hardy disappears during the investigation, leaving the boys with an even bigger mystery, and their mother with concerns regarding Fenton's safety.The exciting conclusion of this book involves the Coast Guard, secret passages and a mysterious cargo ship. As the battle between the smugglers, the police, the Coast Guard, and Joe, Frank, and Fenton Hardy rages on, everyone is in danger because the smugglers have guns and are not afraid to use them.\\"Secret of the Old Mill\\"Chet Morton, a good friend of the Hardy boys, and Frank and Joe Hardy are on their way to purchase a new microscope when they save a boy's life. The boy, Ken Blake, is a delivery boy for Elekton Corporation, which does top secret work on military rockets. After finding Ken's package, he is on his way to complete his delivery.We soon learn that the Elekton facility is new, and Elekton refurbished an old mill to act as part of the guard house for the new operation. We soon learn that there is something unusual going on in the old mill.As the story evolves, we learn the old mill has a unique warning system, a hidden room, and a secret tunnel. We also learn that there is more than a single mystery in this book, which makes for interesting reading as the reader attempts to guess who the bad guys might be, and what their motivations are.\\"The Missing Chums\\"At the beginning of the book the boys take their new boat, the Sleuth, out on the bay. While they are cruising on the bay another boat nearly rams them. They would have chased the boat but the steering on the Sleuth broke, and the boys ended up going around in circles. Soon the Sleuth is stolen, and good friends Chet Morton and Biff Hooper disappeared after a party. The boys not only have to learn who stole the Sleuth, but where their missing friends went, and who robbed a local bank.\\"Hunting for Hidden Gold\\"At last the Joe and Frank Hardy and their father Fenton get away from Bayport for a mystery. The boys travel to Montana through Chicago. In Chicago, men posing as their father's associates kidnap them. After a harrowing escape and stupid actions on the part of the kidnappers, the boys were able to continue on their journey. In Montana it appears their adversaries are ruthless, and their adversaries attempt numerous times to stop the Hardys from investigating their activities, including trying to kill the Hardy boys and their father. The boys fend off assassins, a fall from a cliff, and a cave-in in their most harrowing adventure yet.\\"The Shore Road Mystery\\"A string of car robberies have piqued the Hardy Boy's interest. It appears as though the car thieves regularly elude the police even when the police are hot on their trail. When the Hardy Boys put their minds to the mystery what they discover is that the car crooks are even cleverer than they could ever have suspected. There are mysteries galore as a spider-man is introduces, along with mysterious plowing at night without lights and a family mystery. A simple car theft becomes an excellent Hardy Boys puzzle.The publisher recommends the Hardy Boys series for ages 9 to 12 because the series is relatively tame for the previous target audience of ages 10 to 14. This particular book is a good fit for the new age range. Though the Hardy Boys series contains archaic information, as reading material for an increasingly younger audience they are good. Once a child has reached age 12 or so the stories may be of less interest, but given the combination of mystery and action, these books remain good safe choices for parents who want to know what their children are reading."},{"Title":"The House on the Cliff (Hardy Boys, Book 2)","review":"Franklin W. Dixion's series the Hardy Boys in the book Hunting for Hidden Gold is a book filled with action and mystery. Every turn of the page brings more and more mystery and excitement to me and other readers who read the series of the hardy boys. This fictional book is about two boys and their father are devoted crime stoppers who yet again embark on adventure filled with action, adventure, danger, and mystery. The Hardy's are assigned to assist their father (another well know crime stopper in there fictional world) in bringing down a well know brigand that has inhabited the woods in lucky lode. It is a constant race with the clock to find the brigand and his henchmen and what they are trying to find and to bring them to justice.I happened to find this book very entertaining at points it brought to the edge of my chair in some parts but it could get boring in some places. It's like they are taking it minute by minute with quick hair brain plans and still not get hurt. I think that it can be a little unrealistic some of the time. This book I think is trying to say even though you might be young or small anything is possible. My over all opinion of the book is that I found it very entertaining and interesting it made me want to find out where the treasure comes into place and find out if the brigand was brought to justice. I give the book a 4 out of five. I would also read the other books within the series of the hardy boys.GSK"},{"Title":"The House on the Cliff (Hardy Boys, Book 2)","review":"I used to read these books when I was a child.

Frank looks through the telescope and he sees a big boat. Joe said, \\"It might be Snattman the smuggler\\". Joe looks through the telescope and a man was climbing down the side of the cliff to a small boat.They all heard a man scream from inside the house on the cliff.

The revised edition is most familiar, but this one is richer in subplots and character development. This book was originally released back in the late 1920's, and is, arguably, the best Hardy Boys book in the entire series. Admittedly this is my personal opinion, but I have read each and every Hardy Boys title (both original and revised text)in the first 58. This story was revised during the first wave revisions of the Hardy Boys back in the late 1950s.

The stories were once recommended for children ages 10 to 14. As children are exposed to more violence and seem to require greater levels of stimulation, the recommended age range has move to 9 to 12. I think any child capable of reading some of the challenging words in these books will enjoy them, regardless of how tame most of the action may be.

I started reading these books when I was seven, and eventually collected thirty or forty of them, reading them all two or three times. I recently found several in an old box in the basement, including &quot;House on The Cliff&quot; and &quot;Secret of the Old Mill.&quot; When I read one to my ten-year-old daughter, I discovered that time had not tarnished their quality nor distorted my fond memory of them. Now my daughter wants to read another.Dixon utilizes two key techniques to capture kids' imagination and keep their attention. One is action. Kids get distracted easily. Dixon never gives them the chance. Exciting, dangerous, and mysterious stuff starts happening right away in each book and continues in every chapter. The other is to end each chapter with some unresolved event so suspenseful that kids must keep reading. I can't tell you how many times I stayed up late to keep reading a Hardy Boys mystery.Every book in the series is as good as the next. Dixon created characters and a formula that worked, and he stuck with them consistently. They teach good old-fashioned values, and are fun and easy to read--the perfect step up from baby books to chapter books. --Christopher Bonn Jonnes, author of Wake Up Dead."},{"Title":"The House on the Cliff (Hardy Boys, Book 2)","review":"I started reading these in 6th grade because my dad had like all of them because he was a big fan.

Rating: Original: A+"},{"Title":"The House on the Cliff (Hardy Boys, Book 2)","review":"Written by Leslie McFarlane from an outline by publisher Edward Stratemeyer, THE HOUSE ON THE CLIFF--the second book in the Hardy Boys series--was first published in 1927. In the late 1950s the earliest novels in the series were re-written to make the characters more consistent and keep the books contemporary; even so, this is 1950s contemporary, and readers will not find computers, cell phones, and the like in the original series. The characters are also very distinctly of their era, with Frank and Joe Hardy, their friends, and their parents reflecting then-popular ideas about good and bad, family relationships, and the like.In this particular story, detective father Fenton Hardy has asked sons Frank and Joe to visit the \\"Old Pollit place,\\" an empty house on a cliff that commands a view of the bay, to look for possible smugglers. The Hardy Boys books are written to a specific formula, so certain elements repeat from book to book--but even so, THE HOUSE ON THE CLIFF is one of the more unexpected books in the series. The boys encounter possible smugglers, experience a theft, run afoul of a landslide, and rescue a drowning man--and that's just the first four chapters! The entire book is written at a very fast pace, so it is an enjoyable quick read.No one would accuse the Hardy Boys books of being great literature. They are distinctly formula in both plot and style. Even so, the books are brightly written and never talk down to their target audience--and older readers who enjoyed them in their childhood will find it a pleasing bit of nostalgia.

Harry Potter probably pushed the outer limit for length and number of volumes.So, I'm inclined to provide my young readers with samples from some of the old series.

Some emphasize the mathematics, others the physics behind these two theories. This book is primarily concerned with the mathematical structure of general relativity, and is written for the student of relativity who has preparation in differential geometry, on the level of manifolds and Riemannian geometry. Readers should not expect an in-depth discussion of general relativity, and so will need to consult other books and texts to gain further understanding.Chapter 1 outlines the theory of special relativity, with discussion first on the Lorentz transformations. The Lorentz group is defined, along with its generalization the Poincare group. Both of these groups could be viewed both mathematically and physically as a constraint on the construction of physical theories. Theories not satisfying the constraint of Lorentz or Poincare covariance cannot be physical theories. The famous Minkowski space is constructed, and the author discusses the (indefinite) norm on this space using an interesting formulation due to A.A. Robb.After a brief discussion of the principle of equivalence, the author begins a study of the (pseudo-Riemmanian) geometry of space-time in chapter 2. He constructs, using very simple geometric considerations and elementary physical reasoning, a pseudo-Riemannian metric that yields in chapter 3, after some &quot;heuristic&quot; considerations, the Einstein gravitational field equations. This derivation is interesting in that the Einstein equations are viewed as a generalization of Poisson's equation. The charge density is replaced by a &quot;mass density&quot; and the Laplacian of the scalar potential by an expression involving the Laplacian of the square root of the zeroth component of the metric of space-time. The stress-energy-momentum tensor is related to this Laplacian, and the Einstein equations follow immediately.In chapter 4 the author does some of the &quot;index gymnastics&quot; in the context of differential forms, and interprets the Einstein equations as an equating of the quadratic form of the stress-energy-momentum tensor to the sum of sectional curvatures of space-time. The geometry of the spatial sections is studied via the Gauss equations, and the Einstein equations are put in a purely geometric form, which brings out transparently their nonlinearity.The Einstein equations would be useless if they could not be solved and related to physically interesting situations. In spite of the nonlinearity of the Einstein equations, many exact solutions can be found, and the next chapter gives the detail of the one of the first of these, the Schwarzschild solution. This solution gives the geometry of spacetime for a spherically symmetric static mass distribution. The famous Schwarzschild singularity is discussed briefly. This is followed in chapter 6 by a more in-depth discussion, using various tools from differential geometry, of the stress-energy-momentum tensor. These discussions are continued in the next chapter to obtain relativistic equations of motion, with attention paid in particular to the shear and stress tensor for a viscous fluid. Noticeably missing though, and a particular peculiarity of general relativity, are the relativistic equations of motion for rigid bodies. It still remains to be seen whether general relativity can indeed include a notion of rigid bodies. The relativistic equations of motion for a true rigid-body gyroscope would be very interesting and important.The bending of light rays around massive bodies, one of the most popular of the predictions of general relativity, is discussed in chapter 8. This is followed in chapter 9 by a discussion of electromagnetism in 3-dimensional Euclidean space and in Minkowski space. The role of twisted forms is readily apparent in the discussion, as expected due to the properties of the magnetic field. The duality between the electric and magnetic fields is made explicit, as well as their well-known synthesis in Minkowski space. The Hodge *-operator makes its appearance here, and its utility in formulating Maxwell's equations in both 3-space and Minkowski is very apparent. The question of formulating electromagnetism in general relativity is answered in the next chapter, wherein the electromagnetic stress-energy-momentum tensor is calculated. The Reissner solution, which gives the electromagnetic field due to a charged massive particle is given. Missing in the discussion is any discussion of gravitoelectromagnetism, a subject which has become very important recently, and could have easily be included here.The author considers the solution of the Einstein equations in the interior of a star in chapter 11, a subject of much importance in astrophysics. The interior solution to the Schwarzschild geometry is considered, as well as the interior solution to any static, spherically symmetric mass-energy distribution. The latter yields the Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation for the pressure as a function of radius.The last chapter is a brief overview of relativistic cosmology, certainly one the most popular topics currently in general relativity. The Einstein static universe is discussed, along with Einstein's famous &quot;blunder&quot; for avoiding an empty universe: the introduction of the cosmological constant. The (constant curvature) Friedman cosmology is then discussed in great detail. Relaxing the constant curvature constraint is then removed, and the author shows what this will entail for the geometry and physics of the universe."},{"Title":"Gravitational Curvature: An Introduction to Einstein's Theory","review":"This lovely little book perhaps suffers from a poor title or miscategorization.

Much better as an intro is Foster &amp; Nightengales' GR book."},{"Title":"The Rose of Sodom","review":"I had the pleasure of proof reading the original text for the author a few years ago. I was amazed by the plot and character development in this futuristic Christian thriller. These are real people caught in what could be a real future if things that are happening today continue in their current direction.I found myself caught up in the suspense of the plot so that I could hardly wait to read the next chapter upon finishing the previous chapter.I also found myself becoming more aware of certain current events that play a major role in the plot of this wonderfully crafted tale.Finally, I must compliment the author on the use of scripture references in this story of religious persecution in the Twenty First Century. The portrayal of Christian Faith in these people is genuine, not superficial.This is a MUST READ for any fan of Suspense Thillers!!! YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED."},{"Title":"The Rose of Sodom","review":"I am not usually a reader of Christian fiction, however when this book was recommended to me by a friend I decided to give it a try. From the first chapter I was captivated by the story line. As I read I became engrossed in the story and did not want to put the book down.I was amazed at the author's ability to bring current day issues into a futuristic realm, showing a real possibility of how things could be in our the not so distant future. This book heightened my senses and made me realize that now is the time to be involved in the Pro-Life movement. I beleive this is a book that every Christian and non-Christian person should read. It will engage you and also raise your awareness of this issue. Abortion is not an easy subject to take on from any venue, but Katie Kuntz does it in a way that captivates and challenges you to be diligent in the fight for Life. I highly recommend this book and am looking forward to the sequele &quot;Gates of Gomorrah&quot;. This author is going to go a long way - Way to go Katie!"},{"Title":"The Rose of Sodom","review":"Let me start by saying that this was one of the best books I've read in a while. I had the book for several months before I finally read it. The reason for that was because, as they say I &quot;judged a book by the cover&quot;. When looking at this book, and the abstract, I did not expect to enjoy it. My personal taste is not one that is attracted to futuristic, sci-fi type stories. My expectation was that this book would be just that, what I was pleasently surprised by was that it was much much more than any genre could capture. I was reminded of social issues that I claim to care about, but forget about all too often. I was encouraged to deepen my walk with the Lord and prepare myself and my family for the future of our world, which, whether we like futuristic books or not, is eminent. I would recommend this book to anyone, as long as you are ready to be captivated by the storyline and moved by the reality that it is based on."},{"Title":"How Firm a Foundation: A Handbook on the Historical Reliability of the New Testament and the Resurrection","review":"Dr. Foster uses a logical, well organized approach to presenting the facts of Christianity's historicity. As Dr. Foster puts it so well, he does not ask the reader to \\"check their brain at the door\\" but instead asks the reader to come and reason with him!After reading Dr. Foster's handbook, I feel more equipped to defend the faith to skeptics. I also feel much better prepared to consume popular media presentations on Christianity and the Bible.

Then using classic literary, historical, and legal methods he systematically whittles away at this commonly held bias, showing the Gospels and the Epistles to be reliable historical accounts and to contain the only logical explanation of the events of Christ's death, burial, and resurrection.A wonderfully concise and astute defense of Christian belief and worldview, this handbook serves as a powerful lesson (or reminder) that the New Testament is not a book of mythology, but is rather a collection of actual eyewitness accounts of events of the highest importance for humanity.Given that so many people are content to simply scoff, or are merely too intimidated to do the work and research necessary, Foster has done believers and non-believers a great service.

This short handbook, written in laymen's language, has many applications and is valuable not only as a summary for theologians and bible school students, but also for adult classes and teenage studies in the church. The truthfulness of the faith we confess is not a matter of simple opinion, but rests upon unshakable foundations when all the evidence is evaluated with an honest mind.

The claymation is great - very visually appealing, bright and well designed. The realistic depiction of a visit to the doctor's office - complete with the reception area and interaction between the receptionist and the doctor provides great insight into what it is like to be a doctor and to visit a doctor. I also like the diversity of the characters. Many different ethnicities are represented as well as disabilities, ages, and levels of confidence when visiting the doctor. I really enjoy reading this book to my daughter. Since we started reading it, she pretends to examine her little brother using a pretend stethescope and other doctor tools and says she would like to be a doctor when she grows up. She also seems less afraid of going to the doctor. I highly recommend this book and plan to purchase others from the collection."},{"Title":"Daisy the Doctor (Jobs People Do)","review":"We now have Daisy the Doctor, Fred the Firefighter and Vicki the Vet.

It's great to read to children to get them familiar with a doctors office and talk about what they do, who goes there and just makes it a much friendlier and not so scary place.

He does an excellent job in \\"Pride Against Prejudice,\\" which is an overview of Miami's Haitian-American community. Haitians in Miami constitute a relatively recent ethnic immigrant population, with most coming to South Florida's shores since the late 1970s and early 1980s. Stepick details the history of Haitian migration, the transnational nature of Haitian lives which connects those on the island with those in Miami, and the prejudice and discrimination Haitians faced throughout the 1980s and to the present day. One chapter is devoted to the differences Haitian and Cuban refugees have faced in coming to the United States: Cubans have historically been welcomed as political refugees fleeing communism, while Haitians have been regarded as illegal aliens and told to keep out.I found this mini-ethnography extremely informative, but with less than 140 pages of text, the $28 price tag is a bit extreme."},{"Title":"Pride Against Prejudice: Haitians in the United States (Part of the New Immigrants Series)","review":"Had this guy as a professor here at Portland State, the guy knows his stuff and his book has great examples."},{"Title":"Prose: Works of Francis Thompson, Part 3","review":"I'm sure Thompson's poems are very good, but the formatting of this Kindle edition makes them very difficult to read.

Nemerov looks at four images from Lewton's movies, images that center on little-known character actors Nemerov then shows how these tie into Lewton's Russian background, Lewton's career as a novelist, and American pop culture during World War II.Rarely have I seen Lewton's films subjected to this kind of close analysis. While I might have wished that Nemerov focused on something from \\"The Seventh Victim\\" or \\"The Body Snatcher,\\" I have to say that what he said made very good sense and placed Lewton in a broader context. (As opposed to the common idea that Lewton was such a genius that his films stand apart from everything else in the horror genre.) This is the rare book of which it can be said that I wish it were longer. Nemerov's enthusiasm for Lewton shines through, but he also has balanced judgment on Lewton's limitations as well. Strongly recommended for anyone interested in horror films or films of the Forties."},{"Title":"Icons of Grief: Val Lewton's Home Front Pictures","review":"\\"Icons of Grief\\" is a fascinating critical study of producer Val Lewton's RKO horror films within a World War II context.

By providing new insights on Lewton and his work, Nemerov encourages the reader to seek out these remarkable films."},{"Title":"The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker Official Strategy Guide for GameCube","review":"I have bought lots of strategy guides over the years and I found this guide the most helpful.

Definitely recommended"},{"Title":"The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker Official Strategy Guide for GameCube","review":"Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker is not an easy game to write a strategy guide for, considering how very many tangents and extra features there are in the game. But this book succeeds pretty admirably, walking you throught the tough parts step-by-step. The charts that cover such things as where to find Heart Pieces and Treasure Maps are especially helpful. The only problem with the book is that in a few places, it directs you to use more difficult methods than necessary to accomplish tasks - for example, it might tell you to use water jars to cool off lava to make a footpath (hard to do and usually gets you burned a few times) when you can simply use your grappling hook to swing across the lava with no problem. But overall, this book is pretty much a must for anyone with a Zelda: Wind Waker game."},{"Title":"The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker Official Strategy Guide for GameCube","review":"I puchased this when I got stuck on zelda and it helped me allot it is very detailed and well explained and eaven has about 20+ pages on the orcarino of time I recomend this to everyone who's having a tough time I give brady games major props hey should'nt a guide that have 272 pages be helpfull you decide : )"},{"Title":"The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker Official Strategy Guide for GameCube","review":"The is amazing guide from Brady Games.

I do like the Nintendo Gallery listing of all characters etc., a fun side quest."},{"Title":"The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker Official Strategy Guide for GameCube","review":"As far as strategy guides go, it can be hit and miss. This one is definitely a hit right on the mark. Sometimes an author simply writes wall after wall of text and uses vague vocabulary and expects you to read every word in the guide as you go. That's not at all what you get here. Everything you need to go from the start to the end is written up, of course, but it's not so texty and confusing as most guides for a game this size. Also, the extensive checklists and mini-game rundown is essential. Not to mention the fold out sea chart which, at least for the first half of your game, is pretty much invaluable. The only thing I would add would be a good index. Otherwise everything about this guide is terrific. I've used it many times just for the map and item information. Of course, this is not a hard game. But it IS huge and going into it without some kind of guide would be pretty overwhelming. I can't compare this to any other publisher's guides to The Wind Waker, but there is nothing missing enough to ever bother with Nintendo or Prima's guides (they may well be really good guides, who knows?)Also worth noting: this has a brief but thorough walkthrough for Ocarina of Time (original quest). At the time the game was ported to Gamecube and given as a promo for those who pre-ordered The Wind Waker. I have never used that part of the book as I have OOT pretty well memorized thanks to Prima's 1998 guide.

If you didn't have the guide you would never find them all. In the end she thanked me for buying the guide. I must admit that even though the game looks some what childish the replay value and story line are pretty decent. It is very non threatening game with a lot of light hearted comedy. The world of the game is huge and there is a ton of stuff to do and see. In other words the guide is a must have because it takes you step by step through the game and points out tons of stuff you probably missed the first time through the game."},{"Title":"The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker Official Strategy Guide for GameCube","review":"Great strategy guide.

I most certainly would not buy this guide again and am actually toying with the thought to get another. I have bought many game guides over the years and this one suites my style the least in the way everything is structured and laid-out. In some areas is too much text to get to the hint needed but in the process I learn plenty things I rather had figured out myself.

Another Legend of Zelda has hit top grade and flew over the disappointing Majora's Mask. The game is quite easy, but having a guide for an adventure game isn't much so of an adventure. I love the game. I also appreciate that they made this guide, but i don't think too much of it."},{"Title":"The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker Official Strategy Guide for GameCube","review":"I agree with the other reviewers; the whole point of the game is to beat it yourself, not to get a strategy guide to do it for you. I only got this because I like to have a list of the items and stuff, so I know what they do (all games are usually a little vague on items). Anyway, this strategy guide doesn't have any of that. It has some useless appendixes in the back, and that's about it. I wouldn't waste my money on this again, so unless you really want something that'll give you lots of maps and take your hand and walk you through the whole flaming game, then get this (by the way, BradyGames usually comes out with some of the worst strategy guides, so this might not be a good idea anyway)."},{"Title":"The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker Official Strategy Guide for GameCube","review":"there is no need to waste money on books like this, unless you enjoy collecting them for some reason. all the walkthrough information you could ever want is easily found on the web at a multitude of different locations."},{"Title":"The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker Official Strategy Guide for GameCube","review":"This strategy guide is excellent. The Legend of Zelda series has a tradition of complex puzzles and hidden items that are enough to drive even the most ardent fan batty while trying to play the game to the end. I long ago decided that I would rather be able to enjoy the game I spent my hard-earned money on than to curse it and its designers for my lack of insight. This guide is especially helpful with the side quests, although I might have asked for dungeon maps that weren't quite as confusing. As a bonus, you also get a complete walkthrough of the bonus Ocarina of Time: Master Quest disc. All in all, a great guide for a superb game. Well done!"},{"Title":"The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker Official Strategy Guide for GameCube","review":"I don't use a lot of strategy guides, so my opinion might reflect my limited experience. But when we (my son and I) couldn't figure out what to do next or remember what we had already done in the WindWaker game, I decided to get the strategy guide. This guide is very well laid out and gives you needed information without spoiling the game for you. Half the fun of a Zelda game is the storyline, and this guide does not give away important plot development. Though I was able to find important items located on each island without having to return to the location over and over again. (And it does take a while to sail around the world in that little boat!) I found the guide well thought-out and an invaluable aid in my 'virtual' quest.Another person commented about the lack of info on the Nintendo Gallery. I must agree about that. Though I have found (in my 4th play-through) that trying to get all those photos is a huge and fun challenge. This is just an added feature to give the game replay value. If you are dead bent on getting the details on the Nintendo Gallery, do a search online.Overall, I would highly recommend this particular strategy guide."},{"Title":"The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker Official Strategy Guide for GameCube","review":"I can't imaging being able to complete this or other Zelda games (Ocarina, Majora's Mask) without some sort of reference guide like this. The nuances and sidequests would just be wayyyy too much for the average Joe to figure out without some help.That said, while there are more &quot;hints&quot; built in to Windwaker, the guidebook is a great reference in finding hard-to-find items such as heart pieces, treasure, etc. It also has a pull-out map of the great sea with all of the islands and what can or cannot be found on all of them. This, in addition to the standard walk-through make the guide a great value. Throw in the walk-through for Ocarina of Time (for those who bought the Windwaker/Ocarina Master Quest set) and it's amazing it didn't cost more.Well worth the investment if you just HAVE to have every single item in the game. :)"},{"Title":"The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker Official Strategy Guide for GameCube","review":"Now, like most people, I wanted to get Prima's strategy guide. But after I read the reviews about it, I heard it just gives away the whole story. So I went with this one. It's great. I mean there are some things that may be hard to understand what it's talking about but it's relatively easy to find out matching the pictures with the area you need to go to. Also, this book tells you the items and enemies you will find before every temple. Personally, I don't care that it tells me what I should be looking for. I just don't want to hear the whole story before I'm going to later. So I highly recommend that you get this strategy guide."},{"Title":"The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker Official Strategy Guide for GameCube","review":"A commercial guide is used to help the player get through a game with minimal effort and meant as a time saving effort. It has to enhance the player's experience by giving clear, concise maps, listings of items, weapons, enemies, as well as divulge secrets hard to find on your own.Doug Walsh suceeded in most criteria. In his walkthrough, he assists the player by placing accurate maps, marks the rooms, item locations and gives boss strategies. The sidequests section is equally choke full of useful strategies. A section by section of WW's 49 sections are given-a pull out 2-sided poster helps in your task of exploring the world of WW. In these, he has done an excellent job.However, the Nintendo Gallery collection, easily the most daunting task faced by any Zelda fan, is not covered fully by him. There IS a complete listing of all the figures, but he does not tell you how to get their picture for ALL figures. To give credit, he did highlight the importance of taking Tetra's picture but the information about several key personal in Wind Waker being obtainable only in the second playthrough is WRONG. I managed to get all of them in the first playthrough. You can purchase them from Lenzo-no need to wait till your second walkthrough. Lenzo will offer you a Legendary Pictograph during different moon phrases-so just keepy playing the Song of Passing until you get them all. Information on hard to find NPCs and timing to take their pictures are also MIA. Some NPCs will never face you in the face-so how are you going to get that 'full frontal shot' as required?

This theodicy is essential for defending the Christian faith and theism.Merton Lee highlights that God is all-knowing, all-good and all-powerful. His Omniscience (Supreme Wisdom) and Omnipotence (Supreme Power) are infinite. They do not need to be supplemented by the existence of the visible world and human beings.But God is also the divine timeless Dimension. In the timeless non-manifest Dimension, God does not have the opportunity to experience the dynamic moral experiences which require the interactions of individual embodied beings in a visible world where they can make moral decisions and perform morally good deeds. Thus, God's purity and moral excellence are non-dynamic in the timeless dimension. This is God's natural ontological attribute and not a shortcoming.Thus God decided to create this visible world and individuate His cosmic consciousness into small units and live in each human being to undergo trials, suffering and spiritual cultivation. This is to enable God to experience and acquire dynamic moral goodness and excellence in the visible world."},{"Title":"The problem of pain","review":"c.s. lewis answers some of the hardest/most troubling questions of life herein.I would recommend for anyone dealing with lose or hardship (which of course is universal and unavoidable)"},{"Title":"The problem of pain","review":"A virtual classic.

Lewis is one of the top two Christian authors of the last two hundred years (the other is Francis Schaeffer). His book, Mere Christianity, is perhaps the leading classic book stating the case for the Gospel of Jesus Christ, and what it means to those who believe and sincerely invite the living Christ into their hearts. In the Problem of Pain, this great author, inspired by the Holy Spirit, tackles the question which has caused doubt among Believers, and is used by opponents of the Gospel to argue against its truth and credibility. Why do apparently &#34;good&#34; people get cancer, are victims of horribly violent crimes, and suffer from all kinds of other tragedy? How could a good and loving God allow the Holocaust to occur to his &#34;chosen people&#34;? How could God allow babies or infants to die before old enough to commit conscious sin, or even make an intelligent decision to believe in Christ as one's personal Lord and Savior? This book, with Lewis' prose and profound writing, explains the answers to these questions in a logical fashion, but one which will resonate with your heart and the Holy Spirit who dwells in all Believers. It is too profound and inspired of God to review. But in the opinion of this avid reader and Christian, Jewish lawyer, The Problem of Pain represents the finest work on this difficult topic. It is deep as C.S. Lewis is not a sports writer (and I love sports). But if you allow yourself to fully immerse yourself in the depths of this God inspired, great book, you will draw closer to God, and at least have some ability to understand one of life's great mysteries."},{"Title":"The problem of pain","review":"Lewis at his best, tackling the issue of pain and Christianity and why the two must co-exist.

Lewis writes clearly but sometimes I have to reread portions because he is better educated and speaks a bit above me. He is well worth the time invested in rereading.Thank you,Sals"},{"Title":"The problem of pain","review":"The question or 'problem' that C.S. Lewis sets out to answer in \\"The Problem of Pain\\" is one that has confounded believers and non-believers alike: if God is good and loves his creation, why does he allow such pain and suffering to exist? How can that be good and exist within his creation? While Lewis' ponderings may not seem like straightforward answers to those questions, he paints a picture of a God revealed through his creation where even pain and evil can exist.C.S. Lewis is perhaps the best person to examine this topic: a former atheist, he commences the book by speaking of what his former answer to that question would've been. It is only through his eventual conversion to a belief in Christ that he is able to see the order behind the seeming chaos. Lewis examines an array of issues, covering commonalities between religions but what sets Christianity apart, the Fall of Man, and why Heaven and Hell must exist. Moreover, he examines the distinct individuality that plays a role in our relation to our Creator.Lewis' prose has the contradiction of being both dense and enlightening. His examinations are not necessarily for the ordinary reader, nor are they too lofty either, but they require a great deal of thoght and reflection. Therefore, \\"The Problem of Pain\\" is best read perhaps a chapter at a time, allowing the reader to meditate on what has been presented. The ultimate irony of human suffering might be that as believers, we have had every opportunity to not experience suffering, since Christ has already suffered supreme - but because of how God created us, we have the will to choose, no matter what that choice might be."},{"Title":"The problem of pain","review":"Punctuated with a thin veil of lyricism and argued from a Christian perspective, C. S. Lewis' book does not only explore the psychological ramifications of suffering in our lives. It also provides an intellectual discussion that aims at reconciling theological tenets concerning the role of God's love in human sorrow. Written many years before his beloved wife's death, the book is far from offering merely theoretical comments on suffering. In fact, it addresses common misconceptions about happiness and love, still within the parameters of deep empathy for the human condition in a world plagued with grief."},{"Title":"The problem of pain","review":"Lewis believed we should try to enter into the meaning, the intent of the authors we read, instead of bringing our own biases and immediately subjecting them to our own categories of thought. We cannot help but enrich our minds if \\"in reading great literature I become a thousand men and yet remain myself.\\" Therefore, if you've stumbled upon this book for whatever reason and feel inclined to read it then I'd urge -- pay no attention to the humbug critics, at least until after you've read what could be a life enriching book, as this was for me.Ten years ago I began reading Lewis; the Problem of Pain was one of the first of his works, after Mere Christianity, I picked up. It wasn't long after I read PoP that I was watching Schindler's List. Scene by scene, the dilemma of evil in the face of a good God assaulted me till I was overcome with intense and sickening violence. I ended up falling to the ground, in anguish, crying \\"how\\"? I received no blinding insight, I'm sorry to say, into the mystery of evil; but Lewis' logic had infected me, and suddenly an argument took hold of my mind, checked my despair, and gave me something to hold onto (incidentally, those critics who, in reading Lewis have immediately subjected him to their atheist framework have a-priori cut themselves off from understanding the ultimate logic of their own position - or they just don't care, which is far worse).The argument, in so many words, ran something like this: the proposition that God doesn't exist amounts, at the same time, to the proposition that all this anguish at the injustice unfolding before me on my TV screen is not rooted in reality, that it's all a purely subjective illusion, which reflects no eternal value, goodness or justice, and, logically, could just as well be delight and approval. In other words, the extent I thought evil truly evil and wrong - that was the extent to which I had to believe in a good God; to deny Him would be, at the same time, a denial of the reality of evil, which was driving me to deny Him in the first place. I simply refused to concede that the Nazis, slaughtering Jews, were no more morally culpable than if they were involuntarily swatting mosquitoes.Many people are keen to respond something along these lines, \\"well, I personally feel this or that is wrong,\\" and seriously think they've resolved the matter. However, this \\"line\\" has a shocking corollary, which runs thusly: \\"...but it is not really wrong\\". In it's blunt, down to earth form, and applied to my experience above, it looks like this: \\"I feel the Nazi's were wrong, but I cannot speak for them and say they were wrong, because they were not REALLY wrong.\\" When the mind reflects objective reality it has truth; if my mind isn't reflecting the eternal reality of value, goodness, and justice, then my gut reactions and intense emotions are a response to nothing in reality, to no quality innate to human beings, which categorically warrants such a reaction - they're a fictional response, a response to a pretended reality. We all know, deep down inside, that this cannot be true, and that evil really exists because there's an eternal standard of goodness (God) by which to identify evil as evil...Read this book - make your own judgments..."},{"Title":"The problem of pain","review":"This book is a theological and logical argument why God can be all loving and yet there can be such awful pain in the world. The initial argument that \\"If God is loving and there is evil in the world implies that something is wrong with God\\", is methodically and logically taken apart. There are arguments for the Christian about how they should live given this logical argument, but the non believer or searcher can take the arguments and come to a very balanced view of God Almighty."},{"Title":"The problem of pain","review":"the problem of pain is classic lewis: an inimitable combination of deep philosophical thought, razor-sharp wit, the ability to poke fun at himself and a heart that is truly amazed by his God.his premise is not to make pain or suffering any less distasteful, but to show that back of it all is the love of God. the book can really be broken into three sections. 1) the divine heart 2) human suffering 3) speculative ponderings.the first section (ch. 1-3) gives the basis for all of lewis' further thoughts and arguments: the ultimate goodness and omnipotence of God. this section defines what true goodness and benefit are in the light God's being. lewis shows that our common conceptions of \\"happiness\\" and \\"what is good\\" may be less accurate than we think. he distinguishes true kindness from what may be called mere pity.some highlights from the first couple chapters:-\\"love is something more stern and splendid than mere kindness\\" - the idea in context being that God loves us too much to simply give us everything we think we want. (anyone with children ought to be able to understand the truth of that statement).- \\"try to exclude the possibility of suffering which the order of nature and the existence of free will involve, and you find that you have excluded life itself.\\"- \\"the election of man, from nonentity, to be the beloved of God, and therefore (in some sense) the needed and desired of God, who but for that act needs and desires nothing, since He eternally has, ans is, all goodness.\\"the second section (ch. 4-7) is about the actual suffering of humans and how that plays out against divine goodness. lewis discusses the fall of adam with a lot of poetic license and conjecture on the way things were before the fall... can't be taken as fact, but some very provocative ideas. also there is a fascinating discussion on the humility of God in receiving us even when we come to Him only as a last resort; He will have us on any terms.here are a handful of quotes from this section:- \\"all sadness which is not either arising from the repentance of a concrete sin and hastening towards concrete amendment or restitution, or else arising from pity and hastening to active assistance, is simply bad.\\"- \\"the proper good of a creature is to surrender itself to its Creator - to enact intellectually, volitionally, and emotionally, that relationship which is given in the mere fact of its being a creature. when it does so, it is good and happy.\\"- \\"God whispers to us in our pleasures, speaks in our conscience, but shouts in our pain: it is His megaphone to rouse a deaf world.\\"- \\"the human spirit will not even begin to try to surrender self-will as long as all seems to be well with it.\\"the third section (ch. 8-10) is very speculative, as all the chapters concern things which no human living on earth has had actual experience of: heaven, hell, and pain in animals. lewis' thoughts on hell are excellent, revolving around the idea that if the fulfillment of our humanity is in submitting to our Creator, then entering hell is ceasing to be human, but continuing existence in some more wretched state. the thoughts on heaven are equally as fascinating. the chapter on animal pain is a unique discussion in Christian theology (i can't remember ever hearing someone talk about it as a theological issue). there are also, albeit highly speculative, great possibilities suggested for what animal pain can and can't mean. also the thesis of humans \\"transforming\\" animals in a way vaguely similar to how God transforms man will at least set your gray matter in motion. however, where lewis really falls short in this section is his upholding of \\"theistic evolution\\". sadly, lewis believed that God used evolution to create the world and the species. this belief, however, skews the whole understanding of goodness and pain. if pain was part of God's creative process, it is not an evil or a temporary necessity in a fallen world, but rather death is a manifestation of the divine being, part of God's essential nature: clearly a problem for all the rest of the ideas in the book.some excerpts from section 3:- \\"to enter heaven is to become more human than you ever succeeded in being on earth; to enter hell, is to be banished from humanity.\\"- \\"the demand that God should forgive such a [wicked] man while he remains what he is, is based on a confusion between condoning and forgiving. to condone and evil is simply to ignore it, to treat it as if it were good.\\"-\\"there are rewards that do not sully motives. a man's love for a woman is not mercenary because he wants to marry her, nor his love for poetry mercenary because he wants to read it, nor his love of exercise, less disinterested because he wants to run and leap and walk. love by definition, seeks to enjoy its object.\\"aside from the theistic evolution, a wonderful book. lot's of food for thought. chew away!"},{"Title":"The problem of pain","review":"It says something that after so many years C. S. Lewis is still one of the foremost Christian apologists of our time. The Problem of Pain is a difficult question every religion has to deal with, and one which has been especially difficult for Christianity. Some religions have the luxury of explaining pain as something deserved - a result of bad behavior from a previous life, or perhaps pain and suffering are caused by a malevolent deity in opposition to a good and loving God. Christianity has no such option.\\"If God were good, he would wish to make His creatures perfectly happy, and if God were almighty He would be able to do what He wished. But the creatures are not happy. Therefore God lacks either goodness, or power, or both.\\"Lewis presents a very readable and widely accessible solution to this problem, covering the origins of human suffering, incurred in the fall, what divine omnipotence and goodness really mean, and why they allow for the existence of pain in creation, heaven and hell, and a topic not often treated but important - the existence of pain in animals who are in every sense innocent.Particularly useful is Lewis' distinction between kindness and love. Lewis reminds us that real love, a love that looks out for the best interests of the beloved, sometimes requires the inflicting of painful experience. From the perspective of the one undergoing the experience, this may not seem like love, but any parent, teacher, or anyone tasked with the guidance of the young will understand that this sort of \\"tough love\\" is often necessary if one does not want a spoiled child to grow into a spoiled adult."},{"Title":"The problem of pain","review":"First Reading-What is truly amazing is the timeless nature of C.S. Lewis' work. The Problem of Pain was written decades ago yet is still just as pertinent as the day it was written. The Problem of Pain, not unlike Mere Christianity, reveals concepts that are not always the easiest to wrap one's mind around in such a light as to allow the reader to feel as if they have been studying the issue for years. With a little help from some poignant imagery, Lewis manages to depict unfathomable concepts in a very human manner. It is with his literary gift that C.S. Lewis, once again, passes on a glimpse of deeper understanding to the laypeople of the world.The Problem of Pain is written about exactly what the title suggests. How could a loving and merciful God allow so much pain to occur in a world that He created? This, of course, is not an unfamiliar topic of debate for Christians and atheists alike. It appears that Lewis realized the popularity of this question and, as such, touched on questions that are raised from both sides of the fence. As exquisitely as Lewis transfers his logical reasoning onto paper he still, throughout the book, maintains his humble demeanor by giving credit to what, he considers, true theologians.I have seen it written that this book is only relevant to Christian believers, yet as a recent convert, I would have to disagree. While it would certainly provide some bearing to have done some reading on similar topics before reading The Problem of Pain, the manner in which Lewis vividly explains his thoughts creates relevance for any reader who has ever wondered why pain exists and if there is a God, what sort of being would establish such a thing. In my opinion, Lewis has created another beautiful masterpiece in The Problem of Pain and has provided me with, at least, a general idea to answer one of the hardest questions I have ever asked. This book is a must for any Christian and just might offer some insight for those who have not quite made up their minds yet.Second Reading-The Problem of Pain is one of Lewis' several timeless contributions to Christian apologetics. With regard to the problem of pain in the context of Christian theology, it would be difficult to find a work that approaches the apparent issue with such precision and efficiency. Lewis presents popular questions while offering situational examples for clarity's sake and follows with accurate explanations based upon Christian doctrine. To leave few questions in the reader's mind, Lewis also offers his opinion about animal suffering; although he states within this work and in others that presenting such a question is a distraction from the truth that has been provided and can be known about human suffering. In its entirety, The Problem of Pain clarifies how and why pain and suffering is not a problem that should in any way hamper one's faith while outlining where and how Christian doctrine presents why suffering is a perceivable reality.The Problem of Pain certainly pertains to its title by tackling the issue head on. Within this work, however, Lewis also decided to dedicate the final chapter to what he believed to be a glimpse of heaven. After presenting his standard disclaimer about his lack of authority on the matter, Lewis justifies the inclusion of this chapter on the grounds that its exclusion would result in the absence of one half of the whole account. This chapter seems to disrupt the established flow, almost to the point of being out of place. Nonetheless, in this short and perhaps unnecessary chapter Lewis might have most clearly conveyed the message he dedicated an entire book to withThe Great Divorce, focused on as a key concept inSurprised by Joy: The Shape of My Early Life, and mentioned in many other works. As is the case so often in Lewis' writings, it was when he asked the reader for and granted himself permission to speak freely that he presented the concepts that were abstract even in his own mind with the greatest clarity. The Problem of Pain is worth the effort if one struggles with similar questions. However, even if one has little interest in the seemingly problematic nature of pain in Creation, the last chapter alone is worth the purchase price."},{"Title":"The problem of pain","review":"Reading anything by C.S. Lewis is an uplifting experience because it gives one a chance to witness a great intellect at work. In this book he explains why there is pain in the world in spite of a loving and all-powerful God. C.S. Lewis can be very helpful to anyone who is seriously seeking Christ and answers to some of the biggest questions."},{"Title":"The problem of pain","review":"Hello,I am searching for answers for my grief. I bought The Problem of Pain and a grief workbook, Write from Your Heart, A Healing Grief Journal,that is helping work my way through this difficult time. In the journal I have the opportunity create a memory book while at the same time I am working through my grief using the daily prompts, Bible verses, and quotes.It is helping."},{"Title":"The problem of pain","review":"Lewis' work audaciously attempts to conquer the issues surrounding the most touchy subject of pain. His boldness pays off, as he presents a clear view of the place of pain with respect to God and man.The greatest strength in this work is the fact that it addresses the place of pain with respect to God first. It discusses those attributes of God such as goodness and omnipotence in such a way that they are ultimately related to the question of the nature and end of pain. This foundation provides a stable foundation for considering the fall and turnaround of redemption with respect to pain in the world and its relationship to Heaven and Hell.Lewis is well versed in philosophy and theology and presents his considerations in an accessible but also academic fashion. While I have a few qualms about some of his conclusions, they are not enough to utterly \\"rock the boat\\" and tip his arguments overboard. There are a few minor points with respect to the character of man as a relational being and the implications thereof for the subject at hand. Nonetheless, I highly suggest this text."},{"Title":"The problem of pain","review":"Lewis here takes on the knotty question of the role of pain and evil in the world for a Christian. I am a former Christian and an atheist. I had heard Lewis was the best Christian apologist there is. If these arguments are the best Christianity can come up with, atheism doesn't have much to worry about.Lewis seems to think that the universal human sense of guilt when one has done something wrong is evidence of God. I disagree. I don't see any reason why evolution could not produce human beings having a sense of right and wrong. To some extent, a sense of right and wrong is a necessity for social animals. Chimpanzees complain when something they have worked to get is stolen from them. Wolves reject another wolf from the pack if he doesn't behave as a wolf should. Why would human beings be different?Lewis has a reputation for being a logician. In my opinion, much of his \\"logic\\" is absurd. For example, Lewis spends a lot of time on how God can be omnipotent and omnibenevolent. After all, how can a merciful God love all his children but send some of them to Hell? Why is there so much pointless suffering? Fortunately for me, atheism doesn't have to twist itself into knots over questions like this. After all, if pain is simply an evolved signal which proved useful to our ancestors, there's no particular reason why there shouldn't be a lot of it around. We can spend our time thinking about the best way to arrange our society to keep pain to the minimum necessary, not worrying about why pain exists in the first place. Atheism has intellectual coherence in this respect which is totally lacking in Christianity. What evidence is there that God is really omniscient or omnipotent or omnibenevolent, anyway? Just because someone said so thousands of years ago? I sometimes get the feeling that Christians choose paradoxical terms to describe God to make him as difficult to understand as possible. I suppose this makes God seem grander.Lewis also gives a lot of attention to the question of whether animals are immortal. Lewis thinks animal pain is quite different in quality from human pain, since he believes animals lack souls. Lewis discusses the question of what people will do in Heaven, why it is so wonderful there, and what makes Hell so awful. Honestly, I know of no better evidence for atheism than the need for serious Christians to consider the sorts of absurd questions Lewis discusses here. Lewis tries his best to come up with sensible answers, without much success.Lewis wants Christianity judged by its fruits. If Christianity really worked to make bad people good and good people better, I would be the first to sign up. If Christianity was an effective way to relieve poverty and bring peace, I would definitely consider it. If Christianity were just a silly hobby that made people feel good and harmed no one, it wouldn't bother me. Unfortunately, that isn't what I see. Even when in power, Christianity has made little or no progress in solving the social problems that it deals with, such as poverty and violence. Christianity systematically ignores the most serious problems of our times: overpopulation, exhaustion of resources, and pollution, among others. Why does Christianity ignore these problems? Because they receive little or no attention in the Bible, a book written thousands of years ago.As far as the book \\"The Problem of Pain\\" itself, Lewis is a fine writer who is never boring. For that reason I give the book two stars. If you're interested in basic Christian doctrine on some thorny theological subjects, this is a good introduction. Before taking it too seriously, however, I would strongly recommend reading other points of view. As far as the major problems of our times, I would suggest Kunstler's \\"The Long Emergency.\\" For a defense of atheism and the naturalistic worldview,I would suggest Carl Sagan's \\"The Demon-Haunted World\\" or Taner Edis' \\"The Ghost in the Universe.\\"I read \\"The Problem of Pain\\" because I feel as a scientist that it is important not to simply dismiss religion as silly, but to give Christians their chance to convince me. If you're a Christian, are you willing to do the same for the other side?"},{"Title":"The problem of pain","review":"If you are suffering from chronic disease and want some theory why a good God would allow such a thing, you will be greatly disappointed in this book. Mostly, there is only intellectual gobbledygook here; at no time does Lewis address this important issue. To the contrary, he spends all his time dancing around it and bogging himself down in meaningless, often totally unrelated or incredibly superficial issues. For example: he spends a few pages talking about the simple and useful reflex-type pain, but he later apologizes for it, because it is obvious, even to the author, that no picks up a Christian book to read about that. He also goes into much detail about his unique, metaphysical view of \\"Adam and Eve.\\" Likewise, his metaphysical view of Jesus Christ. His closest approach to the issue of chronic pain is a rather weak reference to the Devil.I am not an atheist, but this book is mistitled. Not only did he not answer my existential question, he made no attempt whatsoever.What a letdown! He could have said \\"Christ wore a crown of thorns\\", but he did not. He could have spoke more about the cross and how it makes Christianity unique, but he did not.Instead, there was a short appendix that he did not even reference or seem to write. Probably, it was added by the embarrassed publisher. As I recall, it had some doctor saying old ladies with rheumatoid arthritis are happier than those without it. Personally, I find this to be incredibly specious.This is not a fable, or a layman's book. The title here is the \\"Problem of Pain.\\" Any rational being would expect a direct discussion on that subject. This book is less Christianity or religion than it is meaningless intellectualism. Eclectic opinions on unimportant matters that he put together because he thought they were too cute by half and wanted to use big words that he had learned specifically to impress people. It has about as much value as intellectualism in any field. Architecture or fashion, for instance. Basically, I would call it pure dreck.DO NOT PICK UP THIS BOOK, if you are a young person with an autoimmune disease that no one else can see and makes everyone think that you are lazy BECAUSE you will not find your answer here. IF YOU DO READ IT, you will only suffer more because you will be bored to tears."},{"Title":"The problem of pain","review":"C.S. Lewis makes many insightful points, but his Arminian (vs. Calvinistic) views distort his presentation at times. For example, he suggests that it isn't God's \\"fault\\" that pain and suffering entered the world, i.e. God's sovereign will was thwarted by man. When of course Calvinists like myself argue that it's the Biblical view that our all powerful and sovereign God foreordains all things as the prophet Isaiah says. But overall, it was a worthwhile read."},{"Title":"The problem of pain","review":"The problem of pain is an enormous one that can lead directly to atheism. Jack Lewis tries to give a theological answer and succeeds within his own frame of reference. But he depends on the doctrine of the Fall and this is not one easily accepted by a modern audience.Those looking for a rational explanation that squares with history and science will not find it here. Unknown in the US, I would suggest Peter Vardy's 'The Puzzle of Evil' for an introduction and part answer to the problem."},{"Title":"The problem of pain","review":"The Problem of Pain was good in some areas and not so good in others. C.S. Lewis makes quite a few assumptions without any Biblical basis. Some of the things he mentions make completely no sense. Here's a quote; &quot;Our Lord while stressing terror of hell with unsparing severity, usually emphasises the idea, not the duration but of finality. Consignment to the destroying fire is usually treated as the end of the story - not the beginning of a new story. That the lost soul is eternally fixed in its diabolical attitude we cannnot doubt: but whether this eternal fixity implies endless duration-or duration at all we cannot say.&quot; What exactlly is he suggesting? That those in hell will not suffer eternally? Revelations 14:11 says &quot;The smoke of their torment rises forever and ever, and they will have no relief day or night for they have worshipped the beast...&quot; Aside from this there are many other things he says which make no sense. Yes, he does make some good points, but not many. I guess this is to be expected considering his apologetics are about 60 years old. I highly respect C.S. Lewis and he was definitely one of the geniuses of his time. Sadly since there is such a lack in good Christian apologetics these days with a few exceptions; we are left with only the long and gone apologetics of C.S. Lewis and Francis Schaffer. More recent apologetics would be Hugh Ross, William Dembski, and Michael Behe, who are very underappreciated for there hard work. C.S. Lewis wrote very good fiction which can still be highly appreciated by today's society. I'm not saying his apologetics are terrible; not at all. Merely that they are old and a lot of the theory's can be easily debunked. If you love to read, then I'm sure his work is well worth your time. If your merely looking for answers to certain problems; I would suggest something a bit more recent, or maybe searching for the answer yourself."},{"Title":"The problem of pain","review":"The book may be of interest to a devout Christian. But if you are looking for logic and sense that would stand an objective and independent test, look elsewhere. That's why the 3 star rating. It would have been an excellent reading and a 5 star for a religious person, and a 0 for anybody with a critical mind (or from a non-Christian background)."},{"Title":"The problem of pain","review":"I just want to say first, that I hate people that just hop on and write bad reviews for things that they haven't even read because they disagree with the stance. I have actually been reading this book. I'm trying really hard to finish it, but it's just so badly written.I had been referred to this book often enough that I felt like I really needed to read it. I was actually excited since it was supposed to \\"answer\\" my questions about the topic of the book. A blog I've been following, @ [...]we've been reading the bible together chapter by chapter. He had also suggested this book as a book for his book club. I thought it was a great idea. [...]A few chapters in, I am having trouble finishing it. He asserts a lot of stuff without justifying it, sometimes pulling stuff out of nowhere. The reviewer that said that it's not for \\"non Christians\\" should have added, also not for anyone with any knowledge of logic. I've never seen so many logical fallacies jam packed into so few pages. I welcome anyone to come and join the discussion. Maybe someone can clarify a lot of the problems we've been having.It's obvious that CS Lewis really believes what he is writing. It's different than some other apologetics books that still spout the same old arguments like the cosmological argument, and can't possibly pretend like they've never read the rebuttals. A lot of the arguments have already been shredded."},{"Title":"The problem of pain","review":"\\"The Problem of Pain,\\" by C.S. Lewis, is a non-fiction work that looks at the title phenomenon in a Christian theological context. The chapters in the book look at human pain, animal pain, divine omnipotence, human wickedness, and other theological/philosophical concepts.I found \\"Problem\\" to be a curious book. Some parts are well-written and thought-provoking, some parts are dull. Some parts just seem self-indulgent and even silly; at its worst the book reads like an eggheaded parody of theology. The chapter on hell is particularly unsatisfying; I found it to sound patronizing and frustratingly vague at times. But the book as a whole is thankfully enlivened by delightful flashes of wit.Theologically, Lewis seems to be at odds with strict biblical literalism; in chapter 5 he appears to endorse the idea of biological evolution, for example. Despite my reservations, I feel that this is a worthwhile book for both Christians and those of other belief traditions."},{"Title":"The problem of pain","review":"Lewis spends much time discussing the redemptive role of pain; problems of goodness, free will, and evil; and hell. He even includes a chapter on the suffering of animals. There is, however, no chapter on the suffering of children. Typical of Christian apologists, Lewis focuses on why God would create rational creatures capable of evil and allow them, and others affected by them, to suffer from the consequences of their evil choices. The problem he ignores is why his God, supposedly without whom nothing could exist, underwrites, for example, the very being of the cancer cells that ravage the body of a child. Such an omission renders the book useless.[Update: As an aftereffect of replying to comments on the original review, I'd like to make the following clarification: Lewis would seem to deal with the issue of why moral innocents suffer by declaring that there are no moral innocents, in that even children daily commit a sin due to their \\"choosing\\" of self over God. Only an apologist desperate to pull together the incompatible strands of his theology could claim that infants are capable of making that sort of freely willed moral choice.]"},{"Title":"The problem of pain","review":"CS Lewis is held by many to be the premier Christian apologist of the 20th century. Unless one is morbidly naive, or has yet to encounter the counterarguments to Christianity in particular and theism in general, I honestly cannot see where his appeal lies.The Problem of Evil is an insurmountable one for Christians (and all other theists who believe in a perfectly loving, all-powerful and all-knowing god). There have been intense and motivated efforts over the past two millennia to defend such a position rationally, and they have all failed. Miserably. Utterly. And in many cases, dishonestly.Some approached involve invoking an unknown \\"greater good\\" defense (which throws god's omnipotence under the bus. An omnipotent deity could simply actualise a desired goal without needing to use suffering as a \\"middle man\\"). Attempts to shift the problem by asserting that human happiness is not the goal of life (but knowing god is) removes the omnibenevolence and omnipotence of god (if you love someone, you don't want them to suffer. It really is that simple). On page 104, Lewis concedes that not everyone suffers equally. He does not give a reason for this, and indeed, admits that our puny human minds cannot understand why god would allow some to live decades in comfort and luxury while others suffer for months or years on end. To quote Lewis himself: \\"The causes of this distribution I do not know; but from our present point of view it ought to be clear that the real problem is not why some humble, pious, believing people suffer, but why some do NOT (emphasis Lewis', in italics). Our Lord Himself, it will be remembered, explained the salvation of those who are fortunate in this world only by referring to the unsearchable omnipotence of God.\\"That's not an explanation. Lewis is falling back on the ancient and ubiquitous appeal to ignorance. God's mysterious ways are beyond us. Well, by that \\"logic,\\" he could send all Christians to hell and everyone else to heaven, and Lewis, by his own admission, would just have to suck up an eternity of torture.The old canard of free will is often invoked. Unfortunately, free will is meaningless unless everyone has an equal amount of it. This is undeniably NOT the case. Not everyone is given the same lifespan, physical strength, mental acuity, political clout, financial resources, and so on. Lewis is pontificating from the luxurious confines of his residence, funded by conveniently gullible sheep. This has certainly damaged his ability to empathise with the billions who live on less than a dollar each day. And the thousands who starve to death every time the Earth completes a full rotation.Lewis also, perhaps unwittingly, advocates a social Darwinism in which the rich and physically powerful are able to murder, rape and steal from weaker individuals (and are therefore less able to exercise their own free will to prevent their own suffering). Lewis worships a cosmic pedophile who revels in granting freedom to abhorrent individuals while getting his jollies from seeing the most vulnerable suffer and die in agony (only to get thrown into even more torture in the Christian vision of hell).Lastly, a loving god would take away free will from those who would willingly surrender it in return for a life without suffering. Funnily enough, Lewis seems to believe in a heaven without suffering but with all the bells and whistles of freedom. So why not create that universe from the get-go and stick with it? Why create a universe with even the possibility of corruption? It certainly is not something a perfect god would do. Then again, a perfect god would not blackmail beings he supposedly loves for eternal worship.While Lewis is usually a good writer, capable of spinning yarns to attract the attention of children and young teenagers, he also assumes that there is a deep, overriding purpose behind suffering. This purpose is so important that it is more critical to his god to NOT end suffering now, but to let things run their \\"natural\\" course until his plan is complete. In service of this goal, he creates a short story that is akin to an essay on theistic evolution, and how man is ultimately responsible for the Fall and his own corruption. If god knows everything, including the future, then he orchestrated the fall (and everything else) before setting his plan into motion. Arguing that god exists outside of time is a lazy copout, nothing more.As a 'loudspeaker' for the Christian god, pain has done more to drive people away from him than anything else. An all-knowing, all-powerful and all-good god would not allow any suffering, even in the service of a so-called \\"greater good.\\" And if such a god desires suffering for a greater good, then it would follow logically that his followers should cause suffering to convert more people. After all, that is god's best tool for getting our attention, is it not? Fortunately, CS Lewis and most Christians today do not follow this logic to its end point. Those who do open hospitals and hospices and waste money on bibles rather than food (explaining why only 25% of tithes go to benefit indigent people around the world).God's Problem: How the Bible Fails to Answer Our Most Important Question--Why We Suffer"},{"Title":"The problem of pain","review":"CS Lewis was a master at making complicated theological questions make sense. In this short work, he tackles what is perhaps one of his most difficult subjects yet. Why does pain exist? If there is a God, and he is benevolent, why does he allow his creatures to feel both physical and mental anguish? The answer, as Lewis sees it, is simple, though the explanation for it may not be. Because he loves us.In this book, Lewis shows how God molds us through our afflictions, and how he actually works toward our greater good by allowing us to experience pain and misfortune, that we may be more willing to give of our own free will back to him. It is through pain, says Lewis, that God can guide us back to Heaven.Lewis continues the argument made in many others of his books: that no one goes to Heaven or Hell without choosing to. God guides us by allowing us to experience pain, but it is our choice whether we choose to submit to His will or not. And no one will go to Hell without having first refused the helping hand. As Lewis says, the gates of Hell will be locked from the inside.This is some of the simplest, yet most beautiful theology around, expounded by a man who's humility made him always refer to himself as a \`layman.' If you're a fan of other Lewis works, pick this one up--you won't be disappointed. And if you're just looking for some good Christian reading material, with great insight, then you won't want to miss CS Lewis's the Problem of Pain."},{"Title":"The problem of pain","review":"&quot;The Problem of Pain&quot; contains such extraordinary spiritual nourishment. Through the process of wrestling with the role of pain, Lewis gives a truly inspirational explanation of the interaction between God and humans (while also giving wonderfully realistic descriptions of most Christians' struggles!) That said, I would agree with reviewers who said that this book in *not* particularly comforting for those suffering from great grief (Lewis himself said much the same, late in his life.)This book has given me so much encouragement and, at the same time, challenged me greatly. I am a better Christian for having read it. My copy is underlined, often quoted, and much loved."},{"Title":"The problem of pain","review":"C.S. Lewis offers a brilliant defense of Christian theism despite the pain in the world in this brief book. Combining sharp thinking and excellent prose, this book is highly recommended for Christians and non-Christians alike.Lewis's arguments are similar to many theodicies (defenses of God's existence despite suffering) developed by great Christian thinkers past and present. Man's suffering is in fact a result of free will, not an original creation of God. And suffering continues to result due to the evil wills and deeds of men. As Lewis observes, \\"When souls become wicked they will certainly use this possibility to hurt one another; and this, perhaps, accounts for four-fifths of the sufferings of men.\\" If men are to have any significant free will at all, the bad consequences of evil deeds must be allowed.This, of course, leaves the problem of so-called natural evil. Lewis contends that such evil and pain are necessary for our own repentance. In order to recognize our sins and ask God for forgiveness (and thus restore the proper relationship between created and Creator) we humans must be awoken with pain and suffering. Pain shatters the notion that what we have is ours and is good enough.The Problem of Pain, despite its brevity, covers a great deal of ground, including a defense of the doctrine of the fall and the doctrines of heaven and hell. All throughout, Lewis's writing style is accessible and convincing. For a powerful defense of Christian theism in the face of a cruel world, \\"The Problem of Pain\\" is highly recommended."},{"Title":"The problem of pain","review":"This beautiful little book is on a par with the author's well-known classic Mere Christianity, as it addresses many profound questions that those in search of truth must have grappled with. Lewis was not an academic theologian so he writes for the ordinary person, which makes his words easy to understand.The introduction deals with the 3 elements found in all developed religions: The experience of the Numinous (A sense of awe), the Sense of Morality, and the Numinous as the Guardian of Morality. Christianity contains a fourth element: A Redeemer who reconciles fallen mankind to the Righteous God.The chapter Divine Omnipotence places the problem in context: God's goodness against the problem of suffering. How can a loving God allow this? Here Lewis discusses the implications of free will and co-existence in a common medium or external world. The next chapter, Divine Goodness, deals with the nature of divine love. Love is sterner and more splendid than mere kindness. Simple happiness in the here and now is not what God has in mind. Love may cause pain but only in order to alter and improve the object of love.The chapter Human Wickedness looks at the state of the human psyche. Our character is, in its current state, not well. Lewis discusses our problems by examining a set of 8 very prevalent illusions. Following from this, The Fall Of Man investigates the abuse of free will while at the same time refuting Monism and Dualism. He suggests that the fall represented humanity's loss of status as a species, and that a new species had then willed itself into existence. But remedial or corrective good exists even in our present debased condition.The next two chapters deal with Human Pain. When souls become wicked they will use free will to harm one another. The human will becomes truly creative only when it aligns itself with the will of God. Christianity demands that we correct a misdirection of our nature. The author advances 6 propositions that are necessary to complete the understanding of human suffering.The chapter titled Hell addresses the seemingly cruel doctrine of hell. Pain mostly leads to redemption but may unfortunately also lead to unrepentant rebellion. This means that some individuals will ultimately prefer darkness to light. The author also discusses the apparent disproportion between eternal damnation and transitory sin, pointing out that some souls do not want to be forgiven.The chapter Animal Pain is speculation as Lewis admits, but such fascinating and plausible possibilities are presented here. If you love your pets and animals in general, be sure to read it! It will give you hope and peace of mind as to the mercy and justice of a righteous God.The chapter titled Heaven contains more speculation but of a most awesome, gripping and mind expanding nature. Lewis explores the idea of an eternal special relationship of each individual soul with the Divine Majesty, an eternal dance of joy in splendid diversity. This is not the unconscious nirvana of Pantheism but a condition of maximum distinctiveness of the individual in a higher form reunited with God.The Appendix is a note on the observed effects of mental and physical pain, supplied by R Havard, MD, from clinical experience. The Problem Of Pain is filled with compassion and illuminating insight. It is highly instructive and edifying, making a convincing case for the profound meaning of life. In addition, it is the perfect antidote for the hedonism and nihilism that are running rampant in the world today."},{"Title":"The problem of pain","review":"I would love this book, but the Kindle edition is horrible!

So it was with eagerness that I devoted myself to the reading of this book.And I was not disappointed in the least. The problem of pain is tightly linked with that of evil, in a world supposedly created and led by God. This is one of the most common, and most important, issues in theology, and I dare say, in everybody's life, provided they're somewhat curious about the world they live in. Justifying God on the counts of evil and pain is called theodicy, if I'm not mistaken, and that is what Lewis does in this book, but he does much more.He deals with the basic problem I just mentioned, how could there be a good God when we live in such a wretched world, but he goes further and treats the human nature as \\"fallen\\", and that in a very interesting manner, not your silly Adam & Eve story taken literally (and by \\"silly\\" I don't mean the actual myth of Adam & Eve, just the literal taking of it).Lewis tackles even such a complicated issue as animal pain and the condition of animals in Christianity. That shows quite some bravery.One chapter is devoted to Hell, and another to Heaven, and either are really amazing prowess of theology. I'm no specialist of theology, but Lewis has a true gift in explaining of all this in a very clear fashion. He truly makes theology a thrilling matter!After having read \\"Mere Christianity\\" and \\"The Problem of Pain\\", I'm absolutely convinced that I will get to read everything he wrote on theology, Christianity, and the likes.

Physically, we experience pain in order to prevent us from repeating a mistake. Like the example of leaving your hand on a hot pan; the heat and pain you experience is your body's way of telling you that if you leave it there longer it might result in irreparable harm. Thus, what value might emotional or spiritual pain have for us as well? This is where Lewis examines thoroughly.I love the fact that despite proving a very rational and profound point about pain that Lewis, still, basically says that some pain...just hurts, which is life. But that there is always an opportunity for growth whenever, if not because, pain is present in our lives.This can honestly open up your eyes and possibly shift your thinking or way of seeing things if you really read it as it is intended to be read. Though, Lewis is one of those writers that you either get or don't get.Much like J.G. Marking's \\"A Voice Is Calling,\\" however much you put into this book is how much you will get out of it because the sheer depth and power of \\"Problem of Pain\\" is in its intimacy with the reader and its ability to express a cathartic exhale for the reader.With his influence on new, contemporary writers, many of which draw comparisons to Lewis because of style or ability, see J.G. Marking above, it is not difficult to see why Lewis was labeled as the most influential thinker/writer of the 20th century and why he will continue into the 21st as well."},{"Title":"The problem of pain","review":"Not the best place to start if you want to see the strongest logical underpinnings of Christianity (_Miracles: A Preliminary Study_, post-1960 edition, would be the best; _Mere Christianity_ would be the most popular and easiest to digest). However, _The Problem of Pain_ (TPoP) does fully address the most popular theological question of all: if there's a good God, then why do we suffer? The question is deep, and the answers here are logically strong (although any serious sceptic of Christianity will probably rankle at them... go read one of the other two books, first!&lt;g&gt;) This is not a book to read if you've just suffered a personal disaster and want to be comforted (although Lewis himself published the final edition of the book just after his wife's death from bone cancer.) It is, however, an essential book for Christians who want to be forearmed in advance when tragedy strikes: remember that strength of will is an intellectual asset that must be developed unless you're a prodigy, and that our reason is our prime (perhaps only) defense against the overwhelming sorrow of our personal tragedies. Lewis' book places the answers squarely within Christian perceptions, and any ideas in the book should be acceptable to members of any denomination. I'll gladly field any questions or comments (or corrections&lt;g&gt;) at the above address, but take note: hatemail will be immediately deleted (so be polite!&lt;G&gt;), and sceptical non-Christians will probably be referred back to one of the earlier books (which I'll also gladly help out on.)

Not, perhaps, since St. Augustine has there been so approachable a writer coupled with such a penetrating intellect.And both Augustine and Lewis share the common trait of reaching, perhaps, too far. In Augustine's case, it was over-reliance on questionable data, such as the reports of the pheonix and the fire-salamander, or the sybillene prophecies. For Lewis, it is a tendency to get stuck in arguing from the general to the specific, on those particularly thorny issues.In \\"The Problem of Pain\\", Lewis takes on one of the thorniest issues possible, and the one on which the Judeo-Christian religions are most often attacked: the reconciliation of a loving, all-powerful God with suffering. As he states in chapter four, this is a daunting problem, particularly for modern man and his predisposition to EXPECT salvation: \\"It was against [a background of fear] that the Gospel appeared as good news... Christianity now has to preach the diagnosis - in itself very bad news - before it can win a hearing for the cure.\\"Lewis' apologetic can hardly be termed a \\"defense\\" of the faith. Rather, he sets out not to solve the problem of pain, but to frame pain and suffering the larger picture of existence. As Lewis repeatedly points out, if you're going to accept certain realities about the world, including our own sensation and reason, then you're going to have to recognize that pain is a necessity. It is part of the system and intrinsically tied to free will and human choice.In butressing this argument, Lewis does an admirable job envisioning \\"paradisal man\\", while freely admitting that his view of it is a construction. Later, he extends his imagery to Hell, and that most bitter of problems (with which Augustine also struggled) of salvation that is not extended to all. Lewis argues around the issue of annihlation vs. eternal torment, and comes off rather well (I think).The only really disappointing part of his analysis is when he addresses pain in animals. In having mastered the general problem of pain, he begins to extend his model to individual cases. And while I am sure that the solution to suffering in animals is consistent with his model, I am also unconvinced that Lewis applies his own model effectively to the animal case. This chapter is clearly the weakest of the book.It also puts one in mind that Lewis rarely addresses the specific problem of Children, a case on which many a good theory has been wrecked. While it is fair to say that the lack of a fully developed intellect should have little bearing on grace and salvation, I'm afraid that the issues of infant vs. adult baptism, heaven, hell, purgatory and limbo all make unwelcome intrusions into the problem of pain. Still, I'm rather glad that Lewis avoided this question (whether intentionally or not), since the analysis of animal suffering was so unsatisfying.But I have spent too much time on very minor complaints. I cannot say that there were great revelations in \\"The Problem of Pain,\\" but at the same time, Lewis' writing is so cohesive and convincing that he helps establish a Christian \\"world-view\\" that the modern world seeks to root out.I couldn't help thinking of the Indonesian Tsunami and the Hurricane Katrina disaster in New Orleans as I read The Problem of Pain. It seemed clear to me that 98% of the pundits and commentators who have wrung their hands over these disasters have given virtually no thought to this problem, or the solution offered by Lewis on behalf of Christian theology. This is unfortunate, because pain (suffering) is one of the most intrinsic, inescapable, and anentropic aspects of life.I offer here the platitude that \\"suffering is the most valuable thing that nobody wants\\" (myself and Lewis included)."},{"Title":"The problem of pain","review":"In an earlier review of this work, I noted that the material should be acceptable to any Christian denomination. This is not exactly true, as there are a few denominations which deny the existence of free will... a main staple of Lewis' apologetica. A member of these congregations reading any of Lewis' work will either reject his conclusions, or be convinced by him that free will actually exists in a Christian context (thus probably removing the reader from that congregation.) TPoP does not bother arguing in favor of free will; so members of these congregations will not be likely to get anything useful out of it. (Lewis' best treatment of the free will issue is probably in the 2nd edition of _Miracles: A Preliminary Study_.)On the related issue of predestination: Lewis uses a modified version of this theory which transcends the limitations of predestination (ie, providing for free will) while concurrently keeping the idea of God as omniscient, omnipotent and omnipresent. Denominations where predestination is not an issue will find Lewis easy to deal with. Denominations where predestination is definitely an issue will have a tougher time, as Lewis' ideas on the matter are very complicated. As someone who has believed in predestination, I can vouch that Lewis' work keeps the essentials while solving most (perhaps all) of the philosophical problems... it has worked for me.&lt;g&gt;Finally, Lewis' major work does not largely reflect his Anglicanism; in fact, he caught a lot of heat from some Anglican clergy because of this. M:aPS, MC and TPoP are written from a non-denominational standpoint, which is why I wrote that any denomination will find them useful, and which is what Lewis specifically intended. However, there are very many Christian denominations in the world--every Baptist church, for instance, has the potential to be its own 'denomination' if it wishes--so please take this recommendation as the generalization it was intended to be, not in a rigorous sense."},{"Title":"The problem of pain","review":"This book is a well-reasoned and beautifully-written explanation of the nature of God; the nature of humans and the role of pain and suffering in the relationship between God and humans. Although it lacks feeling, this is not a flaw. Its purpose is to touch the mind, not the heart. And this C.S. Lewis does brilliantly.Lewis' begins by giving us a context on the nature of both God and humans. In brief, he says that what we know as \\"human\\" is not really human at all--at least not the \\"human\\" God originally intended. And that's because of sin. According to Lewis: \\". . . it was the emergence of a new kind of man--a new species, never made by God, had sinned itself into existence.\\" (p. 79)And it's not just human nature that's been corrupted; it's our entire reality. \\"My own experience,\\" writes Lewis, \\"is something like this. I am progressing along the path of life in my ordinary contentedly fallen and godless condition, absorbed in a merry meeting with my friends for the morrow or a bit of work that tickles my vanity today, a holiday or a new book, when suddenly a stab of abdominal pain that threatens serious disease, or a headline in the newspapers that threatens us all with destruction, sends this whole pack of cards tumbling down.\\" (p.106)The end result? God uses pain to make us fully human and jolt us into reality.\\"The Problem of Pain\\" is an excellent book to uncover the intellectual underpinnings of these topics and their relation to us; however, if you are seeking emotional comfort in your pain, this book is not for you.Sandra EggersAuthor\\"Dying Body, Growing Faith\\""},{"Title":"The problem of pain","review":"In the past, I've said that in some of his works, C.S. Lewis almost seems like a professional philosopher, while in others, he clearly comes across as more of a popularizer. This book, I'm afraid, is of the latter type. I say this, not because it's a bad book (it deals quite well with all the major problems people have concerning pain,) but because it's non-technical.There's nothing wrong with using a book to popularize very basic responses to very basic arguments (rest assured, this kind of content is as much as [perhaps more than] most internet atheists will be able to grasp on these issues,) but if you're a really educated seeker, really looking for answers to life's tough questions, or a theology student who wants to know the truth, or even just a philosophically-minded person who's not entirely on board with Christianity yet, put this book down. In fact, even if you -are- entirely on board with Christianity, there's a chance this book might damage your faith.Now, as I said, this book is a good book. Rest assured, I got just as many really good quotes from it as I did bad ones. That said, there were bad ones, and they came in two varieties. The first variety was weak and illogical arguments in favor of true positions. The second was defending very questionable, or even clearly-false positions.At this point, I feel the need to remind you that I am not an atheist. I'm an orthodox Roman Catholic, so when I say a position is questionable, I mean either that it has been denounced by the church, or else not affirmed by them in any way (not respected in doctrine, discipline, practice, creed or prayers.) However, my objections to some of Lewis' conclusions will not exist in a vacuum. I will back up my position with evidence, and a noteworthy, talented apologist like C.S. Lewis deserves, I feel, no less.First, however, let me cover the weak defenses of true positions. Fortunately, I only spotted two of these.Firstly, in chapter 6, paragraph 12, he responds to the well-known Euthyphro dilemma. The dilemma is \\"does God command things because they're right, or are they right because he commands them. If he commands them because they're right, then that 'rightness' must have a source other than God. If they're right because he commands them, then 'right' and 'wrong' are arbitrarily dependant on the will of God.\\"Lewis' response to this dilemma is correct. He says that God commands things -because- they're right. What he does not do is explain how this can happen without \\"rightness\\" originating outside of God; namely, that it is God's nature, not his will, where right and wrong originate, and his will obeys his nature in commanding right things.Chapter 6, paragraph 18; Lewis wants to prove that pain can be good for people, and cites the claim that old people generally, in his experience, grow better with age, not worse. However, age is not pain, and it brings many things with it other than pain. Sometimes, for example, it brings wisdom, which is much more likely than pain alone to improve a person's character. I think his claim that pain can be good for people is spot-on, but this argument is horribly wanting.More importantly, however, he makes a number of claims which I think are simply wrong, and which certainly aren't required for Catholics (or indeed, Christians of any sort) to believe. He keeps going back to these too, so I'll describe these faulty teachings first, then point out where I saw them surfacing.1. Competition is a form of evil.This may not be intentional, but in Ch2Par14, he says that \\"hostility and competition\\" are a \\"grave evil.\\" Gee. Should I have confessed my last game of chess to a priest?I'm sorry. I don't mean to be snide about this, but only one kind of competition is evil; the hostile kind. If C.S. Lewis believes this (and I have no reason to think he does not,) the word \\"hostility\\" need not have been followed by anything.2. The self-depreciation of the saints is \\"scientifically\\" accurate.Ch4Par15. No, it's not. Science is about measurements, and how rotten you are is not measurable by any method of which we are aware.3. God -causes- evil and suffering efficiently.He doesn't use these precise words, but he does seem to imply that God is the cause of evil in Ch6Par8. He also, in the same place, implies that the human will is evil, but that's a separate problem.4. The human will is evil, just by being a will.I really don't know why he would say this, since he elsewhere rejects Total Depravity (which I also reject.) However, he seems to repeatedly confuse -evil- will with any kind of human will considered as a whole. In Ch6Par3, he rails at the very idea of desiring anything for the self, and advocates ruthlessly shattering such desires by force. However, the problem is that a person who -really- desired nothing for the self would also have no reason to associate with other human beings, since they wouldn't desire to be noble or virtuous, which is absurd. Of course these desires are valid. So are many other desires, provided they're kept in the proper order.In Ch7Par3, he again demonstrates a fundamental confusion between the will, considered absolutely, and the will to do diabolical things.This Error seems to feed into another one; his incorrect understanding of Heaven, which I will deal with in a moment.5. Free will and its associated dangers are needed in order for people to live.Ch2Par15. I agree that free will is needed in order for people to live, but its dangers are not required, or else, it would be impossible for Heaven to exist, since people clearly live there, yet, without danger.6. Even if there were pains in Heaven, those in the know would desire them.Ch8Par9. I don't think he quite understands the purpose of Heaven in saying this. The purpose of Heaven is to be in the closest possible proximity to God. To be in the closest possible proximity to God is to have all good things, and no evil things. However, pain is an evil thing, in and of itself (which I think may be another point of confusion for him.) Therefore, merely having pain proves that one is not in the closest possible proximity to God, and therefore, not in Heaven.Believe me, after all we humans have suffered (self-inflicted or no,) a partial victory on an -eternal- scale would never be sufficient, and God knows this. That's why Purgatory doesn't last forever.7. In Heaven, there is no beer.More or less. He claims that no one can possess anything in Heaven. Then what, may I ask, is the point of giving up the things that we clearly -do- possess? This is a poor substitute, if true, and I'm fully convinced that it's false on that basis alone.Still, I want to fully examine the points he makes on the subject.Ch10Par5; he seems to recognize that this claim imperils the parable of the pearl of great price (the first objection I would have brought up,) but doesn't really deal with the issue, except to assert that what he's speaking of is \\"not an experience.\\"This requires an analysis of what the word \\"experience\\" means. An experience, in a broad sense, is anything which is perceptible, but is still a particular instance, and is therefore not obtainable, since it ceases to occur once the experience is past. However, a \\"particular instance\\" could, in theory, be stretched out into eternity, and therefore remain an experience, while still being imperishable. However, it would not be obtainable. This seems to be the common thread. Experiences are not obtainable things, and obtainable things are more than mere experiences.Now, rewards come in two types; either obtainable rewards, such as money or candy, or else experiences, such as a vacation, or a trip to the fair. By merely saying that something is \\"not an experience,\\" we imply that it is more than a mere perceptible, or even participative occurrance, whether or not it is experienced. We therefore imply that it is something which can be possessed. In other words, this paragraph contains a self-contradiction which disproves his claim.Ch10Pars7, 9 and 10. Lewis quotes the theologia germanica, which is not doctrine, and heavily inspired Martin Luther, to try to support his claim that not only is there no ownership in Heaven, but no human will either. This, I think, ties into error #4. The theologia germanica contained several questionable claims, and this; the denial of the will of the saints, was one of the big ones. It said outright that the saints in Heaven have no will except for the will of God, but I reject this claim for one simple reason.If this were true, asking the saints to intercede for us at the throne of God would be a wasted effort, since they would have no will to respond with. Now, you could say that the will of the saints does not -conflict- with the will of God, but that's not the claim that C.S. Lewis makes. He seems to have something of a mad-on for human wills and human selves, since he apparently wants both to be annihilated (the will being the highest function of the soul.) He even claims that human beings can only fulfill themselves completely by repeatedly giving up everything they are. I assume I don't need to point out that this is a self-contradiction, and therefore, necessarily false.But the real question is why? Why hold onto this notion of the self and the will being evil in and of themselves? Why claim that anything which God made is evil? Why not claim, with the Church, Saint Thomas Aquinas, myself, and others, that everything which God made is essentially good, but tainted by sin? Well, it seems to me that Lewis' reason is somewhat evident...Ch10Par1: \\"Heaven offers nothing that a mercenary soul can desire.\\"C.S. Lewis, it seems, either does not believe, or does not want people in Heaven who are only -imperfectly- penitent for their sins.Let me explain what this means. In Catholic doctrine, we define two types of penitence. -Perfect- penitence, in which you're sorry for your sins because you know you've offended God, and don't wish to, and -imperfect- penitence, in which you're sorry for your sins because you're afraid of being punished (like, with the loss of goods or rewards.)It seems that Mr. Lewis wants to make the point that the Christian God is not morally-inferior to anyone, because he rejects those who do his will out of ulterior motives, but this is problematic for four main reasons.1. It's contrary to Church teaching, and therefore false.2. It's contrary to the words of the apostle Paul, who said, in his letter to the Romans, that God will give to each person according to what he has -done.- Not according to his motives for doing it.3. It does not, in fact, make God seem morally-superior, but rather, morally-inferior for not showing mercy on those who tried to please him, without really understanding the best reasons why they should.4. I can only imagine how many modern men may have read these words and said to themselves \\"forget this. If this is the best deal I can get out of Christianity, I'm better off being an atheist.\\" A mere two years ago, I'd have said the same.The fact is that no matter how much certain Christians may want to thumb their noses at regular Joe Christian for following God, not out of selflessness, but because he wants a happy ending, you're much, much, -much,- better off not doing so. Jesus didn't say that people needed perfect contrition in order to enter Heaven. He said people needed faith and humility, and that they needed to be baptised, eat his body, drink his blood, take up their cross... You know... Catholic stuff.Just living this way involves a massive degree of sacrifice, to the point where there are days that only the promise of that happy ending gets us through. This is the kind of understanding of the relationship between this life and the next that Jesus preached. He didn't claim that God would force people out for not having a perfect motive, or that dangers and life were one and the same, or that God would lobotomize the saints of their human will. Our Lord wasn't nearly so grim as all that.He said that any man who has given up lands/cattle/wife/mother/father/etc... for his sake would receive (implying ownership) much more in the age to come.When you think about it, that's a darn good deal, and I wonder why so many otherwise-holy people want to spoil that.Again, this review may have come across as just a load of griping. I'm sorry if it seemed that way. It's only because these are complex issues, and they take a while to explain. As I said at the beginning, this book is more than half right. Its missteps are few and far between, but they do exist. Just keep your eyes open and proceed with caution, and you'll do just fine. You might even learn a thing or two about the problem of evil and how to approach it. Just don't take all of it at face value."},{"Title":"The problem of pain","review":"The wonderful thing about C.S. Lewis was that he put an amazing amount of thought into his faith. He understood better than most that becoming a Christian meant constantly trying to understand more, to examine both one's self and one's relationship to God. His penetrating intellegence towards Christianity is something that is often lacking in religion, and every time I read Lewis I learn something new, both about myself and my faith. Lewis is a true master. Another author who I'd highly recomend to anyone who enjoys Lewis, one who explores the Christian faith as brilliantly as Lewis, is Brian Caldwell. His novel, We All Fall Down is breathtaking. I'd put him on a par with Lewis, both for writing ability and theological brilliance. His novel is one of the few Christian masterpieces. Both Lewis and Caldwell should be read by those who have discovered God and want to explore that faith as deeply as possible, and perhaps more importantly, by those who have not."},{"Title":"The problem of pain","review":"Jack wrote this toward the beginning of WWII, and it was sort of the beginning of quite a bit of attention focused on the problem of suffering. This problem was particularly something that he had to deal with before his conversion to Christianity, so you find a tincture of his theodicy in many of his fictional works.What is particularly fascinating about this work is the way he used myth to handle the unknowns of Christianity (Eden, Heaven, Hell). When you read this book and all of his books regarding theology, keep in mind that he is not a theologian, as he admits himself. What he writes about suffering is not even how he actually believed it was, it was what could have been.I suggest reading this work along the side of the Space Trilogy or The Great Divorce. He incorperates much of his own theology presented here with these pieces. I've focused a bit of study on Lewis' handling of suffering, though I'm not a scholar by any stretch. If you would like to read a little I've written on the subject, let me know.All in all, what Jack wanted to do with this book was to take the reader's mind's eye on a pilgrimage to the gateway of possibilities that lie within God's own imagination. Although we may certainly never be able to totally conceive the mind of the Lord, Lewis does the best he can to take us to the edge of knowing Him as we are known."},{"Title":"The problem of pain","review":"Out of all Lewis' books I have read this is the one I dislike and disagree with him the most. I will start out by saying that Lewis builds up to his points on this subject whereas in, say, \\"Miracle\\" he gets right to the point and then builds up his thesis. Also, with most of Lewis' books, this one will require another read through. Before I list my main contentions with this book, I am not aware if Lewis ever revised his thoughts on the subject or the particular claims which I take note with. I think he is dead wrong on certain principles of Christology - mainly the ability of God-knowledge to reside in Jesus. To say that God is incapable of this is to say that God is not all-powerful. I will say that Jesus gave up certain aspects of His Godhood to become human (for example, omnipresence). I also disagree with his assessment of where goodness comes from. With the statement of the Euthyphro dilemma, Lewis chooses to say that goodness is subjectively dictated by God, if there is a way God can be subjective - but I digress. I'm not sure why he doesn't make mention that the Euthyphro dilemma is a false dilemma and goodness arised out of God's character so God appeals to Himself. So what is good is of God and not just commanded by Him or He appeals to a status of goodness above God. The false dilemma answer has been around since Aquinas so I'm not sure why he doesn't comment on that. Another problem he spends too much time on because of the philisophical gymnastics he has to go through is the doctrine of Creation. Lewis comments on man existing before Genesis 1 and appealing to evolution to get to Adam. Adam arrises out of animalism. I'm not sure why Lewis doesn't take the Bible for what it says and it clearly leads to some murky backbending that Lewis isn't quite sure of himself what to do with it. This leads to my last negative point which is his theory on animal pain. He leaps way too far out from his main point and appeals to \\"mights\\" and \\"maybes\\" and \\"hopes\\" of God's character not stated in the Bible. Thus Lewis' basis for such claims are just as good as those wishes made on falling rocks from space. He agains lands in murky waters in stating that animals arrived not from Creation week but on the building upon death that evolution requires. Lewis reckognizes the problem with saying this and assumes a multitude of conclusions that have no biblical basis and are very, very weak - even in his own arguements.I do not wish to say there is nothing good about this book, because his formation of his main thought is decent. I have no issues with it in general but he does make some really great points. Another reading might pull my grade down farther or it might build it up. However, I think Lewis is way off in many parts here.

But the creatures are not happy. Therefore God lacks either goodness, or power, or both.&#34; Lewis then works through the argument from there, and concludes, &#34;Try to exclude the possiblity of suffering which the order of nature and the existence of free-wills involve, and you will find that you have excluded life itself.&#34; In doing so, he explores the difference in love and kindness, explores the question how a &#34;bad&#34; creature could come from the hands of a good Creator, the meaning of the Creation and Fall, the meaning of evil or cruelty, the illusion of self-reliance and pain's role in breaking that illusion and re-forming it into true self-suffiency as a co-creator with God.Lewis makes valuable, thoughtful arguments that hold together all the way to the end, building on each argument to the next. If you've ever wondered about the meaning of pain in a world created by God, this is your book.Although the book may feel somewhat difficult to plow through, particularly at first, this is mostly due to the difference in writing style when Lewis wrote the book and the difficulty of the topic. The book becomes easier to read as you make your way through it. This is not a book to be skimmed - it requires thoughtful, thorough reading."},{"Title":"The problem of pain","review":"C.S. Lewis's \\"The Problem of Pain\\" is one of the best books I've found to address the considerable question of how a good God could allow bad things to happen. I found it to be as challenging and interesting as Harold Kushner's \\"When Bad Things Happen to Good People\\" although the two theologians come to different conclusions about what the reason for pain is.Part of what makes Lewis amazing is the crystal clear language and metaphor he uses for examing faith. In \\"Pain\\" he talks about humanity as being an opportunity to \\"reverse the fall of Adam\\" by coming to Christ. Here, in one sentence, he has truncated the scope of the Bible down to one goal -- start with the Fall, end with the Resurrection. A perfect, crystalline comment -- one of many in this book. Then Lewis is on to the consirable task of explaining why God would require pain (in fact, death) for his creations.Lewis -- in another excellent metaphor-- likens God to a sculptor and man to his clay. God is an artist, and won't stop until his creation is perfect. The pain we feel in life are God's attempt to make us his perfect creation, to complete the goal he has for our lives. In another collection, Lewis likens God to a heart surgeon. Knowing the full process required, the surgeon can't stop the process when the patient cries out in pain, because if he did the required outcome would never result.Lewis likens Christians to a child drawing a circle -- they are attempting to draw something but it is rudimentary and sketchy, while the perfect circle God wants for people's lives is outside the reach without pain.Fine, you might say, but what about needless suffering? Not the pain of death but the pain of life -- suffering children, poverty, abuse. Lewis is a little less convincing on this topic, relying on the age old excuse of blaming free will and man's sinful nature for the unneccessary pain in the world. Here I like Harold Kushner's metaphor (co-opted from another source) that human beings are \\"God's language\\". When you ask \\"where is God?\\" the answer is that God is in the spirit of inspiration of people who help out in times of crisis. God can't intervene, Kushner says, so he inspires people to do his work for him.All in all, \\"The Problem of Pain\\" is an excellent book, well worth the read."},{"Title":"The problem of pain","review":"Pain is real, just as sorrow, death, and wickedness. Your becoming a Christian will not encapsulate you away from it. Christ did not promise that in the first place. But there are reasons why pain happens, as much to Christians as non Christians, and we should reach a better understanding of the circumstances in which we live, so that we can apprehend the promises that are envolved through that pain. Everyone is to pick up a cross at childbirth, but whether you follow Christ with it depends only on you.This book won't be the treat that 'Mere Christianity' was. It's more philosophical; it assumes the reader is a Christian and has some knowledge of Scripture. But nevertheless, everyone can follow his thinking and it will all make sense. About 160 pages, it has chapters of between 10 and 20 pages, and frames the problem in its right context before reaching his conclusion at the end of the book.

If his role is to \\"justify the ways of God to man\\", then in an intellectual sense he has succeeded to the extent of internal consistency. But his chapter on animal pain is chilling; if he had ever seen an animal in pain he could hardly have written so callously. His avowed fear of pain makes him intellectualize it to the vanishing point. This was an intensely human man, in some ways a noble man, but the humanity and nobility are missing and all that is left is the Oxford don. Read this, then read A Grief Observed, when he has to face the loss of his wife. That's the real book. That book gives the whole truth about the problem of pain.

How can we escape pain without the forfeiture of free will? How would we love? How would we cherish? All that was good would be provided. All that was bad, extinguished. What, then, would be good? What measure could we take? Without free will we would be mere automata and, as automata, we would be nonsense.Grief exists because love exists. People die premature deaths because they must if we are to exist in a world where free will is possible. Anything else would be a controlled experiment, a massive fraud where we are not free to love God, but are predetermined to do so. There'd be no upside for there would be no down. We, in essence, would be pointless.The problem of pain, once looked at through Lewis, becomes not so much a problem, but a requirement. Indeed, it becomes surprising that one hadn't arrived at this reality before. C.S. Lewis' clarity of mind is as evident in The Problem of Pain as in his other apologetics. His works are immeasurably helpful to those willing to assess them objectively. 5 stars"},{"Title":"The problem of pain","review":"In \\"The Problem of Pain\\" Lewis deciphers a very trying question for the whole of Christianity - why must humanity suffer. Many atheists argue that if God were both omnipotent and good, why does he allow such a world of pain to exist? Lewis answers this question and many others in a style that can easily be compared with a learned scholar, not a layman.While I don't agree with all of Lewis's suppositions in \\"The Problem of Pain\\" (namely some of the statements found in the chapter \\"The Fall of Man\\" dealing with the origins of the human species), he still by and large offers up a very convincing case deeply rooted in the best Christian doctrine around - The Bible. The problem of pain for the Christian may be summed up rather simply: 1) Man, not God, was and is the creator and instigator of pain through Adam's sin. 2) Pain is a megaphone God uses to speak to us - sharply perhaps, uncomfortably, even unbearably - but if pain did not exist, would the joy and peace of God's love be the same? God uses pain to rouse a deaf world, to let us all know that something is wrong, that we need something beyond ourselves. 3) While life can be exceedingly painful at times, there is always the happiness, the sunrises and the mountain streams, for us to enjoy. Pain allows us see joy even more clearly.

The only chapter that led me to question his words is on man's fall.On human wickedness: \\"A God who did not regard this with unappeasable distaste would not be a good being.

It is for our sake.\\"The full acting out of the self's surrender to God therefore demands pain: this action, to be perfect, must be done from the pure will to obey, in the absence, or in the teeth, of inclination. How impossible it is to enact the surrender of the self by doing what we like,...........\\"After finishing the book, a thought on heaven came to my mind:The differences are what makes up a community whether here or in heaven: God has created us after a time where all was God (but that is no more!); we are all unique parts to a puzzle. He needs us all back to complete it----to rejoin our family in heaven; it pangs Him that many will not make it, and choose to ignore their created purpose, because they have surrendered to the self and not to the Lord.

S. Lewis's theodicy - his attempt to explain why, if God is omnipotent and good, bad things happen in the world and people suffer. His target audience is Christians; non-Christians are likely to dismiss this work out of hand.In this book, Lewis addresses the goodness and omnipotence of God, the fall of man and human wickedness, human and animal pain, and heaven and hell. In doing so, he gives a strong case for the free will of humanity (stronger even, perhaps, than might be biblically defensible).As per usual, most of Lewis's arguments are logically rather than theologically based. The problem is, in this book, his logic is noticeably faulty. It does often tend to be \\"either/or\\" - Lewis will say, \\"this must be X or Y\\", almost arbitrarily, and will not leave room for other options. Much of Lewis's logic here is based on the rampant speculation he makes without theological or biblical support, particularly in his chapters on hell and animal suffering. The illustrations Lewis uses in this book tend to be general and academic, and he qualifies many of the things he says.At one point, Lewis breaks from his own argument to embrace a personal position in direct opposition to the case he has been making. Lewis says that he presupposes that \\"the good man ordinarily continues to seek simple good. I say \`ordinarily' because a man is sometimes entitled to hurt (or even, in my opinion, to kill) his fellow, but only where the necessity is urgent and the good to be attained obvious...\\" The reader familiar with Lewis knows that his position here is strongly rooted in the time he spent in the military and fighting in World War I. But here he has contradicted things he's said earlier in the book, and in other books, about love and good. Obviously the urgency of necessity and the obviousness of good are often completely subjective. Lewis really dropped the ball here.It is interesting to note (although it really has little to do with the quality of the work) that Lewis here both embraces evolution and says quite clearly that he believes that the creation accounts in Genesis are myths. Neither of these cause any problem for his faith.The Problem of Pain is hardly Lewis's finest work. The logic is often faulty and the illustrations he uses are too hypothetical and vague. There is some good here also, particularly the message that God can use pain to reach and change people. But this is far from being the definitive work on pain."},{"Title":"The problem of pain","review":"This book predates Lewis' _Mere Christianity_ (collected as such, anyway) and the first edition of _Miracles: A Preliminary Study_. It is, in fact, the first 'religious' book he ever wrote, aside from his semi-autobiographical allegory _The Pilgrim's Regress_.As such, the reader (pro or con) should be prepared to keep in mind a caveat or two. For instance, Lewis rightly notes that pain and evil only become problems for Christianity once certain relevant Christian doctrines have been established (or at least are on the table). In order to be consistent to this precept, Lewis must begin the book by making an argument for the acceptance of some of these doctrines being true.It is hardly a comprehensive or solid argument, although it is a novel one. It is also one Lewis doesn't seem to have bothered to ever use again--which should alert critics to what his own opinion of its merits ended up being! (This is why I am not bothering to summarize it here; read the book. |g|) The weight of his main argument, however, does not rest strictly on the argument from his Introduction: if on these grounds _or better_, he says (and he had better ones in development), we accept certain truths about Christianity, then the problem of pain arises. And that is what TPoP is about.This puts TPoP in a curious place among Lewis' books. In effect, it should be read as a sequel to his final, best Christian apologetic (MaPS, the 1960 revised edition): although, again, I don't think any of the TPoP argument necessarily requires (or is thrown out by) the _specific_ arguments of MaPS. This keeps it useful for (most?) other methods of proposing or arguing in favor of Christian doctrines.(Most, maybe not all. The first time I reviewed this book, I was reminded that any Christian denomination which denies human free will--or is heavily into theistic predestination, which amounts to the same thing in my opinion--is not likely to find this book very useful, since Lewis _does_ rely on the existence of human free will. I accept the qualification; with the further observation that most Christians in most times have accepted and relied upon the existence of human free will--including, in my experience, those who attempt to deny human free will.)I wish oppositional critics to Christian (or any mono)theism were more familiar with the principles discussed in this book. I believe Lewis is entirely correct to notice, for instance, that the power of an anti-theistic Argument from Evil (not necessarily from Pain, though), requires the presupposed existence of the objective personal ethical source which the anti-theistic argument is attempting to deny.Still, the book does have some weaknesses (partly due to its early authorship). Lewis mentions that he has grounds for believing God to be good, for instance, yet I don't think he actually presents the best grounds in this book. The closest he comes is, I think, the aforementioned point that if he tries to argue against God's existence and character via the subject of 'evil', he finds he must presuppose the very properties of existence and characteristc which he wished to attack. This is an important point, worth keeping in mind, but isn't a positive argument for those characteristics.He does mention the Euthyprho dilemma explicitly in a later chapter (although he doesn't credit it to Socrates via Plato here--apologies in advance for possible misspelling |g|); but while he comes down in favor of one side (God is following a standard) he doesn't explain in TPoP why this standard isn't above God.There _is_ a proper answer to the Euthyphro dilemma (do we say God is good because He holds to a standard? Then the standard is above Him and He is not God. Do we say God is good because He is the most powerful? Then His standard is arbitrary and not objective goodness). And Lewis did touch on it elsewhere (I know ,because I learned it from one of his works--I just don't remember which |g|). However, since he didn't do it in _this_ book (I believe it may be in _Mere Christianity_), it wouldn't be proper to comment on it here.(He does partly address a somewhat different dilemma, regarding the question of how we could possibly be in a position to perceive God's goodness if His omniscient wisdom is so superior to ours. Again, it isn't the most technically accurate solution, but it does have strong practical value, coming as it does from Lewis' own experience as a former atheist and moral relativist.)Be that as it may: TPoP does offer considerable resources and principles for springboarding disputes past the typical deadlocks of religio-philosophical debate on this subject. For instance, his discussion of hell is highly worth keeping in mind; as well as his discussion of the implications of omnipotence.The collection of Lewis essays _God in the Dock_ features a reply from Lewis to some criticisms of the speculative chapter on animal pain."},{"Title":"The problem of pain","review":"In the Problem of Pain Lewis tackles a question that has morally plagued society for centuries, &quot;Why does bad things happen to good people?&quot;Lewis using his logic to answer this question rewrites alot of things modern man thinks he already knows!He does a fine job of answering this question, and explaining why a loving God would allow people to suffer, though the first few chapters come accross wordy, and the obviousness that Lewis wasn't up for the battle of this book is prevelant in the first chapter."},{"Title":"The problem of pain","review":"Hello,I am searching for answers for my grief.

Lewis' works as I do other Christian authors (A.W. Tozer, Andrew Murray, E.M. Bounds, Charles Spurgeon, Charles Stanley, Chuck Swindoll), The Problem of Pain will challenge you to think of the book's seems to address the age old question - why would a loving God allow suffering in this world? Sometimes I wonder if that is the right question to ask. Perhaps a better question would be - apart from God's grace through Jesus Christ, why should we demand any better treatment in this life than did Jesus? Indeed, as a Christian, since I am identified with Jesus Christ in His death, burial, and resurrection, I have no right to demand that I be spared the pain that is prevalent in this world.I like Lewis' assertion that perhaps God would not love us any more if we did not experience pain. I submit that the times when I and countless other Christians most experienced God's presence and comfort was during times of pain and trials. Readers will note that Lewis himself experienced the loss of a wife through illness.Lewis will challenge you to think through why you beleive what you believe and this book is no exception. This is not an easy read and you will have to concentrate on this one! Lewis touches on the following areas in The Problem of Pain:1. God's Omnipotence2. Heaven and Hell3. Human Wickedness and Pain4.

This doesn't address that aspect. More of a societal view of pain and those in pain."},{"Title":"The problem of pain","review":"C. S. Lewis, the late professor of Medieval and Renaissance literature at Cambridge University, was one of the most popular, thought-provoking Christian apologists of the Twentieth Century. In his book on the problem of pain, he acknowledges in his Introduction that Christianity actually \\"creates, rather than solves, the problem of pain, for pain would be no problem unless...we had received what we think a good assurance that ultimate reality is righteous and loving.\\" On the other hand, as he also points out, merely discarding Christianity creates the problem of explaining why, if \\"the universe is so bad...humans ever came to attribute it to the activity of a wise and good Creator?\\" He then follows this statement with a mini case for Christianity, discussing four religious elements.The first three elements are: (1) experience of numinous awe, (2) consciousness of a moral law which we both approve and yet disobey, and (3) identification of the \\"Numinous Power of which we feel awe\\" as also being \\"the guardian of the morality to which [we] feel ablation.\\" Lewis perhaps rightly contends that these experieces are neither \\"the result of an inference from the visible universe\\" nor a logical deduction \\"from the environment and [our] physical experiences.\\" He then contends that our religious experience must be either \\"a mere twist in the human mind, corresponding to nothing objective and serving no bioligical function...or else it is a direct experience of the really supernatural.\\" Religious experience and thought may indeed be a \\"twist in the human mind\\" that nevertheless has a useful function without necessarily being an actual experience of the supernatural. Anyone interested in finding out more about how religious thought may have developed without invoking the supernatural may consult Pascal Boyer's excellent book, Religion Explained: The Evolutionary Origins of Religious Thought (New York: Basic Books, 2001).The fourth religious element Lewis discusses is the Incarnation as follows:\\"Either he [Jesus Christ] was a raving lunatic of an unusually abominable type, or else he was, and is, precisely what He said. There is no middle way. If the records make the first hypothesis unacceptable, you must submit to the second.\\"Far from being cogent, this argument would make an excellent example of an either/or fallacy for textbooks on logic. It is also called the fallacy of \\"incomplete enumeration.\\" Christ could have been mistaken about himself without necessarily having to be designated an \\"abominable lunatic,\\" and he could be misrepresented in the Gospels. These rational alternatives show that the dilemma presented by Lewis for the unbeliever is false. Having introduced how Christianity causes the problem of pain, Lewis then proceeds to deal with it via the free-will defense.In his chapter on \\"Divine Omnipotence,\\" Lewis states the following:\\"We can...conceive of a world in which God corrected the results of this abuse of free will...at every moment...But such a world would be one in which wrong actions were impossible, and in which, therefore, freedom of the will would be void.\\"However, the contention that free will necessarily includes the option to commit wrong actions is erroneous. Am I less morally free if I am only able to care lovingly for my little dog and incapable of choosing to abuse him? Is my moral freedom diminished in the least by my incapacity to terrorize mentally and abuse physically the woman I love? Are persons capable of choosing to do evil as morally free as those capable of only choosing good? Free will is always limited by the capacities and opportunities of any moral agent. Hence, there is no logical contradiction in conceiving of a limited moral freedom to choose only from among various good actions.Furthermore, free will limited to choosing only good options need not diminish the total amount of free will. God creating greater capacities and opportunities for choosing good could replace the loss of the capacity to do evil. Consequently, since even Christian apologists acknowledge that free will is never absolutely free and since the option to do evil is unnecessary to possess limited free will, the free-will apologetic attempting to rationally explain evil in a world created by an omnipotent, loving God is fallacious. Another of the problems for Christian theology concerns a doctrine Lewis discusses in his chapter, \\"The Fall of Man.\\"Lewis says that, in the developed doctrine of the Fall, \\"Man, as God made him, was completely good and completely happy, but...he disobeyed God and became what we now see.\\" This doctrine creates another problem, which Lewis states as follows:\\"For the difficulty about the first sin is that it must be very heinous, or its consequences would not be so terrible, and yet it must be something which a being free from the temptations of fallen man could conceivably have committed.\\"The sin that Lewis suggests as being possible to someone completely good is \\"turning from God to self\\" or \\"self-idolatry.\\" However, the notion that enyone completely good would commit \\"self-idolatry\\" or any other sin is self-contradictory. If turning to God and not to self is essential to being good, then a morally perfect agent ipso facto could never turn from God.Near the close of his chapter, \\"The Fall of Man,\\" Lewis suggests that \\"it would be futile to attempt to solve the problem of pain by producing another problem.\\" However, this is just what Christian apologetics does with the problem of pain and evil. It introduces \\"solutions\\" that both fail as solutions and actually produce more problems--even when authored by C. S. Lewis."},{"Title":"The problem of pain","review":"Sometimes there are just things that we'd just as soon avoid. Pain can probably be one of those subjects. Take the advice of the spotlight reviewer, because if you aren't a Christian, then you aren't who Lewis is talking to. No offense to ANYBODY, but that's just the simple truth. I think only C.S. Lewis could make sense out of something such as pain. How could he pull stuff like this off? Like he always does, and he certainly does it better than I do! What's this about? Read on.In classic Lewis form, he concludes his \\"Introductory\\" (which is the title of the first chapter) by saying, \\"If, on such grounds, or on better ones, we follow the course on which humanity has been led, and become Christians, we then have the 'problem' of pain.\\" I guess that's a good thing, right? Uh, yeah. Hey, if we know about how God molds our lives, the Great Potter has to shape us as clay, and He has to chip away at the rough edges in order to have that perfect creation in the end. The thing you can't exactly get around in this is that there are no easy answers. You ever hear somebody say, \\"Either you're a Christian, or you're not. Either you are for Jesus Christ, or against Jesus Christ.\\"? That's not an easy answer, its reality because there is no Purgatory! Like it or not, you better believe it. I've never known Lewis to offer the easy answer, and in this case, it shouldn't be watered down. And for an added bonus, (at least I saw this a few times) he basically blows that whole Evolution theory right out of the water with some of this! I'm thinking to myself, \\"Hey Darwin! EVO-WHAT?!!?\\" I do believe that with a lot this, despite the subject, that Lewis had a lot of fun with this work. He was also very down to earth. There is pain in this life, and if you think that it is just some carnival where you always get hot dogs, cotton candy and carmel apples... THINK AGAIN! Sometimes life just plain sucks, and sometimes it just gets plain tough. But there's more to this, as there always is to Lewis. There was chapter on Hell, straight up and to the point. Basically, just mark it down that there IS a Hell, and we really don't want to go there. A few of his other remarks in that chapter threw me for a loop at first, and made perfect sense in the end. And hey, what would a book with a chapter on Hell be if it weren't followed up (and ends the book) with a chapter on Heaven! Hey, that's awesome!Hey, if you don't want to read about The Fall, human pain, or even about human wickedness, then go find Dr. Suess and read about how people fight about buttering bread. If you are looking for something real, and we ALL have it, people, then give this a shot. Because as far as I'm concerned, there's no problem with C.S. Lewis!"},{"Title":"The problem of pain","review":"In this book, C. S. Lewis makes an attempt to explain the causes and purposes of pain. He explains its necessity in the universe in which we live and how God makes use of it. Out of the nature of both God and the universe, Lewis tells of how we have helped to usher pain into our existence. In doing so, he touches on the very essence of creation and the relationship between God and man. There are some very poignant notions in this book. The reader will develop a greater understanding of how we relate to God. The Problem of Pain will probably not comfort someone who is in the midst of dealing with his or her own suffering or heartbreak. It appears that it was intended for more of an intellectual approach to the subject. There are, however, some cumbersome and awkward moments in the book. Lewis makes what seem to be some largely unsubstantiated claims that are outside his realm of expertise, such as man's ability to control all his own biochemical processes before the fall and how animals come to God through man. These ideas seem to come at best from Lewis's imagination. He is humble in his consciousness of his own imperfection. In the preface, Lewis states, \\"If any real theologian reads these pages he will very easily see that they are the work of a layman and an amateur.\\" His writing style is like free flowing thought which can be difficult to read at times. Nonetheless, the work is in no way incomprehensible. Overall, the profound ideas Lewis has on the nature of pain have deepened my own spiritual understanding, and I considered it a privilege to have read his work."},{"Title":"The problem of pain","review":"Lewis wanted to write this book anonymously because he felt he was too much an amateur and a layman to cover such a theologically difficult subject. He was convinced otherwise, which was a good thing. We can thus put it into context with his other works as well as the man himself, certainly no \\"amateur.\\" I read this once, noticing its rich complexity, so I immediately read it again and wrote what I thought were the highlights, chapter by chapter. Unfortunately, it's lengthy.In his \\"Introductory,\\" Lewis starts out by offering his atheistic version of \\"Why do you not believe in God?\\" giving a dark explanation of the world summed up with \\"The race is doomed\\" and that all evidence points to a universe hardly \\"the work of a benevolent and omnipotent spirit.\\" But such pessimism poses a problem: \\"If the universe is so bad...how on earth did human beings ever come to attribute it to the activity of a wise and good Creator?\\" He offers some of the possibilities for this but then makes a startling statement: \\"At all times, then, an inference from the course of events in this world to the goodness and wisdom of the Creator would have been equally preposterous; and it was never made.\\" He footnotes: \\"i.e. never made at the beginnings of a religion. After belief in God has been accepted, \`theodicies' explaining, or explaining away, the miseries of life, will naturally appear often enough.\\" (Emphasis added)Lewis delves into the elements of all developed religions, the first being an explanation of \\"awe\\" of the Numinous, or mighty spirit, which is as old as humanity itself and was \\"not the result of an inference from the visible universe.\\" He attempts to explain \\"awe\\" but acknowledges the difficulty and concludes that there are only two possible views: \\"Either it is a mere twist in the human mind, corresponding to nothing objective and serving no biological function, yet showing no tendency to disappear from the mind at its fullest development in poet, philosopher, or saint: or else it is a direct experience of the really supernatural, to which the name Revelation might properly be given.\\"The second element of religious development is the acknowledgement of some kind of morality expressed in words like \`I ought' or \`I ought not'. And \\"they all agree in prescribing a behavior which their adherents fail to practice. All men alike stand condemned, not by alien codes of ethics, but by their own, and all men therefore are conscious of guilt.\\" Where did it come from? Lewis offers another \`either-or' possibility. \\"It is either inexplicable illusion, or else revelation.\\"The third stage in religious development is when humankind makes the Numinous Power \\"guardian of the morality to which they feel obligation.\\" Lewis discusses variations of this, e.g. \\"sheer moralism\\" or \\"non-moral religion\\" but again concludes that the connection may be sheer madness, and \\"oddly fortunate in its results,\\" or revelation.Lewis then moves to the historical event in Christianity, saying that either Jesus was a \\"raving lunatic\\" or He was precisely who and what He said he was. \\"There is no middle way....Christianity is not the conclusion of a philosophical debate on the origins of the universe.\\" And it isn't a system \\"into which we have to fit the awkward fact of pain: it is itself one of the awkward facts which have to be fitted into any system we make. In a sense, it creates, rather than solves, the problem of pain, for pain, would be no problem unless...we had received what we think a good assurance that ultimate reality is righteous and loving.\\" In thinking about this, the fact of pain is painful; it hurts. But I think Lewis is saying that it's either man functioning like an animal, like accepting death at the jaws of a wolf pack fatefully, as it was meant to be, as opposed to the pain of the believing person feeling that somehow \\"it's not fair\\" because he knows there is a loving spirit guiding the universe. The former really has no legitimate complaint for it's consistent with his worldview. The latter seeks understanding, which is the point of his book. Thus, Christianity has hit \\"us in the face\\" with this problem of pain.In the chapter \\"Divine Omnipotence,\\" Lewis first presents the age-old question, \\"If God were good, He would wish to make His creatures perfectly happy, and if God were almighty He would be able to do what He wished. But the creatures are not happy. Therefore God lacks either goodness, or power, or both.\\" Lewis's explanation is long, dealing with free will, definitions of terms, and \\"anthropomorphic\\" conceptions of God's freedom. But I enjoyed, and record, one concluding remark: \\"It is no more possible for God than the weakest of His creatures to carry out both of two mutually exclusive alternatives; not because His power meets an obstacle, but because nonsense remains nonsense even when we talk it about God.\\" Yes, that seems correct.We still have to deal with how we are to reconcile God's goodness with a suffering world, without contradiction. In the chapter \\"Divine Goodness,\\" Lewis raises the question of the definition of goodness leaving open the possibility that we do not see the whole picture as seen by God. But the fact that we are called to repent suggests that the good is not just a reversal of what we know. Nor is goodness synonymous with contentedness; e.g. God as our kindly grandfather liking to see the children enjoying themselves. \\"If God is Love, He is, by definition, something more than mere kindness.\\" And Lewis describes the nature of this love--we are the objects of this serious love. We asked for a loving God and we have one. But He is the \\"lord of terrible aspect\\", a consuming fire. \\"The problem of reconciling human suffering with the existence of a God who loves, is only insoluble so long as we attach a trivial meaning to the word \`love', and look on things as if man were the center of them...God has no needs...God's love, far from being caused by goodness in the object, causes all goodness which the object has, loving it first into existence and then into real, though derivative, lovability.\\" He has everything to give and nothing to receive. \\"If He requires us, the requirement is of His own choosing.\\" If He suffers, it is from a \\"humility that passes understanding.\\" If He chooses to need us, \\"it is because we need to be needed.\\" He is all goodness \\"for our sakes...to experience the love of God...is to experience it as surrender.\\" Lewis drives home the point: \\"When we want to be something other than the thing God wants us to be, we must be wanting what, in fact, will not make us happy.\\" When we follow the demands of worshipful obedience, do we honestly suppose that it can do Him any good? It is for us.In the chapter \\"Human Wickedness,\\" Lewis deals with the fact that the \\"good news\\" was viewed as a healing to a people who knew they were mortally ill. But this has changed in modern times and \\"Christianity now has to preach the diagnosis...before it can win a hearing for the cure.\\" In other words, it has to give bad news, news that people don't want to hear. He offers explanations for this condition, which I won't cover, but suggests that an old sense of sin is essential. Otherwise we're not part of the audience to whom Christ's words were addressed (by our own choosing). Lewis considers some of the illusions we harbor in regard to sin:We are deceived by comparing ourselves, Mr. X, as not much worse than Mr. Y. Also, we often believe \\"that habitual vices are exceptional single acts, and make the opposite mistake about our virtues--like the bad tennis player who calls his normal form his \`bad days' and mistakes his rare successes for his normal.\\" Lewis is saying that we don't face reality about ourselves. (And I can personally relate to the tennis analogy since I once fancied myself as a player.)A reaction to social conscience, a good thing, and the resulting corporate guilt can mask or deceive us. It can become an excuse for evading the real issue of personal responsibility.\\"We have a strange illusion that mere time cancels sin.\\" As all times are eternally present to God, time does nothing to wash away guilt. Only repentance does and \\"we should remember the price of our forgiveness and be humble.\\"There is no \\"safety in numbers\\" as though it made our sins more excusable because the majority of our neighbors consider it within the normal standard of decency.There is a temptation to compare people of this modern age as being so much more humane or enlightened than those in ages past and he offers some good examples of how this isn't necessarily so (It's called chronological snobbery.)Beware of reducing all virtues to a sentimental kindness. One cannot be truly kind unless one has all the other virtues.The Holiness of God is something other and more than moral perfection; but like corporate guilt, it is easily used as an evasion.\\"Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God.\\" James 1:13.Lewis quotes William Law: \\"If you will here stop and ask yourselves why you are not as pious as the primitive Christians were, your own heart will tell you, that it is neither through ignorance not inability, but purely because you never thoroughly intended it.\\" He closes the chapter with a clear description of true humility, not the kind where we put halos around our own heads, which is the worst sin of all-pride.In \\"The Fall of Man,\\" Lewis defines the doctrine that man is a horror to God because of the abuse of free will, then discusses two theories on the origin of evil: Monism (God being above good and evil) and Dualism (God produces good but some independent power produces evil). The Christian view is more complex--the nature of free will, a good thing, includes the possibility of evil. Augustine saw the sin described by the Fall as the result of pride, a sin against God. What exactly happened when man fell, we don't know; but Lewis offers his own mythic tale involving \`Paradisal' man who, as a species, spoiled himself, and therefore \`good' must come from corrective action.In \\"Human Pain,\\" he suggests that the human spirit will not even begin to try to surrender self-will as long as all seems well. \\"Now error and sin both have this property, that the deeper they are the less their victim suspects their existence; they are masked evil...We can rest contentedly in our sins and in our stupidities...but pain insists upon being attended to.\\" Pain is God's \\"megaphone to rouse a deaf world.\\" It is not vengeance but Lewis acknowledges that it is a terrible instrument that could lead to final unrepented rebellion of man. Another element of this issue shatters the illusion that what we have is our own and it's enough for us. We say \`we have all we want' and unfortunately it does not include God. In this scenario, He is an interruption. He is our parachute, there for emergencies only. And as long we call our own life agreeable (under our astute management) we will not surrender to Him. God then must do something to help us see the \`false happiness'. Lewis calls it \\"Divine Humility.\\" If we have not learned to know Him, our life is wretched, in spite of all appearances. We thus don't even know our need, i.e. \\"the dangers of apparent self-sufficiency.\\" Lewis says, \\"God's will is determined by his wisdom which always perceives, and His goodness which always embraces, the intrinsically good.\\" And one of the good things that rational creatures should freely do is surrender themselves to their creator in obedience. It's for our own good.Lewis carefully discusses this business of writing about pain in the abstract recognizing that it is not the same as experiencing it. He doesn't even attempt to \\"prove it palatable.\\" He does explain, \\"Tribulations cannot cease until God either sees us remade or sees that our remaking is now hopeless.\\" Lewis then offers six additional propositions on the subject of human suffering:The paradox of suffering: If it's \`good' shouldn't it be pursued? No! It's not good in itself. What is good for the sufferer is his submission to the will of God and for the spectators, the compassion and mercy aroused. God can and does make a complex good out of a simple evil.Tribulations will not cease until God \\"sees the world to be either redeemed or no further redeemable.\\" Thus man's attempts for \`heaven on earth' are absurd but the hungry still need fed, the sick cared for, the dying visited and loved.The Christian doctrine of self-surrender and obedience is theological, not a political doctrine. There is no inference to a political system or obedience to a political system.We are never safe in this life but there is plenty of enjoyment. However, God will not encourage us to mistake our pleasant journeys over the landscape as a trip \`home'.\\"There is no such thing as a sum of suffering, for no one suffers it.\\" Lewis argues that adding numbers don't add more pain. (I have to think about this one--six million Jews? One million Ugandans?)Sin by its very nature breed's sin by strengthening sinful habit and weakening the conscience. On the other hand, certain pain, once over, is over.Hell as a doctrine is one of the chief reasons Christianity is attacked as barbarous. Lewis agrees and detests it also; but sees the rationality of the possibility of losing (as well as the clarity of Scripture on the subject). \\"The problem is not simply that of a God who consigns some of His creatures to ruin.\\" It's made complex by the cross--\\"so much mercy, yet still there is Hell.\\" While it may not be tolerable, Lewis argues that it is moral by addressing the objections to it:Hell is objected to as retributive punishment. But Lewis gives a long account of the truly despicable unrepentant man who will not be converted and asks, \\"what destiny in the eternal world can you regard as proper for him?\\" He then discusses the acting out of revenge or spite as an improper response but acknowledges an ethical demand and the conflict of Justice and Mercy. That such a man should be forgiven for remaining what he is, is a confusion of \`condoning' and \`forgiving'. To condone evil is the same as ignoring it, the same as treating it as though it were good. The totally self-absorbed, the evil man, will get his wish...\\"to lie wholly in the self and to make the best of what he finds there. And what he finds there is hell.\\"Another objection deals with \`eternal damnation' vs. \`transitory sin' built on the idea of eternity as a \\"mere prolongation of time.\\" But he rejects this idea and offers a descriptive analogy considering eternity as a \\"solid\\" while our base-line earthly life is a line.A third objection concerns our images of hell, e.g. as expressed in art. Christ speaks of hell as \`everlasting punishment', of \`destruction', and \`exclusion'. Lewis says, \\"To enter heaven is to become more human than you ever succeeded in being on earth; to enter hell, is to be banished from humanity.\\"Finally, it is objected that the loss of a single soul to hell, means a defeat of omnipotence. \\"And so it does\\" Lewis agrees. \\"In creating beings with free will, omnipotence from the outset submits to the possibility of such defeat\\". Lewis calls this a miracle, not a defeat. \\"I willingly believe that the damned are, in one sense, successful, rebels to the end; that the doors of hell are locked on the inside... They enjoy forever the horrible freedom they have demanded, and are therefore self-enslaved.\\"To the objectors of the doctrine of hell, Lewis asks: \\"What are you asking God to do? Wipe out their sins? But He has done so, on Calvary. To forgive them? They will not be forgiven. To leave them alone? Alas, I am afraid that is what He does.\\" Lewis then reminds the reader that this chapter is not about some distant person facing possible damnation, our friends, or our enemies; \\"it's about you and me.\\"I found the chapter on \\"Animal Pain\\" a bit of a stretch. Although Lewis finally offers that \\"we just don't know,\\" I won't comment further.I will briefly close with the final chapter on \\"Heaven.\\" In Romans 8:18, Paul says that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy compared to the glory of heaven. Lewis says Christians are criticized as escapists, trying to ignore the duty of making a happy world and looking to a dreamy \`pie in the sky' existence. He also notes the fear in some that heaven is a bribe but counters that heaven offers nothing a mercenary soul desires. Lewis beautifully writes of the nature of heaven, the union of the soul with God, in its \\"continual self-abandonment\\". He writes of it less as explanation, and more as poetry, so trying to capture it here is more than I'm able to do. It is certainly a great mystery!This is not a book for light reading. Lewis skillfully offers an analysis and perspective on some sticky subjects within Christianity."},{"Title":"The problem of pain","review":"I have recommended this book to so many people over the years. CS Lewis's writings have a certain wit about them that keep you entertained while at the same time exploring vast Truths. Like Chesterton, Lewis is excellent at keeping the attention of his readers while leading their logic into deep philosophical Truths. If there is a loving God, why is there so much evil in the world? Who hasn't asked this question? Even a believer asks this question. Atheists, however, rather than asking the question and seeking an answer, instead use this questionable characteristic of life to demonstrate the absence of an all-good, all-powerful, omni-present God. Every person who has read this book that I have talked to has really enjoyed Lewis' witty and personal style of writing. All in all, buy this book and then pass it around!"},{"Title":"The problem of pain","review":"St. Thomas Aquinas said that there really is only one legitimate objection to the existence of God--the problem of pain. How could an all-good, all-powerful God permit such pain and suffering in our world? In his book, Lewis devotes a chapter to each element in this problem.God's goodness, according to Lewis, doesn't mean \\"niceness\\" in the modern sense. It doesn't mean that God's ultimate goal is for us to be carefree and comfortable. We must remember, Lewis reminds, that God is \\"our father who art in heaven,\\" not \\"our grandfather who are in heaven.\\" Which means he sometimes refines us and brings challenges that end up benefiting us and make us fully alive. God does that not in spite of his goodness, but because of it.Regarding God's power, Lewis explains that while in most cases God doesn't cause pain, he certainly permits it because it can often have incredibly positive effects. Pain fortifies and refines our character, as most of us can attest, while it also forces us to lean closer to God. Both are worthy ends in God's eyes.In addition to these topics, Lewis also covers the nature of heaven and hell along with the interesting question \\"do animals experience pain?\\"The Problem of Pain is one of Lewis' most brilliant books and, excepting Mere Christianity, the one I would most likely give to an atheist friend. It's an intelligent, charitable response to one of Christianity's thorniest issues and I think Lewis' answers are some of the best available."},{"Title":"The problem of pain","review":"Whether physical, emotional or spiritual, pain is an undeniably reality in this world. C.S. Lewis eloquently explores the pain we endure as humans, as well as the Christian response to it, in this wonderful book.I think many non-believers find pain to be a great deterrent against them accepting faith. They wonder how a loving God would possibly allow His children to suffer. This has never been a problem for me, although I have been fortunate to avoid devastating tragedy in my life. Lewis explains how pain is a product of the Fall, how through the Fall humans have become vulnerable to \\"the laws of nature\\", which they were not subject to before sin tarnished Man. Lewis also writes of animal suffering, the grim reality of Hell and he concludes with a vision of Heaven: \\"But God will look to every soul like its first love because He is its first love\\"I would highly recommend this book to Christian and non-Christian."},{"Title":"The problem of pain","review":"This might be one of Lewis's greatest and most challenging works. The questions he tackles are among some of the most profound that human beings face, and Lewis approaches them with characteristic logic, sensitivity, and humility. His \\"solutions\\" (and he would not call them solutions) are not easy but they are very sensible and true to his faith."},{"Title":"The problem of pain","review":"In The Problem of Pain C.S Lewis addresses the \\"elephant in the room\\" when it comes to Christianity. He answers this question, if God really loves us why does he allow pain to come into our lives? Everyone at one point or another asks themselves that. C.S Lewis gives us a new point of view and theological reasons to this issue.One of the main reasons that he tells us is that our pain is a reflection of our sin. When we sin we are subconsciously turning our hearts away from the Lord and that causes us to endure pain. \\"We have a strange illusion that mere time cancels sin. But mere time does nothing either to the fact or to the guilt of a sin.\\" Lewis mentions this because people who are constantly in emotional pain are waiting for time to cancel their sin. Not everyone who is in pain is experiencing it as a reflection of sin, but as christians we seem to be in a lot more pain than others due to sin. This is because we know what is right and we choose to walk down the pain of temptation and sin. \\"From the moment a creature becomes aware of God as God and of itself as self, the terrible alternative of choosing God or self for the centre is opened to it.\\"C.S Lewis also explains how once you experience God's love for you, you will forever long to have it. \\"God will look to every soul like its first love because He is its first love.\\" This part of the book helped me to re-fall in love with God. As Christians we find it easy to become accustomed to just do the \\"christian walk\\" and we start to forget about all the things that God has actually done for us. \\"We regard God as an airman regards his parachute; it's there for emergencies but he hopes he'll never have to use it.\\" This quote was one of the most powerful quotes for me through out the entire book. It moved me so much because I could see in my own life where I was putting God on the back burner. This book has taught me a lot of things that will help me through out my life.C.S Lewis is an amazing man of God. You can see it in his writing that he writes because of experience. He lets his walk with God lead his writing. As Christian reading this book you can look into the words that Lewis says and relate it to your lives. I believe that God has given Christians this chance to have authors like Lewis to relate to and to seek advice from. In the end this is the statement I will leave this with, \\"God has paid us the intolerable compliment of loving us, in the deepest, most tragic, most inexorable sense.\\""},{"Title":"The problem of pain","review":"In the beginning of Saint John's gospel, Philip finds Nathaniel and excitingly tells him, \\"We have found the [Messiah], Jesus, son of Joseph, from Nazareth!\\" Nathaniel's obviously less than enthusiastic response was, \\"Can anything good come from Nazareth?\\" (Jn 1:45-46). I think if we approached a friend and told that friend, \\"I have a new richer outlook about pain!\\" Our friend would most assuredly respond very glumly, \\"Can anything good come from pain?\\" Let me qualify that statement! Our friend would reply thus, unless they had read \\"The Problem of Pain\\" by C. S. Lewis.This book is based on the claim and belief that underlies all Lewis' works, and that Nathaniel quickly found out, that something good did come out of Nazareth! With his extraordinarily rare brilliance that mystifies his readers, Lewis takes a subject that does not make sense, cannot be understood, and cannot be readily accepted. Startlingly, we then marvel as his incredible mind begins to make sense of all this, so that we, the reader, can begin to understand, and learn to accept to some degree, certainly in this case, one of the most difficult aspects of life that many people have to face or experience.Nathaniel did not just swallow what Philip said; but, he accepted the invitation, \\"Come and see!\\" We certainly do not have to buy this whole matter blindly. I even propose that we do not even have to read the entire book! We just need to go and see for ourselves. Begin to read the book and see what happens!"},{"Title":"The problem of pain","review":"\\"God whispers to us in our pleasures, speaks in our conscience, but shouts in our pain: it is His megaphone to rouse a deaf world\\" - p. 91.The problem of pain or our objection to its existence as CS Lewis emphasized, in parallel, can be summarized by the word of Epicurus, a first century philosopher, \\"Either God wants to abolish evil, and cannot; or he can, but does not want to; or he cannot and does not want to. If he wants to, but he cannot, he is impotent. If he can, and does not want to, he is wicked. But, if God both can and wants to abolish evil, then how comes evil in the world?\\" The problem statement seem to bring a contradiction in God's attribute of Omnipotence and Love in solving the problem of pain/evil (there is a reason I use pain/evil term correspondingly) which is CS Lewis first tackled in this book.The trick question which is often brought up regarding God's omnipotence is going like this, \`Can God create a stone that He can not lift?' is like asking, \`Can God be a No-God or un-Godlike?' As CS Lewis put it, \\"This is no limit to His power. If you choose to say God can give a creature free will and at the same time withhold free will from it', you have not succeeded in saying anything about God: meaningless combination of words do not suddenly acquire meaning simply because we prefix to them to other words \`God can'\\" (p. 18). In the end, \\"not because His power meets an obstacle, but because nonsense remains nonsense even when we talk it about God\\". (p.18)And then came the second problem (or so it seem we make a fuss and problem about it), any consideration of the goodness of God at once threatened us with the following dilemma. \\"On the one hand, if God is wiser than we His judgment must differ from ours on many things, and not least on good and evil. What seems to us good may therefore not be good in His eyes, and what seems to us evil may not be evil. On the other hand, if God's moral judgment differs from ours so that our \`black' may be His \`white', we can mean nothing by calling Him good\\". (p. 28). The point is our conceptions of the Divine goodness which tend to dominate our thought though seldom expressed, are open to criticism. Or is it what we thought of God's goodness is like we want the heaven but we do not want God in it, if God comply with that demand then He is a good God.If we can come to term with....well the above terms then we can talk the problem of pain/evil reasonably and objectively (as objective as a human can be) as CS Lewis proceeded with the rest of the book. The book does not present an essay of problem of pain for practical application. It is in the realm of our mind that we perceive pain as a problem and it is in this realm CS Lewis quenching our intellectual curiosity of such perceived problem. For practical application (as in emotionally), I suggest Where is God when it Hurts? by Philip Yancey.\`What are you asking God to do? To wipe out their past sins and, at all costs to give them a fresh start, smoothing every difficulty and offering every miraculous help? But he has done so, on Calvary. To forgive them? They will not be forgiven. To leave them alone? Alas, I am afraid that is what He does. - p. 130"},{"Title":"The problem of pain","review":"I relly Enjoy C.S Lewis, This book helped me realize in the logical sence that God Does love me, even though I have Pain.Great Book, I relly Enjoyed reading it."},{"Title":"The problem of pain","review":"Lewis does an excellent job of conveying his reasoning for pain's necessary existence, though as other reviewer's have noted, if you have no concept or acceptance in the existence of a God, then this book would seem no more than an inept grouping of essays from yet another of \\"God's sheep.\\" I had often pondered the thought as to why God allowed such atrocity to exist in the world, but this book did definitely lead me to a greater understanding of why, from God's perspective, that such things must be as they are. Essentially, Lewis says it is for the greater good of mankind and that it proves God's love for us, for pain more often than not drives us closer to the God who so wants our communion, (that same God that we so often neglect to commune with when all is going well) though Lewis does readily admit that at times pain creates feelings of bitterness or resentment towards God.Lewis does not try to obscure the fact that he probably tolerated pain no better than anyone else. In both the exposition of his vulnerabilities as a person that he makes throughout the book and the scriptural references he uses to back up what he says, Lewis does an outstanding job of conveying the message that God would neither have given us free will nor pain if he did not love us with complete abandon. Definitely recommended reading for any Christian seeking a better understanding as to why hardships must be endured."},{"Title":"The problem of pain","review":"I definitely like the premise of Lewis' book - Christians must be able to explain \\"The Problem of Pain\\". Or in other words, given the fact that we belive in a loving God why is there so much pain and suffering in the world. Definitely not an easy task, but a necessary one.Overall I think that Lewis does an excellent job explaining in a very logical fashion why pain exists, and the purpose that it serves. He covers many difficult facets of this topic in a unique way. I believe that his analogies are very powerful, and well beyond my capability of coming up with this material. I truly appreciate the way he so easily works his way through the material. He was truly gifted by God with a unique apologetic approach.I agree with a few other reviewers that this book is not without fault. Two sections I did not find to be very good were the chapter on the pain of animals, and some of the chapter about the fall of man. The chapter on animals seems out of place, the one about the fall includes some obscure rambling about the origin of man. Not really Lewis at his best.Having said that, I still highly recommend this book to any Lewis fan, and definitely any Christian. We need to be able to provide answers to life's difficult questions, and Lewis is a great source of material for supplying the Christian world view."},{"Title":"The problem of pain","review":"What more can be said about C.S. Lewis... indeed!This book gets off to a slow rambling start as noted in a previous review but gets up to speed about a quarter of the way in. And once you are in the book is VERY mentally engaging (not one of Lewis's lighter books).Lewis tackles the big question: How can a supposedly loving God allow suffering?If you haven't asked that question yourself then you are probably too shallow to get into a book like this ;-)If you haven't been confronted with a question like that from someone else then you need to get out a bit more...Lewis tackles the big question with intellectual depth. However, some of the most interesting portions of the book come when Lewis allows his fertile and creative mind to speculate. For example, he touches on the pre-history of man before Adam which might be problematic for some but should given a chance...His short sidebar discussion on the purpose of pain in animals is wild and wacky (almost trippy) stuff that I had never thought about.His thoughts on hell and damnation are weak. Caution: I believe the final punishment for unrepentant sin is permanent death (or non-being)... so you may want to take me with a grain of salt.Anyhoo... if you like to have your brain stretched and tickled at the same time you might want to try this one. But I'd recommend you try some of his fiction first. My personal favorite of his fiction isTill We Have Faces: A Myth Retold, then try the more accessible apologeticMere Christianity.The Problem of Pain is a bit tougher to chew."},{"Title":"The problem of pain","review":"For a person who includes \\"Mere Christianity\\" in any list of my favorite books (most influential, most often read, etc.), I really haven't read much of C.S. Lewis's other work. I intend to remedy that, having just finished \\"A Grief Observed\\" and, more recently, \\"The Problem of Pain\\".As would be expected, the book is full of brilliant insights and Lewis's trademark logic and disarming wit. Consequently, it should be read by just about everyone, although it is probably not the best introduction to the subject for non-Christians.I held back one star only because Lewis's writings on the origins of sin and mankind are wildly speculative and arbitrary, and are founded on next to nothing. His views on the topic are further clarified in the chapter on animals, but just as I was starting to track with him, he tossed in a little more craziness. One of Lewis's usual strengths is a fresh and unorthodox perspective, but he gets a little out of hand for a stretch. My criticism is not that these portions of the book were not what I expected, but rather that they were not useful."},{"Title":"The problem of pain","review":"The Problem of Pain seeks to answer one of the most consistently asked questions about the Christian faith: why is there suffering and how is suffering possible in a universe created by a God that claims His goodness. Lewis, in what amounts to a very long essay, not only seeks to answer why pain and suffering are present in this world, but how this most negative of situations can actually be used for good in the lives of individuals facing affliction.Pain, whether physical or otherwise, is a problem to be explained precisely because things in the world do not seem right. The pain the Lewis addresses most are the pains caused by spiritual separation. While the pain caused by biological processes is bad, Lewis seems to indicate that much of the pain we suffer through is due to our rebellion against God and our inability and failure to achieve peace and happiness.For those with more modern literary tastes the important thing that Lewis carries away from his speculation is how the origin of pain is absolutely correlated to the dissolution and fall of man. The Biblical narrative's statement that by sin death entered the world is a short, yet profound statement of the origin of pain. By developing his speculative story of the origin of man, Lewis ultimately says that man has refused to communicate with God by natural means, and as a result God has agreed with man and cut man off from natural communication with Himself.Any issue dealing with pain in the lives of modern believers has to be addressed from two angles. The first is the necessity of encouraging an embattled group of people who are called out by and being changed by their Creator. The second deals with the unique challenges of the modern world where naturalistic and pantheistic tendencies point the believer inward to solve his problems of pain and suffering.For those in need of encouragement in the midst of suffering, Lewis is quick to point out that pain is often much to be preferred over many types of temporary pleasure. Here Lewis is consistent with much of Protestant thought in that any sort of sanctification is confined to the earthly life of the believer. All pain and suffering that is used as a sanctifying process ends in life, there is no possibility of Purgatory.The advances of the naturalism and scienticism of the modern world have for the first time led many to believe that pain can be solved successfully apart from the work of God. The generations, since the late 1800's, have believed as truth that men do not need God, and furthermore, that no sort of supernatural intervention will solve pain and suffering. From physicians to political peace brokers, much of the world has developed deep faith in its own ability to solve any natural pain or any pain caused by the suffering of others. The ever-increasing influence of pain and suffering upon modern man can be said to be inversely proportionate to the level that modern man believes he can escape from pain. The great value of The Problem of Pain is that it attempts to remind any who have a sense of arrogance about modern man that pain for them is God shouting above their pride so that they would recognize his sovereignty and His care for them."},{"Title":"The problem of pain","review":"I have been reading several of CS Lewis' books lately because I enjoy the way this man of great intellect and faith expresses the major doctrines of Christianity. He has a way of taking very difficult concepts and making them easy for me to understand. This book not only addresses why we have pain, but also explains several related doctrines more clearly than I have seen before.His discussions on the characteristics of God and his love were presented well. He talks about God having power to do what is intrinsically possible, not the intrinsically impossible. God cannot allow free will and also make sure there is no pain. A loving God does allow pain, just as a loving parent sometimes allows pain to help his child become wiser and stronger. A child that has been totally protected from pain or consequences is spoiled and does not reach his or her potential.From the above it appears that Lewis does strongly believe in free will, which does make the problem of pain much easier to comprehend. This happens to agree with my feelings on the subject. He also points out that we humans sometimes need pain to remind us of our need for God. I sometimes find myself forgetting to pray as often as I should when things are going smoothly; but I always seem to remember God when things are not going well.I strongly recommend this book for anyone wanting to understand why God allows pain. I don't agree with all of his arguments, but I thought they all were well presented and it got me thinking."},{"Title":"The problem of pain","review":"Even though this book is thin, it took me a long time to make it through the first 3 chapters because there is so much food for thought. Chapter 3 especially changed the way I look at things. This is an important read for anyone who has ever asked \\"Why me?\\" or said \\"It doesn't seem fair\\". Or even for anyone who wants to experience a level of writing far beyond the normal read. I bought this book and made it through chapter 3 before giving it away to a friend in need, and had to buy a new one because I was desperate to read the rest."},{"Title":"The problem of pain","review":"Excellent book by C. S. Lewis. Used for adult Bible Study discussion group."},{"Title":"The problem of pain","review":"According to the Author, Lewis took up the daunting task of trying to understand why pain exists if a good God exists too on a suggestion from a colleague. He notes in the book that figuring the problem of pain out started out as a duty, then quickly became an immense pleasure. Reading the book may give the reader the same progression of feelings. One may feel the urge to confront the deep question of pain and how that impacts one's faith is an obligation to be met grudgingly against one's will. However, while delving into the work, one will find it extremely pleasurable as the author reveals that there really isn't a problem of pain. The question eventually evolves from why, in a world created by a good and all-powerful God, is there pain and suffering to why, in some instances, is there a lack of pain.Lewis illustrates his resolution of this problem eloquently and sufficiently, though concisely. The book could be much longer and still not fulfill every but, though, or what if created by these major life concepts.I recommend \\"Mere Christianity\\" over this book, but suggest that this is a great supplement. While some ideas overlap, there is much to be learned by each book."},{"Title":"The problem of pain","review":"This book attempts to tackle the problem of evil from the perspective of Christain theology.

It is doubtful C.S. Lewis was ever more than agnostic, and not a very thoughtful one at that, in fact he seems to have been made out of straw.*He claims he thought the universe was completely dark. This is certainly false.*He claims he thought that the universe is \\"unimaginably cold\\". The universe is 3K. That is a very easily comprehensible number, especially when compared to absolute hot (Planck temperature).*Claims that celestial bodies are 'few'. This is mind numbingly stupid. He seems stunned that things might have a little space in between them.*Claims that few places support life, perhaps only Earth. We have discovered hundreds of planets and even by cautious estimates the Universe is boiling with life, some of it sentient.*Thinks in terms of millions of years. Cute.*States consciousness is necessary to feel pain. This is not obvious, and he does not try to justify himself.At this point I threw the book down in disgust and did not return to it. He's not worth your time."},{"Title":"The problem of pain","review":"Since God is Infinite Goodness, we must conclude that the appearance of reckless divine cruelty is a delusion. When we are comfortable, we are too shallow-minded to realize that we need God. Since God knows that He is the only thing that we really need, He inflicts pain upon us to wake us up to this fact. So pain is God's megaphone. If some people, such as the Jews, try to love God without going through Christ, it is not yet God - merely the best approximation their fantasy can attain. Hence poor God is forced to keep screeching at them through His megaphone. But even people who try their hardest to love the true God, such as Job, or C. S. Lewis for that matter, cannot adore God as much as He wants to be adored, so He uses pain over and over again to \\"plant the flag of truth within their rebellious souls.\\"Where does this notion of an Infinitely Good God come from? Given mankind's painful existence, \\"an inference from the course of events in this world to the Goodness and Wisdom of the Creator would be preposterous.\\" God had to reveal Himself to mankind by Revelation; thus it is in the likes of Abraham and Moses, who identified God as righteous, that all peoples are blessed. Lewis informs us that God expostulated with His own creatures on the basis of their own ethical conceptions - \\"What iniquity have your fathers found in me, that they are gone far from me?\\" One has to wonder if Lewis has ever actually read the Bible. Can anyone really deny that if a leader of today did exactly the sorts of things that Abraham and Moses did that they would be decried by all of sane mankind as monsters? I have never understood why, or how, I am supposed to pretend that this is not true. Of course, God is wiser than me, so if I could only see it from God's viewpoint, I would see that the butchery of whole populations, including babies and animals, was actually an act of love. In MERE CHRISTIANITY Lewis condemns this line of reasoning in eastern religions as \\"damn nonsense.\\" Undoubtedly, we get the impression of a just and loving God through the teachings of Christ, but the conviction that God is Infinite Goodness, Omniscience, and Omnipotence did not come from biblical revelation; it was developed by medieval Christian philosophers by reasoning through extrapolation -- a process that Lewis, rather inexplicably, deems impossible.Lewis's insistence that people have free will needs to be examined. Even as he describes it, since we are born in sin, we cannot use free will to avoid sin, and most people are blind to their sin. Hence, it logically follows that there can be no free will without the ability of self-perception. The evidence suggests that incessant pain, especially when inflicted upon children, destroys this ability. Abused children typically grow up to be abusers. In my own case, I adamantly insist it was the drug, marijuana, which first gave me introspective ability, at the age of 23. Prior to that moment, God knows that I had no free will. Free will is not a realized trait that we are born with, but a potential ability that requires a great deal of effort to develop. In most people it remains largely dormant. Since free will is dependent on self-knowledge, the role of religion needs to be the development of introspective ability. Dogmatic adherence can only hinder this.Lewis is at least honest enough to acknowledge evolution. Unfortunately, it is hardly possible to reconcile the notion of evolution of man from animals with his fairy-tale notion that animals only exist by destroying each other because they were corrupted by Satan before man's appearance on Earth. Somehow, the perfectly good \\"Paradisal Man\\" descended from animals already corrupted by Satan. Lewis can be abominably silly sometimes.Lewis is given to disjunctive, either/or, logic. Either the common human experience of supernatural awe is a mere twist in the mind with no biological purpose, or it is direct experience of the supernatural - a Revelation. I would once have scoffed at this, but a Numinous vision of Christ was the major turning point of my life. The problem is that this Revelation was not at all consistent with Mere Christianity. According to Lewis, the purpose of pain is to break our will, since it is our tarnished wills that keep us from God. I had only recently come to realize that I had not had free will until my sense of self was awakened by an illegal drug. I experienced Christ in the very moment that I was cursing Christ for demanding that I beg forgiveness for that which He was responsible. Albeit, at the time I was an atheist, and was only cursing at what I had been taught about Christ. I experienced Christ as the core of my being, not as an entity completely separate from myself, and as an awakening of will, not a surrender. Lewis assures me that the feeling of being one with God, rather than a creature of God, is Satan's ultimate deception. But I have also experienced Satan within myself. If Christ were not the core of my being, I would never have survived Satan. I know the difference. I do not acknowledge that Christianity has the authority tell me what my experience of God must be.I am a scientist by training, not given to superstitious credulity, however much like it what I have written above must sound. In my attempt to make sense of my experience of Christ and Satan battling within my mind, I have come up with the following myth: It is, at least, not completely unreasonable to assume that consciousness is an inherent quality of existence. This consciousness would first be in a primordial state, probably in some way responsible for evolution, though not by anything like intelligent design by direct control. There could be no distinction between good and evil; in fact the terms could have no meaning, until consciousness evolved to a complexity capable of self-awareness. As self-awareness developed, so did awareness of pain and terror, and a rebellion against achieving a level of awareness capable of experiencing pain. The human mind, as the vessel of consciousness experiences these antagonistic trends and, for whatever reason, tends to personify them as God and Satan, or their various cultural equivalents. What makes the Christian God so detestable is His complete refusal to accept responsibility for anything. Satan can therefore be described as \\"God's self-ignorance.\\" Buddhists are apparently able to put themselves into the conscious state of inanimate matter, hence there insistence that good and evil are identical. C. S. Lewis tells us that \\"it is not God's purpose that we should go back into that old identity.\\" I think I agree with him on this point. Mankind's goal must be to attain free will be becoming conscious of what we really are.(Peter Payne, author of CAPTAIN CALIFORNIA: A YOUNG MAN'S ENCOUNTER WITH THE EVIL WITHIN HIMSELF)"},{"Title":"The problem of pain","review":"Suffering is not an easy subject to approach. Humans are virtually incapable of approaching the topic objectively. We all have experienced suffering in some way. You may have felt it firsthand and/or you have empathized with a close friend. Suffering is an inescapable reality of life. We can try to run from it but it will always find us.I think it is valid to admit that the modern American has never truly experienced suffering. Even an individual classified as \\"poor\\" typically has some general education, enclosed shelter, access to adequate nutrition. In comparison, billions around the world live on less than dollar a day, have no guarantee of clean food and water, and no safe shelter to shield them from the elements and their enemies. However, we do understand that suffering is not always a physical attribute, in fact suffering in the soul can feel even crueler.C.S. Lewis, in my opinion, is one of the best thinkers in the twentieth century. His combined ability to think logically and communicate eloquently made him a superior scholar and an excellent apologist. Lewis recognizes that pain is a problem for a religion that believes God who is all-knowing, all-powerful, and most importantly all-loving.We agree God can do anything, but can the all-powerful overcome the impossible? Sunday school children love to ask the trick question, \\"Can God make a rock so big that He cannot lift it?\\" But to Lewis \\"nonsense remains nonsense even when you talk about God.\\" God cannot make a square with five edges because the rules indicate a square has four edges. God, though being all-powerful, has set the rules. In creation, He has given man free will and with free will the door to suffering is unlocked.\\"Trying to exclude the possibility of suffering which the order of nature and existence of free wills are involved, and you find that you have excluded life itself.\\" Creation with free will unfortunately leads to suffering. God allowed for the opportunity, and we as humans regrettably pounced on the chance.It is very clear that there is something very wrong with the world we live in. How in the midst of horrible suffering happening to us or around us did we ever come up with the idea of a loving God? God is real. This world is not our home. We will never be completely happy here because we will never be satisfied here. The one who satisfies is in Heaven where there is praise and no pain.This is a very deep book that requires a lot of reflection. This book does not answer all of my questions, but no book on suffering will."},{"Title":"The problem of pain","review":"C.S. Lewis first wrote this book in 1940. In this manuscript Lewis considers the problem of suffering from a theoretical and theological viewpoint. The existence of pain in a world created by a good and loving God is a fundamental dilemma and perhaps one of the most common objections to Christianity.Lewis touches on some very key points of basic theology. But, he does so in a way that is bold, informative and energizing.In discussing the omnipotent and good natures of God, Lewis wrestles with two ideas that no sinful human could begin to understand. He does a splendid job comparing created and Creator so as to remind us that because of our nature man can not comprehend God's. However, Lewis makes a valiant effort to help us get a better grasp on God's perfect love.The heart of the book is centered on a review of man. Lewis investigates the fall of man and man's wickedness and pain. Aware of the reader's humanity he reminds us that we are imperfect, sinful and contain no qualities that are redeeming to a perfect being. Our pain, while unpleasant, is in fact well deserved and compassionately lenient.The conclusion is not - why does God allow pain? But, instead - why does he allow any of us a respite from our suffering? There is nothing in man deserving of relief or reward, but, through the grace and mercy of God, He has determined that He will provide some of us an eternity free from pain. How sweet that will be."},{"Title":"The problem of pain","review":"C. S. Lewis has a masterful way of putting deep concepts into simple words and analogies. The \\"Problem of Pain\\" is an age-old question, asking how can God allow pain and suffering in his creation if he is indeed good and all-powerful. Though not providing a comprehensive answer, this book provides many of the write answers in a way that is accessible to any reader of teen years and beyond. Difficult questions deserve careful and clearly-communicated answers. This book provides just that."},{"Title":"The problem of pain","review":"It is somewhat inconceivable to think that the same man who authored \\"A Grief Observed\\" also penned a book about pain. But Lewis is honest about his task in regards to writing about pain, stating that \\"All arguments in justification of suffering provoke bitter resentment against the author.\\" This is perhaps why a \\"Grief Observed\\" is so incredible. In a \\"Grief Observed\\" Lewis writes about his own suffering (the lost of his wife) in stark detail, expressing his doubts about his faith and God. So in a sense, \\"The Problem of Pain\\" should be read juxtaposed to \\"A Grief Observed\\" since any resentment against the author will quickly dissipate with the turn of each page. Behold a man who could not avoid the problem he set out to justify. The \\"Problem of Pain\\" deals with the theoretical justification for pain; \\"A Grief Observed\\" is the application of that theory.In this book Lewis writes: \\"If I knew a way of escape [escape from suffering] I would crawl through sewers to find it. But what is the good of telling you about my feelings? You know them already: they are the same as yours. I am not arguing that pain is not painful. Pain hurts. That is what the word means. I am only trying to show that the old Christian doctrine of being made 'perfect through suffering' is not incredible. To prove it palatable is beyond my design.\\" Thus, Lewis sets out to give us a different perspective about suffering. He traces suffering back to the fall in Eden and Satan's reign in the world. Lewis also talks about human pain and animal pain. Lastly, Lewis switches voices as he discusses heaven and the restoration of the human soul.I'll admit that this book isn't an easy read. I'll be the first to admit that there are many things in this book that I have yet to understand. But I think that with more time and experience, I will be able to re-read this book and think, \\"Alas Lewis, I see.\\""},{"Title":"The problem of pain","review":"The pages are yellowing on my modest collection of C.S. Lewis paperbacks. I've read them several times over the years, and they ring as strong and true as the first time through them, if not more so.In the Problem of Pain, Lewis deals with the difficulty of suffering in a world created by a good and all powerful God. As a Catholic, I understand that suffering exists to bring about a greater good, but why is that? Basically, it comes down to our free will; if humans are beings free to choose and not simply automatons, we have to have the ability to go bad: we are self-absorbed rebels and, as Lewis explains, \\"the human spirit will not even begin to try to surrender self-will as long as all seems to be well with it.\\"There are plenty of great, informative reviews already written, but I just want to highlight two passages that stood out to me; I'm a sucker for dogs, so these both had added impact.The first passage is an analogy to help explain why pain is involved - even necessary - in God's plan for us to reach perfection:\\"Man interferes with the dog and makes it more lovable than it was in mere nature. In its state of nature it has a smell, and habits, which frustrate mans' love: he washes it, house-trains it, teaches it not to steal, and is so enabled to love it completely. To the puppy the whole proceeding would seem, if it were a theologian, to cast grave doubts on the 'goodness' of man: but the full-grown and full-trained dog, larger, healthier, and longer-lived than the wild dog, and admitted, as it were, by Grace to a whole world of affections, loyalties, interests, and comforts entirely beyond its animal destiny, would have no such doubts.\\"How true. House breaking must be a complete mystery to that furry, little, tail-wagging barbarian; and the concept of bathing must be as linked in the mind of a puppy to torture as food is to pleasure.Lewis continues:\\"It will be noted that the man takes all these pains with the dog, and gives all these pains to the dog, only because it is an animal high in the scale - because it is so nearly lovable that it is worth his while to make it fully lovable. He does not house-train the earwig or give baths to centipedes. We may wish, indeed, that we were of so little account to God that He left us alone to follow our natural impulses - that He would give over trying to train us into something so unlike our natural selves: but once again, we are asking for not more love, but less.\\"The next passage, near the end of the book, deals with the idea of vicariousness in Christianity. As we are saved and resurrected in the man Christ, so too, Lewis supposes, our pets may - may, mind you - be taken up through us as we are taken up through Christ:\\"And in this way it seems to me possible that certain animals may have an immortality, not in themselves, but in the immortality of their masters. And the difficulty about personal identity in a creature barely personal disappears when the creature is thus kept in its proper context. If you ask, concerning an animal thus raised as a member of the whole Body of the homestead, where its personal identity resides, I answer \`Where its identity always did reside even in the earthly life -- in its relation to the Body and, specially, to the master who is the head of that Body.' In other words, the man will know his dog: the dog will know its master and, in knowing him, will be itself. To ask that it should, in any other way, know itself, is probably to ask for what has no meaning. Animals aren't like that, and don't want to be.\\"Since reading that passage, I have often wondered, petting my dogs as they rest so blissfully on the couch, if one day I may find that in return for the adoration and companionship they have afforded me, if, in 'civilizing' them, I have not done a greater thing than I know."},{"Title":"The problem of pain","review":"There are things in life that can be learned which cannot be taught.For some of those things it is a matter of audience.I remember a song from a couple years ago which contained, roughly, \\"You never know what God is going to use to reach you.\\" In particular, there was a line about having to say goodbye to someone who left too soon.The moral of the song was, again roughly, \\"that which is bad, is actually good, when you belong to Jesus.\\"I think it is perfectly fine to have this realization *for yourself*.I can quite see someone in the grip of loss, steadfast in their faith, come to God and worship and cling to His sufficiency and providence.But I think this realization loses all of its power when you try to translate it to the 2nd person.\\"Hey, you should worship God because of this.\\"Whether this conveyance is true or not, the message is lost.The moral compass of the hearer almost becomes a raging beast, \\"What right have you to tell me to submit to this injustice.\\"That's why I didn't like the song much then.I like it even less today.This is because I now have a brother and a friend who have both been asked to make the sacrifice of Abraham, their child. Or if the analogy breaks down, because Abraham made a choice, the sacrifice of Job, which was to worship through the loss.So if one is going to talk about someone's pain, one is, from the outset, choosing to be indelicate. He is choosing to talk in 2nd person about those things which experienced in 1st person sweep one directly into the throes of existence and mortality.That said, The Problem Of Pain is about as delicately indelicate as can be achieved on the matter."},{"Title":"The problem of pain","review":"The intellectual problem raised by human suffering, examined with sympathy and realism from a Christian point of view.

Christianity contains a fourth element: A Redeemer who reconciles fallen mankind to the Righteous God.The chapter Divine Omnipotence places the problem in context: God's goodness against the problem of suffering. How can a loving God allow this? Here Lewis discusses the implications of free will and co-existence in a common medium or external world. The next chapter, Divine Goodness, deals with the nature of divine love. Love is sterner and more splendid than mere kindness. Simple happiness in the here and now is not what God has in mind. Love may cause pain but only in order to alter and improve the object of love.The chapter Human Wickedness looks at the state of the human psyche. Our character is, in its current state, not well. Lewis discusses our problems by examining a set of 8 very prevalent illusions. Following from this, The Fall Of Man investigates the abuse of free will while at the same time refuting Monism and Dualism. He suggests that the fall represented humanity's loss of status as a species, and that a new species had then willed itself into existence. But remedial or corrective good exists even in our present debased condition.The next two chapters deal with Human Pain. When souls become wicked they will use free will to harm one another. The human will becomes truly creative only when it aligns itself with the will of God. Christianity demands that we correct a misdirection of our nature. The author advances 6 propositions that are necessary to complete the understanding of human suffering.The chapter titled Hell addresses the seemingly cruel doctrine of hell.

The author also discusses the apparent disproportion between eternal damnation and transitory sin, pointing out that some souls do not want to be forgiven.The chapter Animal Pain is speculation as Lewis admits, but such fascinating and plausible possibilities are presented here. If you love your pets and animals in general, be sure to read it! It will give you hope and peace of mind as to the mercy and justice of a righteous God.The chapter titled Heaven contains more speculation but of a most awesome, gripping and mind expanding nature. Lewis explores the idea of an eternal special relationship of each individual soul with the Divine Majesty, an eternal dance of joy in splendid diversity. This is not the unconscious nirvana of Pantheism but a condition of maximum distinctiveness of the individual in a higher form reunited with God.The Appendix is a note on the observed effects of mental and physical pain, supplied by R Havard, MD, from clinical experience.

C.S. Lewis was a real skeptic and agnostic for much of his life and only slowly came to belief in Christ. His writing reflects that struggle with none of the glib self-satisfaction of so many writing \\"Christian\\" books. His ideas about pain and how it relates to our ideas about God are not unique to Christians or only applicable in that context. I think this is a book for people who are searching, who don't know what their faith is and how to proceed in the world. This is a book about also ideas. Lewis speaks honestly about his own Christian faith and eloquently about ideas themselves but I don't think his work attempts to force or presuposes that you have reached any conclusions about religion God, life's meaning - infact his argument almost starts from the position of atheism - Lewis is also a great story teller - see Screwtape Letters, Narnia, etc."},{"Title":"The problem of pain","review":"I consider this little book on a par with the author's well-known classic Mere Christianity, as it addresses many profound questions that those in search of truth must have grappled with.

That is, Lewis makes no attempt to separate God from the problem of pain, in fact, apart from certain classic theological ideas, the suffering of 'conscious' beings (humans) cannot be coherently understood as being a \\"problem\\" at all. In an atheistically meaningless universe, the concept of suffering is meaningless, thus the awareness of a pain \\"problem\\" can only be addressed theologically. Although he modestly suggests that others might offer better theological arguments, it seems that Lewis argues plausibly, rationally and soundly. The following sentences present, generally and briefly, one of Lewis' more famous arguments:\\". . . anyone who has watched gluttons shoveling down the most exquisite foods as if they did not know what they were eating, will admit that we can ignore even pleasure. But pain insists on being attended to. God whispers to us in our pleasures, speaks in our conscience, but shouts in our pain: it is His megaphone to rouse a deaf world.\\" (p 91) \\"While what we call 'our own life' remains agreeable we will not surrender it to him. What then can God do in our interests but to make 'our own life' less agreeable to us, and take away the plausible source of false happiness?\\" (p 94) \\"How can I say with sufficient tenderness what here needs to be said? It does not matter that I know I must become, in the eyes of every hostile reader, as it were, personally responsible for all the sufferings I try to explain . . . (p 95) \\" . . . [God] is not proud, He stoops to conquer, He will have us even though we have shown that we . . . come to Him because there is 'nothing better' now to be had.\\" (p 96) \\"Those who would like the God of Scripture to be more purely ethical, do not know what they ask. If God were a Kantian, who would not have us till we came to him from the purest and best motives, who could be saved? And this illusion of self-sufficiency may be at its strongest in some very honest, kindly, and temperate people, and on such people, therefore, misfortune must fall.\\" (p 96) \\" . . . but from our present point of view it ought to be clear that the real problem is not why some . . . people suffer, but why some do not. Our Lord Himself, it will be remembered, explained the salvation of those who are fortunate in this world only by referring to the unsearchable omnipotence of God.\\" (p104)Other problems and arguments are treated, but the approach is not exhaustive. Lewis doesn't intend it to be; he merely wants to address certain obvious questions (and he does this quite ably). As I read this I concurrently read J. C. Polkinghorne's \\"Quarks, Chaos & Christianity\\" which addresses the problem of pain as well as the problem of \\"natural evil\\" -- as each relate to the concept of freedom. Some say that Polkinghorne thinks as Lewis would have if he had been a quantum physicist; so if you find yourself agreeing with Lewis or at least intrigued by his arguments, I'll suggest you read Polkinghorne as well."},{"Title":"The problem of pain","review":"In this classic by C.S. Lewis, the writer's brilliance really shows. Aside from his somewhat speculative approach to applying Eden to evolution and the way he treated Heaven and Hell as the final destinations rather than resurrection with New Heavens/New Earth, this book is excellent. I was inspired, challenged and strengthened by the reading, and will certainly read it again sometime down the road."},{"Title":"The problem of pain","review":"Probably less appealing (than, say, Mere Christianity) because Lewis is needing to be more \\"lateral\\" here, more horizontal, more earthbound. There is nothing merely inspirational about his book, in other words, since it is taking as its subject a pretty serious philosophical problem.I'm not a hundred percent on board with reviewers who insist that one must be a Christian to appreciate this book. But an openmindedness to thoughts about a deity, and some grasp that humility and submission can be good things, that one can learn from them, are probably essential qualities to bring to this reading. No proud atheist will be satisfied by these arguments.For my money, Lewis is at his best here when speculating about the afterlife. His subjective version of heaven, as a place where personal joys are extended and sustained, is so much more appealing than centuries of talk about streets of gold, or harps and clouds. He has a way of making heaven meaningful, a place you'd like to be."},{"Title":"The problem of pain","review":"This was a very good overview of the problem of evil and how to respond to it from a Christian viewpoint. Lewis does quite well in most of his chapters making solid Christian points. Yet he loses me in his chapter entitled \\"Animal Pain\\" wherein he SEEMS to identify that some animals have not only sentience but a sufficient amount of conciousness to almost be considered moral beings. He then describes a version of animal \\"heaven\\" wherein tame animals are incorporated into their masters as we are incorporated into God. Strange stuff indeed.Besides this though, the book is quite splendid, with a great explanation of God's omnipotence and His omnibenevolence."},{"Title":"The problem of pain","review":"In picking up this volumne it has been a long time since I read anything by C.S. Lewis. I had forgotten how logic oriented he is and how these writing of his can be very academic and intellectually stimulating. I picked this volumne up because of dealing with many people and the pain they are feeling with depression.Lewis does a great job of academically addressing the issue of pain in relationship to our emotions. This is not a book about addressing physical pain, for such a book pick up Joni Erickson's new book, the problem with pain. This book deals with how we as Christians handle the aspect of pain in regards to suffering, relationships, anxiety, depression and extreme emotionally turmoil.Lewis does a good job of addressing the issue, although at times I think he is far ranging in his dialogue. He addresses the issue of God's omipotence and His goodness. He does an extremely good job of this. Then he moves on to the issue of human wickedness and human pain. The logical progression of his arguments are good. Although it doesn't appear that his dialogue is from a personal experience but from an academic intellectual pursuit.Just when I thought he was going pretty deep he had one of the funniest quotes I think I can ever write down and use. In discussing the issue of pain with animals he sarcastically is writing about how some people want to believe that all animals go to heaven and have souls and have feelings. He doesn't quite buy into that. But here is his quote that I love, \\"if the worst came to worst, a heaven for mosquitoes and a hell for men could very conveniently be combined.\\" I wholeheartedly agree!But probably the main point of his argument is this, all Christians will suffer. He doesn't ask, \\"Why do good people suffer?\\" Instead he asks, \\"why don't all Christians suffer?\\" He sees suffering and pain as the way for God to help us grow in our spiritual walk with Him.This book is for every Christian. But it is not light reading. It takes discipline to read, think and then digest what C.S. Lewis is writing. But it will be a good exercise.Once you have read this you need to follow it up by reading his book, \\"A Grief Observed\\", that will be the one that you find absolutely riveting in regards to how he personally deals with suffering, grief and pain.Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The problem of pain","review":"I think this was the first book by Lewis I had exposure to. I was 15 to 16 years old, and I remember not being able to know what I was reading, but falling in love with however it was being said. It was through this book that I came to love not just Lewis, but reading in general. Over time, I became a better reader and this book has had a huge impact on my life.I shall never forget reading the first couple paragraphs of the chapter on Heaven. I remember reading them over and over again, cherishing how true his longings mirrored my own. I remember pulling aside anyone I could get a hold of and reading this beautiful passage. Almost without fail, whenever I read these passages to others, they are stricken with delight, and touched by that same stab of joy Lewis himself felt all those years ago as a child in Ireland.As a philosopher major, I can testify to Lewis' philosophical abilities. He is an able philosopher with remarkable philosophical intuitions. He is one of the finest writer of pros I've come across, and his style has made me fall in love with the English language.As for the content, Lewis probes one of the deepest mysteries in life: the riddle of pain in a Christian universe. And there are no easy answers. Having read Plantinga, van Inwagen, and Alston, though these world-class philosophers do great, I prefer Lewis. There is a tone in Lewis' pros that is almost deliciously Christ-like, a sweet aroma that makes you feel like you're being talked to by someone who isn't here to mock you or make you feel stupid. He is here - as he once said - like a patient in the same hospital, who has been here a little longer, and has learned some tips on how to cope.His chapter on Animal Pain is the most speculative (as he admits), but his speculations are thought provoking, taking away from the beasts self-consciousness, leaving them with sentience. The logic is that if you take away self-consciousness, the beast can't discern an 'I' which experiences successive states of pain: in other words, there is no 'I' to connect together all the successive pain states.The Fall entertains Lewis' theory about how the rational faculties - once man disobeyed - sunk beneath the tide of the passions and became subject to them, all within the historical context of biological evolution: once man evolved sufficiently, rational capacities were directly implanted by God, giving us the Adam and Eve of Scripture.The Chapter on Hell was the most unclear to me, even after the Peter Kreeft commmentary you can find in his books on Heaven. In Hell, the 'I' is abolished, and so there is no unifying 'I' to tie together the various facets of the soul, like a book without a spine, the pages eternally blown away. Time is no longer linear succession or progression - time stops growing in length, and the soul somehow lingers in this eternal final instant where - mysteriously - the soul is destined to linger in time's eternal width. If you imagine time as a line, then eternity in Hell is like a plane; or if you imagine time as a plane, then eternity is like a cube. Just as the plane is a dimension of the cube, time is a dimension of eternity.As you can see, Lewis' speculations build upon the speculations of past philosophies about these issues. Lewis confesses to be standing on the shoulder's of giants, and when he himself is a titan, we are able to see very far indeed.The best thing about Lewis is that even if you disagree with him, the presentation is given in a logical order, with clearly written pros, illuminating analogies, and penetrating insights into the human condition.A must read!"},{"Title":"The problem of pain","review":"C.S. Lewis is never light reading. He is highly educated and challenges the intellect. Which is good. Especially for a topic such as this.He explains the age old question - If God is Good, and if God is all powerful, and if God is loving, then why is there pain and suffering in the world?Lewis starts out presenting the problem. He explains that if there was no God, then there would be no problem. If life is mere chance, then the fact that there is pain would be a non-issue.So where did we come up with this idea of a good and loving God? Certainly not by looking around us! Pain, suffering and injustice are older than recorded history.He then proceeds to explain that in a universe where the creatures have free will, there is going to be a chance that one of us its going to hurt someone else. For example, God made wood which can be used for many purposes. It can be used to make fine furniture; or to make a baseball bat which can be used for fun, or can be used to hurt someone else.This is an excellent book for anyone who wants to be able to explain the problem of pain to themselves, or to those who who are skeptical or searching."},{"Title":"The problem of pain","review":"Lewis deals with a timeless issue in this book: why is there suffering and pain? In the UK, this issue has come centre stage in moral debates. Should a being being permitted to exist if its life is destined to be one of \\"useless\\" suffering.There was an article in the paper about a year ago about a couple who had a child with cystic fibrosis and wanted through IVF to conceive a child free of this nasty disease. Through the \\"miracle\\" of science, they were enabled to screen out any embryos with the disease so that they could have a \\"perfect\\" child. The logic for this was, so they said: \\"why would anyone want anyone to suffer\\" (aside: what would their existing child with CF be now thinking: it would have been better that I had not existed?) as if all who suffer, would wish not to be rather than to be. This kind of thinking is becoming indemic. It is a rejection of the truth which shines forth luminously from every human being, a truth which causes the beholder to say: \\"It is indeed wonderful that you exist\\"And, this is where Lewis comes in with an attempt at answering the question of: \\"why is there suffering\\"?:\\"The problem of reconciling human suffering with the existence of a God who loves, is only insoluble so long as we attach a trivial meaning to the word \\"love\\", and look on things as if man were the centre of them. Man is not the centre, God does not exist for the sake of man. Man does not exist for his own sake\\".Thus, love has become associated with a soft type of sentimentality in our culture; but it is much greater than that: it actively seeks for the good of the person loved - love may thus permit suffering to enable the person loved to become a person, who is himself capable of self emptying love. Lewis notes: \\"We are not merely imperfect creatures who must be improved; we are, as Newman said, rebels who must lay down our arms\\".Lewis does not shrink from giving suffering its due: \\"No doubt pain as God's megaphone is a terrible instrument; it may lead to final and unrepented rebellion. But it gives the only opportunity the bad man can have for amendment. It removes the view; it plants the flag of truh within the fortress of a rebel soul\\"In a word, suffering destroys our self delusion that we are in control, that we are demi-gods: when we suffer, we know where we are and its not at the centre of the universe.Thus, whilst suffering (be it physical, natural or emotional), is an effect of evil, being a privation of the good, it can lead us to a recognition of our creaturely place in the universe and hence to find out true \\"orientation\\".On hell, Lewis states; \\"I willingly believe that the damned are, in one sense, successful rebels to the end; that the doors of hell are locked on the inside\\"Lewis is very good indeed in this book; he synthesises brillianty key christian doctrines coherently and intelligibly.Brilliant!"},{"Title":"The problem of pain","review":"While some (including myself) would disagree with Lewis on some parts of the book, the profound insights more than make up for the differences.

He is always accessible to ordinary people like me because of his plain-spokenness and his willingness to use analogies and examples. That said, he had his work cut out for him here, and he wasn't up to the task. Here's where he fell short.* \\"If the universe is so bad...how on earth did human beings come to attribute it to the activity of a wise and good Creator?\\" (p 17). This is a straw man and a non sequitur. It's a straw man because the universe isn't bad. Viewed one way, it merely *is.* Viewed another way, parts of our universe are good (sex, love, family, football) and parts are bad (pain, loss, despair, death). It's a non sequitur because there is no logical link between the universe and Lewis' implication that because we can conceive of the Good, Good therefore must exist. It would make just as much sense to say that because humans have conceived of a movie where aliens come to earth that therefore E.T. must exist.* Lewis uses the reasoning that because we, humans, have a conception of proper conduct, with only some variation among cultures, that this must mean that God has given us morality (p 21). In response, I note that if morality is externally imposed on us as a fixed law of nature, then there would be no variation in it, or else God would be inconsistent. It would be like having the sun shine for one person but not the person right next to him. Moreover, there is a simple anthropological explanation for basic moral conduct. Conduct that perpetuates the family or group over time is more successful than conduct that harms the family or group. That's why the Hottentots, who immorally kill their \\"excess\\" babies, remain a small group, while the rest of humanity has grown.* The key part of the book is Lewis' attempt to resolve the problem of pain inflicted on people by forces of nature, i.e., pain experienced by a person, inflicted by a force not engaging in human free will. Lewis attempts to answer this particular dilemma by essentially arguing that the nature of reality requires this type of pain to exist: \\"Try to exclude the possibility of suffering which the order of nature...involve[s], and you will find you have excluded life itself\\" (pp 33-34, see also p 54).Frankly, Lewis' conclusion doesn't make sense. Let's take a plausible example from the 2004 Tsunami that killed more than 250,000 people, many of them children. A child is the least morally culpable type of person, I think everyone can agree. So: a three-year-old child is drowning in the tsunami, screaming for help that never comes, gasping, choking, in utter terror as he vainly attempts to catch a breath of air. He drowns after experiencing four or five minutes of torture and fear. Lewis is saying the child *had* to suffer this way -- that reality would grind to a halt if he didn't? Lewis himself in this very discussion admits God performs miracles when it suits him (p 34) but somehow God can't alter reality so that this child does not suffer?Lewis attempts to buttress his position by arguing that to take away pain totally would be like playing chess with a player who could change the rules at his whim (p 34). That might make sense when discussing pain caused through free will, but not when discussing pain caused by nature. He inappropriately analogizes the impersonal forces of nature to a free-willed individual, the chess player.* \\"When the relevant difference between the Divine ethics and your own appears to you...the change demanded of you is in the direction you already call \`better'\\" (p 39). In response, I point out one of the classic clashes between human ethics and divine ethics presented in the bible: the sacrifice of Isaac by Abraham. Gen. 22:1-2. Is Mr. Lewis really telling us that our moral compass will tell us that offering our children as sacrifices is in the direction of \\"better\\"? Which is more important -- following our morals or being obedient to God? Lewis can't make up his mind, first saying the former (pp 38-39), then the latter (pp 101-102).* \\"[L]ove may cause pain to its object, but only on the supposition that the object needs alteration to become fully loveable\\" (pp 55, 91-92). While that may be true in some circumstances -- \\"For whom the LORD loveth he correcteth\\" Prov. 3:12 -- it certainly doesn't make sense when it comes to the suffering of children. Does a baby really need to die screaming in agony in that house fire in order for God to fully love it? Ridiculous. Outrageous. Monstrous. Contemptible.Lewis can throw in the towel, and claim that spiritual realities are not \\"even explicable in terms of our abstract thought\\" (p 86). Or he can cherry-pick his examples on pain by claiming that free will necessarily must include pain (pp 32-31, 81-82) and we need pain to whip us, adults, into shape morally (pp 55, 104-107, 120). Fine. But don't pretend the existence of pain can be satisfactorily answered if you can't answer the problem of pain inflicted by nature on children. Every, EVERY scenario in which pain is felt and inflicted must be satisfactorily answered, or the premise of a loving, personal God, fails.Personally, I think the only real response to the problem of pain is the one God gave to Job: \\"Shut up.\\" See Job 38:1 - 40:2."},{"Title":"The problem of pain","review":"This book can change the way you view things, if you let it. If you are looking for a book that is relevant now, as it was when it was written, and will be relevant still in 100 years, read this book. And then re-read it often. CS Lewis was ahead of his time...still is. Awesome book."},{"Title":"The problem of pain","review":"The Problem of Pain is the first of C.S. Lewis's apologetic works. Having been an athiest(or maybe just a skeptic?) ten years before, Lewis certainly had walked through this problem on his own and in 1940 wanted to help many of his fellow British skeptics through it, too.The book starts, after a disclaimer on his lack of theological schooling, with an explaination of selves that are distinct from God and a description of the fall of man before tackling human pain. His basic argument is that, while human pain is a result of Adam's Fall, God uses it for our good to A)alert us that something is wrong with the universe and B)to refine Christians into better people. Lewis does admit that while pain can \\"rouse the bad man to a knowledge that all was not well\\" it can also \\"lead to final and unrepented rebellion\\". He finishes with a very good explaination of Hell,\\"the doors of hell are locked on the inside\\" and an equally good chapter on Heaven.This is a book for those who are struggling with the \\"idea\\" of pain; in other words, \\"If God is so good why does allow people to be in pain and even send some of them to Hell?\\" But if your question is more concrete, like \\"Why did God allow my husband to die from a fatal illness?\\" you will probably find this book to be like salt in a wound. If that's you I would recomend Lewis's other book on pain, A Grief Observed, or Philip Yancy's Where is God when it Hurts. The Problem of Pain is certainly an excellent piece of apologetics, however, and I found it to be very helpful."},{"Title":"The problem of pain","review":"I think it is Lewis' point that this life on planet earth involves a series of good events intersperced with very painfult ones. We start this life with few of its bumps and terrors. [Even embryos can absorb painful events if they survive at all.] God seeks to create man as one with whom He can have companionship so He does not want to control the creation. Man struggles through random events of pain and sorrow but also of beauty and joy. Man develops his own character during the course of his life. In this way God creates man with character by letting man develop it himself but using pain, sorrow, beauty and joy supplied by God's creation. One of the mysteries of the universe is how we can take with us through death the character God wants for his companionship."},{"Title":"The problem of pain","review":"Lewis effectively and poignantly analyzes the age-old &quot;Problem of Pain.&quot; The logos of his reasoning never falters, but goes hand-in-hand with the pathos of his telling. More still, he effectively establishes his ethos by being uniquely qualified to disect the problem, having suffered much on his own, popularly known to have lost his wife to cancer.This book, an enlightening pleasure, helps the reader understand pain, why it occurs, and why it is necessary."},{"Title":"The problem of pain","review":"Lewis wrote this book in 1940, twenty years before his wife Joy died of cancer. After this experience he wrote \\"A Grief Observed\\". \\"The Problem of Pain\\" begins \\"Not many years ago when I was an atheist ... \\". Thus, with first hand experience of the view that pain and an Almighty God cannot co-exist, Lewis plainly sets out the \\"problem\\": \\"If God were good, He would make His creatures perfectly happy, and if He were almighty He would be able to do what he wished. But the creatures are not happy. Therefore God lacks either goodness, or power, or both.\\"From here he takes the reader on a journey that does not merely attempt to tackle the co-existence of God and pain, but scrutinses the very concepts of God, pain, love and happiness. Later, in \\"A Grief Observed\\", what was (relatively) impersonal writing on a theological dilemma in \\"The Problem of Pain\\" becomes a personal testimony."},{"Title":"The problem of pain","review":"I would recommend this book--The Problem of Pain--very strongly to the Christian reader. Certainly, the thrust of this book is NOT to convince agnostics and atheists of the validity of the Christian platform, and anyone choosing to live in the Fool's Paradise that is agnosticism will come away from a reading of this book just as incredulous and empirically-minded as before. As any well-versed Christian knows, a testimony of God and of Christ comes not through study and reason alone. Any agnostic or atheist wishing to investigate the fundamental claims of Christianity would be better off studying C.S. Lewis' \\"God in the Dock,\\" or \\"The Grand Miracle\\"(an abridged version of \\"God in the Dock\\").Chiefly, I think that this book is meant to help Christians--or those with Judeo-Christian leanings--to reconcile the existence of pain with the realities of God's mercy, benevolence, and grace. Christians--and people of many other religions--believe life in the universe to be the result of a deliberate and calculated act of creation (nothing random or irrational, as the agnostics postulate). In light of this fact, a great number of Christians wonder why God would knowingly and intentionally create a world in which pain and sin had the possibility of being introduced.Lewis very accutely observes, in this book, that free will--while certainly POSSIBLE without the option to commit evil--would be utterly WORTHLESS without the option to commit evil. As I have prayerfully contemplated this doctrine, I have come to know if its truth. For instance, when my father or mother told me--and still tell me--that they love me, it was and is deeply meaningful because I know that they CHOOSE to love me. If all my parents could possibly have done was love me, with no active decision on their part to do so, their love would have no meaning. They COULD have chosen to abandon or abuse me, but they did not. And that gives meaning, indeed, to all of their love and nurturing. We do not congratulate fish for breathing under water, after all (it's the only way they possibly can breathe!).Lewis also observes, with emphasis, the fact that Jesus Christ could only have been one of two things: A lunatic or a God. The combined multitude of witnesses that knew Him--according to both Scriptural and Non-Scriptural documentation--affirm that if there was one thing Jesus constantly declared it was His own Godhood, and His Sonship to God the Father. When all of the evidence is taken into account, the representation universally set forth is that Jesus of Nazareth claimed to be God. Some denied it, some believed it, but all knew that this was, at least, His claim.And, of course, all things taken into consideration, only a madman would have even the slightest inclination to make such claims unless the claims were true. Jim Jones and David Koresh are two primary examples of men who falsely claimed to be God, and who were, as is undoubtedly known, both certifiably insane.Lewis makes the point, also, that with pain comes humility, and with humility comes receptiveness to God. If we were never to experience pains or disappointments in life, we would always take our blessings and gifts for granted. Either that, or we would worship the gifts (blessings) instead of the Gift-giver (God).The point is also made--and it agrees perfectly with Emerson's essay on the Law of Compensation--that every \\"loss\\" in life is, in reality, a sacrifice offered to the acquisition of something else: If a man loses his left arm, he develops an impressivley strong right arm; If a woman loses a husband to death, she is relieved of her duties as wife, and thus is free to go about doing other things.Finally, the Tester and the tested are both positively identified. Unfortunately, many--including some professed Christians--assume to be testing God. If, for example, they read in the newspapers of an elderly man shot down and robbed by thugs, they will say, \\"God failed him.\\" But, the fact is, through all of the tribulations and turmoils of life, WE are the ones being tested, NOT God. God is already the paragon of absolute perfection. We, on the other hand, must prove ourselves in the test that is life (and, in the case of thugs robbing elderly men, such thugs fail the test quite horribly).To love and adore God in a perfect world--a world without pain or opposition--would be no major accomplishment. But, to love and adore Him in spite of all temptation and adversity is a most supreme accomplishment.This is a most praiseworthy book!"},{"Title":"The problem of pain","review":"It is works like this that will have C.S. Lewis ranked, in the future, with thinkers like Augustine and Aquinas. The book is very \\"readable\\" but must be re-read over and over to start to get a hold of the momentous implications of the ideas he is proposing. Do the work to try and comprehend the message and you will be rewarded with a far greater sense of personal peace in this suffering world. Changed my life 14 years ago. Changing my life again as I read it now.There are astounding ideas captured in words. For example, in answer to people saying that they couldn't believe in a God who needed our worship, comes a lucid response about how God doesn't need us, but humbles himself for us to relate to. Lewis writes:\\"A man no more diminishes God's glory by not worshipping Him, than a lunatic can put out the sun by writing the word \\"Darkness\\" on the walls of his cell\\""},{"Title":"The problem of pain","review":"The only goal of my brief and amateur review is to simply express my unqualified opinion of what the reader should expect to find within the pages of this amazing work of literary art. To quote directly from C.S. Lewis himself \\"What I am now going to say is merely an opinion of my own without the slightest authority, which I submit to the judgment of better Christians and better scholars than myself.\\" Even worse, Lewis actually was a scholar, and I am not.As you may suppose from the title, The Problem of Pain is not a lighthearted work designed to keep the passive reader entertained while he waits for a flight, or passes time in the library. It is not meant to be read in one sitting, nor is it meant to be skimmed over for the highlights. There is no point in this book where the reader suddenly realizes that he has already \\"figured this out\\", or \\"gotten what he needs\\". This book is meant to be read in a quiet, even peaceful, place where your mind can focus on the depth of the material and allow the concepts and theological analyses to sink in completely. It is a book that will cause you, or at least it caused me, to go back and reread paragraphs or entire chapters because you suddenly realized he lost you ten minutes ago. In short, it is much like the second half of \\"Mere Christianity\\", it can be a tough read.Another thing you may infer from the title is that this book may be ideal for someone who is in a season of difficulty or pain in their life right now. In my humble opinion, it is not that kind of book. This material is for those who are seeking a greater understanding of the evil, suffering, and pain in this world. To rethink the Fall of Man and the Doctrine of Original Sin, the effects of the natural world, and ultimately to begin to consider the realities of Heaven and Hell.It is a tool to be used in the education of a Christian adult who is trying to more deeply understand this fallen world, how we got here, and what lays ahead. To prepare a person to be ready for whatever challenges this broken world may bring. It is not a book to comfort the grieving widow or widower with flowery and fanciful, yet understandably comforting, prayers of strength and fortitude as they struggle with their grief. I see nothing in these pages that would comfort the parent of a sick or dying child, if read from their perspective deep within such unimaginable anguish. It is no good to bolster the foundation and board up the windows after a hurricane. That is the time to pick up pieces and rebuild. This book is for the calm before the storm, it is to set a deeper foundation and ready the steel shutters that allow the house to withstand the forces of the storms of life. It is an essential tool in the mature yet still developing Christians belt to help him more confidently and faithfully face the realities of evil in a world full of fallen men and the ultimate mixed blessing, free will.The Problem of Pain addresses one of the most difficult objections to Christianity in a very clear and thought provoking way. You may find the tact to be quite direct, and less than gentle, which is precisely why this is not a book for those currently in a painful season. For those people, and in time we shall be one of them, there are far more gentle and consoling books available. One last thought on this, it is also possible that this book is for those who have had great suffering in their past, and are now trying to come to grips with it, and move forward in, or even return to, their walk with Christ. For that application though, be gentle and consider all that I have said before giving this book as a gift to a healing soul.In summary, I recommend this book to anyone who is seeking to become closer to God by gaining a more clear understanding of His Word, His world and His people. It is for those who seek answers to the difficult questions, whether for their own edification, or to be prepared to defend the Faith when called upon to do so. Jesus Himself said to \\"...bring you mind\\", and this book requires you to do just that.-------------------Side note: Before he was saved by Christ, C.S. Lewis was an atheist. This is of little importance now because once he was saved he became one of the best and most prolific advocates of Christianity in literary history. In the \\"introduction\\" of this book, Lewis gives what had previously been his response to the question, \\"Why do you not believe in God?\\". His answer consists of one long paragraph taking a little more than one page of the book. That answer is one of the most difficult passages I have ever read, and far from being a convincing argument for atheism, it gives the reader a very clear example of how truly blessed we are to have our Faith in a loving God. The other option is nothing less than horrific."},{"Title":"The problem of pain","review":"As a dentist I've had the opportunity to treat several patients with chronic idiopathic oral-facial pain. While I can access the best scientific medical literature in the world on the topic I am consistently reminded of the spiritual aspects of pain by my patients.

Lewis, we are challenged to see a loving and omnipotent Creator despite the obvious dilemma represented in the human condition and the many faces of pain. I can't imagine trying to offer empathetic and genuine care to my patients who live in the shadow land of chronic pain without the grounding Lewis offers in this short, yet magnificent book.

I read this book to help myself understand the pains in my life and found it extremely useful. I also found it helpful in explaining pain to others, especially those who are not Christians. Lewis helped me to see &quot;why do bad things happen to good people&quot; and sparked an interest in me to study Christianity all the more."},{"Title":"The problem of pain","review":"A quick warning to those who have been pointed to this book but are not Christian: you are not the audience Lewis is speaking to. This book cannot be fully grasped in its original context without some degree of belief or acceptance of Christian doctrine. It is apologetics at its best, but cannot be considered in the \\"self-help\\" category like many contemporary titles are.That said, this must be the finest treatise on the apparent contradiction between the existence of pain and the existence of a supposedly loving God that has been written.Succint, well-organized, thorough, yet \\"The Problem of Pain\\" still reads like it was written by a human being rather than a scholar. Some chapters bring conviction. The chapter on Hell brings fear and dread, and respect for Him who can \\"destroy both body and soul in Hell\\". The chapter on Heaven, which Lewis admits is his own philosophical foray, no one else's -- brings hope and reassurance that Heaven is your true calling, your one True Home.This is not light reading, at least not at first. This may not be a book to recommend to someone at the height of a crisis; Lewis taxes your attention and does not take any short cuts. A \\"Cliff Notes\\" version of this book would miss the point. Pain is one of the toughest theological problems a Christian can face, either in their lives or the life of another person they know -- and Lewis does not want you going in armed with half an argument or some \\"Precious Moments\\" sentiment.From a non-Christian POV, I would be surprised if this book made much sense -- so many of the pillars are set on Christian theology, philosophy, and tradition. If you cannot (or will not) accept the possibility of the existence of Heaven, Hell, or God, this book will be just so much incomprehensible babble.But, as I said, it is not written for that segment of the market. This book is best read by the thinking Christian who has reservations about aspects of Christianity that seem to gloss over, avoid, or ignore the issue of human suffering."},{"Title":"The problem of pain","review":"Lewis analyzes the fundamental question, or problem, of pain: how can God be omnipotent and yet allow pain (war, injury, cruelty, etc.)? Lewis's answer has many levels. Foremost, is that nature had to be created with certain unchangeable properties. For example, the same hardness which allows wood to serve as a beam in my house allows it to serve as an instrument of potential injury, as when that beam collapses and hits my head.The world also had to be created neutral so that humans could interact equally with one another, i.e., those same, unchanging properties of wood allow it to be manipulated similarly by anyone. But, obviously a neutral world contains the potential for good or evil. Wood can be used to build a home, which is good, or to create a weapon, which is evil. But, this is what makes us human. We have free will.If I choose evil, God could not intervene. For to intervene some times but not others would be unjust and illogical (this is why miracles, if you believe in them, are extraordinarily rare). And to intervene once is to intervene always. Imagine if God intervened each time one person was going to cause another, or himself, pain. If he did, we all would be puppets, not humans.Another interesting idea in this book is that of Original Sin. According to Lewis, we have not inherited Adam's sin, as is commonly believed, but instead everyday face Adam's identical choice, perhaps thousands of times a day. For Adam's sin was not disobedience in eating the apple, but in choosing himself over God. Adam had the opportunity to see himself either as a creation or an individual self existing apart from God. Thus, according to Lewis, a final reason for pain, is that it is God's wake-up call that we have, in constantly choosing ourselves, chosen the wrong thing.This is a profound and provocative book."},{"Title":"The problem of pain","review":"This book clarified many issues in my life and turned my God from One that was a bit of a stretch to fit into my everyday world, into a God which makes himself evident in every aspect of the earth, evil and pain included. I think this book frankly is a better apology for Christianity than Mere Christianity. Definitely a good introduction to the problem of pain, and the clearest exposition of the free-will defense I have read. C.S. Lewis deals with a concept lofty and philosophical in a manner that grips my attention and bolsters my faith. I recommend this book first above all Lewis' other books on theology."},{"Title":"The problem of pain","review":"I'm a blogger. Blogging makes me read. It makes me turn off the television and read. This is very good. What I have been reading lately is C. S. Lewis. Particularly, I've been re-reading The Chronicles of Narnia. After reading through The Magician's Nephew and The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe, I decided to shift gears and read one of Lewis's theological works before resuming the Chronicles.All I can say is, \\"Wow!\\" The Problem of Pain is not what I expected. I'm not sure what it was that I did expect. Perhaps something more along the line of a good evangelical book - you know, shallow, but with lots of Bible verses. Pain is exactly the opposite. Deep and with very little use of prooftexting. How the Church of the twenty-first century needs more minds like C. S. Lewis! We have been drowning in the fluff of \\"make-me-feel-good-like-Jabez-bless-me-bless-me\\" Christian publishing for years. It is very difficult to find a Christian book store that sells theology anymore (perhaps because Christians don't think or read anymore). I bought this copy of Pain from Amazon.Lewis is surprising because he doesn't go where you anticipate he will. He tackles the issue of pain from a very human angle. He asks the right questions and doesn't always give us the answers we want. Lewis is often held up by evangelical Christianity as a beacon of evangelical thought. I wonder if those evangelicals have even read him lately? Lewis disagrees with the doctrine of total depravity, questions original sin, weaves a parable of the fall which includes evolution, and leaves the door wide open for something other than an ever-burning hell.The answer to the problem of pain is that we are works in progress, being made lovable by a God who loves us even when we are not yet lovable. Says Lewis, \\"If the world is indeed a 'vale of soul making' it seems on the whole to be doing its work.\\" The true heart of the book is the two chapters in the middle of it all: \\"Human Pain,\\" and \\"Human Pain, Continued.\\" Lewis says, \\"God whispers to us in our pleasures, speaks in our conscience, but shouts in our pain: it is His megaphone to rouse a deaf world.\\"One of the most intriguing and thought provoking passages I encountered was this: \\"As for the fact of sin, is it probable that anything cancels it? All times are eternally present to God. Is it not at least possible that along some one line of His multi-dimensional eternity He sees you forever in the nursery pulling the wings off a fly, forever toadying, lying, lusting as a schoolboy, forever in that moment of cowardice or insolence as a subaltern? It may be that salvation consists not in the cancelling of these eternal moments but in the perfected humanity that bears the shame forever, rejoicing in the occasion which it furnished to God's compassion and glad that it should be common knowledge to the universe. Perhaps in that eternal moment St Peter - he will forgive me if I am wrong - forever denies his Master. If so, it would indeed be true that the joys of Heaven are for most of us, in our present condition, 'an acquired taste' - and certain ways of life may render the taste impossible of acquisition. Perhaps the lost are those who dare not go to such a public place. Of course I do not know that this is true; but I think the possibility is worth keeping in mind.\\" Are we to understand in this passage a bit of Eastern Christian thinking? Is salvation not exclusively individual, but also corporate? Is pain part of the process whereby a corporate humanity is brought to a heavenly perfection in Christ?Lewis always makes me think and re-think. We need more of that in the Church today. O, that our teachers and preachers would read!"},{"Title":"The problem of pain","review":"C.S. Lewis was a rare individual. One of the few non-clerics to be recognised as a theologian by the Anglican church, he put forth the case for Christianity in general in ways that many Christians beyond the Anglican world can accept, and a clear description for non-Christians of what Christian faith and practice should be. Indeed, Lewis says in his introduction that this text (or indeed, hardly any other he produced) will help in deciding between Christian denominations. While he describes himself as a 'very ordinary layman' in the Church of England, he looks to the broader picture of Christianity, particularly for those who have little or no background. The discussion of division points rarely wins a convert, Lewis observed, and so he leaves the issues of ecclesiology and high theology differences to 'experts'. Lewis is of course selling himself short in this regard, but it helps to reinforce his point.Lewis sees pain as an inevitable part of the human experience, given our condition of being estranged from God. He does not pain and suffering as being caused by God. 'The possibility of pain in inherent in the very existence of a world where souls can meet,' Lewis writes. 'When souls become wicked they will certainly use this possibility to hurt one another; and this, perhaps, accounts for four-fifths of the sufferings of men.' God has a role in that God is the creator of all things, and set things in motion, but God is not responsible in Lewis' view for the individual or corporate acts of humankind in contradiction of God's will. In this, Lewis does go against the Calvinist strain that goes through Anglican and other theologies.Lewis highlights part of the problem with pain in that it cannot be easily ignored. 'We can rest contentedly in our sins and our stupidities; and anyone who has watched gluttons shovelling down the most exquisite foods as if they did not know what they were eating, will admit that we can ignore even pleasure. But pain insists upon being attended to.' Lewis admits that this is a 'terrible instrument' that God uses to draw people back to God's will, and that it isn't always successful. In addressing the doctrine and idea of Hell, Lewis admits that this too is a terrible idea (in fact, he states it is an 'intolerable' one), but also states that this is not meant to be an intellectually satisfying or comprehensible doctrine, but rather a moral one. Lewis does hasten to state that people often confuse the imagery of Hell for the doctrine of Hell - the ideas of Dante et al. are very pervasive, and our conceptions of what is meant by Hell usually owes more to such sources than the actual Biblical text.Lewis also shows part of his method of biblical interpretation in different passages in this book. In the chapter on Animal Pain, he discusses the absence of statements in scripture about whether animals share in immortality. 'The complete silence of Scripture and Christian tradition on animal immortality is a more serious objection; but it would be fatal only if Christian revelation showed any signs of being intended as a \\"system de la nature\\" answering all questions. But it is nothing of the sort.'Lewis explores the issues of divine omnipotence, divine omniscience, and divine goodness as possible contradictions and stumbling blocks to the way we see the world (or the way in which we can see a world with God operating in it, or responsible for it). Lewis comes to no definitive, systematic conclusions that will satisfy everyone. In the case of this particular text, Lewis is writing is a specifically Christian context, and readers from other backgrounds and adherents of other traditions may find less to connect with in this text.This is a key piece in the overall structure of Lewis' theological construction."},{"Title":"The problem of pain","review":"There are better books about the theological problem of pain (the biblical book of JOB, Paul Brand's PAIN: THE GIFT NOBODY WANTS, and Philip Yancey's WHERE IS GOD WHEN IT HURTS?, to name three), but Lewis's book is a good place to start. Lewis himself makes it clear in the introduction that this book only addresses the intellectual problem arising from suffering, and as such does not pretend to give advice about living with pain. Lewis offers this by way of observation, that &quot;when pain is to be borne, a little courage helps more than much knowledge, a little human sympathy more than much courage, and the least tincture of the love of God more than all.&quot; As a catalyst for considering the theological difficulty of resolving the idea of a good God with the pain and suffering in His creation, this book is worth reading."},{"Title":"The problem of pain","review":"Is pain God's megaphone?Lewis ably examines the thorny subjects of pain and suffering in this book. The brief work is at once philosophical, logical, and semi-theological, even though Clive points out in his preface that he is no theologian (We can thank God for that!).Lewis seeks to answer questions such as &quot;If God is good and all-powerful, why does he allow his creatures to suffer pain?&quot;No stranger to pain himself, Lewis sheds some valuable light on the subject and on human nature. The book is both a comfort and a discomfort. One wonders how differently Lewis might have approached the subject after the death of his wife, for example.I found the later chapters, particularly those on Hell, Animal Pain, and Heaven particularly enlightening.&quot;Pain,&quot; writes Lewis in the end, &quot;offers an opportunity for heroism.&quot; His words ring true. Those who have suffered, to any degree, will find the book intriguing.A fine work, I would not recommend that the Lewis neophyte begin with this work, but perhaps &quot;Mere Christianity.&quot;"},{"Title":"The problem of pain","review":"If God loves us, why do we suffer? Why is there pain? Why? Christian Apologist extraordinaire C.S. Lewis studies the possible answer to these questions. The answers are intellectually stimulating and thought provoking, to say the least, for those interested in the direction (Christian, primarily orthodox) Lewis's argument takes. What is more fascinating about the text is the rigid emotional distance Lewis has to the subject, his own personal experience with Pain (told in A Grief Observed) still many years away. Those wanting a more easy to relate to study should read Grief. Those wanting a strictly intellectual and emotionally distant look at the concepts and Christian answers could do a lot worse than The Problem With Pain. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The problem of pain","review":"Many times through my second reading of the book (first time a decade ago), I felt-\\"this is what language was made for.\\" Of course, no apologist can posit an argument without counter. However, Lewis shows himself vested with not just \\"divine\\" insight, but also with his unique, unmatched grasp of the human condition, primarily as expressed in literature and linguistics. This book echoes many themes from his earlier writings, he reveals himself consistent throughout. His intellectual foundations (he might not call them quite philosophical) are strong. His discussion of the \\"neutral field\\" as a requirement for interaction is masterful. Anyone that doubts the validity of his comments on free will won't be convinced of such by any arguments. For the rest of us, Lewis clarifies a conviction consistent with the broadest sweep of churchdom-what he would most certainly call \\"mere\\" Christianity. If one sees contradiction between his comments here and his own \\"A Grief Observed\\" then rest assured you are sitting at the feet of a human teacher. His writing is intensely personal-his comment \\"how can I say with sufficient tenderness what here needs to be said\\" reveals his heart for humanity in the comments that follow. Furthermore, he takes the high ground decades ahead of the animal rights movement in his ideas about animal pain, to which he devotes an entire chapter. He is an able voice to promote real care-stewardship-of animals long before the issue became so trenchant. His final chapter on heaven is best illustrated by reading his adult fiction \\"Perelandra\\" where he re-creates Eden, and to stages their triumph over original sin."},{"Title":"The problem of pain","review":"While I read this book (in fact, an old, battered version of my mother's) in order to answer some questions regarding pain and why it exists in a universe created by a loving God (if one accepts this hypothesis), Lewis not only convincingly answered those but also dug into topics such as free will and election, clarifying many other not necessarily pain-related questions in the process. I am now convinced (my apologies to all the Calvinists out there) that free will is an essential ingredient to human being and that it is necessary in order for Christian self-surrender to have any sense at all.I usually don't riposte to other reviews, but I don't believe the reviewer was correct in saying Dr. Lewis chickened out, largely because his concept of innocent children seems erroneous to me. I remember my younger brother was fully capable of scheming before he could even talk. The helplessness of children does not make them innocent.I fully recommend this book to anyone grappling with problems of pain."},{"Title":"Elephant Quest","review":"Can't take the kids to Africa? You won't believe that illustrations in this book are painted-they look like photographs and bring the subject to life. The text is a bit rich for little ones, but mine came back to it again and again. I think this ranks with \\"Market Day\\" as two of Lewin's best."},{"Title":"Froggy's Halloween","review":"I agree with the other reviewer about the inappropriatness of the ryme about \\"trick or treat\\" and pulling down anothers underwear. I personally do not want my children running around singing that inappropriate rhyme either. It also bothers me that when the Mother tells Froggy that he should be doing his homework she \\"laughs\\" at his response that he is Count Von Frogula and Vampires don't DO homework. That type of blatant disrespect is not allowed in our house and I do not want it modeled in books for my children either. This is minor, but I also did not like that Froggy cut holes in his Mom's \\"best white sheet\\" while making a ghost costume with no feelings of remorse and without any consequences to his actions. I do not want my children disregarding other's property in such a way either. This book had great potential but all of the inappropriatness mentioned above ruined it for us."},{"Title":"Froggy's Halloween","review":"As a school Librarian I have read this book 1000s of times to kids from K through 6th grade and never fail to get a laugh from them all. As a Froggy fanatic I have the complete collection, and love how this story with the \\"trick or treat\\" part helps to bring the Froggy series full circle. I am sure that the author, Mr. London never meant for this to be taken so literally. It is meant to remind us all of those crazy Halloween times.Thanks from all \\"my\\" children Mr. London, you hit this one out of the park.....and onto the soccer field!"},{"Title":"Froggy's Halloween","review":"I have a three and two year old that have really enjoyed the froggy books. We own several, so when my 3 year old picked out this book from the library I didn't even think twice about bringing it home. However, when we sat down to read the book, I was appauled at one line in the book that talks about pulling down someone's underwear if they are not given candy! This is INAPPROPRIATE for ANY child to say! Who really wants to hear children talking like this? We use to be a froggy fan but NO more frog books in my house!"},{"Title":"Froggy's Halloween","review":"I purchased this book for my two sons ages 2 and 4. I am incredibly disappointed in this book. Jonathan London should be ashamed of this title. If you as a parent think it is funny for the text to teach your child &quot;trick or treat, smell my feet, give me something good to eat; if you don't, I don't care, I'll pull down your underwear&quot; then buy it. Otherwise, boycott this book for all the right reasons!!! Truly distasteful and offensive literature."},{"Title":"Froggy's Halloween","review":"In today's society with what kids go through, the fact that anyone would think that using a kindergarten level \\"recess\\" song which encourages children to pull down someone's pants is acceptable material for public school disgusts me. How does the author treat his children, because I would never do that to my kids, nor would I encourage it. Gross! This was part of my child's music curriculum. The teacher read it, then taught them the song. I am completely blown away. There are so many wonderful books out there, why would you ever dabble in hurtful garbage. No more froggy books for us."},{"Title":"Froggy's Halloween","review":"Our first grade class rated all of Jonathon London's Froggy books. Froggy's Halloween was rated the favorite Jonathon London book. Jonathon London has made reluctant readers excited about reading. Kids love watching Froggy get into trouble."},{"Title":"Froggy's Halloween","review":"This book is your typical Froggy book. If you are familiar with Jonathan London's Froggy series, then you know what to expect. There is the usual event where Froggy turns \\"more red in the face than green\\" and the reference to underwear. I teach 2nd grade, and my students still have that \\"EWWWWW\\" reaction to underwear or nakedness, so the book has that shock effect. The only thing that I do not like is the \\"trick or treat, smell my feet, give me something good to eat. If you don't, I don't care, I'll pull down your underwear\\", but the kids love it. I just don't love it when they repeat the verse or go home and say it!I love the touches of the changing of w's to v's to sound like a vampire, and of course the abundant onomotapeia. If you love Froggy, then you'll love this book! It is perfect to add to your collection of Halloween stories to read before going out!"},{"Title":"Froggy's Halloween","review":"None of the books in the FROGGY series is a disappointment. My five year old daughter has fallen in love with all of the adventures of Froggy, his parents, and friends. The books are just the right length for you and your child to share a nice bedtime story--not too short where you have to supplement with another book or too long where you have to stop and pick up the story the next night. What I like most about the series is that even when Froggy might encounter one of life's little problems or when he gets nervous doing something new, he always learns for the better and knows that no matter what, Mom and Dad are there to help and support him."},{"Title":"Froggy's Halloween","review":"Froggy can't decide which costume to wear for Halloween. Superhero? Vampire? Finally he becomes a Frog Prince. Frogilina kisses him and he is scared.This was a fun, non-scary book. For probably ages 3-6."},{"Title":"Froggy's Halloween","review":"My 5 year old really likes this book and thinks it is very funny. I especially like the scene where the girl from school tries to kiss him (because he looks so cute in his costume) and he has to jump over his parents to get away.As far as the trick or treat rhyme goes, I say people need to lighten up a bit. I remember saying that rhyme when I was a kid and thought it was funny, but I never actually pulled anyone's pants down. When my son and I read it, I simply took a moment to talk with him about how it may be a funny rhyme but we would never actually do something like that. The recommended age is 4-8. I think 4 year olds are perfectly able to comprehend that you shouldn't do that kind of stuff!"},{"Title":"Froggy's Halloween","review":"It's almost Halloween and Froggy still can't decide what costume to wear. Should he be super frog, ghost frog or vampire frog? How about a football player, cowboy or even a zombie. All week he gets ready for Halloween, carving pumpkins and hanging spider webs and ghosts. He's even practiced saying &quot;Trick or treat, smell my feet./Give me something good to eat.&quot; Finally when the big day comes, Froggy decides to be the Frog Prince, complete with crown and sword. Now he's off for a scary evening of tricks, treats, surprises and fun..... No one captures the essence of a busy pre-schooler as well as Jonathan London and Frank Remkiewicz. Mr London's lively text is full of sound effects, energy and humor and complemented by Mr Remkiewicz's bold, bright and expressive artwork. Together they've authored a clever and entertaining story about an engaging character that your little &quot;Froggy&quot; will easily identify with. This is the perfect read aloud story to help everyone get into the Halloween spirit. Froggy's Halloween is part of a marvelous series that youngsters just can't get enough of. Read them all and enjoy!"},{"Title":"Froggy's Halloween","review":"We own several Froggy books, and they're pretty popular with my two boys. Yes, Froggy usually mentions his underwear and we all giggle. Fine. This book, however, crossed a line with me. Froggy jokes about pulling down another person's underwear if they don't give him any candy. Not just once, but TWICE. Now, I'm not a huge prude, but this kind of talk is totally unnecessary in a children's book. And heaven forbid if my three-year-old repeated the line to a fellow preschooler. He'd probably be kicked out for sexual harrassment! I took Froggy back and told the clerk about the problem. Her eyes widened and she said, \\"Seriously???\\" Glad to see it's not just me."},{"Title":"Froggy's Halloween","review":"I am a fan of the Froggy series. The kids that I work with just love it. I am very disappointed in this book, primarily because of one verse. \\"Trick or Treat,smell my feet, give me someting good to eat, if you don't I don't care, ILL PULL DOWN YOUR UNDERWEAR! If you are familiar with the Froggy books, you already know that the kids usually get a kick out him making references to underwear. In the first book \\" Froggy Gets Dressed\\". It was cute ( \\" You forgot your underwear!) In this book, it may be sing-songy but the part about referencing pulling down someones underwear is highly inapppropriate. It may be a kids rhyme, but it this day and age of sexual misconduct by adults and kids alike, any references to pulling down someones underwear for fun or not, is best left out of the books. It would take just one kid to try to do this to someone at school, because they read that in a book, now you have got a sexual harrassment case going on. Not funny at all."},{"Title":"Froggy's Halloween","review":"This book is just as funny and charming as the other Froggy tales. I especially liked the Halloween costumes in the illustrations. Just as expected, Froggy has an embarrassing moment and of course he is &quot;more red in the face than green&quot;! This book is a wonderful addition to any personal or educational library!"},{"Title":"Froggy's Halloween","review":"Another fun Froggy book for children of all ages. Not scary but catches the spirit of Halloween. And it's a great read aloud. A perenial favorite!"},{"Title":"The Recollections of Geoffrey Hamlyn","review":"Geoffry Hamlyn recollects the life,times and adventures of the Buckleys,Brentwood's,Dr Mulhaus,Tom Troubridge,Frank Maberly,his great friend Jim Stockbridge and the tragic Mary Thornton and her liason with George Hawker.Initially the action is in Devon,then switches to Austrailia where they make their fortunes.This is classic Victorian fare, and a perfect example of how the Victorians structured and wrote before the influence of the great Russian and German authors. It has all the romanticism and flaws;the heavy reliance on coincidence and chance to get the characters all in the right place (Hamlyn and Stockbridge, in Ausrailia for some years are out looking for stray cattle in the middle of barely charted land when they amazingly 'bump' into the Buckleys and Thorntons on their way to found a homestead!Hawker is of course transported and crops up in our heroes midst as a feared bushranger, and the Dr and Maberly make equally unlikely arrivals!) and it sticks to the moral lines of the day;how great all things English are;how honesty and hard work bring prosperity whilst all else leads to ruin!Its a wonderful soap opera that has the Dr explaining all the latest scientific theories on Austrailias geology and wildlife. It also has the first pangs of conscience of the Victorians as to the displacing of the 'blackfellows' but it also has a breath takingly awful half page where Hamlyn and his chums are sweltering on the Verandah and he says what is missing is n****rs and he berates Harriet Beecher Stowe for 'Uncle Tom's Cabin' for being a woman in Connecticut ignorant of temperatures in the 100's and the Southern gentlemans need for n****rs as slaves as Anglo Saxon man cannot function above 95f and needs the slave to serve him! First pangs of conscience,yes, but there's still a way to go!!I think you need to allow yourself to be entertained by this book;amused by it;look on it as a time capsule rather than get irritated by it; it really is a good and enjoyable read; a perfect example of Victorian literature.

Simple construction was covered in depth, but the instructions would probably be slightly over the head of someone without some experience at drafting patterns. Most instructions begin with basic commercial patterns and give instructions for altering those into a period pattern - be aware that the instructions are not exhaustive. Muslin mock-ups will definitely be needed before settling on a completed pattern. Also, the detail might have been a bit lacking, particularly on period colors, fabrics, and trims for all social classes. Overall, a VERY useful book if you already know something about this kind of sewing. If not, it is still very good, but be prepared to put a lot of work into mastering some of these techniques and patterns.

If you *are* looking for faire garb, this is *one* of several key references you will want in your library: Carolyn Savoy (the illustrator) was Director of Costuming for the Renaissance Pleasure Faires during the early 1980's.Three major caveats here make this volume questionable for the historian, and requiring cross-authentication for faire costuming: (1) it is designed to be &quot;simple&quot; for the knowledgeable home-sewer or journeyman costumer, which Winter interprets as license to use such anachronisms as &quot;hidden zippers&quot; and elastic (she does give more appropriate closure options in at least some cases); (2) some of Winter's assumptions are a bit off (for example, that for middle-uppper and upper classes the Spanish surcote was worn directly over the shift, rather than over the loose kirtle); (3) the book was last updated in 1987 and is therefore lacking the input of more recent research, much of it based on primary sources.All in all, it's a great *idea* book, more useful to the performer than to the historian."},{"Title":"Elizabethan Costuming (For The Years 1550 - 1580)","review":"While I am, as a historic costumer, extremely disappointed in this book, I would say that both its good and bad reputations are undeserved. The drafting and construction instructions are horrible - true. However, the first-time Fairegoer, beginning sewer, school play's costume department, and those interested in the look without the substance should find this useful. This is NOT a book for anyone interested in accuracy, variety in research (HOW many times will I hear someone tell me that their gown is of \\"dead Spaniard color\\"?!), or correct cutting and wearing of the clothes. In short, this is a book for making costumes, as opposed to working garb or reproducion garments.Caveat emptor."},{"Title":"Elizabethan Costuming (For The Years 1550 - 1580)","review":"This is the book that a lot of people start with when making clothing for Renaissance Faires or for the Society for Creative Anachronism. For creating &quot;Renaissance-ish&quot; costumes it's not bad. However, I've read some fairly harsh criticism online about its instructions for assembling a woman's outfit, so caveat emptor aut lector, so to speak. Those who are looking to accurately recreate Elizabethan clothing should probably look elsewhere (e.g., Janet Arnold's &quot;Patterns of Fashion&quot;). This book occasionally uses techniques and &quot;cheats&quot; that have no historical basis whatsoever. For someone who is simply interested in making something that looks more or less correct this is a great book, with the previously mentioned warning that some of the directions may lead you astray. I would just be aware that this is a book about making &quot;costumes&quot;, not &quot;clothes&quot;, regardless of what the authors say in the preface!"},{"Title":"Elizabethan Costuming (For The Years 1550 - 1580)","review":"This is a wonderful book for someone who's curious about Elizabethan costuming, but has absolutely no idea where to begin. It gives step-by-step instructions for creating undergarments such as corsets and farthingales, talks about altering modern patterns into period bodices, and also covers headwear,sleeve styles, hairstyles,jewelry, and accessories. Here you'll find a list of fabric measurements needed for various garments and period colors to use for them, information on what peasants and middle-class women wore, and also information on men's Elizabethan garments for all classes. Accompanied by many, many illustrations and full of practical advice (exactly how do you go from &quot;dream on paper&quot; to reality? What is the best type of outfit to make for children?), I would recommend this book to people who want to find out what Elizabethan Costume is all about before diving into more detailed tomes."},{"Title":"Elizabethan Costuming (For The Years 1550 - 1580)","review":"The best investment you will make in your costuming library.As a person who has trained new folk for many years, I recommend this book to all because it is easy to understand, gives you an overview of who wore what when, and how to easily create your own versions of everything from your first simple chemise to complicated hats. It tells you about period colors and fabrics, jewelry, embriodery, acessories, and includes a comprehensive measurement template in the back. Its not going to hold your hand step by step as a simplicity pattern will, but if you have a little common sense and left-brained talent, you can make this stuff with ease.As for the corset/bumroll &quot;oopsie&quot;, I think this is all in translation of the drawing. I never understood that they wish your bumroll to go UNDER your corset. That just doesnt make sense.You will eventually graduate to the Janet Arnold books (which are incredible, but terribly complicated and advanced), and other resources, such as the elizabethan costuming homepage, http://costume.dm.net/. Remember when reading these (negative) reviews that in all communities, there are fashion trends to watch for, and self-appointed &quot;experts&quot; who find themselves &quot;more period than thou&quot;.

All in all I would not recommend this book to anyone but a beginner or intermediate costumer, and only then if they have done enough research to recognize when there is useless info included.

The authors' goals are straightforward: This book is for the novice costumer who either lacks skill and resources to make a visually authentic costume for theater or Renaissance Faire, or the costumer who is rather lazy or disinterested in making better researched clothing. That's fine. What I have issues with is the research and patterns that are presented by the authors, which is at best an \\"overview\\" and at worst \\"completely wrong, even in the face of logic and the natural laws of science.\\" Patterns which are not based on any surviving historical garments are given as being \\"authentic\\", and the text that accompanies said patterns is really nothing more than a *very* glossed over synopsis of the entire scope of 16th century English culture. Picking up an outdated encyclopedia should give you better background info than this book. Numerous diagrams showing patterns are inaccurate, such as those for the French Hood, the proper placement of the bumroll, the size and construction of the bumroll, etc. Another serious fault I have with this book is the fact that the authors are apparently regurgitating information from other well-respected costuming books such as Jean Hunnisett's _Historic Patterns For Stage And Screen_ and Janet Arnold's _Patterns of Fashion_ books which are very good resources for theater costumers and historical costumers, alike.For [this price] it's a bargain and if you take the information within as being really just a very basic overview on how to make something that won't stand out awkwardly at your local Ren Faire, this is the book for you. If you're looking for credible documentation, authentic patterns and quotes from primary sources, you will not be happy with this book."},{"Title":"Elizabethan Costuming (For The Years 1550 - 1580)","review":"While I applaud the focus of this book and don't deny that there is some really useful information in it, I found this book disappointing.

I found this book to be too daunting for the beginner and too sketchy for the experienced sewer. It could also use more references to source material and documentation."},{"Title":"Elizabethan Costuming (For The Years 1550 - 1580)","review":"This is probably the best practical resource for Elizabethan clothing I have come across in years of searching.

I was so disappointed that I decided I'd rather pay the cost of return shipping than have wasted my money on this. Except for very simple garments, the \\"drafting\\" instructions are \\"First find a [modern] pattern that fits and...\\" Furthermore, far from having a few minor historical errors, this book is littered with them. I would be very hesitant to use anything from it without confirming in another source. This book is not for anyone serious about historical clothing or who thinks they might become serious in the near future. These costumes might be OK for a first time costumer/reinactor or someone who was casually attending a faire without planning to get serious in it. It would also be OK for stage. For those reasons, I rated it a two. However, for a casual user or first timer, I would suggest a web search instead; they would find similar or better patterns for free in many cases.I would suggest possible buyers try some of the other books listed in the \\"Listmania\\" or \\"So You'd Like To...\\" links.

It is the first book I have seen that actually tells in detail how bad resource use decisions are made in Third World countries. I picked it up with a sense of &quot;ho hum--another book on resource econ--I bet I know it all already.&quot; I did know most of what Ascher says, but I hung on every word anyway, because what he does with the info is so original and incisive. He provides many case studies of resource management failures. I have worked in many of the countries involved, and can testify to the accuracy and insight of the accounts (though he does pull a few punches). There are some problems. The worst is that he confines his attention to Third World countries, even when they are just doing what First World countries told them. His discussion of Mexico's disastrous irrigation policy, for instance, does not include the fact that Mexico was copying the US, and with US advice. Mexico was a fine student--managed to wreck the land, water, and small-farm economy as badly as the US has! (Ascher might have compared Charles Wilkinson's BEYOND THE LAST MERIDIAN to the Mexico case.) Brazil's disastrous &quot;development&quot; of the Amazon was also inspired by US example (the &quot;winning of the west&quot;--Indian genocide and all). In short, Ascher has put his finger on general processes of resource devastation, not &quot;Third World&quot; ones. This being said--this is an essential book for conservationists and resource economists."},{"Title":"Why Governments Waste Natural Resources: Policy Failures in Developing Countries","review":"I made a tiny research on why are the reforestation governmental programs failing in Southeast Mexico, where rainforest restoration would be a plausible profitable activity. I looked for conceptual bases here and there and Ascher's book was definetely one of the most useful sources I found. It explains clearly why resource management fails when looked from the implementation of policies logic, with strong conceptual basis. The role of policies is accentuated and it manages to make the reader understand few things can be done if there is not a clear political line behind resource management. Several examples illustrate both successful and failure cases, in diverse ecosystems. I highly recommend this book for anyone interested in understanding, at different levels, why the world's biodiversity is apparently lost without remedy.Happy reading!Ximena"},{"Title":"Bibliomen: Twenty characters waiting for a book","review":"This book is a strange assortment of characterizations, stories no longer then one or two pages, recounting the bizarre and surprising lives of twenty (actually, twenty-one) characters.

I selected the one which had notes scribbled in the margins by a previous reader. Curious to find out what others thought of my favourite author, I read all the scribbles before I started the book. Whoever had it before me hated it! I cannot concieve why, since this is an excellent look into the struggles of a new teacher in a harsh environment. Hey, let's not forget that Mr. Hunter has an Oscar for the film based on the book! The major difference towards the end between the movie and the book sways me in favour of the book -- a must-read, to quote an old cliche."},{"Title":"The Blackboard Jungle","review":"Published in 1954, Evan Hunter's novel is set in an urban vocational school of all boys. Today, almost fifty years later, it remains not just an excellent read, but also a worthwhile one-especially when it is read in conjunction with SPINE, a more contemporary novel of teachers struggling with students and the school system of an isolated rural town. In the latter work-a creation of this reviewer-the power and authority of the teacher in the classroom has been virtually eliminated (though seldom admitted), and no administrator would ever utter the words that Hunter's principal stresses to his faculty: &quot;The teacher is boss, remember that!&quot; Nor would those same administrators of today play the hardball of the JUNGLE's head man and insist on payment by parents for the destruction of school property by their sons and daughters. And how many modern-day parents are there who don't view the entire school as something they cannot entirely trust? Who may even regard it less a friend to their progeny and more an enemy? These and other contrasts are often starkly apparent if one reads both novels. Just as are other items that are the same today as they were midway through the previous century. In fact, one of these may even help to determine when teachers began to lose the authority of their position. Again, consider Hunter's school principal. When a student levels a charge at his English teacher, the story's protagonist, principal Small accuses his employee Rick Dadier of being a racial bigot, and he does so without first listening to the other side of the incident. Read one, read the other. Gain a little more insight about the world of education."},{"Title":"The Blackboard Jungle","review":"This was the first major novel of \\"Evan Hunter\\", a WW II Navy veteran who attended college and then taught at a vocational high school. This book is dedicated to his wife Anita. It is a work of fiction, any resemblance to actual persons is purely coincidental. But it is obviously based on his personal experience. There is a lot of detail in this 309 page book that suggests reporting rather than fiction. If you saw the film you will find the novel more detailed about his teaching experiences, and without the Hollywood dramatic changes. Are this scenes still true today?The snowfall on October 19 suggests Albany or Syracuse rather than New York city (Chapter 6). Rick learned the usefulness of dramatics in teaching and holding attention in class. Rick says there are no courses on \\"Teaching the Trades School Student\\". The trade school was invented to give \\"practical education for those who want it, or don't fit into an academic environment. [They don't acknowledge that it is class-based. Before the 1930s most grammar school graduates went directly to work at 14. They learned on the job.] Rick's experiences in the Navy told of a similar situation regarding a squealer.Chapter 10 describes the various methods used to keep discipline in school. One incident has Dadier accused of bias by a secret informer (one of his students). Part III describes the work done for the Christmas Assembly show. Dadier was put in charge, he found the volunteers needed. Later he made a breakthrough to his class (Chapter 12). It was the story about \\"The Fifty-First Dragon\\". Was the story about the maternity hospital an allegory about his teaching career? There is a final dramatic chapter where Dadier earns the respect of his class.Are trades school students still considered inferior? They are more likely to become independent businessmen than an academic graduate. Note that Dadier family is a \\"nuclear family\\" living in a new development with little contact with relatives. Hunter knew how to spice up this novel for the reading audience of the 1950s. [There was an earlier film by Abbott & Costello whose story was similar to \\"The Fifty-First Dragon\\".]"},{"Title":"The Blackboard Jungle","review":"As a mystery writer with my debut novel in its initial release and a teacher with over twenty years of experience in an impoverished high school, I found Evan Hunter's THE BLACKBOARD JUNGLE fascinating. Ed McBain, the celebrated mystery writer, was a teacher back when he wrote this book. Evan Hunter is, as we all know, Ed McBain's actual name. I suspect he based his Richard Dadier character on his own experiences. Dadier is an idealistic young man with his first professional job as an English teacher in a working class high school. Dadier does his best to reach his students, yet the challenges are great. This book is a classic, and it still applies to teaching these days. I truly wish Evan Hunter would return to THE BLACKBOARD JUNGLE. America needs its best and its brightest in our classrooms. As I can attest to from my experience, one can teach students and write mysteries without sacrificing either career."},{"Title":"The Blackboard Jungle","review":"I just bought THE BLACKBOARD JUNGLE and I am a few pages from finished. I am currently a Secondary Ed-English Ed undergrad and I find this book to be very good from an education perspective. From a literary perspective it is well written, but a little too much repetition at times. The foreshadowing keeps repeating itself. However, I believe this book is a must read for any and all educators, or anyone interested in the field. I know some people do not think this novel is prevalent to today. It is. Look at Kozol's SAVAGE INIEQUALITIES, there are still problems in inner city schools. This novel helped pave a road toward reform, but we need to use this novel to continue that road. We need to all work together to make the yellow brick road to success! Anyway, now that I am done ranting. :) I especially enjoyed the chapter where Hunter described the various types of teachers (slumberer, fumblerer, rumblerer, etc.). I believe that we can use this novel not only as a form of leaisure reading, but a form of intellectual growth and a beginning for how to reform education today!"},{"Title":"The Blackboard Jungle","review":"Forget the campy movie- The novel is an insightful look at the people who become teachers; how they cope, how they survive and what happens when they don't. It was written over fifty years ago, but the issues it addresses are still with us. Rick, the hero, struggles within an educational system that is broken; filled with cynics that feel their job is to \\"keep the lid on the garbage can.\\" He manages not to be be crushed like his idealistic coworker and even manages to reach his students. Blackboard jungle should be required reading for anyone who wants to be a teacher."},{"Title":"The Blackboard Jungle","review":"The language in BLACKBOARD JUNGLE sounds very dated. It's the kind of speech I've never heard in a modern classroom, but I did see an example of it in Frank McCourt's TEACHER MAN. I suppose the language and lingo of our teenagers has changed since the 1950's.BLACKBOARD JUNGLE comes off as a horror show, which it is in a way, but it also created a stereotype. Readers are tricked into thinking that all NYC Public Schools were like this, which is far from the case. Richard Dadier's awful school didn't become a dump as a result of \\"white flight\\"; it was DESIGNED as a dump! It's a school meant for kids who were thrown out of others. Every kid in the school has some kind of problem with adults.There is a scene in BLACKBOARD JUNGLE that is irritating but touching at the same time. A boy names Miller keeps talking back and won't shut up, despite the teacher's instructions. I realised what the problem is here; these kids have all these things they want to talk about, but there's no adult in their lives for them to say it to. Their parents are unavailable and they have no way, as Fred Rogers put it, to \\"talk to the people you loave about the things you wonder about.\\"Evan Hunter taught in a school like this in the early 1950's.

One day men came and built a fence around the field and watched over the growing wheat. They watered the field, weeded it and waited for the wheat to ripen. The mouse wondered what was so special about this particular wheat.At last the men harvested the ripened wheat, bundled it and loaded it onto a wagon. They worked carefully to keep it dry.The mouse, curious as a cat, decided to find out what was going on. So he jumped on the wagon and rode to the mill, where he found a hole in the door from which he could watch as huge grinding wheels crushed the harvest into fine flour, and poured it into new sacks and loaded them onto another truck.Hidden in the sacks, he rode for a long time aboard the truck to the city, crowded with people, cars and trucks. Here the truck stopped at a place called Goldstein's Matzah Factory, where an inspector checked to see that every sack was completely dry.From a window ledge, he watched as factory workers inside unloaded the sacks, brought in buckets of water and mixed the water and flour and rolled it out into flat sheets punched full of holes.I can't tell you what happened on the last eight pages of this 34-page book. But kids will learn from this cute book how matzah is made, and what exactly makes it kosher for Pessach.As an added plus, they will enjoy the fine pen and ink art. The book's cover resembles a sheet of egg matzah. And inside are fetching illustrations, reminiscent of the evocative drawings in Homer Price.--- Alyssa A.

Also, the authors mentioned nursing home insurance, but didn't recommend any particular policy or company.

Three meals a day and a place to hang your hat in assisted living costs $2500/month and up. I can't imagine what the places that offer horseback riding (and golf, etc.) charge. One thing I really appreciated about the book, however, was that the authors advised assisted living consumers to make sure that wheelchair users were not segregated from the rest of the assisted living community.

In fact, it was with great hesitance that I finished reading the book to my daughter. I'm glad I did.Given the contemporary climate of speech control and the like, broaching the subject of gender differences is a dangerous thing. David T. Greenberg does it with grace, humor, and a necessary amount of tongue and cheek. Using language a child would, he mimicks what is said on playgrounds and in school halls and in the minds of girls and boys.From blaming flatulance on members of the opposite sex to pointing towards their lack of hygiene, Greenberg gives voice to both sides of the story. Children will laugh, grin, and agree that boys and girls are different, but they can be cool, uproarious, glorious and wondrous, too."},{"Title":"Jose Maria Sison: At Home in the World--Portrait of a Revolutionary","review":"Internationally acclaimed Filipino journalist and novelist Ninotchka Rosca presents Jose Maria Sison: Portrait of a Revolutionary, a political biography of Filipino revolutionary Jose Maria Sison as told in Sison's own words, through question-and-answer format. Sison bore witness to, and suffered from, the extreme corruption of the Marcos regime; ineptitudes of the Aquino regime; and even the failings of the left-wing revolutionary movements that he supported in a desperate effort to bring about positive change for the exploited and impoverished Filipino population. Jose Maria Sison: At Home in the World explores Sison's study of Marxism and other political precepts; the many ideological and personal smear attacks leveled against Sison as well as threats, and explains why labeling Sison a \\"terrorist\\" for his political views is slander. Furthermore, Sison offers his perspective on the Philippines' tumultuous history from the Marcos regime to the present day. Of special interest are Sison's predictions for the future, as well as his warnings for the United States' failings and complicity in exploiting Filipinos. \\"The crisis of overproduction in all types of goods - agricultural, mineral, basic industrial and high-tech products - and the ensuing bankruptcies and financial meltdowns cause terrible hardship and suffering for the working people in the US and other imperialist countries and so many in Asia, Africa and Latin America and will probably increase and intensify before a global war can break out among the imperialists or before the proletariat can seize power from the monopoly bourgeoisie in any imperialist country. Nowhere other than in Asia, Africa, and Latin America are there armed revolutionary movements led by the proletariat and actively fighting imperialism and seeking to seize political power in the process. No matter how few these armed revolutionary movements still are, they have the potential of increasing rapidly amidst the grave crisis of the world capitalist system.\\" A one-of-a-kind personal portrayal of an emphatic and forceful personality dedicated to improving the overall human welfare of his home nation at any price."},{"Title":"Jose Maria Sison: At Home in the World--Portrait of a Revolutionary","review":"Reminiscences from the past, nothing has changed except glabalization and Mao's death, the year is still 1967, Joma is a conservative.

Questions arise what does Joma really mean with democracy, gender, stalinism and the future. The book is co-written with Ninotshka Rosca, acclaimed author and feminist.

I just finished it and found the pictures spectacular and the organization very helpful. In addition to hundreds of very rich and colorful depictions of tomb paintings, it includes breathtaking aerial views of some of the larger sites. I ordered my own copy immediately.Both are very interesting but in different ways. The Silverman book is organized by topic, and it does have a lot more detailed information. The Agnese-Re book is organized by site, which I found much more helpful since this will be my first trip to Egypt. It helped me decide what I really want to see at each site."},{"Title":"Ancient Egypt, Art and Archaeology of the Land of the Pharaohs","review":"This is primarily a picture book featuring a number of Egypt's archaeological wonders. There are, however, also brief written descriptions and explanations of some of the major sites in Egypt.The pictures are fine. (I wonder, though, if other books don't provide much of the same material.) The writing and editing, on the other hand, are quite poor. The site descriptions are rather dense reading, but strangely fail to convey much information. The writing style, such as it is, appears to change - rather jarringly - on several occasions. Perhaps most troubling in a book of this sort, however, it is often difficult to match the photos with their intended captions. This is not a high quality resource. Though I have not examined what other Ancient Egypt resources are available, I am quite certain you can do better."},{"Title":"Home and Work: Housework, Wages, and the Ideology of Labor in the Early Republic","review":"I have to modify significantly the previous reviewer's take on this book. Boydston does not argue that women did all the work while men got all the pay. What she argues is that because women did as much unpaid work as they did, factories benefited more from male labor than they might have if they'd considered and economically rewarded the female labor that went into making the male a productive worker. In other words, capitalists effectively got two for the price of one when they hired a male worker. Without a female working for free at home while practicing home economics to keep expenses low, the American labor-profit system in the early republic would have been unsustainable. To make this system palatable, Boydston argues in her concluding chapter (indeed, the chapter that really is the point of the book), the culture generated a pastoral mystique of housework . . . images and ways of talking about housework that made it seem not only natural, but part of the beauty and splendor of nature.The previous reviewer's take suggests that this book in some way could be read as perpetuating a simplistic male/female gender war mentality. Instead, where this book really leads is to a common enemy of the mass of men and women: an exploitative political economy that thrives on the poverty of the family. Women entering the marketplace has done little to solve the problem. Indeed, what Boydston shows is that women have always been in the marketplace. If you think about it after reading this book, it becomes pretty clear that in the postmodern, post industrial age, capital is still getting two workers for the price of one: women working for less pay than men and men working for less pay than they have before. Meanwhile, the economy absorbs the on average lower female wage in a network of childcare services (daycare, formula, etc.) and \\"busy lifestyle\\" services (convenience food, maid services, etc.) that leave the situation little changed. Meanwhile, of course, the marketing machine continues working overtime to naturalize this situation."},{"Title":"Home and Work: Housework, Wages, and the Ideology of Labor in the Early Republic","review":"Boydson goes to prove that the average woman ha had to work long and hard hours that have been often under paid and overworked while the men get their payment, the women must endure long hours and work extra hard. This book seeks to tell how the women have built the economy and have been one of the major leaders yet do not get the credit that they deserve. Think about the long hours put in spinning, canning, and doing the house work without air conditioning and yet still how it is today! This si the book to read for all historians."},{"Title":"Justification and Variegated Nomism: The Complexities of Second Temple Judaism (Wissenschaftliche Untersuchungen Zum Neuen Testament. 2. Reihe. 140)","review":"Volume 1 addresses the various (variegated) views held by the Jews during the second temple period about the relationship of the Law (nomism) to salvation (justifcation). It focuses on the era before and right after the time of Jesus. Understanding the views of this era help us with understanding the background of the New Testament.D.A. Carson, one of today's greatest evangelical scholars, has elicited the help of many scholars, some evangelical, others not; he is the editor of the two-part series, but most of the material is provided by the illustrious contributors. The overall purpose of this two volume set is to refute the \\"Covenantal Nomism\\" (the view that \\"you get into the covenant by grace, but you stay in it by keeping the Law\\") of E.P. Sanders. It also seeks to refute the \\"New Perspective\\" as to what Paul the Apostle really meant when he spoke of salvation \\"apart from the Law.\\" Volume one shows that Sanders erred: there is no one view that dominated all Jewish thought before the time of Christ (or shortly thereafter). Volume 2 (I am still reading it) then completes the project by demonstrating that the \\"New Perspective\\" may be \\"new,\\" but it is not correct. The Reformers really did know what they were talking about.But whether you are debating the \\"New Perspective\\" or not, you will find this volume rich! You will sharpen your understanding of the thinking of the Jewish world from about 200 B.C. to about 100 A.D. You will delve into the Apocrypha, the Pseudepigrapha, the Talmud, etc.; those who want to better understand the Jewish Roots of the Christian Faith will also appreciate this volume.This book is not intended for the average layman, but a trained pastor can understand this work (which is all I am; I am no scholar). Although a few parts are dry, other portions are absolutely fascinating.Does the book accomplish its goal? Absolutely."},{"Title":"Justification and Variegated Nomism: The Complexities of Second Temple Judaism (Wissenschaftliche Untersuchungen Zum Neuen Testament. 2.

It includes 15 essays (usually 20-60 pages each), each surveying the concept of righteousness in a particular group of Jewish writings.

The set overall is an examination of the \\"New perspective\\" theology which claims that Christians have mislabelled Judaism as a \\"works for salvation\\" or merit-based religion."},{"Title":"The case of the careless kitten (Cardinal edition)","review":"D.A.

Burger plans to convict her, then try Mason as an accessory, convict him, then institute disbarrment proceedings against him. This will end Mason's career of legal dramatics and &quot;outwitting the police&quot;.Mason doesn't care anything about a murdered man, a wounded man, or the missing man who is the prime suspect - all he cares about is aquitting Della Street.

After all, if he did so, he'd be &quot;outwitting the police&quot; once again..."},{"Title":"The case of the careless kitten (Cardinal edition)","review":"It is an interesting case, where Perry Mason defends his secretary, charged with hiding a material witness.

So, watch out for the answers &amp; learn a little bit of cat psychology!"},{"Title":"The case of the careless kitten (Cardinal edition)","review":"This convoluted murder mystery is weakened by the common flaw in so many of the books by Gardner, the police and other officials are incompetent or weak personalities. In this case it is more pronounced than others because district attorney Hamilton Burger is so out to get Perry Mason that he brings Della Street up on criminal charges. Given the successful history of Mason and Street, it should be clear to everyone that Della would always be operating along the instructions given by Mason. The case goes to trial and as expected, Mason makes legal mincemeat of Burger. Lieutenant Tragg is a little better, he occasionally shows some sense but his aggressive nature when he visits Della at her apartment is not the attitude that a police officer would take that has been regularly defeated by Mason.Through it all there is a convoluted murder plot, ten years ago banker Franklin Shore disappeared with almost no trace and suddenly he has apparently made contact again. The person claiming to be Franklin Shore asks that Mason be brought to a meeting, but at the designated time and place of the meeting, a man is found shot to death. This begins the process of Mason, the police and some of Shore's family members all involved in a complex web of intrigue, deception and further murders. There is no dramatic courtroom scene; the book concludes with Mason telling Della in a bit of a condescending manner how everything happened and who the guilty parties are.Talented, capable adversaries are what make heroes great and the problem with so many of the Perry Mason stories is that his adversaries are often the police and Hamilton Burger, who regularly acts like a dunce. That is the case here; putting Della Street on trial trying to get at Mason is too childish even for an incompetent such as Burger."},{"Title":"The case of the careless kitten (Cardinal edition)","review":"In 1942 California Helen Kendal receives a phone call. The strange voice identifies himself as her long-lost Uncle Franklin Shore, and tells her secrets to verify his identity. Helen is to contact Perry Mason, bring him to a hotel, and ask for Henry Leech. Helen lives with her Aunt Matilda Shore, whose husband ran off ten years earlier. But her kitten takes sick, and is rushed to the vet (a mysterious poisoning). Later she meets Perry Mason and goes to the hotel. A message redirects them to a place in the hills; when they arrive there they find a dead body in an automobile, and call the police. It is not the uncle; his death would leave a large sum to Helen. Helen returns home alone, as her aunt was taken to the hospital. When she and her boyfriend hear a noise, they investigate. Shots ring out, and her boyfriend is hit. Perry is notified.When Perry and Della visit the Shore residence, Perry is taken inside where the police ask him to produce the long missing Franklin B. Shore. Della finds Tom Lunk, the gardener, and drives away with him. Lunk tells Perry that Franklin visited his home earlier to spend the night. But they find Franklin has disappeared again. Perry wants Lunk to hide in a hotel, and Della takes him there. But the police find out, and arrest Della for hiding Franklin! Della escapes conviction for hiding Franklin, a material witness, because of the actions of the kitten at Lunk's shack! Lunk can't appear again as a witness because he is killed in a hit-and-run accident. But this results in solving the three murders. The clue again is eye-witness testimony that can't be corroborated. This story shows the variety of events and surprises that will mark future novels.There is one warning in Chapter 20. Prosecutors have campaigned to sweep away constitutional guarantees, supposedly to fight professional criminals. But the end result was to stack the cards against ordinary citizens because the whole legal procedure has been completely undermined. Can you trust government to see that no known innocent person is ever prosecuted? The prosecution of Della Street provides an answer. Della will be found guilty unless she can prove her innocence!

His mother is dead, his demented stepmother starves him and locks him in his room and makes him do all the chores in the house, and his father lets her. The story is told in diary form of Julian's three notebooks, or \\"Nbs\\" as he calls them. The notebooks are written in code so that if his father and stepmother should discover them, they would have difficulty reading. The reader also has difficulty at first, as it takes some detective work to decipher the code.The thing I liked most about the book is Julian's strength of spirit. With the support of his English teacher and a classmate, he is able to get a job, run away, and make a new life for himself. When I looked at James Deem's website, it says the story is based on the author's own experiences. And you can tell.

With a touching cast of characters and a deep, yet expertly told storyline, 3 NBs of Julian Drew will leave you breathless. The code that Julian writes in at the beginning of the book makes him seem so much realer and so much more believeable, therefore adding to the story another dimension. We watch as he progresses more and more and deserts the code.

I read it many years ago...The beginning starts off peacefully, like a romance, you become part of the scenerios, you fall in love with the characters...Then all of a sudden there is war (World War 1)...This novel is about people in that epoch, about tango dancing, about France and Argentina. About money and the pampas...About Germany...In fact about all of Europe...It is about an epoch in which people thought the world would end in war and genocide and everyone was just trying to have sex and fall in love and live life to the fullest before it all came to an end...The name Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse which is a phrase taken from the last book in the Bible which talks about Armageddon (better known as \\"the end of the world.\\" This book is like a mix of War and Peace by Leo Tolstoy and Gone With The Wind by Margaret Mitchell, only better.

The book is even better than the already phenomenal film; since the film is only about two hours long, it obviously couldn't fit in everything that happens in the book, and there were some things invented, left out, or cut and pasted together (in a respectful tasteful way though). The book gives an even more complete and complex picture of the Desnoyers family and their circle of friends, like having a lot more details about their life in Argentina before Julio, the main character, his sister Chichi, and their cousins the von Hartrotts were born, as well as having more details about their life back in Europe when they returned there shortly before WWI broke out. Having the powerful images from the film in my head made the characters, plotline, and descriptions in the book even more powerful. There were also some things that the book made clearer than the film had, although personally I felt that the ending line of the book wasn't as powerful or effective as the final intertitles of the movie. Still, it's a great book, powerful historical fiction about WWI and the years leading up to it. My only gripe is that this translation is a bit dated, such as in certain words or turns of phrase that now have different connotations or have fallen into such disusage that the modern reader would have to look them up. It doesn't change the powerful content one iota, but it would still be nice to have an updated translation with more modern language and some explanatory footnotes where needed."},{"Title":"Henna: The Joyous Body Art, Pattern Book 1","review":"This book is a must have for any henna artist.

Taking a short break in the shade of the towering canopy, it sat on some bamboo shoots which broke off in its fur. As the animal continued on its search for its next meal, the shoots began to irritate it. Growling (as I imagine), it rubbed up against an algarrobo tree. Some of the irritating plant fell out, along with one or two of the animal's hairs. These things fell into some resin or sap which exuded from the tree. The sap preserved them perfectly. Later the large drop of sap fell to the ground, was covered by debris which turned to earth, burying the sap completely. It lay there for a million or more years, then the ocean rose, taking the object to the bottom, where it was polished or preserved for more millions of years. Finally, due to the tectonic movements of the earth's plates, the ocean bottom where the (now) amber lay rose up into the mountains of an island. When Europeans arrived there in the tiny fragment of time known as \\"history\\" in this whole unbelievable span, they dug out the amber and found the preserved proof of that one moment in an animal's activities a possible 25 million years ago !Poinar and Poinar have created a fascinating scientific work with their reconstruction of what the forest of that epoch looked like. Using the thousands of examples of plants, seeds, petals, leaves, pollen, insects, and frogs or lizards that fell into the tree sap and were preserved like time capsules, they describe the ancient jungle long before any man trod this earth. They rely on the principle of behaviorial fixity-that is, the idea that species that fill certain ecological niches today did so in the past as well. They describe dozens of strange creatures, mostly insects (because they were abundant and small enough to get trapped often) that inhabit today's tropical forests as well as those in the past. The majority of the book is devoted to describing as many organisms as possible with an enormous number of black and white photographs and line drawings to help your imagination. They also have a whole section of color photographs of the actual amber pieces. At the end there is a short reconstruction (or summary) of the whole vanished forest as well as an interesting discussion of climatic change and the reason for the disappearance of many species between that time and the present. Not being a person with a scientific background, I found all these things excitingly different from my usual reading fare, but the language used-apart from having to deal with such terms as homozygotic, depurination, dehiscent, and phytotelmata, which don't exactly roll off my tongue-is understandable by any educated lay reader. I found THE AMBER FOREST one of the most fascinating books of science that I have ever read and one of the best books in any field that I've read recently. If learning about the symbiosis of plants and insects, parasites and hosts, ants and fungus, in fact all the biological world of a long-gone jungle, has any appeal to you, don't miss this work."},{"Title":"The Amber Forest: A Reconstruction of a Vanished World.","review":"This is a phenomenal book which will present a very thorough, and brilliant, \\"lecture\\" all in a single book.

There are four islands in the chain: Puerto Rico, Jamaica, Cuba and, the subject of this book, Hispaniola (comprising of Haiti and Dominican Republic). Millions of years ago Hispaniola was, much like today, a tropical paradise with forested slopes and a thriving ecosystem. Within those forests lived species of Algarrobo tree (now extinct in the Greater Antilles) which exuded a kind of sticky resin that, after a time, hardened to form copal (an intermediate stage). During the intervening eons the copal became fossilized to the form we now call amber. Authors George Jr and Roberta Poinar have brought it all together in this amazing book. Between the two of them, the Poinars have spent most of their professional lives studying Entomology and amber inclusions to reconstruct a &#34;vanished world&#34;. Roberta is also an electron microscopist and, with the help of some moderne technology, she and George have opened a window into the past. While the Algarrobo resin was still fresh it acted as a perfect litter trap for any kind of plant debris such as: leaves, flowers, pollen, etc. Animal life too found itself stuck in the sticky discharge, to be preserved, along with the plant litter, in minute detail as the resin was slowly transformed into amber. Amber is found in mines though out the world but some of the finest specimens come from the Dominican Republic and are thus named; Dominican Amber. By combining the study of amber inclusions with their knowledge of modern day plants and animals the Poinars have been able to extrapolate many details of this prehistoric world. If we know that certain kinds of termites live in arboreal nests today and we find the same species, or a close relative, in fossil amber then it's a good bet that they had a similar life style. In this well written and visually stunning book the Poinars provide the reader with an extensive list of fossil species as well as a peek into the lives of both modern and extinct life forms. Concepts like: singing caterpillars, extra floral nectaries, ambrosia fungus and tank bromeliads are just a few of many wonders that await you in The Amber Forest.LastRanger"},{"Title":"The Amber Forest: A Reconstruction of a Vanished World.","review":"This book tells of the author's adventures looking for amber as well as facts about it."},{"Title":"The Spanish Missions of San Antonio","review":"This guidebook gives a great, detailed history of the missions of San Antonio as well as providing large historical photographs.

What the other reviewers fail to recognize is the duplicity in the life of this man (understatement) that the author glosses over i.e. the burning of the Christians at his dinner parties is given just a few passages and then excused. The truth being that Nero was a true monster in any definition of the word. Bred from the loins of a killer to be a killer himself, nonetheless born from a lineage of killers going all the way back to Livia, who without, the history of the empire (republic without her maybe) would have been completely different.Why modern writers try to cast emperors such as Tiberius, Caligula, and Nero into a positive, or even neutral, light should be beyond the comprehension of the educated thinker. There are absolutely no excuses for the actions of these human beings and for Champlin to try to do so is irresponsible and he should feel ashamed of himself. I look very forward to his exonoration of the emperor Commodus next."},{"Title":"Nero","review":"Edward Champlin's book provides a revolutionary approach to understanding the commonly misperceived Nero, who now is often portrayed as a demented fool who watched Rome burn while reciting the Iliad; who brutally executed Christians for entertainment; and, whose death was celebrated far and wide. Champlin dispels these misconceptions as products of bias and shows that Nero remained a positive mythological hero for over 400 years after his death even to some Christians and, that he was well loved by a great majority of the people: particularly in Greece and Asia Minor.The book retraces the common sources on Nero as being Suetonius, Tacitus, Plutarch and Dio. Champlin demonstrates how the Latin and Christian sources tend to be severely negative while the Greek ones are either neutral or positive. Champlin then shows how Nero was really a Hellenic phillantropist who freed Greece from taxes and gave it its autonomy. He notes that, after his death, three impostors pretending to be Nero came out of Greece and Asia Minor with significant followings and explains that this could not have happened unless a significant group of people saw Nero as an enlightened folk hero. Champlin reveals also many other biases in Suetonius and Tacitus depicting Nero as tone-deaf and without talent. Champlin shows that other writers commented significantly well on his skills and that the impostors were tested as to their claimed identities by being asked to sing and/or play the lyre. He also demonstrates how members of all classes in Rome willingly participated in both his public and private spectacles and that this wasn't just flattery on their part. More importantly, Champlin shows that Nero was very conscious of his public image and that his public appearances and performances met the collective needs of his audience in being assured of his benevolent rule despite his misdeeds such as incest and matricide. Champlin argues that this well calculated propaganda and interplay with the crowd was the key to Nero's sense of self and power: Nero the artist, entertainer, and idol whose mythological persona wooed the crowds who in turn approved of him as their champion. Champlin thus shows that Nero was hardly a depraved imbecil but a very creative and intelligent self-propagandist.The book is comprehensive but would be even better if it emphasized certain points more clearly. First, for emperors such as Nero and Caligula it is important to supplement the historical analysis with a psychological one as both were psychotic in one way or another: Caligula being primarily a completely deranged sociopath while Nero demonstrated more an Oedipus complex and abandonment issues. Modern readers fail to appreciate that Nero, who died at 30, was very much a boy trapped in a man's body whose mother was none other than Caligula's sister: an overbearing, overambitious, and incestuous mother who sought to rule for herself through her son. With this in context, the image of Nero the monster becomes more of a sad story of a young man whose youth must have been a traumatizing ordeal: a shy and insecure boy of 16 put on the throne by a sinister and depraved mother. Nero's ascension to the throne and breaking away from his mother required strong approval for something that he achieved without his mother's meddling: he found that approval in the crowds and in the Hellenic world with his obsessive devotion to the arts. Nero wanted to act and play games where he would be loved and approved and his artistic talents were the key to that approval: he soon found that such approval could be manipulated into his own collage of the mythical hero for the collective Roman/Greek psyche. The book should have also clarified that many in the Hellenistic world also loved Nero because he was the promoter of major, mostly Greek, factions and guilds involving the arts that affected a broad spectrum of Roman society: most importantly, all of the 4 chariot factions in Rome had strong ties to Greece and Asia minor and they benefitted immensely from Nero's largesse. Finally, the book should have clarified more on the Christians and their place in society at the time. For most of the world at that time, Christianity was nothing more than an obscure and militant sect that followed the teachings of a Jewish rabble rouser crucified under Tiberius' reign. Christians were also very evangelical and apocalyptic at that time: devoted followers strongly believed that Judgment Day was near and Christ would come back to overthrow The Beast (The number 666 in the Apocalypse spells as 'Nero' in Hebraic numerology.) Such beliefs could only have been perceived by pagan Rome as threat to the State requiring strong and immediate punishment. Thus, the modern view of Nero as an Anti-Christ is rather misleading if put into context: Nero was a pagan and never believed in the Judeo-Christian model of the world, he therefore never chose to assume the role of Satan in the biblical sense as modern Satanists (who ultimately accept the notion of God/Satan/Christ/Heaven/Hell as a theological model) would do for example. In addition, the punishment inflicted on the Christians wasn't exceptionally more cruel than the punishment given to all other criminals at that time. Unfortunately, it is with this false paradigm that Nero has been misunderstood until today as a cruel Anti-Christ out to destroy a peaceful religious institution and the book should emphasize this misconception more clearly.In any case, this is a fascinating reevaluation of Nero \\"The Monster/Anti-Christ\\" as Nero \\"The Mythical Hero\\" whose largesse and promotion of the arts made him a well loved emperor by a majority of the populace in the Empire, especially in Greece and Asia Minor. Indeed, his unpopularity was pervasive in the smaller but more powerful social circles of the nobility, army, and the imperial bureaucracy who felt the consequences of a bankrupt treasury much more than the common populace who were the ones who obtained all of the benefits from it. The book dispels the misconception of Nero being a depraved imbecil and shows him to have been a very intelligent and energetic artist/emperor who used his artistic talents to define his public image as a mythical hero. The book is easy to read both for the scholar and the casual reader. I recommend it for anyone who wants an unbiased evaluation of one of Rome's most facinating emperors."},{"Title":"Nero","review":"Champlin has written a delightful book about a troubled Caesar. As the current tends, the author glides much of the discussion of Nero into a course that resembles the sentence: that actor is the emperor whose performances are his politics. Nero's recognition of the real necessity for memorable spectacles as politcally provident does not separate him from other Caesars, however his rare compulsion to be the spectacle in its entirety does. Champlin works hard to identify the tainted strands of Nero's story and succeeds at separating some of the thoroughly tendentious traditions from the popular but less evident cheers for the better buildings and bigger spectacles he sponsored. It was exciting to learn of Nero's afterlife and of all those who expected his return in the fashion of some sort of ur-Elvis.The book is tastefully written and compelling, particularly in its informative appraisal of the historians whose works mold most of the early modern and modern perceptions of this prince. Until his death, Nero sought to create a world that would correspond to his desires; Rome became his Golden Home and primary stage. Champlin reveals much about Nero and his world. This book overflows the boundary of biography to spread into the fields of performance, politics, popular reception, Roman religion, art and historiography. I heartily recommend it."},{"Title":"Nero","review":"Champlin bravely asserts his own contribution to the great wealth of Neronian scholarship for the critics to pick apart. I find very little to quibble about.It is difficult to write even-handedly about Nero for a Western audience. Who could forget the image of a man who \\"fiddled while Rome burned\\" or the terrible tyrant who had begun a nearly 170 year \\"persecution\\" of the early Christians, under whose reign both Peter and Paul were executed? As other reviewer comments reveal, you can easily earn the brand of a Nero \\"apologist\\" if you don't tow the party line, however inaccurate it might be.Champlin's thesis can be stated simply as follows: many, if not most of Nero's grandstands and outrageous actions, were performed out of considerable political shrewdness and calculation - not the madness or puerile excess wrongly attributed to a \\"live fast, die young, and leave a good looking corpse\\" emperor. Nero's success, Champlin argues in the first chapter, is evinced by a shockingly prolonged \\"afterlife\\" manifested in pseudo-Neros, Judeo-Christian apocalyptic writings, and a disenfranchised populace openly lamenting his death. Nonetheless, I cannot help but wonder, (working on the same assumption,) whether he had truly orchestrated his public relations as well as Champlin suggests given his untimely demise at age 30.Some reviewers disagree, but I reckon Champlin's original Nero-Periander link to be one of the most intriguing ideas in ancient biography I've ever seen. The ambivalent relationship with the mother, the Philhellenism, the artistic bent, and the numerous other links are too compelling to ignore outright, even if the conclusion a hard sell. Further research is warranted, but I suspect that Champlin, with his great intellect and energy, may have already exhausted all of the available evidence for advancing his thesis. He demonstrates the Augustus/Antony connections thoroughly. The discussion of the great fire of 64 is arrestingly well done: after convincingly presenting the defense for Nero's innocence, he suddenly shatters the deception in stating that despite this preceding evidence, Nero undoubtedly held direct responsibility for the coflagration. It hits you with dramatic effect almost equal to one of the primary sources comprising the centerpiece of his proof in this sudden reversal: Tacitus' Annales XV.67.Champlin's organization is somewhat bothersome as it is in \\"Final Judgments,\\" because he rejects chronological arrangement for thematic foci. This requires repetition of several facts, and I cannot understand his reasons for the chapter order. The post-mortem legacy of Nero, being most fascinating, he puts up front obviously to hook his reader. It serves as an interesting set piece for further discourse, because the inevitable wonder we feel about Nero's impression on the world ever after demands explanation: thus the rest of the book. But with Dio, Suetonius, and Tacitus unfolding the bulk of their own histories so methodically, the rearrangement isn't always a neat fit. Still, Champlin's brilliant weaving together of hundreds of sources, as before, vindicates his literary decisions several times over.Champlin, like any other historian, has his hypotheses and directs his evidence toward proving them. His presentation however, is replete with past scholarship and primary sources presented candidly and fairly. One of the most appreciable inclusions is the extensive collection of Latin graffiti, which add a critical dimension to our knowledge. This book has been for me an introduction into full-strength Neronian scholarship and I found it both accessible and empowering enough to read further with confidence."},{"Title":"Nero","review":"As an undergraduate, I took Roman History I (up to Augustus), a very good course. Because I was getting a double major in economics and classical languages, I did not have time to take Roman History II, a deficiency I have felt during the several decades since then, although it has nothing to do with my career. So I decided to read a biography of each emperor where available, from Augustus to Justinian.I am now at Nero, for whom I bought this book because of the credentials of the author and the publisher. This was a mistake. I was 100 pages into the book before I realized I would never come to a chapter that began \\"Nero was born in ....\\" This is not a biography but rather a large number of short essays on historiographical problems loosely organized into thematic chapters. I have had to resort to the Oxford Classical Dictionary and numerous surveys of the early Empire to find out basic information about Nero and his reign.This is probably an excellent second book to read about Nero for the analysis of the contemporary evidence, but I still don't know what would be the best book to start with."},{"Title":"Nero","review":"The thesis of this book is that Nero was entirely sane and all interpretations of Nero come from distortions of the way he presented himself. Dr. Champlin's argument compares Nero with various mythological figures. That these line up with specific features or events in Nero's life is, he argues, evidence that Nero promoted these similarities himself through his self-presentation and visual style. Much of this information is useful. His analysis of Nero's change from identifying himself with Apollo to associating with Helios is particularly interesting and most likely correct. This book will not serve as a conventional biography, as he admits himself in the introduction, but is intended to explain the proper way of viewing Nero's actions. The evidence used is almost entirely literary. Despite warning about the unreliability of the sources earlier in the book, even going so far as to call them Tacitus, Suetonius, Dio, and \\"Dio\\" for the epitome, Dr. Champlin uses these sources in great detail almost unquestioningly. This is a problem inherent in many historical works perhaps, but it is particularly obvious here given the way that he uses his sources. They are all treated as biased but essentially all the facts and events listed are presented as true.The problem with the account is that he really does take most of what he reads as true. Even the obvious slanders are treated as perversions of Nero's own presentation. For example on entirely questionable and circumstantial evidence he asserts that Nero did indeed burn down the city of Rome. His evidence is: he twice cancelled a trip to the east for sudden and mysterious reasons, he experienced omens in advance of the disaster, and he was accused by a member of his own guard of setting the fire only nine months after it happened. The middle point does not even require an explanation. Omens were found for every major event in Roman history and could frequently be recalled only after the event. The cancelling of the trip is unusual but hardly cause for such a sweeping accusation. It is not proof. The member of the guard who accused Nero was venting his disgust at the emperor for his way of living and was not necessarily true. None of this is really strong evidence compared to the evidence against: it was just two days after a full moon and therefore a bad night for arson, fires were a constant threat in Rome, Tacitus himself (the most reliable source) was uncertain and seemed to favor an accident, the fires did not start in the areas where Nero wanted to build his Golden House, the fire (while dramatic) was a horribly impractical way of clearing the area and did much damage to his buildings as well, the rebuilding was expensive and drained Rome's treasury substantially, and the people did not blame Nero for it. He views the evidence as damning, but that is because he puts such a high value on his interpretation of Nero's character. Champlin views nothing that Nero does as an accident, so all the little details must be made to fit. Nero is always in control of the situation and is rarely portrayed as merely reacting to events. Since Nero demonstrated such eagerness building his Golden House he must have planned it in advance. In many ways this invalidates Champlin's thesis that Nero was not insane since only a madman would burn down his own capital for no good reason. Unless people fully subscribe to Champlin's interpretation of Nero's character they are unlikely to buy his explanation for the fire.Most of the evidence is not in dispute, only his interpretation of it. For example, he holds that Nero's famous quote \\"What an artist perishes in me,\\" (In Latin qualis artifex pereo) is entirely wrong. Artifex can mean craftsman as well as artist and since he was directing the digging of his own grave Champlin argues that he is referring to himself as a craftsman and not an artist. He is in fact saying \\"what an artist I am in my dying,\\" presumably ironically. Thus he is not mourning his own death but how low he has fallen in his final hours. While the Latin can be taken in that sense it seems While this is rather a minor point to be going on at length about in such a brief paper Dr. Champlin makes a major deal of this in the first part of the book. He views this phrase as symptomatic of the way that Nero's actual words and deeds have been continuously misinterpreted over the centuries. In a way it is symptomatic of his work as a whole. It can be interpreted in that way, but you have to look at it from a very odd angle.This book is brilliant at analyzing the reason behind Nero's public presentation and his choice of heroes to emulate. His actions do make much more sense when viewed in the context of the heroes of the ancient world. A Periander for example lived to extremes and was not very likeable, yet he was much admired. Nero's presentation of his actions offer wonderful parallels with ancient gods and heroes and it seems to be intentional. The manner in which he was loved by the common man suggests that he was successful in associating himself with these figures. The analysis of ancient mores, particularly where performing was concerned, showed that his desire to perform was not as extreme an act as it has been made out to appear in the sources. What enraged contemporaries was his attempt to do it on a professional level. These conclusions are well reasoned and pick out examples of contemporary attitudes with great skill. On the other hand Champlin's use of the sources for historical events is questionable. There is a fine line between trusting the sources too much and discarding too many as unreliable. The author trusts his sources far too much. When he is reporting on contemporary attitudes and opinions this works to his advantage since even a hopelessly inaccurate work reflects an opinion, but when he tries to argue events from character motivation he gets too carried away with himself. If one accepts that Nero did all the things attributed to him then this book will likely make a great deal of sense. If not then it offers some intriguing possibilities but goes too far in its conclusions."},{"Title":"Nero","review":"I am not sure why so many reviewers here think that Edward Champlin is going easy on Nero or recasting him in a positive light. Champlin certainly dispenses with the caricatures that history has handed down to us, including the image of Nero fiddling as Rome burns. He shows us convincingly and I think definitively that Nero was not the buffoon of Roman tabloid authors like Cassius Dio.The picture Champlin gives us of the last emperor of the Julio-Claudian line is far more intriguing. The Nero we find here is, in fact, far more devious and far more cruel in that his crimes were not the result of foolery but were premeditated far in advance of being carried out. Each act of brutality, be it the murder of his mother or the burning of Rome, Nero carefully staged and crafted in order to present himself to the world as a living hero of myth.That's right, I think Champlin convincingly shows us that Nero not only burnt Rome, but planned its burning far in advance. In fact, he telegraphed Rome's burning in actions that are recorded by contemporary authors who did not realize the import of those very actions. Most notably, the blindness episode in the temple of Vesta. Most take the story to be just another example of Nero's craziness. Champlin shows us that it was in fact a carefully scripted part of Nero's show.In the end, I think that those who find Champlin's Nero to be a revisionist and more favorable account of the emperor are missing the point. No, Champlin's Nero is not the Nero of popular myth. He is actually far worse."},{"Title":"Nero","review":"If you've read any relatively recent works on ancient Rome, you'll know that the contemporary sources were infamously unreliable. The principate, established by Augustus, disenfranchised the large aristocracy known as the senatorial class who were, unfortunately for posterity, also responsible for documenting the era. It's therefore accepted that, from them, a historian is only able to gain piecemeal understanding of any Roman figure, especially when it comes to emperors.That they would be hostile is a given but, in \\"Nero,\\" Edward Champlin doesn't merely accept this at its face, instead deciding to devote to it an inordinate amount of time. He compares one source to another and points out the inconsistencies and, in most cases, reconciles them. Easily, he could have simply given one example and then asked us to take his word for it but, instead, continues his discussion of nuanced minutiae throughout.When Champlin finally decides to relate his theory it is, in effect, that \\"Nero the emperor\\" can only be understood through \\"Nero the performer.\\" Because of the notorious difficulties a historian faces in writing an adequate biography of any ancient person, Champlin's interpretation is an interesting way to suss out his life but, by using the games of Nero's reign to evaluate his career as princeps, he forces all knowledge of Nero through a constricted window. While in some instances this works, as with Nero's marriage to Pythagoras and his debauchery of Roman youth, his theory ultimately limits any conclusions he can draw.From the skewed history we do have, we know that Nero was undoubtedly an interesting character. He burned Christians and castrated a youth and made him his bride! While he may or may not have practiced incest, Champlin argues that he almost certainly killed his mother. The evidence for this? Champlin points to his interest in Oedipus. For Champlin's Nero, life was literally a stage and he the central character. While it's probably true that Nero both killed his mother and enjoyed artistic works, Champlin is grasping at straws to establish a connection between the two.Unlike other reviewers here, I entered this foray without much preexisting knowledge of Nero. Also unlike the revisionist works ofCaligulaby Aloys Winterling orSocratesby Robin Waterfield, I felt that Champlin's \\"Nero\\" requires a rather extensive knowledge of the historicity of the emperor with an overriding interest in the intricacies of Roman entertainment and Senatorial misinformation to be enjoyable to any layperson or amateur historian.But the biggest disappointment is the limitations established by Champlin himself. In order to link the fictions (myths, tragedies, etc) and the facts (as we are able to know them) of Nero's life, Champlin relates an extensive history of Roman beliefs. In and of themselves both these fictions and facts are appealing, but his attempts to tie them together are regrettably not."},{"Title":"Nero","review":"Nero is the most controversial figure in Western history. He was denounced as the Antichrist by the early Christians and as a disgrace to the imperial throne by the Roman aristocracy. At the same time he was adored by the common people in Italy and the Greek speaking East. Years after his death Nero sightings generated the same excitement Elvis sightings do today. He was the only Roman emperor, and one of the very few historical figures, to pass into the realm of myth. Even today he still fiddles while Rome burns.In his fascinating, revisionist study of the singing emperor, Champlin reveals a Nero who was a brilliant, learned and enormously energetic young man with a genius for self promotion. He was also a gifted poet and musician whose compositions were popular for centuries after his death at age 30. His passage into the eternal realm was his own doing - he portrayed his role in the death of his mother and wife on stage in the grandiose terms of myth and legend.Rather than a reclusive megalomaniac who shut himself up in a vast palace which threatened to gobble up Rome, Champlin points out that his notorious Golden House was much closer to a public park and entertainment complex. Nero may not have lived there at all. The psychotic monster of today is the product of two thousand years of hostile spin but the truth still shines through the obscuring mist because the Nero legend was created by an artist.I have two reservations about this beguiling, illuminating book. After Champlin convinces us that Nero did not set Rome on fire he does a sudden about face. On the basis of a statement by a single defiant conspirator, he concludes that Nero in fact probably did set the city ablaze. Apocalyptic expectation of the imminent cleansing of the world by fire makes it much more likely that Christian zealots were to blame.My second reservation is that Champlin does not explore the power astrology held over first century Roman minds. Nero's elevation to mythological status was in large part due to his sudden and unexpected suicide which nothing but his blind faith in astrology adequately explains."},{"Title":"Nero","review":"It sounds like this guy's buddies have been reviewing this book, based upon all the glowing reviews. Mr. Champlin (the author) seems to be a gifted researcher...the bibliography is staggering and the details of Nero's life are amazing, if true.

In my mind, a four-star review means that I thought it was at least worth it to wade through them to get to the fruits of his research.

If it is the first, don't use it- send it back and ask for a second printing.The second printing has accurate instructions, drawings and dimensions for building a variety of attractive display cases to grace your living room. As well, the book has extensive instructions on different techniques for making wood frames to put glass into. The emphasis in the book is on adapting a given design to dimensions and techniques that work for you.My deepest apologies to anyone unlucky enough to have gotten the first printing. For the record, I worked long and hard to correct the book and put it in the state of accuracy in which it now stands."},{"Title":"The Complete Elliott Wave Writings of A.

This book contains nothing more than the egotistical ravings of an arrogant, hate-filled, misguided, rabidly anti-Semitic professional protester and race hustler who has thus far abjectly failed to accomplish anything constructive for African-Americans, or for anyone besides himself. In fact, his agenda seems to center upon fostering disunity whenever and wherever he can. Further, his credibility is highly questionable, given his role as one of the chief perpetrators of the Tawana Brawley hoax. This sad, sorry literary effort merely reaffirms that Mr. Sharpton is little more than a posturing, flamboyant, hate-driven windbag whose chief purpose seems to be promoting divisiveness. Readers are advised not to waste their time reading this junk; more than enough time was wasted in producing it."},{"Title":"Al On America","review":"I just happened to wander upon this book at my library. I read a few pages, and due in large part to curiosity, had to check it out. First off, I would never vote for Al Sharpton due to his far left politics. That being said, I respect him nonetheless for the passion and enthusiasm he brings to the table. Let's face it, he's the only Dem candidate with even an ounce of genuineness and passion. He's the only reason to watch the debates.I admire the Reverend for doing things he discusses in the book such as sticking his neck on the line and getting thrown in jail while in Vieques to protest the naval bombings, which has led to cancer and other health problems among its inhabitants. However, I must call in to question the legitimacy of Mr. Sharpton being \\"a man of God\\" when he states things such as the following in his book: \\"My religion does not support homosexuality, but I do.\\" & \\"I will not stand in the way of a woman's right to choose.\\" & \\"Sexual orientation in no way matters when it comes to parenting-all children need is love.\\"Read the book and be your own judge. As for me, I take Mr. Sharpton for what he is - a man who has admirable passion and enthusiasm for his beliefs, no matter how misguided they may be."},{"Title":"Al On America","review":"l don't like him, l don't like his politics, l don't like how he inconveniences others in the name of justice but more to get his fat face on TV.

His views on hip-hop music, Bill Clinton, class struggle, and other issues are quite a hoot, but even when you don't agree with him, he makes you think. As the Rev. Al holds forth on the various issues of the day, this book will date rather quickly due to much of the subject matter as is the case of most books on current political events. But take a trip through the mind of Rev. Al. You'll laugh and you'll get mad at points, but you will think afterwards."},{"Title":"Al On America","review":"In the book AL ON AMERICA by Reverend Al Sharpton, the civil rights activist and 2004 presidential hopeful states his positions on some of the problems affecting American citizens. As the presidential campaigns heat up between now (I write this April 14, 2003) and Election Day, 2004, compare what Reverend Sharpton says in this book to the platforms of other candidates. Tell me if Sharpton doesn't understand what Americans need.In AL ON AMERICA's latter chapters, Reverend Sharpton tells his side of the story regarding some of the more controversial incidents of his career. I find myself comparing Sharpton to the late Martin Luther King, Jr. The media reported half-truths and lies about Dr. King while he was alive but his accomplishments outlived those falsehoods; today we remember King for what he represented. Reverend Sharpton has suffered similar media mistreatment; in time, we will appreciate Sharpton for his triumphs.Unfortunately, AL ON AMERICA, despite the help of writer Karen Hunter, at times is not well written. Sometimes it struck me as a \\"draft\\" in need for further rewrites. Had Reverend Sharpton and Ms. Hunter taken more time rewriting, the book would flow better. I even caught one factual error, not that it matters much - Sharpton refers to musician James Brown getting his start in \\"the late nineteen-sixties\\" when in fact the singer had been making records since the nineteen-fifties.Mistakes and stilted style aside, tell me if these words from AL ON AMERICA do not move you:\\"On our currency and in the courthouses are the words 'In God We Trust.' It's easy to trust God . . . If you get sick, you can call on Him. If you're down, He'll lift you up. It's hard not to trust God. The question is, can God trust you? Can He depend on you the way you depend on Him? . . . During the days following the terror attacks on this nation, the number-one song was 'God Bless America.' The question is, when is America going to bless God? When are we going to take care of the children, take care of the elderly, feed the hungry? God has already blessed America from sea to shining sea. When do we bless God?\\"In 2004, if someone were to survey Americans on the major issues, I would bet they agree more with Reverend Al Sharpton than anyone else running for president. Read AL ON AMERICA. Then vote for Al Sharpton."},{"Title":"Al On America","review":"Edit of 21 Dec 02 to add comment and links.New Comment: Oprah Winfrey has replaced Al Sharpton as the leader of black America, and while Barack Obama is a rising star and has already earned my vote, Al Sharpton is still, in my view, an essential voice and spirit. See links below for why.Black Commentator noted in November that Al Sharpton has assumed the mantle of leadership for black America, and that it is highly likely that he will receive a majority of the black votes, at least in the South. For that reason alone, this book is *must reading* for every Democratic and non-Republican voter.Below I summarize a few highlights from this rich book that took an afternoon to absorb:1) Reverend Sharpton is strongest in his articulation of the hypocrisy of America, its lip service to slogans. I take him at face value when he speaks of the need to unite the country again around its values, and when he speaks of the emerging black/Latino coalition that resonates on the street level.2) He lists some of his role models, and it merits comment that three of the four are pioneers of non-violence: Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Nelson Mandela, and Mahatma Ghandi. Later on the in book Reverend Sharpton discusses James Brown and Adam Clayton Powell as length, and I found his account of their merits and his lessons drawn from them to be compelling and credible.3) Fidel Castro comes in for special mention, as do Ronald Reagan and Minister Louis Frarakhan, and I have to give Reverend Sharpton very high marks for directness and accuracy. Others, those with less integrity, might have left Fidel Castro out for fear of the kind of unethical attacks it might unleash against him from the extremist Republicans. I for one agree with Reverend Sharpton, as I agree with his view that the embargo against Cuba should be ended immediately.4) He is powerful and convincing when he addresses the prison-industrial complex, a complex as threatening to America's long-term security and prosperity as the more well known military-industrial complex. As he points out, prisons are big business, and politicians on pay-offs have every incentive to keep pumping out contracts for major construction and related services including guard employment.5) Reverend Sharpton is intellectual and emotional dynamite when he describes the Democratic Leadership Council (DLC) as an anti-Rainbow Coalition organization, and Bill Clinton (and by extension, Joe Lieberman) as rich boys eager to stay to the right and reap the benefits, rather than true Democrats committed to delivering people from poverty. In brief, Al Sharpton has to run for President precisely because neither the DLC nor Dean are unwilling to reach out to and represent black America in the truest sense of the word. On this basis, I see Ralph Nader's 2000 campaign in a different light--Nader was campaigning for those that the DLC had shut out of the Democratic Process, and Al Gore was too slow to understand that he was leaving a very big crowd out of the big tent.6) Reverend Sharpton impresses me on the foreign policy front. Although his experience is limited to foreign travels and specific interviews, his intellect and his gut instincts are totally consistent with the 430+ books I have reviewed on national security and international relations. Reverend Sharpton gets it: America has made many deals with the devil, with dictators like Saddam Hussein, with terrorists like bin Laden, and the American people do not realize that 9-11 is in fact the beginning of payback for decades of official US hypocrisy in its international relations.7) Although very short on the topic, in my special area of interest, intelligence qua spies and secrecy, I give Reverend Sharpton the highest marks. He is the only Democratic candidate to really understand that we need \\"an intelligence unit that would allow us to really know what's going on out there in the world.\\" Reverend Sharpton is also committed to allies, investments in nation-building, and strong relationships nurtured over time. He also understands that you cannot threaten those who are not afraid to die suicidally, and that whipping out a bigger gun against them is precisely the wrong thing to do.8) He focuses correctly on the internal dynamics of America as its greatest area of vulnerability, as the area most in need of attention if America is to be strong and prosperous. He correctly notes that the 30 percent increase in the US military budget in 2002 was *not* about making America safer, but about buying all the things that could not be rationalized before, and at the expense of domestic priorities such as health and education.9) There are several chapters that offer up specific lists of initiatives that he would support, across many policy areas, and I find them all sensible. This is a man I could work for and follow.10) I am satisfied that he puts the Tawana Brawley matter to rest with a chapter.11) His chapters on black leadership, Jessie Jackson, why anti-Semitism is strongest in the Billy Graham-Richard Nixon crowd, and how the hip-hop movement is both wrong to be obscene and yet a major power in waiting, a power that can mobilize youth toward a more Christian vision, are quite fascinating, words that are not to be found anywhere else.Bottom line, and I say this with the utmost respect, being scornful of most beltway politicians and bandits: Al Sharpton may have baggage and be a spendthrift in some ways, but when all is said and done, his voice absolutely must be fully and consistently heard as America charts its course into the future. Like Pat Buchanan, Sam Nunn, and a few others great voices that may never be President, Rev Sharpton has a depth of intuition, understanding, and experience that he has ably articulated in this book. We need to read it and we need to ask for his views in all major future decisions bearing on the security and prosperity of American's core black community and constituency, a community and constituency that too often in the past has been over-shadowed by new immigrant communities--Asians and Hispanics, for example. America cannot be great if its black community is not itself great. Rev Shapton stamds for this.See also, with reviews:Off the Books: The Underground Economy of the Urban PoorThe Working Poor: Invisible in AmericaNickel and Dimed: On (Not) Getting By in AmericaThe Global Class War: How America's Bipartisan Elite Lost Our Future - and What It Will Take to Win It BackThe Battle for the Soul of Capitalism: How the Financial System Underminded Social Ideals, Damaged Trust in the Markets, Robbed Investors of Trillions - and What to Do About ItExporting America: Why Corporate Greed Is Shipping American Jobs OverseasWar on the Middle Class: How the Government, Big Business, and Special Interest Groups Are Waging War onthe American Dream and How to Fight BackState of Emergency: The Third World Invasion and Conquest of AmericaDay of Reckoning: How Hubris, Ideology, and Greed Are Tearing America ApartI notice from the tags that those who do not like this review appear to be literate but ignorant whites. As Michael Moore notes, it is the whites that have done the most damage to our economy and our society, and in my view, the Wall Street whites have finally realized the error of their ways, and Reverend Sharpton's views will receive a more respectful hearing, especially if we can all come together to elect Barack Obama as President in 2008."},{"Title":"Al On America","review":"I am a huge fan of Rev.

He calls the Democrats the Democratic Leisure Class because he believes they serve the elitists liberal leisure wealthy class of the powerful with media ownership and access to influence the people and maintain control over the processes of democracy.The book is simplistic in its approach to foreign relations dragging it all down to the sins of slavery, that is good argument, but we need more innovative policies for the future. I did find his insights on having lunches with Arafat and Castro enlightening. However, if he thinks he has influence with them then start having these icons of brutality start to mend their ways in their 70's. I will not hold my breath waiting for it.I found his political beliefs quite striking with roots in the conservative and liberal camps making him far more moderate than even he knows today. He backs Judaism beliefs by being against the death penalty and advocates far more understanding and assistance for those who committed crimes. He sees no difference between repentance and forgiveness and thus seeks prison improvement, and I support him on that cause. He feels this will progress society by helping those branded with mistakes of youth and poor judgments to reform with kindness and skills and expects victims to forgive as taught by religious leaders.Moreover, Al Sharpton as a preacher knows the scriptures teach gay sexual practices as a sin but he sees no reason to interfere with an individual's right to practice what he or she wants in life without discrimination letting fate, heaven, or hell decide the paths for everyone.Finally, the Presidential candidate thinks a woman's right to choose should be accepted but does not approved of abortion personally.He is more silent and confused on health care because like many of us it is a choice that will take huge resources from education in the future since America cannot pay for everything.As an advocate of justice, he reveals mix results but retains his strong emotions. The author addresses only his own views on Tawana Brawley, Amadou Diallo, and Abner Louima cases plus the racist's events of Howard Beach and Bensonhurst. They are in direct conflict with the court records. Therefore, he loses creditability since the records are far more fair and precise in their findings than in his adaptations of those events.I believe Al Sharpton has entered into a new phase in his life by writing this book. He knows he must be taken more seriously by the powers in the Democratic Party and public domain for the approval to be elected. No matter how he wants to cut the truth his way, he has to be elected in order to have a place at the table of real power. Power is one thing that cannot be faked, you either have it, or do not, and this book reveals he wants it.I think he will eventually be elected and his transformation from being branded himself as a bias bully to today's fair-minded opportunists will then have to be compromised if he wants to accomplish some of the goals he lays out in this book.It is a good book if you seek to learn more about a man who is learning more every day about him and us so he can build, contribute, and be productive in building a better America."},{"Title":"Al On America","review":"If there were no injustice and if there were no racism;there'd be no need for Al Sharpton.I have been seeing appearances of Al Sharpton for years but only in bits and pieces as doled out by the Party and Media.All presented with the air that he was just a lightweight and someone the Democrats had to humor for the Black/Latino vote;and not someone they had to take seriously. In this book we see a giant of a man who understands what a great loss it is to America to have somewhere in the order of 30% of the citizens excluded from what the rest of the people take for granted.Many people might think that Crime is America's greatest problem,but that is a minor problem compared to racism,prejudice,lack of opportunity,morality,marginalization and so forth that essentially excludes so many from what America is all about.When you stop and think about it,95% of the Black vote has gone to the Democrats and a person like Sharpton is still not taken seriously.What must he think when hears the other leaders of his party,give lip service to his concerns,criticize the Republicans for not caring about anyone but themselves;and then see Powell and Rice in the Bush cabinet.It's not hard to agree with the things Sharpton says,the real issue is how to correct them and what does it take for either of the two parties to have the will to make the changes.There are enough people who are being left out that need the changes Al talks about, that the only way they can get results is to vote for the party who will deliver for them.Although Sharpton is painted as a Leftist;I think he really doesn't believe that big government,socialism,handouts,entitlements are the long term solution to injustice.In fact he suggests several times,empowering people to pull themselves up by their own bootstraps,is the answer.It is hard to imagine any of those seeking leadership in the Democratic party providing the solutions Sharpton is looking for.It is going to take a massive shift in the way government is elected and run.Maybe something along a senerio like this.Al finally concludes that the Democrats have already been given the Black/Latino vote too many times without results.Let Sharpton approach the Republican party with that large vote support and broker a deal.How about this Rice for President ,use capitalism instead of socialist programs to effect change.Create a Secretary of Empowerment,whose mission would be to empower those who have been excluded to take responsibility for themselves.Over the door of the office of Secretary of Empowerment would be enscribed:\\"We may not have put ourselves on the floor,but we damn sure better learn how to get up.And until we do,the question remains,'Are we worthy of the legagy we inherited'\\".To complete the picture the person sitting behind the desk in that office;who else but Reverend Al Sharpton.You don't think things would start to change!!"},{"Title":"The Golden Treasury of Poetry.","review":"I have read this so many times my copy is literally falling apart.

I used an alternate book the second time as a guide and got through it with a B. Of course my 2nd instructor was very competent so that did help. Along with the Bertin book, this one shares the unique distinction of having no answers in the back to any problems. Just hope for old solutions.

When I studied circuit analysis, we had scarcely finished loop and nodal analysis before plunging headfirst into Laplace transforms. Simply put, Laplace transforms are the way, the truth, and the life. They lay open the entire dissected form at one's feet. Why waste time with mounds of insoluble integro-differential equations? Why spin wheels with pretty phasor diagrams that offer no headway toward closed-form solutions? The student will have to invest years upon years in linear systems analysis from the classical control system theoretic perspective, so why not start sooner rather than later? And why, oh why, do Hayt and Kemmerly burden us with terminologic tomfoolery, viz., what is the natural response versus the forced response versus the steady-state response versus the fiddle-de-diddle response?

Because that same semester I was taking Systems Analysis, which had Circuit Analysis as a prerequisite and my daring academic advisor at OSU, the late Dr. Bennett Basore, who signed me up for 19 hours my first semester, warned me that I might have trouble taking those two courses together. My solution was to allocate two or three days over Christmas break to studying this text to make sure that I had its principles down.Naturally, like any good student, I skipped the Preface, which warns, \\"An amused smile on the face of a student is seldom an obstacle to his absorbing information.\\" Imagine my surprise at page 11 when we find a first-hand observer counting electrons, up to a Coulomb, with the footnote that he \\"is a small, *quick* student\\"!

My custom is to annotate the errors on the rear flyleaf of the book. This book should get an award for accuracy. The first error that I found is on page 320 and is a typesetting error on an underscore that most people would overlook! (Most texts have serious errors every 20 or 30 pages.)In the few days that I had, I read the first several chapters and did all the drill problems and most of the problems at the end of the first chapters. This is a very self-explanatory text to those who did well in Algebra and Linear Algebra. Later chapters use a little Calculus. I had a fun and easy time doing enough that I covered all the homework that we had during the first six or eight weeks of the semester! (Although the Teaching Assistant would ask me why I turned in extra problems!)In my edition, only the drill problems have answers. The chapter problems have no answers at all, but I understand that the teacher's edition has answers. This was never a problem, since the text tells in an entertaining and informative manner how to work the problems. If it were not so, I'm sure the problem would have been moved to a different spot in the book!I've spent over 30 years in Electrical Engineering and along the way obtained a Ph.D. in the subject.

An existentialist and Kantian, Jaspers argues that true and pure metaphysical knowledge into the ground of Being (which he calls Transcendence) in an unmediated and rational manner is impossible. Nevertheless, there is a 'way' or 'path' to Transcendence which Jaspers believes is lit up by 'ciphers' (a sort of symbolic language expressed by the concepts and ideas of the metaphysical systems of great philosophers) which are 'illuminated' when the concrete individual's conciousness of their existence is truely awakened by the mystery of their existence.Jasper's philosophical theology draws on a variety of sources, and he shows a strong admiration for the Buddhist refusal to speak about what is unspeakable, yet at the same time the attempt to reach Transcendence. Jaspers uses the Buddhist temple at Borobodour in the Indonesian island of Java to try and illuminate the human quest to reach their ground of Being. One also senses in his philosophy there is a tension in Jaspers, expressed by the influence of Nietzsche, of the need to avoid religious nihilism which denies the value of this life and this world, and the influence of Kierkegaard and Kant, where the unknowable Absolute, while beyond our speculative reason, still has a mysterious attraction to us and irrestiably draws us to it. Jaspers doesn't seem to make up his mind whether it is a good thing ultimately to seek Transcendence at the cost of losing our individuality, and seems quite ambivalent towards it at many points, sometimes seeming to believe it is the ultimate and final goal of all philosophical questioning, and at other times seeing it as something we can't achieve without losing our humanity.For some readers, Jasper's refusal to believe the Godhead can be known and talked about (especially theologians) and his agnosticism about divine revelation in a true sense will be frustrating, while for others, his refusal to take the project of Kant to its logical end and reject metaphysics as fruitless and pointless to engage in, will be equally frustrating. Perhaps what might also irritate the analytical philosopher is Jasper's sometimes imprecise use of language and concepts, and his rejection of the powerful work by people such as Russell, Frege and the positivist school. Even so, Jasper's philosophical theology remains interesting, even if not in the end totally convincing."},{"Title":"And scatter the proud,","review":"This is a strange story set in the mountains.

The approach taken by the authors is one of the most honest of those in the literature, for throughout the book they are careful to note just how much evidence there is to support their position(s), and to what extent further work is to done. Philosophically speaking, the authors are clearly in the materialist camp, believing that Cartesian dualism does not cohere with current scientific knowledge. But they state that materialism is not an established fact, allowing the possibility, but not the probability, that dualism may in fact be true. They reject early on though any &quot;arguments from ignorance&quot; in their assertion that just because neuroscience does not have an explanation of consciousness, that such an explanation is impossible. The authors call the failure to be able to think of consciousness in terms of neuronal activity &quot;intuition dissonance&quot;, and reject completely its efficacy in establishing the truth of the nature of the mind/brain.The underlying theme in the book is to explain emergent properties as &quot;high-level&quot; effects that are dependent on &quot;lower-level&quot; phenomena, hence rejecting the thesis that they are &quot;nomologically autonomous&quot;, i.e. that such a dependence cannot be done and is outside the domain of science. The science in this book recognizes its historical origins, and it is clear that the authors will not accept explanations of the mind/brain that do not involve scientific experimentation and analysis. Much has been done experimentally in neuroscience since this book was published, especially using the techniques of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A brief discussion of MRI is given in the Appendix of the book, but no doubt if the book were updated there would be a lengthy overview of it. The current experimental situation in neuroscience has led some to predict a total &quot;reverse engineering&quot; of the brain in the upcoming decades. This prediction is an optimistic one, but no doubt detailed knowledge of the brain will continue to accelerate, this being a sign of what the authors call &quot;a remarkable time in the history of science&quot;.The authors devote an entire chapter to the computational modeling of the brain, mostly of course dealing with the mathematics of neural networks. The approach in this chapter though is still at a level that would allow a general audience to follow it. Readers with a background in physics, especially statistical physics, will appreciate more the discussion on Hopfield networks and Boltzmann machines. Experimental results are inserted as graphs throughout the book, with detailed explanation. As a whole the discussion of the biology of the brain is purely descriptive, and the line drawings could stand some improvement.The chapter on neuronal plasticity is the most interesting in the book, the authors viewing the brain as an entity that is continuously undergoing modification. Their stated goal in the chapter is to explain how the &quot;local&quot; property of plasticity can result in the &quot;global&quot; property of learning. Clearly intelligence to the authors is an emergent property, i.e. an object or device may be characterized as intelligent without its components being intelligent. Particularly interesting in this chapter was the discussion of the amnesia of a patient who underwent bilateral resection of mesial temporal lobe structures. The time scales of the patient's memory are striking: he remembered things before the surgery but could not remember things that happened a few minutes or hours ago, but could remember things within a minute in his past. The authors also mention the fascinating work of Antonio Damasio and his collaborators, this research being even more important at the present time. The scientific study of consciousness is just beginning and no doubt this study will give many surprises as it develops throughout the twenty-first century."},{"Title":"The Computational Brain (Computational Neuroscience)","review":"There is an argument that this is a book of its time. It is nearly fifteen years since it was put together and a great deal of neural water has flowed under the bridge. The thematic enthusiasm for computationalism that dominates the book has not been convincingly proved in the meantime. If anything, the computational properties of models have been shown to entertain many unpleasant complexity results. Moreover, the localisation of brain functions grounded in naive interpretations of lesion effects has come under greater scrutiny due to detailed MRI results. Given twhat was known at the time, it is unsurprising that the book focuses on the visual system - a focus also found in Christof Koch's recent book. Acknowleding all that and more, it would be hard to find a better condensation of science, computationalism, and philosophical speculation than in this book.Leaving aside downsides arising from recent discoveries that the authors could not have anticipated, the book can be frustrating to read at times. In particular, there is a tendency to introduce technical concepts and descriptors into accounts without prior definition. For example, very early on in a brief account of monkey vision there is mention of V4, MT, etc. The terms are neither defined nor explained. Strangely, in the introduction to networks, the inner product of two vectors is explained while the outer product is not. Small points but the oversight recurs.The philosophical content in the book is light, but the assumptions driving the work are among the most contentious. There is no point reaming off a list but the book does not shirk supporing the brain-as-a-computer hypothesis.All in all a stimulating work, if in need of updating."},{"Title":"The Computational Brain (Computational Neuroscience)","review":"This extremely interesting book integrates our vast knowledge of neuroscience with computational models of perception, sensori-motor integration, memory etc.For students of neuroscience, computer science and psychology this book is extremely important, because it gives you the necessary fundamentals of this field(namely computational neuroscience) so you can get to more advanced levels easily.Understanding the book will need some background in higher mathematics (differential calculus)."},{"Title":"The Computational Brain (Computational Neuroscience)","review":"I bought this book in 1995 and read it cover-to-cover in 2009. It is an enormously valuable tour of many neuroscience topics, but the general (reasonably sophisticated) non-specialist reader must be tolerant of the very numerous gaps and discontinuities. In other words, this book is not self-contained in the sense that a non-specialist can pick it up and understand it.In order to wade through all of this book, one must first know enough to be able to fill in the very large gaps, and to bridge the discontinuities. I think that at least half of the technical terms were not defined at all. I felt it was a bit like picking up the proceedings of a research conference. One does not expect continuity in conference proceedings; nor does one expect everything to be defined. But generally in a book, one does expect definitions and continuity. The authors have given copious references parenthetically in the text, and background reading suggestions at the end of each chapter. But footnotes with definitions of terms would have been more useful. If one needs to look up too many things, one may as well read a different book. (Of course, there is a substantial bibliography at the end of the book also.)Still, it's good for those who are curious about the neurosciences to be thrown in at the deep end to read some snippets about the functional hierarchy of the brain, the basic facts in each level of the hierarchy, the functional capabilities and interrelationships between regions and sub-regions of the brain, numerous specific mechanisms for transmitting information from one part of the brain to another, numerous methods of encoding sensory inputs for transmission within the brain, some intriguing functions of the hippocampus, and the coupling between sensory inputs and motor outputs.The impression I had after reading this book is that the brain is no more nor less than a big associative engine. In other words, it is totally unlike the von Neumann architecture or any other kind of human-made computer. I also had the impression that an amazing amount is already known, and I look forward to the day when enough pieces of the jigsaw have been put in place to see an overall picture emerge for how the brain does what it does. (My own principal interest in the matter is to know the physical basis of the \\"seat of consciousness\\", for some meaningful definition of that naive concept.)My conclusion is that this book is an excellent sampler of research in computational neuroscience. Since it covers a broad area, it gives some perspective on the relations between the different areas of the subject. So it's a good place to start, to get some ideas for what to read next.

Originally published at The Way of Karate: Beyond Technique, this book will guide karate practitioners to another side of karate, a softer, more powerful, and more spiritual side as described by one of the pre-JKA pioneers, Shoto Kai Master Shigeru Egami. This book provided insight and helped me improve my karate (I have trained in Wado Ryu for over 20 years). The book also has historical significance in that it provides a window into the understanding of a man who trained with Funakoshi and went on to make his own discoveries."},{"Title":"The Heart of Karate-Do","review":"This is no doubt a true classic in the traditional Karate world, which I should find no reason not giving it full marks.

I was so surprised when I received it, finding out that they'd replaced all the demonstration photos from the older version. What a dumb move. The quality of the new photos might be a little bit better, but the new demonstrators are simply not on par with the ones in the original version.My advice: If you can afford the $ and time, hunt down an out-of-print copy of the original version instead."},{"Title":"The Heart of Karate-Do","review":"Think again! But for the pioneering spirit of Shigeru Egami...Egami pioneered certain flexability and strength exercises that are demonstrated in this book. Included are several kicking exercises which are similar or identical to many done by Korean and Chinese stylists, like the jump split kick, jump double front kick (both feet out at the same time), and so on. Also many jumping and flexing exercises. If you are familiar with the martial art of Shintaido, founded by Horoyuki Aoki, you will note many similarities, for Aoki, a disciple of Egami's, encorporated many of Egami's flexibility training ideas and techniques directly into Shintaido, making them the foundation of the art and doing away with much of the ridgidity that had taken over Shotokan since Funakoshi. Egami was an accomplished karate man, unafraid to innovate, experiment, and include new helpful training methods. Advanced &quot;hard&quot; stylists should enjoy this book, especially Shotokan, Wado-ryu, Sh'to-ryu, Kyokushinkai. Egami is seen in some circles as the &quot;Tohei of Shotokan&quot;, innovating and changing karate in a manner similar to the way Koichi Tohei changed Aikido."},{"Title":"The Heart of Karate-Do","review":"I was eager to read this book. I have read virtually all articles by and about master Egami on the Internet, for I admire his idealistic view of karate do, and his struggle to turn it into a way to make oneself a better person.Master Egami found that the karate he had been training was somehow misdirected. Not Funakoshi's fault, though. I kept wondering why Funakoshi students did their techniques differently than Funakoshi, and I finally concluded that it was the kumite practice.While Funakoshi's main teaching devices where punching the makiwara and kata, his students wanted to learn how to fight and therefore included sparring in their curricula, but did this privately for Master Funakoshi wouldn't like it (there are many examples of Funakoshi being upset when he heard about sparring training). Most of the technique deviations from master Funakoshi's teachings came from senior students who practiced sparring and developed their own training regimes. This was the karate Egami practiced for a long while.What I wonder is why master Funakoshi didn't do anything to stop this, like not granting the senior students their black belts. In any case, Egami trained and mastered a karate full of force and contraction which, for a young man, could be really effective.Why, then, would he change the way he practiced and understood karate?Egami's awful experience at Nakano base where he had to train soldiers left marks. He felt karate was but the art of homicide, and that he was training murderers (which indeed he did while at Nakano). That must have hurt, because I think of Master Egami as a nice person. Therefore, he tried to change the karate he had learnt into something else, not to oppose but to cooperate; not to move against but to move with your oponent; to react to your opponent as if you were parts of something bigger. Some sort of coordination and harmony (the 'ai' in 'Aikido' and in 'Deai').This idea permeated the way of striking and of blocking. This idea is related to concepts such of rythm, timing and distance.Furthermore, Master Egami became ill many times throughout his life, and had to approach karate training very differently than the way he trained when he was young, without force and without contraction of the body, and that is how he discovered a new way to strike (which, in my opinion, is the traditional way, that is, the way of Okinawa).Therefore, by making his techniques more relaxed and blending the concepts of rythm, timing and distance into the techniques, Egami acquiered a very effective yet apparently light tsuki.Tsuki = relaxation + breathing + rythm + timing + distance. That is the new way of striking. This is the way of striking that needed a new approach to blocking. Not just the way to form a fist, or the stances (which he also changed). The rest is history.Another thing that influenced Master Egami's karate was his spiritual quest, which gave birth to the Rakutenkai (which, in turn, gave birth to Shintaido). There are many references to ki and esoteric stuf like the kata in Appendix II. I think that his experience in WWII must have been devastating.In my humble opinion, The heart of karate do is not a book to learn techniques (eventhough it includes nice pictures and descriptions of the basic stances and striking, blocking and kicking techniques, no to mention the warm up excercises). It is, on the other hand, a very inspiring book."},{"Title":"The Heart of Karate-Do","review":"It is very famous in Japan that Egami looked for soft and smooth Karate in Aikido or Shinei dai do.His techniques are not like Karate we imagine. How to make fist is very different from other Karate because Egami way is very good to give a blow to human beings, not good for a brick or a board.A kind of meditation, &quot;A&quot; and &quot;Un&quot;, seems funny.

She captures the character as well as the picture of each State (Croatia,Dalmatia, Serbia, Macedonia, Bosnia, and Montenegro). We literally travel with her through the spring snow, the beautiful countryside, the mountains, toward the religious festivals and ceremonies (Orthodox, Catholic, and Muslim) she seeks with such vigor. We witness with her the conflict of past and present history, past and religion that sparks up like flint banging out fire in such tight geographic proximity-- conflict we see even today. The book is long but broken into manageable chapters; the work, plowed through from beginning to end, is exhausting-- as if we actually walked with her through each of the states, climbed each stone wall and looked over her shoulder as she rested under a tree recording in her journal everything she is about to tell us. If there is one criticism I have of the present edition it is simply that there are no maps-- I can see everywhere I go in the journey with her crisp description of place, but I was forced to go to an atlas to see where I had been. This has been called a classic of 20th Century Lit. It is an amazing tour de force. And as much as it is a journey through the history of people and place, it is also a powerful description of the mind of a woman who had eyes to see and words to help share that world with all of us. RAF"},{"Title":"Black lamb and grey falcon: A journey through Yugoslavia","review":"Today's reviewers skewer West because she had a Serbian guide, because she was a tourist, ad nauseum.The real reason they hate her is because West says things that grate on the average multiculturalist.West's unpleasant-yet-true observations include:The Germans hate the Slavs.The Turks ruined the Balkans.The Austro-Hungarian Empire was a parasite whose death is reason enough to celebrate what Princep did.West's observations throw light on the current hateful sham of the Ramboullet ultimatum that insured that American bombs would fall on the Balkans. It also explains why a bunch of thugs like the KLA would get such deep support from Germany.I thank Ms. West for her blunt words. The current fad of pretending that real ethnic differences do not exist will pass. And the carping about the shortcomings of &quot;Black Lamb and Grey Falcon&quot; will pass as well."},{"Title":"Black lamb and grey falcon: A journey through Yugoslavia","review":"and found this very useful. He balked at the size of it. The paperback is HUGE. But he read it and said an awful lot has not changed.But read it for the pleasure of her writing. You can't write a book that long and have it all pleasure, and some of the political complaints of earlier posters are quite justified. I first read it in the seventies,from the library, when it was out of print.The huge paperback came out before the Sarajevo olympics, and I bought it then, and now I'm contemplating the Kindle edition, even though it's 18.99.I just want to have this book available for the rest of my life!"},{"Title":"Black lamb and grey falcon: A journey through Yugoslavia","review":"Never before and never after have the mind of this tortured region - the Balkan - been thus penetrated: with such passionate, humane precision, with such eloquence, with such empathy and such conviction. A classic, if ever there was any, a masterpiece without a doubt. It is as fresh as yesterday's news and as ancient as the monasteries it describes. It is an eternal work, a must for Balkan afficionados, a work of scholarship and love. Influenced by it, I wrote this (in my 'After the Rain - How the West Lost the East'): 'The Balkans is the unconscious of the world...It is here that the repressed memories of history, its traumas and fears and images reside. It is here that the psychodynamics of humanity - the tectonic clash between Rome and Byzantium, West and East, Judeo-Christianity and Islam - is still easily discernible.' Thank you, Rebecca West. Sam Vaknin, author of 'After the Rain - How the West Lost the East'."},{"Title":"Black lamb and grey falcon: A journey through Yugoslavia","review":"This is a fascinating book on a number of levels. It is intensely personal, written in Rebecca West's characteristic tone of bullying good sense. It describes with great insight personal relations between a number of sharply-drawn &quot;characters&quot; in a distinctly novelistic way. It also provides a vivid travelogue of a long-lost age, by now nearly as remote as the middle ages, irretrievably lost to us behind the triple cataclysms of World War II, communism and Milosevic. Finally, long digressions in the book provide an impressionistic presentation of Yugoslavian (mainly Serbian) history.The weakest part of the book, in my opinion, is the dialogue, which is frequently stilted and for that reason detracts from the immediacy of the travelogue. West's unnamed husband -- referred throughout merely as &quot;my husband&quot; -- is made to talk exactly as West herself writes, and unsurprisingly he and she always agree. But that the book should contain considerable dialogue, and that of distinctly intellectual cast, in itself illustrates its uniqueness.Reviewer Edo Bosnar's main complaint, it seems, is that the book is not something that it makes no claim to be. It's not a textbook of Balkan history or politics, nor is it presented as a work of scholarly research or interpretation. It makes no pretense of being fair -- fairness doesn't enter into it. What makes the book so compelling, in my view, is precisely that it doesn't fit into any category. It's not just a book, it's a genre all its own.I write as a person who believes that no book should exceed 300 pages without some very good reasons. Black Lamb and Grey Falcon has some excellent reasons for its great length."},{"Title":"Black lamb and grey falcon: A journey through Yugoslavia","review":"West probes well the issues of &quot;the Balkans&quot;. Her reader is treated to an engaging and intriguing look at ethnic strife, at conflicting cultural histories, at myths elevated to the status of religious significance. Her prose is something to be savoured, to be enjoyed. While it did take me in excess of a month to plow through her immense work (in excess of 1100 pages) and to feel as though I was coming remotely close to doing it justice, it was time well-worth it. The issues that she ultimately addresses are not confined to history---they linger with us today; nor are they simply questions to aid us in understanding polito-cultural behaviour in the Balkans...they are universal, timeless issues. I have no qualms in believing Rebecca West to be one of the giants of 20th century literature...this is an exquisite work, well worth the time and energy to consume."},{"Title":"Black lamb and grey falcon: A journey through Yugoslavia","review":"I bought this book recently interested to learn more about a troubled region and because of its description as &quot;a masterpiece...in the subtlety and power of its judgment...&quot; and &quot;...one of the great books of our century&quot;. Deeply disappointed after the initial chapters, I could not force myself to read it beyond the 94th page of the Penguin Book edition. Let me tell you why.In the end of the prologue the author states: &quot;I am never sure of the reality of what I see, if I have seen it only once; I know that until it has firmly established its objective existence by impressing my senses and my memory, I am capable of conscripting it into the service of a private dream.&quot; This sentence explains best why this whole book seems to be nothing but a private dream; she sees most things only once, and many of the historical anecdotes described by her not at all. Her bias towards one of the nations begins with her Note on Pronunciation, and her understanding and comments on the spelling of local names is representative of what she does to the history and facts found in this region.Magnificent in volume and truly eloquent descriptions of private dreams that begin on page one with the description of a dream-like state induced by anesthesia, and this state of mind seems to permeate the whole book. If you are interested in that and in numerous irrelevant stories and fictionalized history, you will love this book. If you want objective information on this region, and will be bothered by not being able to differentiate between what is fact and what fiction, you should probably stay away from it, since it will be a waste of your time.There are much better books than this one. For the lovers of fiction I can only recommend the Noble prize winning &quot;The Bridge on the Drina&quot; by Ivo Andric, a true masterpiece, or for the lovers of fact and history the excellent and fun to read chapters on Yugoslavia in &quot;Eastern Approaches&quot; by Fitzroy MacLean."},{"Title":"Black lamb and grey falcon: A journey through Yugoslavia","review":"Like many other reviewers on Amazon, I discovered this author and her work through reading Robert Kaplan'sBalkan Ghosts: A Journey Through History. \\"Black Lamb and Grey Falcon\\" is certainly a compelling work, full of vivid imagery and references to otherwise unknown or poorly understood historical events but it may, however, not be an entirely objective account. The reader must be aware, however (and it is hard to see how any reader could possibly miss it) that West was not only a Serbophile and an enthusiast for a greater Yugoslavia dominated by Serbia, but also (perhaps unconsciously) willing to stamp her romantic vision of South Slav/Serbian nationalism and idealised peasant society on everyone fated to live in the Balkans. In every respect, West lives in a Manichean world where Serbia is white and any historic adversaries (the defunct Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman empires in particular) are uniformly black, and while I am sure that it was very easy at times in the 1930's to see much that was dark in Germany, her Germanophilia - in matters large and small - is surely excessive.Reading \\"Black Lamb and Grey Falcon\\" I was reminded in different ways of three near contemporary English authors, George Orwell, Wilfred Thesiger and Virginia Woolf. West shares with Orwell broadly similar (strongly held) political positions and a real descriptive power, with Thesiger the innate sense of inquiry coupled with a desire that these picturesque natives should retain their romantic customs pleasing to the English passerby, while with Woolf (who I am admittedly less familiar with - or fond of - than either Orwell or Thesiger) she shares the tendency to superimpose the concerns and perspectives of a very select class of literary-minded upper-class Englishwomen on humanity in general and women in particular.This may sound like a negative review, but the power of West's writing is such that this is actually quite an engrossing read - the experience of reading it is just somewhat like reading a erudite, interesting (albeit very long) but clearly partisan opinion piece in a newspaper which prefers to promote a \\"world view\\" rather than objective. It is still a rewarding read and does provide one particular view of the Former Yugoslavia, but I would caution against forming too many historical or political opinions on this work alone."},{"Title":"Black lamb and grey falcon: A journey through Yugoslavia","review":"The best reason to read this book, is not so much to learn about Yugoslavia as it was before WWII, but to enjoy Rebecca West's enormous witty and profoundly intuitive gift for illuminating entire themes, peoples, places, social patterns, and aspects of history, through the application of metaphor to small, anecdotal events or particular places or sights.Examples will illustrate this: (pg 268) (Describing Slavs listening intently to a folk musician) \\"Look at them, they are Slavs, they believe that the next Messiah may be born at any minute, not of any woman, for that is too obvious a generation, but of any impersonal parent, any incident, any thought.\\" (pg 655): \\"some superb women whose fine and bitter faces were unveiled, and therefore must be Christian, yet wore the Turkish trousers, and strode along in a gait that knew nothing of Islam, or indeed of Christianity, but remembered a primitive matriarch.\\" Or (pg 75) \\"he lived his whole life to free Croatia from Hungarian rule...he had ended by believing that the Hungarians had had the best of everything in all respects, and that this world of musty antlers, and second-rate pictures and third-rate furniture was superior to the world where peasants sang in church with the extreme discriminating fervor which our poets envy, and wore costumes splendid in their obedience to those principles of design which our painters envy....\\" Or, (pg 379) \\"This was a Slav, this is what it is to be a Slav. He was offering himself wholly to his sorrow, he was learning the meaning of death and was not refusing any part of the knowledge.\\" (pg 92)\\"She had that vigorous young beauty that seems to carry its keen cold about with it. Her eyes were bright and her cheeks glowed as if she were not really here, as if she were running on her points up the cornices of a snow peak to a fairy ice-palace.\\" WEst's whole book is teeming with such jewels. Gather them and delight in their faceted lights!To relish these intuitive glimpses into present circumstance, that illuminate whole patterns of the human condition, is why you read Rebecca West. Some reviewers have critiqued her for being \\"germanophobic,\\" possibly because in her book she honestly records her struggles with Gerda, the German wife of her Serbian guide Constantine. However, unless we imagine that West is completely making up the stories about Gerda and her extraordinary negativity and rude behavior, which would be quite out of keeping with what we can readily discern of West's character through her writing, we must acknowledge that it really isn't her German ethnicity which makes Gerda so offensive: she's just a highly offensive and rude person who happens to be German. Besides, West is able to draw color and adventure out of Gerda's rudeness, in the fine manner with which she seems able to do this with every aspect of her travels: \\"In the lounge Gerda was sitting quite still, dazed in contemplation of my inconsiderateness as an antique monk of Mount Athos in contemplation of his navel, and Constantine was nervously agreeing with the strictures she had made before she passed into full ecstasy.\\" (Pg 633).Anyone who is capable of seeing how a person can actually find what almost amounts to spiritual \\"ecstasy\\" in their own contempt or dislike, is someone who has something so valuable to offer all of us, to free us from where we may find obstacles and constrictions in \\"the human condition\\", and instead find these manifestly endearing, poetic and metaphorical tributes that open us up to the fascinating mystery of human life, in Yugoslavia or anywhere in the world."},{"Title":"Black lamb and grey falcon: A journey through Yugoslavia","review":"Rebecca West's Black Lamb and Grey Falcon is really a masterpiece of the &quot;deep map&quot; genre, which incorporates into her travel narrative the insightful retelling of Balkan history.Sadly, her bias against Austrians and Germans and her reliance on scholarship that has proved faulty in recent years undermine some of the factual side, but somehow facts aren't the only key to understanding in this case. Her narrative illustrations of the assasination of Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo and the attentat that killed King Alexander and Queen Draga in Belgrade are some of the most amazing prose written, whether you view her version as fact or fiction or somewhere in between.West is a marvelous storyteller, especially when the story -- in some form -- took place, making this worth a look, even if it's only to read through sections of specific interest."},{"Title":"Black lamb and grey falcon: A journey through Yugoslavia","review":"This is perhaps one of the most amazing and persuassive exercise of the power of empathy, of how a person can absorb and relay not only the facts, but the nuances which West observed such that the reader has empathy for all &quot;tribes&quot; in the Balkans. I do wish our President had read this book.This book is crucial reading now, much more than just art, for those whose actions will impact millionsin the weeks ahead. For those people, not to read this book would be just short of a criminal, as history, especially in the Balkans, repeats itself over and over and over and over."},{"Title":"Black lamb and grey falcon: A journey through Yugoslavia","review":"During her travels through Yugoslavia Rebecca West was mostly accompanied by Constantine, a Serbian Government Official, most of her explanation of historical events are actualy the opionion of her travel companion. Constantine is a strong supporter of a Yugoslavia, therefore he is not only Pro-Serbian but is racist against Croats and Muslims. It is very evident in this book that Ms. West has developed this racist attitude as well.I found the book very difficult to follow because of her poetic descriptions of situations and her habit of wandering off on tangents. I recommend the book, solely as a good travel book and not as a good source of history. I recommend instead, A Nation Forged in War by Marcus Tanner as a history book, not only is Marcus Tanner's book well written and organized, it is very objective, therefore reader gets a better understanding of why certain ethnic groups would feel a certain way."},{"Title":"Black lamb and grey falcon: A journey through Yugoslavia","review":"I purchased BL&amp;GF a week ago to read about the former Yugoslavia. I can understand that after the first Great War there was plenty anti German sentiment to go around. The racial and ethnic stereotypes do not stop with Germans but with Croats, Bosniaks, Montenegrins, and Macedonians. The latter which were referred to as either Bulgarians or Serbs. It was well written but historically inaccurate. All we need now is for Oliver Stone to Direct the movie."},{"Title":"Black lamb and grey falcon: A journey through Yugoslavia","review":"This book will perk your interest in travelogues and Balkan embroidery. It is masterpiece theatre fodder as well as an a comprenhensive overview of Balkan history and politics.(1) She is decidedly biased (as acknowledged in other reviews); pro-Serbian and anti-Teutonic. Examples of her anti-Teutonic bias include: Germans sneaking into the first class compartment on a train, the vilification of a German orthodox monk, the pomposity of the German WWI memorial, and the cruel Austrians who imprisoned Princip in a damp and unhealthy cell as punishment for assassinating the Archduke.(2) Rebecca West was obsessed with degrading effeminate men and discussing the castration of masculinity. This obsession led us to believe all was not well between Rebecca and her banker husand in the bedroom. We were left questioning the sexuality of her emasculated husband.(3) Often times Rebecca was left alone, when her husband and their driver, Dragutin, suspiciously disappeared and then returned after long periods of time with pretty flowers for Rebecca.(4) We think this is an engrossing introduction to the Balkans, author's subjectivity notwithstanding. Rebecca's characters in the book may not be real; they may have been embellished to make a point. For example, did Constantine - the self-hating Jew - and Gerda - his pro-Nazi wife - really exist, or were they invented for propoganda purposes? We think Rebecca was trying to alert the unsuspecting populace of Europe to the negativism of fascism.(5) Did she buy heavily embroidered clothes for her effeminate banker husband? Where are all of those fine examples of Balkan folk art now? However, having just recently returned from the Balkans, one of us can attest that works of embroidery are still sold as souvenirs, albeit in the airport gift shop.(6) Her absence of gruesome details of torture are most appreciated. Even without gory details, there is a memorable account of Queen Draga's assisnation and how the palace coupe was brought to fruition at her very &quot;finger tips&quot;. Wait a minute, Queen Draga, or was it a Drag Queen?(7) Amuse yourself by opening the book at random and seeing how many descriptions you can count of &quot;jolly, healthy men&quot;.(8) What did Rebecca have in mind when she recounted the episode in Montenegro where she was led down a slippery and rocky precipice in the mountains by a disturbed young man?In addition to the salient points above: the prose was exemplary, however, the length was daunting - it took one busy executive six months to finish the book, while another executive finished it in two months, as he was able to read it during staff meetings."},{"Title":"Black lamb and grey falcon: A journey through Yugoslavia","review":"Ms West was a great storyteller and she shines in this book. The problem I find is that she, like Rousseau,loved the primitive,hated the empires and glorified ethnicity and nationalism.

Amador"},{"Title":"Black lamb and grey falcon: A journey through Yugoslavia","review":"&quot;Black Lamb and Gray Falcon&quot; is the best and most complete book about Yugoslava written in English, and also probably the best travel book ever written. Anyone interested in understanding the roots of the current conflict should read this book. West covers Yugoslav (esp. Serbian) history in depth, and provides great detail about early 20th Century Yugoslavia. She also provides great insight into the historic conflicts that led to today's confrontation between NATO and Yugoslavia."},{"Title":"Black lamb and grey falcon: A journey through Yugoslavia","review":"Or in this case, &quot;Too many words.&quot; Among serious books this is the most needlessly verbose and narcissistic I've ever read (exclusive of anything by Proust.) It must be largely fictional since West purportedly repeats verbatim many extremely lengthy and involved conversations and disputes that would only be capable of capture by a tape recorder--and she didn't have one. It is entirely pro-Slavic and tediously anti-German. To West, Gavrilo Pricip is a hero and the Archduke Francis merely a foreign agitator. She includes a vast array of detailed historical anecdotes but leaves one doubtful of her accuracy. She is apparently unaware, for instance, (perhaps deliberately) that the Albanians are not Slavs, that their ancestors were the ancient Illyrians, and that their roots in the Balkans go back to at least 2000 B.C. Some claim to admire her writing style; I found it excessively wordy and personalized."},{"Title":"Black lamb and grey falcon: A journey through Yugoslavia","review":"The subtitle of this book is &quot;The Domestic Front, 1939-45&quot;, which suggests that it will be an essential read for anyone interested in the Battle of Britain in 1940-41. The focus is on the role of the British women in that period, and their roles as mothers, wives, factory workers, nurses, entertainers, farmers and others. In the process, the authors provide a wide-ranging description of life in the British isles during the period. Not the least of the virtues of the book are numerous photographs--dramatic ones of bomb shelter existence, domestic ones such as that of a woman pondering the complexities of ration stamps. Also fascinating are reproductions of posters, advertisements, government documents, and other semi-official literature to inform and inspire the civilian population. This book will be invaluable to anyone interested in the period."},{"Title":"Black lamb and grey falcon: A journey through Yugoslavia","review":"This book is a huge disappointment. Instead of discovering the history of a wonderful people, I found bigotry, racism, snobisness and intolerance. At page 200 or so, and after many tries to warm up to this author with her narrow-minded and slanted views, I decided to just put it down and search for unbiased history in other sources. To readers who haven't visited the Balkans, I'd suggest save your money to actually travel there. You won't be disappointed by the wonderful islands or it's people."},{"Title":"Black lamb and grey falcon: A journey through Yugoslavia","review":"As an intelligence officer in the US Army who was stationed near Zivinice recently, I have been inclined to keep up on Yugoslavian politics and to educate myself on its history. This book is the singlemost comprehensive source of history on Yugoslavia I have seen, without being a textbook. It is better than a textbook because it adds the necessary human element to history. Having spoken with Serbs, Croats, and Bosniacs in Bosnia, and from reading the daily newspaper articles and political rhetoric from the region, I believe that West understands the historical reasons for the attitudes of the peoples she meets as well as anyone can understand them, and she reports them acurately. There are only two shortcomings to the book, neither of which is nearly powerful enough to make the reader want to pause. First, and this can't really be called a shortcoming, the book is pre-WWII, so a significant source of modern Serb-Croat animosity is unrealized. The work Chetnik is mentioned only once or twice in passing, and the word Ustashe has not yet even come into being for West. Balkan Ghosts by David Kaplan is a good &quot;sequel&quot; for those who want post-WWII history. The second, and very real, downfall is West's conceit. She is supremely opinionated against those with whom her personality conflicts, and she often allows a perceived slight from a passerby or the disagreement of an acquaintance to turn into a half-page rant about how &quot;ignorant&quot;, &quot;childish&quot;, &quot;stupid&quot;, or &quot;idiotic&quot; such people are who fit her type-cast of her newfound social or philisophical enemies. Also, you will have to drudge though her lectures on art and archetecture, which are usually the sources of her aforementioned literary ravings. Overall, the book is a treasure of history, infinitely preferable to the serious mind to any title by one of the myriad of historical carpetbaggers on the subject with titles containing the words &quot;death&quot;, &quot;destruction&quot;, or synonyms thereof."},{"Title":"Black lamb and grey falcon: A journey through Yugoslavia","review":"BLGF is a gigantic grab bag of a book.If your interested in the former yugoslavia,it is a fascinating read.Although i don't think anyone would wish it longer than it is.West offers sharp and at times profound insights.However the reader needs to be careful.West's prejudices distort much of what is on view.The first of these is her near pathological hostility to all things german.One might think that would not be all that important in a book on yugoslavia.It turns out to be of critical importance.West combines this anti-germanic perspective with a pronounced anti-catholic bias.Once you realize this the opinions expressed in the book as well as its omissions begin to make a kind of sense.It's telling that West virtually ignores slovenia except to point to bad conduct by the catholic church.Slovenia is mostly catholic and even worse the most\\"austrian \\" of yugoslavia's nations. As such i think she considers it unworthy of her attention.Croatia is a place she has to write about but one can infer she'd rather not.The croats are too catholic and somewhat german influenced.Almost as bad they are also italian and hungarian influenced.They just aren't \\"slavic\\" enough! Well it is fairly easy to guess who is slavic enough,the serbs.This is a very distorted picture.Westdoes seem to think that the serbs are noble savages by virtue of their freedom from non slavic influences.Whereas the northern south slavs are tainted by foreigness.To say the least,this is a strange viewpoint for a writer of\\"advanced\\" views.It smacks of an odd provincialism.Italy was at one point one of the most creative and dynamic societies on earth.It's croatias neighbor.Does West really think that the croatians should have turned their back on italy inorder to cultivate slavic purity?I think the answer is ,yes.West dissmisses late imperial austria as an intellectual and cultural wasteland.That can only be explained as a by product of ignorance.This was afterall the land of klimt,mahler,freud and wittgenstein.Joseph Roth would wind up downright nostalgic about it.West says austria-hungary was the most repressive state in europe after russia.This is oddin two ways.One i doubt it's true.Austria was more repressive than the ottoman empire,spain,portugal,romania and bulgaria?Also even if true no one with a straight face could argue that austria was comprable to russia as a tyranny.That said this peculiar book is fascinating.Although like some of the other reviewers i too wondered what's the story on the husband and what's allthis talk about the positive benefits of the absence of homosexuality?(and where did she get that idea from?)."},{"Title":"Black lamb and grey falcon: A journey through Yugoslavia","review":"I have read the book, and the reviews to date. I agree that the book was too wordy. West seems to indulge all too much in stream of conscious writing. A good editor would have helped to focus the book more. It combines a travelogue with history, a dangerous combination as it becomes all too easy to lose historical continuity: her thoughts are prompted by what she sees, and thus she wanders back and forth through regional history in a way that confused me. But, the insights, I think, were very interesting. But beware: she has terrible prejudices that would be totally non-PC in a writer today: her views on Germans, Austrians, Russians, and homosexuals are probably unsustainable. She tends to oversimplify Jews and their views(other reviewers mentioning Constantine missed the complication: he was Jewish with an almost Nazi wife).To those who say her book tends to explain modern Kosovo and KLA actions, I say no. I think there is a very important piece of post WW2 history that I do not understand, but I know is there, that also has a very big impact. The whole answer is not there as far as I can see.It took a very long time for me to get through the book, simply its length and somewhat distracting habit of going off on tangents tended to exhaust me.But, for what it is, I think it deserves the accolades and should be read by anyone with an interest in European or Balkan or religious history."},{"Title":"Black lamb and grey falcon: A journey through Yugoslavia","review":"Rebecca West spent 6 weeks as a tourist in Yugoslavia, and somehow ended up as the most frequently quoted writer about the area. This is probably because her beautiful prose style and gift for storytelling mask the deep and pervasive flaws in her perception of the country. My rating (3 stars) is an attempt to average the book's strengths and flaws.BL&amp;GF is well worth reading as a travelogue; by turns epigrammatic (good), anecdotal (good), and philosophical (not so good), it is nearly always absorbing. (&quot;Nearly always&quot; because those philosophical passages do have to be endured.) Don't go looking for more than that, because she is notoriously unreliable as an interpreter of Yugoslavia. The situation in which she wrote it--early World War II--overshadows her perceptions of the place, slanting the book in favor of the Serbs and against the Croats, the Albanians, and just about everyone else. Her sympathy for the poor beleaguered Serbs looks pretty foolish in retrospect. She also betrays a very shallow understanding of the complex and shifting web of ethnicities in the area (particularly in Kosovo, which she calls &quot;Old Serbia&quot;).So by all means read BL&amp;GF; just take that &quot;definitive work about Yugoslavia&quot; reputation with a grain of salt. If you really want to understand the Balkans, though, read Edith Durham--she spent 7 years in the area, did relief work for the Macedonians and Albanians, did the first serious ethnographic work on the Albanians, was a war correspondent in the Balkan Wars, and became a national heroine in Albania. (She's also a much better observer than Dame Rebecca to begin with; and an entertaining storyteller, with a sharp sense of humor.)"},{"Title":"Black lamb and grey falcon: A journey through Yugoslavia","review":"One of the most passionate and beautiful travel books ever written, and a masterpiece of 20th century prose. Written during the London Blitz, as West doubted the survival of our species, this book uses the outline of a travel memoir through Yugoslavia as a structure to critique all of Western Civilization. West shows a strong pro-Serb bias that alienated some readers when the book came out, but most acknowledged it as one of the great books of the century. The language is ironic, clever, philosophic, despairing, wonderful by turns. But fair warning - the book is quite massive and takes some dedication. You will have to read the first twenty pages or so to know if it's for you, but if it is, you will never forget it."},{"Title":"Black lamb and grey falcon: A journey through Yugoslavia","review":"For anyone living in or traveling to the Balkans, this books is a must read. R. West brings you back to the days before WW2, and her telling of her story brings the people, the area, and the era alive. Its also very interesting to see what was similar back then, compared to now."},{"Title":"Black lamb and grey falcon: A journey through Yugoslavia","review":"Get this book.If there is one book you should read, that is pivotal in early 20th Century History, I'd strongly recommend that you read this book. By following Rebecca West's footsteps through Croatia, Dalmatia, Bosnia and Kosovo, she engages you with her trivial and quaint observations of people and places, set against her awesome knowledge of art and history, which is fascinating and worth re-reading time and time again.And then you realize that this journey took place just before the start of the second world war. What a place to be, what a time to live, what a book to write. It is a long book, no doubt about that. In some respects, it is too short to fully tell the whole story and she helps with a full bibliography and index.So, get this book and re-live her experiences."},{"Title":"Black lamb and grey falcon: A journey through Yugoslavia","review":"There is no way this book is not a classic. People who don't appreciate it simply haven't read it or are too prejudiced. Its 11 hundred marvelous pages are full of wisdom, historical accounts, relevant personal experiences, wit, humor, love of literature and personal humility. Despising it is a suicide of the intellect.Rebecca West must have been a one of a kind woman, understanding and forgiving. She dwells on all topics through this travel book. There are passages that are so interesting and so well written that must win her a place among the best writers in the English language.I'd like to chose two excepts from this nice Penguin Classics edition. One is a humoristic and down-to-earth rationalization of xenophobia:'She was the gentlest and sweetest of women and for that reason had developed a most peculiar form of hysteria. Perhaps because of her experience as a tiny child in the war she was a true xenophobe, she could not imagine anything more disgusting than a member of another race than her own. ut she did not like to feel anything but love for her fellow-creatures, so she transformed her loathing for them into a belief that they exude powerful and most unpleasant odours.. This belief made her life as a chambermaid an extraordinary olfactory adventure, for to this hotel there came people of all nationalities. [...] The Hungarians seemed to her to have a strong smell, which, however, was not unpleasant, only extremely different from the smell a human being ought to exhale. But the Germans and Austrians were definitely very gross in her nostrils, and the French smelt wicked and puzzling, as I imagine a chemist's shop might to a country woman who knew the uses of hardly any of the articles it exhibited.'Or this one:'There are those who sourly remark that Bolshevism was made in such rooms. It is not true. The Russian exiles who were responsible for that sat on unmade beds in flats as untidy as Versailles or any medieval castle. They were the powerful people who never tidy up, who only happened for the moment to be out of power. But those who live in these wept and garnished rooms wish only to serve. In the hereafter they shall be saved when all the rest of us are damned.' Eloquent, isn't it?And what about this almost mystical passage:'In too many Western pictures Christ looks as if He were wholly dying, and as if He were making an unmanly fuss over it considering His foreknowledge of the Resurrection. But in all these Macedonian frescoes death is shown working on the body that is bound to the spirit of Christ, wringing the breath out of the lungs as a laundress wrings water out of a shirt, taking the power out of the muscles and nerves like a dentist drawing a tooth whose roots drive down through the whole body. There is demonstrated that separateness of the flesh which Proust once noted, in a passage which describes how we think in our youth that our bodies are identical with ourselves, and have the same interests, but discover later in life that they are heartless companions who have been accidentally yoked with us, and who are as likely as not in our extreme sickness or old age to treat us with less mercy than we would have received at the hands of the worst bandits.'Must be read slowly, like a good wine."},{"Title":"Black lamb and grey falcon: A journey through Yugoslavia","review":"As I read in the daily papers the news of Serbians fighting separatists in Kosovo, I am grateful once again to have read this classic four summers ago. Faraway names and events become meaningful when you have the background it will give you. It's not a travel book at all; it's an exploration of the European soul. Read it, and you will begin to understand the intractable nature of the conflict between Serbs, Croats, and Bosnians (not to mention Turks, Greeks, Montenegrans, Austrians, Italians, Jews, Muslims, Catholics, and Othodox). Humane, biased (as aren't we all?), beautifully written, and supremely enlightening. You will find yourself reading long passages out loud to others; underling paragraphs and dog earing pages.Despite its bulk it moves along in a compelling, novelistic way. I may never see Dubrovnik, and the bridge at Mostar is gone forever, but I went there through this book."},{"Title":"Black lamb and grey falcon: A journey through Yugoslavia","review":"The prose in this book weaves a mosaic of rural and town life in the 1930s Yugoslavia which is gone in fact but captured in West's captivating prose. This was a Yugoslavia whose name was adopted a few years before, whose eastern and southern borders were agreed in 1913 with Bulgaria and Greece , just one year after the Ottomans had been evicted in 1912 after 500 years of rule . And published just before Catholic Croatia's Tito and Orthodox Serbia's Mihailovich led separate resistances against the Germans then like two pit bull terriers fought until Tito emerged as victor and ruler for three decades . The war between these carnivores ended in 1991 with the unravelling of the mosaic West had so beautifully weaved just over 50 years before.The scenes-in-words of a run-down town of Bitola (ex-Monastir) and a lakeside lovely Ochrid provide instructive insights into a Macedonia before the Communist Tito created a Republic of Macedonia (in 1944) in an effort to destabilise the northern borders of Greece at the beginning of her wrenching civil war.West's is a must-read for students and scholars of the land of the southern Slavs during the fleeting time it was a union and they wish to relish one of the classics of 20th century English prose."},{"Title":"Black lamb and grey falcon: A journey through Yugoslavia","review":"Rebecca West was a novelist, biographer, journalist, and critic born in 1892, when women were not liberated. Even so, in the 1920s she began working for the New York Herald-Tribune as a reviewer. Black Lamb and Grey Falcon was her magnum opus, published in 1941, after Yugoslavia had been conquered by the Nazis. This book is not only a travelogue through the Yugoslavia of the mid-1930s but it is a history of the region from the time of the Romans until the fall to the Nazis in 1941. A lot of what she has to say explains the problems that exist in the region today and why there must be a U. N. Peacekeeping Force there. It is a long book (1150 pages) but it is well-written and well-worth the read."},{"Title":"Black lamb and grey falcon: A journey through Yugoslavia","review":"I read this book while living in Tuzla, Bosnia. I've talked with the people and lived there, the attitudes of the public have not changed much and the same goes for the politics. To some West may seem to have favorites, but it is her book and her trip, read, learn, and follow along. The places she has been are really as beautiful as she describes them, the valleys are deep and green in the summer and white and serene in the winter. The people friendly, and welcoming. I truly enjoyed the book and am at this time reading it for the second time, reliving the experiences she had and the memories I have of that beautiful but troubled county."},{"Title":"Black lamb and grey falcon: A journey through Yugoslavia","review":"It amazes me that \\"Black Lamb and Grey Falcon\\" is still being read by people to inform themselves about the former Yugoslavia. It's not that the book lacks merit, but this value mainly lies in a number of West's keen observations of Yugoslav politics and society during the late 1930s and in the large number of interesting statements made by the people she met and associated with. Thus, it can be used as something of a supplement for the study of South Slav society in a given historical period--the 1930s (although cautiously, as West is notoriously biased). Also, her forays into (mainly) Serbian history contain a number of fascinating anecdotes, even if her general presentation leaves something to be desired. The key problem with \\"Black Lamb\\" is that it is also a very prejudiced text: West has her obvious favorites among the Yugoslav peoples, and her anti-Germanism sometimes borders on racism. This is understandable given that she wrote the book as Nazi Germany was attacking England, but it seriously taints many of her general conclusions about Germany and the Germans and their role in Central Europe. Additionally, although her most frequent criticism of the Germans is their allegedly irrational hatred of the Slavs, her own views are imbued with a patronizing fetishization of the Slavs that is only a little better than this apparent German animosity. West also spends a good deal of time bemoaning the horrible consequences of \\"Turkish\\" (i.e. Ottoman) rule in the Balkans, even though the Ottoman presence in this region had many positive as well as negative aspects. This, together with West's excessively lengthy, opinionated and often mind-numbing lectures on art, architecture, politics, philosophy and her skewed presentations of history (this is in fact why a book about a six-week tour of Yugoslavia meanders on for well over 1,000 pages) truly make this a poor source for general information on the Yugoslav peoples. Unfortunately, because it is still so widely read for precisely this reason (especially after it was re-popularized by Robert Kaplan in his equally flawed \\"Balkan Ghosts\\") and, somewhat inexplicably, because many serious Balkan scholars still include it in their bibliographies and reading lists, \\"Black Lamb and Grey Falcon\\" is something of an unavoidable text for anyone really interested in the former Yugoslavia. My point is simply that this book should not become the foundation for anyone's knowledge or study of this topic."},{"Title":"Black lamb and grey falcon: A journey through Yugoslavia","review":"This book recounts a journey made by the author and her husband as they traveled through Croatia, Dalmatia, Herzegovina, Bosnia, Serbia, Macedonia, Old Serbia, and Montenegro at a time when Hitter threatened to engulf all of Europe in a World War.Describing and analyzing the journey, the author fills more than a thousand pages.The highlight of the book is the epilogue which recounts the author's thoughts of the impact her travels made on assessing the politics of Germany and the Balkans at a turning point in history."},{"Title":"Black lamb and grey falcon: A journey through Yugoslavia","review":"Black Lamb and Gray Falcon is monumental, and anyone that has written formal fiction or non-fiction can only marvel at how West maintains control over her materials at nearly 500,000 words, and over 1100 pages. We never get the impression that she is fatigued with the work --- and there is no repetition. Even if one is not interested in travel literature, BLGF is a must read, because it one of the great examples of its genre, and as such, transcends it. For all its length, West complains that one can never fully write about a place, can never actually capture it! That nugget is somewhere on page 900, I think, and although the reader can sympathize with her exasperation, we can hardly believe her."},{"Title":"Black lamb and grey falcon: A journey through Yugoslavia","review":"I'm a Serbian/Croatian linguist for the government, so this book struck my fancy right away. This is the most readable non-fiction book I've ever read. Mdm West's prose makes me feel as if I am traveling with her.

Should I make a trip to Croatia, Bosnia or Serbia anytime in the future, Black Lamb and Grey Falcon will certainly travel with me."},{"Title":"Black lamb and grey falcon: A journey through Yugoslavia","review":"A Classic. Perhaps a little long-winded for the modern reader but full of interesting insights on interwar Jugoslavia and the imminent Nazi threat. Lots of information on earlier history and some amusing commentary on West's relations with her travelling companions who were a Jewish government official and his German wife, particularly considering the politically charged social atmosphere of the time. West has some 'interesting' opinions. In light of the author's background, it might be worth reading earlier works by Edith Durham as an interesting comparison."},{"Title":"Black lamb and grey falcon: A journey through Yugoslavia","review":"Having visited Slovenia last year, this book was recommend as background material on the history of the area, before Slovenia become a country and other states in the area were formed.

She meets a large cast of fascinating characters along the way and forms opinions about all of them and everything she sees. Ms West has vast knowledge and makes connections between much of what she sees and the entire fabric of European history, art, religion and pretty much everything else. Perhaps the best and most amusing parts are when she gets critical of the locals and her friends. The book is quite a slog and apparently never was presented to an editor. I read it in four pieces, while I was recovering from surgery.

You will either love or hate this book, particularly the style of writing. Rebecca West is an upper middle class English feminist who obviously (and sometimes with too much gushing prose) LOVES the land and people of this troubled region.If you can get through the oft side-tracked narrative and the sometimes over-the-top prose, you will be rewarded with a frozen slice of European history that didn't begin to thaw until Tito's death. You will be amazed at her uncanny ability to get to the heart of the religious, cultural, and ideologically splits that existed within the Slavic communities just prior to the Second World War (and that still exist to this day!)Bottom line: this is a seminal work about the troubled Balkan region. If used as an anchor to other Balkan works, you will have a strong fundamental knowledge about the inevitable collapse of Yugoslavia into its diverse and rival parts."},{"Title":"Black lamb and grey falcon: A journey through Yugoslavia","review":"Rebecca West's classic book hardly needs a review from me but suffice to say that I re-read it with great enjoyment during a recent ten day-long tour of the Orthodox churches and monasteries in Serbia and the now independent states of Kosovo and Montenegro.It is truly amazing how evocative a book written this long ago can be. If you care anything about the former Yugoslavia and the present day countries formed from it or about the Orthodox Church, you must read this book."},{"Title":"Black lamb and grey falcon: A journey through Yugoslavia","review":"I had no particular interest in Yugoslavia or the Balkans but her insight and detailed writing on its people and culture as a traveller was interesting and at times absorbing It is dense but good writing. One and a 1/2 inches thick seems daunting but there are paragraphs when insight and ideas turned into lyrical or beatiful or unusual poetry in prose as motivation enough Maybe the book is too thick for its subject matter but it tolerates browsing without disconjunction."},{"Title":"Black lamb and grey falcon: A journey through Yugoslavia","review":"Black Lamb and Grey Falcon: A Journey through Yugoslavia, by London born Cicely Isabel Fairfield (pen name Rebecca West) is a fabulous 1,100 page documentation showing Yugoslavian past, intertwined with present.

The way of presenting the Balkan history and ethnography that was never done before.Quotation by Rebecca West: \\"To my friends in Yugoslavia, who are now all dead or enslaved\\".Black Lamb and Grey Falcon (Penguin Classics)"},{"Title":"Black lamb and grey falcon: A journey through Yugoslavia","review":"If you love the Balkans and want to know more about it, this is a book for you."},{"Title":"Black lamb and grey falcon: A journey through Yugoslavia","review":"Rebecca West's Black Lamb and Grey Falcon: A journey through Yugoslavia calls to mind traveler epics of candid observation through past centuries in Europe, Russia, and the Americas. Many pages are devoted to death by details, but the total canvas is a rich, detailed one of a region buffeted by the crosswinds of history. It provides an excellent foil to works such as Huntington's Clash of Civilizations and Fukuyama's End of History.Traveling by car, train and foot through many a spot that would not show up even in a Michelin guide, Mrs West paints a detailed picture of the (now former) Yugoslavia. The Austrians, Hungarians, Turks and Italians do not come off well under her historical microscope. With perhaps a bit of traditional British dislike for Napoleon, Mrs West reserves some of her harshest criticisms for Marshal Marmont and his cynical rule in Dalmatia.Written as a traveling journal in the late 1930's, the book is free of much of the angst ridden writing of today on this region. West has no clear political agenda to advance in this book; rather, she lays out a series of experiences, analyzes them, and provides them to the reader for consideration. With the advantage of hindsight, many of her ethnological observations are uncanny, especially the role that the Serbs and Croats would play in the 1940's and again in the 1990's.Her understanding, and further exploration, of the depth of religious current swirling in the valleys and plains of the Balkans is impressive. Although she appears somewhat cynical about the true depth of feeling in many instances, she nonetheless accords the importance of religion, and what I would call the &quot;cult of martyrology&quot; its due respect in this turbulent historical region.For someone looking for a quick, executive summary type read on the Balkans, this is not it. For someone who knows how to speed read, and extract nuggets of wisdom and keen observation, this book is a must read for the Balkans."},{"Title":"Black lamb and grey falcon: A journey through Yugoslavia","review":"A nice read but highly romanticized outlook of the old Yugoslav Kingdom and the people of Yugoslavia. The book is based on the authors interaction with the Yugoslav intellectual elite and her observation of the people of old Yugoslavia. Her interpretation of the Slav character needs to be understood in the context of the orientalist approach of the time- as a result - the Slav character in the book is idealized in the same manner that modern day nationalist in the same region see themselves. Namely, the great Slavic nation of the Serbs who defended Europe from the Turks and saved the rest of the Southern Slavs from the Austrians. Given the time in which it was written (late 30s) the author suffers from an extreme germanophobia in every possible sense! She seems to come across only irrational, pompous and arrogant Germans who can't appreciate the Yugoslav people in the same way that she and her husband can. The book is extremely pro-Serbian, so much so that the Croatian and Macedonian discontent and wish for separation is seen not as a solution to the Serbian dominated Kingdom but as, sometimes Vatican sometimes Austrian and sometimes Italian inspired propaganda to divide the otherwise brotherly relations between the Serbs and the Croats! How much of this brotherly love was genuine - we saw in the WWII that followed as well as the bloody brake up of Socialist Yugoslavia. As much as she has made a conscious attempt not to become another British traveler in the Balkans that picks her pet-nation and promotes their interests - she falls under the Balkan trap of victimization and myths and becomes in the process an ardent pro-Serb - as indeed her political activities would later reveal."},{"Title":"Black lamb and grey falcon: A journey through Yugoslavia","review":"Masses of fascinating information here,some of it silver thruppeney bits, some of it perhaps nuts. Written in a truly remarkable travelogue style. What is perhaps the most impressive element of the book is the depth of some of the conversations that West recounts- a truly humbling experience given that these discussions, that often cover hundreds of years of history must have been conducted simultaneously in several different languages! It is a sad commentary on the present era that such a conversation is unlikely to occur again. A must read for anyone serios about the Balkans."},{"Title":"Black lamb and grey falcon: A journey through Yugoslavia","review":"As an American soldier facing the strong posibility of travel to the Balkans in the near future, I truly enjoyed Mrs. West's book despite the several months it took me to read it. The book provides a detailed account of life in the Balkans during the 30's which continues to have relevance in today's world. I recommend reading the book with a high-quality world atlas and following her journeys on the map. This book is not for the casual reader. In fact, I would have given it five stars except that it is somewhat confusing at times due to the author's tendency to shift between the past and present. For those who only recently became interested in Balkan hisotry, the book provides a good starting point for the study of a complex culture."},{"Title":"Black lamb and grey falcon: A journey through Yugoslavia","review":"I have a highly ambivalent realtionship with this book, and with Rebecca West. She present stories as history, but they are wonderful stories (hm, that should probably be &quot;wonderful Serbian stories&quot; considering West's preferences). They main problem I have with this book is West's &quot;noble-savage complex&quot;. She sees a guy carrying a lamb in a hotel lobby and concludes that Serbia is untainted by the restrictions of Western Bourgeois Civilisation. She dislikes Croatia because she believes that people have been spoiled by their interraction with the Austrian Empire. So, everything in Serbia, and especially Kosovo, is unspoilt and delightful, everything in Croatia is germanised and uptight: look out for the ever so picturesque Albanians, notable in West's eyes predominantly for the precarious positioning of their trousers. It IS a good book, but probably best to go and see for yourself before drawing any major conclusions about the &quot;balkan soul&quot;."},{"Title":"Black lamb and grey falcon: A journey through Yugoslavia","review":"This is a deeply biased almost fictional and totally one sided account and portrayal of the history of Yugoslavia, especially of the Serb people. The author is a devoted Serbophile mixing historical half-truths and half-fictions always to the elevation of the Serbs among other balkan nations. The result is that nothing in this book can be trusted for any historical value and in the long term it backfires on many fronts as history has recently proven. In the end this book can only bee seen as an exposition of the views and ideas of the author herself rather then the people that she's describing. As a conclusion this book doesn't serve anybody's purpose as a historical/travel account book, but would certainly be much better suited to the 'Fiction' section of the library where it would be appreciated for what it is, a fiction/propaganda book."},{"Title":"Black lamb and grey falcon: A journey through Yugoslavia","review":"Love it or hate it, anyone with an interest in the Balkans will eventually have to deal with this book. Rebecca West is one of the giants of 20th century literature. Never heard of her? I hadn't either until I read this sprawling opus. Don't be put off by the size of the book, however (West herself writes that most people probably won't read this book because of the massive length). Black Lamb and Grey Falcon is a travelogue detailing West's travels through 1930's Yugoslavia. The book goes far beyond travelogue as West intersperses massive doses of Slavic history and philosophy with her travel accounts. Not only do we see the things she sees, we understand the mentality of the people. These people she meets and places she visits become almost mystical under her magical pen. I read this book over a six week period at the end of the summer. Like West on her travels, I meandered through the book, reading it religiously at times and then setting it down for a bit to read other things. This might be the best way to read the book. It allows the reader to absorb what West is trying to say without being overwhelmed by the immense amounts of information.I have to say that I was most fascinated by her discourses on Yugoslav history. Balkan history can be a challenge because most of us in the West really don't understand the people or places involved. A section on the assassination of Franz Ferdinand runs on forever and never becomes boring. In fact, I became so enraptured of this event that I started reading other works concerning the assassination. Even though there are some problems with West's interpretation of history, her accounts are so well written that it makes the reader want to go out and read more about these events.Many have criticized Rebecca West for her bias and her tendency to simplify history. This is a valid concern. Her most serious transgression is her rabid hatred of anything German. It literally infects parts of the book with a somber, unpleasant tone. Right from the beginning of the book we see West criticizing a group of German tourists who are on a train with her as she travels into the Balkans. The bias finds greatest expression when West writes about her relationship with her Yugoslav guide Constantine and his wife Gerda. Constantine is a Jew and a Slav, but Gerda is a German whom West seems to believe is a Nazi. West's slanders on Gerda are endless, so much so that Constantine himself eventually turns against West. What is important to remember is that West is English and World War II was only a few years away. West actually wrote this book a few years after her trip, in 1941, so war was already raging between the two countries. If I were a German, I would be offended by West's comments.Please read this book. I guarantee you'll enjoy it, at least to some extent. Even if you don't like history, the descriptions of the Yugoslav people and places are enchanting. I wanted to hop on a plane and go to Yugoslavia after reading this book, although it's important to remember that this account was written during World War II and before the Communist occupation that followed the war. I imagine things have changed quite a bit in this part of the world since the 1930's. What prose! What endless beauty! Images that flow like honey! Read this and dream!!"},{"Title":"Black lamb and grey falcon: A journey through Yugoslavia","review":"I read BLGF after returning to the US after living in the region for over two years. I found and read Robert Kaplan's \\"Balkan Ghosts,\\" while the 1999 NATO action in Kosovo within clear sight of the situation. Kaplan made numerous positive referrences to BLGF so I found and read that soon after returning to the US. (I do know that Clinton did read BG (and that this led him to intervene in Bosnia-Herzegovina) and so may have read BLGF after leaving office). I suppose it was because of my very personal witness to the Balkans when I was living there, in particular the personal stories and lives that were generously offered by loving and almost pathetically nationalistic people. I found that RW, regardless of her \\"only six week\\" tour of Yugoslavia hit the button on the head in an overwhelming fashion. The personal emotional bias must be understood and the historical meat filtered through it. I didn't find that any history she related was false. What did startle me was how much similar her findings were to my own, fifty years later. When one understands that Tito effectively froze the populations of Yugoslavia in time through the use of forced migrations and a strong secret police force, how this could be becomes easy to grasp. But Rebecca West's journalistic intellect reaches its zenith when after witnessing the ritual slaughter of lambs, makes one of the best arguments against religion I have ever read. At once, she makes the best intellectual and emotional argument I can never have imagined as I read the brilliance of it. How a people come to act as both lambs and falcons, victims of history, myth and legend. The story of the Serbian people and for that matter the Balkans is something not to be missed by anyone interested in the story of civilization.I lived in Slovenia in the late 1990s for over two years, serving the public in concert with a Slovenian orthopedic surgeon. I was married there in 1999 before returning to the US. As one deeply drawn to historic studies since childhood, I carried along with me, a small library of historic works on European history, including the very large History of the Habsburg Empire, published by the Berkeley University Press. I traveled to many regions, but more importanly, had (and still retain) friends who are Slovene, Serb, Bosnian Serb as well as acquaintances of some in higher government and military offices. At one point, I was even invited to an informal meeting of (Ljublijana) university professors and a Croatian UN Bosnia-Herzegovina Peacekeeper mission executive. I was present to witness the development of the problems in Kosovo and led to the Bombing Campaign in 1999. I saw the protests against it that took place in front of the US Embassy in Ljublijana as I went there for the settling of various matters so I could be married in Slovenia legally. My dear, loving Serbian receptionist was symbolically blocking the entrance with other protestors. And later that day we met at the office and worked with only the slightest bit of simmering resentment, so deep was our care for one another. Through her, I learned so much, and on a later return, attended a Serbian Orthodox service as her guest, just to get a deeper feeling of the history of these people. It was very moving. People torn between the most generous loving inclinations with a rare love of life and at the same time, mutilated by a long history of oppression. They see themselves alone with the world against them. This same friend was also in the crowd in Belgrade that finally brought down Milosevic. All attempts to understand and find the tortured human element in Serbs is an obligation for us. And doing so does not require that we denigrate or minimalize the Albanians or any other of the ethnic groups in the Balkans. BLGF so enriched by complement, all these experiences. When I return, I do so with a greater and greater depth of knowledge and tolerance for all, regardless of the minefields of strong nationalistic sentiments one must step through to do so.What makes BLGF so great and a must read for anyone remotely interested in history or literature in general is that it is at once an excellent source of introductory history of a region that has been for the West, lost in a mist of vagarities and myth. At the same time related as a personal experience by RW in a almost lyric fashion. Go with it, even the angry diatribes about men. History becomes real when it is felt as a personal experience; That is why traveling and living abroad is so valuable for everyone, but especially for Americans, who need to understand the world that their government so often effects. If there is anyplace in the world that can teach us that nothing is simple and perhaps most important, impress the American reader with the eternal sense of history, expanding that compression of time that US history lives in, the Balkans are it. This is a book that ought to be used at least at the community college class level in both literature and history classes.I have read many of the reviews and various opinions on this book, including the one critic living in the region who only allowed one star. (Locals hate outsiders having any opinion of them). My view is that all the praises and criticisms are valid and deserved, even the one that questions whether RW and her husband had any kind of sexual realtionship and if her husband might have actually been homosexual. Without doubt, RW was a strong willed individual and I gathered from her occassional diatribes concerning men that she had a issue with the entire gender and completely capable of a \\"marriage of convenience.\\" (So what)? Realizing that her father had left her mother and then soon died, must be somewhat to blame. Allow her to be human, it made her what she was as a writer. So although I found her rants less than usefull, I allowed her to be human because this book is part journal, part essay and part diary. How many authors have laid their own feelings out so clearly. Given the period that it was published in, that took courage. I have to wonder with our emotionally suppressive PC enviroment today, how could anyone even conceive such writing today and not be shouted down by the \\"thought police\\" installed in their own mind? Welcome to journalism before PC! What a gift that is in itself - an artifact of true intellectual freedom."},{"Title":"Black lamb and grey falcon: A journey through Yugoslavia","review":"In Black Lamb and Grey Falcon, Rebecca West weaves together history, ethnography and travelogue into an encyclopedic and unforgettable portrait of this troubled region. As I explain below, I think there are some marvelous things about this book, and some aspects that are less well realized. On balance, it is well worth the effort, but for somebody considering it, the cautions are worth noting. First the highlights:West is at her best as a reporter. She has a truly brilliant eye for detail, for simply seeing how the people lived, what they wore, how they worshipped and what they did with their days. Her images, particularly of the remote communities and the many churches and religious shrines that she visited, are particularly well rendered. Although the book lacks photographs or drawings, West's very considerable talents for description are such that the reader really gets a feel for a large number of diverse places within the Balkans.She also does an excellent job illuminating a great deal of the history of the region, both relatively modern history (meaning modern at the time the book was written -- 1941) and more ancient history. Modern history at the time West wrote meant dealing with the Balkan wars, the series of rebellions by which the vestiges of the Ottoman empire were overthrown in the 19th and early 20th centuries. West devotes particular attention to the assassination of the Archduke Ferdinand in Sarajevo in June 1914, which precipitated World War I, an event that at the time of the writing of the book was still relatively recent in the world's memory, and the facts of which were still somewhat controversial. Ancient history meant dealing with the Battle of Kosovo in 1389, the decisive battle in which the Turks defeated the Orthodox Serbs led by Tsar Lazar and began to move further north and east in Europe.West's writing on why liberal democracies are typically reluctant to arm themselves to confront militant totalitarian regimes, which forms a secondary theme, seems quite fresh. West writes as an unabashed liberal and closely analyzes both her own squeamishness about violence and why, in more general terms, liberals' reluctance to use force is ultimately suicidal. Her criticism of the pacifism of the governments of pre-World War II England and France in the face of the visible threat of a rearming Germany and a bellicose Italy is both fascinating and dead-on. One of the points she makes in her admiration of the Slavs is that for five centuries, beginning with the Battle of of Kosovo, and largely ignored by Western Europe, they took arms against the totalitarian regime of their day, militant Islam in the form of the Ottoman empire. Her point of view on this issue is quite clear: for taking on this task, she regards the Serbs to have been the unrecognized and unthanked saviors of Western Christianity.As brilliant as this book is, however, it will not be to every reader's taste, even those who want to explore the history of the Balkans in depth. West makes little effort to disguise her prejudices: she sees the Slavs as an heroic if primitive race who had been ill-used by the then Great Powers of Europe, Great Britian, France, Germany and the Austro-Hungarian Empire. And within what was then the newly-formed state of Yugoslavia (which came into being after World War I), she is emphatic in her sympathies for the Serbs, whom she sees as the the descendants of what was good and right in the Byzantine empire. West is equally obvious in her lack of sympathy for the Croats and the Bosnians. But seen through the lens of the more recent wars of Serbian aggression, it is harder to see the Serbs in such an unqualifiedly heroic light.Other parts of the books also wear less well, including her prolixity (the paperback edition is a whopping 1150 pages of small print). West's long tirades on the evils of the Austro-Hungarian empire seem a curiosity at this point; as evil as it may have been, it has long been relegated to the dustbin of history. Her antipathy to the Germans also seems an historical set piece, although rather more understandable in its context. And West's economic analyses of modern capitalism appear naive and superficial. Finally, the relatively major roles played in her narrative by she and her husband, their Serbian guide Constantine, and his German wife Gerda, are, at best, distracting. But these reservations should be seen for what they are: minor criticisms of an awe-inspiring work."},{"Title":"Black lamb and grey falcon: A journey through Yugoslavia","review":"...I initially was not so moved to write this review of Ms. West's remarkable work. What has inspired in me the need, though, was the reading of her being persistently condemned for her sympathy for the poor beleagured Serbians. Indeed...moreso than anything else, her work has forced me to ponder the question of 'What shall we tomorrow say of the 'poor, exploited, tormented Kosovars'?' It is most ironic that Ms. West's six-week journey through Yugoslavia should have so accurately succeeded in capturing the spirit of the land. Read it not for a travel guide, but as a snapshot of the past...nowhere else do we have access to many of the prodigious quantity of sources which she employed in her authoring...and whereelse may we hope to find a British tourist's view of the Balkans upon the eve of war? Nowhere. It is unique...and incomparable...and her revelations are sometimes stunning, her prose frequently beauteous...thus, five stars."},{"Title":"Black lamb and grey falcon: A journey through Yugoslavia","review":"One has to stand in awe before this enormous (ll40 pages) masterpiece of literary travel writing, even with its prejudice and poetry and occasional unkindness. Ms West and her husband and Constantine (he of the stubby fingers and wicked keyboard technique who tells unbelievable stories and opines on every imaginable topic) travel through Yugoslavia at the time Hitler is gaining power in Germany and the Habsburg Empire is just a dirty memory. Constantine is a Serb utterly devoted to the continued existence of the Yugoslav state but he's married to a dreadful hausfrau who despises anything that is not German and especially Slavs. She thus makes her own life miserable and does a number on the lives of everyone else. The book offers rich descriptions of all the states that make up (or made up)Yugoslavia, including religious and social customs, the mental and emotional tendencies of the people (sometimes depending on which outside influences -- Turkish, Austrian -- have impacted them most decisively). Montenegran men come in for high praise because because of their physical beauty and the presumed ease with which they could inseminate any woman. The book is a masterwork of richly textured Enlgish prose done in long, elegant, sometimes convoluted sentence that are a delight to read and may remind some readers of Proust. St. Paul and St. Augustine come in for the mistreatment they so richly deserve (the author traces several questionable religious practices she encounters to ideas found in their writings). This is a work for reasonably well educated adults, so anyone approaching it in search of accurate factual history is making a mistake. But nor will it mislead anyone on matters of historical fact."},{"Title":"Black lamb and grey falcon: A journey through Yugoslavia","review":"&quot;One must give these sheep-stealers plainly to understand that the European governments have no need to harness themselves to their lusts and rivalries.&quot; So Otto von Bismark, the German Chancellor and all-round diplomatic high-wire artist. The sheep-stealers in question are the nations of the Balkans, whose politics, evidently, were enough to frustrate even this most adroit of intriguers. Perhaps happily for him, he did not live long enough to see the world do exactly what he feared.There are two ways to get a grip on those Balkans -- a short way and a long way. The short way is through &quot;The Bridge on the Drina,&quot; by the Slavic Nobelist, Ivo Andric. The other is the great, sprawling monstrosity (cited above) by Rebecca West. Andric's novelized account of a near-millennium of Ottoman rule is a marvel of (if nothing else) concision. Individual set-pieces are unforgettable: the account of an impalement is not for the faint of heart.But anything as compact as Andric's narrative must necessarily expose itself to a charge of oversimplification, That is one charge few could bring against West's 1100-odd pages (not including index and bibliographical note). This is an irony, because West on the surface appears to have an agenda so simplistic as to be crude: the Yugoslavs are a species of noble savage, while their North European &quot;betters&quot; - more precisely, the Germans, are a gang of buffoons. Her caustic sendup of life in a train compartment with a party of German tourists is hilarious in its own right, and it surely didn't hurt her as the book hit the market at the beginning of World War II (also: it is near the beginning, so anyone who wants to claim to have read the whole will want to get at least that far).But facts do her the kindness of getting in the way. Agenda or no, West is one of the world's great reporters, with an enviable capacity to see not just what she wants to see, but rather what is before her eyes. The result is the best kind of journalism, and the best kind of history: a book full of exceptions &quot;We are too rough and too deep for your smoothness and your shallowness,&quot; her guide tells her in a fit of impatience. &quot;That is why most foreign books about us are insolently wrong.&quot; West must be wrong about a lot of things: any book so rich in detail and texture would have to be wrong about something. Thanks to her good efforts, it will be harder for her readers to be wrong."},{"Title":"Black lamb and grey falcon: A journey through Yugoslavia","review":"I read _Black Lamb and Grey Falcon_ about three years ago, just as the Kosovo conflict was at its height, and the book seemed to me then almost an essential primer to Yugoslav history and politics as seen from Anglo-American eyes. West has a strong tendency to simplify history and to write through the lens of prejudices against Germans and Muslims, so don't take her historical accuracy for granted. But she is a sympathetic traveller, a person who is fascinated by foreign places and who understands that cultural context is everything, and simply for this the book is worthwhile.However, I find the book especially valuable as an example of the &quot;encyclopedic&quot; book: the kind of book that transcends genres (history? travel literature? personal essays? memoir?), that is eager to accumulate and to share knowledge, that a reader ends up wanting to live with. Even though the important conflicts of the day have shifted east from Kosovo (but her discussion of the migration of the Turks into the Balkans is essential material for understanding the place of Muslims in Europe today), her book stays with me: not for what it says about Yugoslavia, but for what it says about how literature can be the tissue that connects individuals and history. Although reading this book is by no means a minor undertaking, it's well worth the time and trouble."},{"Title":"Black lamb and grey falcon: A journey through Yugoslavia","review":"The legendary critic Diana Trilling, who in this edition's blurb calls it one of the best of the 20th century, gets it right. The nay-sayers here who pan it, don't.Its reputation suffers currently because Rebecca West, writing in the late 1930s, sympathized with the Serbs, whose reputation has been darkened in our time by the atrocities of Bosnia and Kosovo.I would guess most West opponents favor rival Croats or Albanians just as they claim she favors the Serbs. A Serb advocate might point out that Croats and Muslims committed a few atrocities of their own as Yugoslavia broke apart. And a West defender may note that she was not equipped with a crystal ball showing Slobodan Milosevic's rise a half century later.When she wrote, the Serbs readily evoked Western sympathy: They were on the Allied side in World War I, and would be again, before the book went to press, in World War II, when they were invaded for bravely defying Hitler. They were Christians, inheritors of the legacy of Byzantium, who freed themselves from five centuries of Turkish Islamic domination, and had fought as well to free Macedonia and Bosnia. Their king had just been assassinated in France in an act machinated by Mussolini and abetted, through silence, by the world's nations. They suffered greatly throughout their history, including World War I, when the war with more powerful Austria swept back and forth over the land twice, forcing the army and many civilians to flee at one point in a horrifying death march through winter and mountains. And the Serbs had always fought with little more than moral support from great power allies, who betrayed them again and again. Weighing against them was their Orthodox Christian rite which often put them at odds with the powerful Roman Catholic Church.This book, however much it might have seemed dated during the 1990s, takes on a greater significance in the post 9/11 world: She shows us just how deep the roots of the Christian-Islamic conflict run in this land, for centuries that conflict's front line.West, for example, distinguishes marvelously between the Bosnian Muslims - Slavs who converted to Islam during the Turkish occupation, many of them Slav nationalists who supported Yugoslav nationhood - and the Turks themselves, who regarded the Slavs as other and inferior. She finds fascinating cross-religious alliances, with the Austrian Catholics cozying up to the Muslims of Bosnia when Austria ruled it, to the detriment of the land's Croat Catholics and Orthodox Serbs, who expected better of fellow Christians. She details a positively surreal scene in Sarajevo, where the Muslims anxiously await the first Turkish republican emissaries since the Ottomans were driven out a half century earlier. When these modern, Westernized diplomats arrive, from their land where Ataturk banned the fez and the burka, they are warm to modern Yugoslav officials, but baffled by and cool to what they regard as the still-backwards, Orientalized Muslims of Bosnia.West got away with a writing style full of ethnic generalizations that, today, would likely be attacked, by airheads anyway, as politically incorrect, regardless of the many hard truths she wrote. A feminist, she wrote of gender in a way delightfully free of today's academic cant. You'll find nary a \\"patriarchy\\" or \\"hegemony\\" here; she talks of men and women only when it matters.I don't believe she leans too strongly towards the Serbs. It is, after all, in great part the story of their lands, and of the short-lived state led by their monarchy. Her section on Bosnia, where the Croats, Serbs and Muslims all mixed, is fair to all sides. She finds much with which to fascinate the reader in Dubrovnik and elsewhere along the Dalmatian coast. The primary villains here are the Turks - not today's modernized, democratic Turks, but their imperial Ottoman predecessors, who sucked wealth and civilization out of the Balkans to set the stage for today's animosities. And West even manages to find some redemption for them in their transcending love of nature and the well-designed, pleasant homes they left behind.You are unlikely to find in English a more cogent account of the Archduke Ferdinand's assassination, which led to World War I. One sees how this equalled the Kennedy assassination for its lingering scent of conspiracy - was the killing actually orchestrated by the Russians? by the Austrians themselves? - and surpassed it in shaking the world, despite targeting a much less popular or powerful man.Many histories can supply hard facts. BLGF stands out for West's elegant travelogue writing in which she lashes together history; national and individual character; geography, ethnicity, and politics. She and her husband journey through Yugoslavia accompanied by a guide and translator who, also a poet, helps interpret the places that signify in Yugoslav history, as well as mundane settings from which West gleans the essence of the nation's many peoples.The book's length daunts, and sometimes the writing drags. Tensions with the guide-poet's German wife during the group's trip through Macedonia take up too much space. But one can forgive even this: West finds, in this woman's hostility and condescension toward her husband's country, the attitudes that were then driving Germany toward conquest - including its brutal occupation of Yugoslavia beginning in 1941, the year this book was published.Readers might consider countering the book's length by taking each national section - on Croatia, Bosnia, Serbia, Macedonia and so forth - as individual books, setting the tome down for a while before starting the next unit."},{"Title":"Black lamb and grey falcon: A journey through Yugoslavia","review":"A somewhat queer book, but widely regarded as a classic. West is a splendid prose stylist, but not entirely trustworthy as a historian. She flits continually back and forth across the line between fact and fiction, and draws more symbolic meaning and universal truth from any given scene than any mere mortal rightfully ever should. West can be criticized for being almost obsequiously pro-Serbian, narrowly anti-Croat and even bigoted in her aversion to Germans, but her attitudes are easier to understand if one considers the time during which she did her research and writing. The book became controversial in some intellectual circles during the 1990s, as some believe Western policymakers were under the influence of Black Lamb and Grey Falcon when they were late and weak about intervening in the wars of Yugoslav succession. That strikes me as a silly notion. In that West has written 1,150 pages and continually diverges from the main thread of her narrative, I frankly doubt that more than a handful of policymakers-in all countries of the globe combined-ever have read her book from cover to cover. She herself confesses (p. 773) that \\"hardly anybody will read\\" her book \\"by reason of its length.\\" Like War and Peace, Moby Dick and the Holy Bible, this is a literary classic that one should read because it is good for you."},{"Title":"Black lamb and grey falcon: A journey through Yugoslavia","review":"Yes \\"Black Lamb and Grey Falcon\\" is wonderful for all the reasons stated in these reviews, but for all that it must be said that the dominant theme of Ms West's masterpiece is the eternal human condition. She sees with the eyes of a woman and the eyes of a genius. She has seen humanity's troubled soul, and gently brought it to the surface in the fabric of her marvelous linguistic tapestry. \\"Black Lamb and Grey Falcon\\" is in a class by its self."},{"Title":"Under Drake's flag: A tale of the Spanish Main","review":"In the early 90s, I came into possession of what I took to be a very nearly complete collection (I have 75 volumes), mostly in first or other early editions, of the British writer G. A. Henty. Henty died in 1902 or thereabouts, having written his last books about the actions which took place in the war opposing English troops and Boer commandos. And that was his formula, first and foremost to record in print the historical events associated with any British military venture from the early Middle Ages onwards. The other characteristic of his writing was, that it was intended for consumption by boys and as such it was typical of a genre that was well developed in the late Victorian period. Henty's prefaces invariably start, \\"My Dear Boys,\\" and he developed a sort of intimacy with his youthful audience that eventually made him something of a best selling author at the end of last century. It is interesting to note that he is still in print, or was until very recently.Most of his books have a two-fold purpose therefore; recounting (mainly) military history and inculcating a certain notion of the standard of behaviour to be expected from a future young subaltern. No doubt, of the thousands of officers from British and colonial regiments who went to the front in 1915 and dashed themselves bravely against the German wall, a great many had had this form of early Henty training. Having read so many of them, one can scarcely recall the actual details of plots and sub-plots. Yet on the details of the history involved, there is much to learn, as Henty was a meticulous man who recorded as fully as possible (and some times too fully, it must be admitted, with respect to the endless movements of particular regiments into the line) the events he describes. He is equally good at sea as on land and has written some classics of maritime literature, particularly \\"Under Drake's Flag,\\" and \\"Cochrane the Dauntless.\\" So while Henty can hardly be expected to have a wide audience today, for those who find him to their taste, it must be said that the material, most of which will have to be located second hand, is not wanting."},{"Title":"Under Drake's flag: A tale of the Spanish Main","review":"This is a great book!

Captain Francis Drake was on shore when Ned was doing this. And after the incident Drake asked Ned to join him on his ship to find the North West passage.Ned went through all sorts of adventures. He killed a shark, lived with runaway slaves for six months, and even was on an island where the natives thought of him as a god. He fought the Spaniards and also the Indians.

Having served in Germany a decade later, I was surprised at the extent to which there had been such problems. In Mannheim, most of the issues that Maria Hoehn describes were not readily apparent. But Mannheim was urban versus the relatively provincial character of Baumholder and Kaiserlautern of the previous decade.Some of Hoehn's themes in this book include the impact the American soldier's money and lifestyle on rural German society, the German conservatives' attempt to punish German women who associated with GIs, especially black GIs, and the irony of the Germans' rejection of discrimination against Jews in the new Federal democracy vis-&agrave;-vis their acceptance of it against black American soldiers. Certainly, Hoehn points out, white attitudes toward fellow black soldiers played a role in the German view.Hoehn's documentation from publications of the time convincingly demonstrates that there were significant racial problems and that many Germans vehemently opposed intimate associations between German women and American blacks, so much so that the conservative CDU political party and various religious organizations tried to have these women legally classified as prostitutes.Hoehn writes that many Germans including those who had lost ancestral lands to American military installations began to cash in on the boom by renting rooms to Americans. Barns and attics were transformed into apartments. German families moved into their own kitchens to be able rent out the rest of the house to the Americans who were willing to pay four or five times the going rate. Hoehn quips that in the small towns where everyone usually kept animals that some Germans had to choose between having a pig or an American, an \\"Ami\\" in the German parlance of the time.Due to high unemployment throughout Germany at this time, many young women came to the area hoping for a job as a maid for an American family, a waitress, or a dancer at an establishment that catered to American soldiers. Many, who had lost homes and parents during the war, hoped to escape from a life of poverty. Some were refugees from the former territories or East Germany. These women did not find favor in the traditional view of the residents of the area for their fraternization with American soldiers, especially black American soldiers. Such women were dubbed \\"Veronikas\\". A number of them were arrested and subjected to humiliating trials in local courts by extremist judges. Efforts for national legislation classifying these women as prostitutes by the coalition of CDU, Protestant, and Catholic leaders ultimately failed.This book is an excellent, well-documented piece of research. Although Hoehn's writing is somewhat academic and redundant in places, this is a commendable book of considerable merit. Those interested in postwar German history and even some former GIs may get new insight from it."},{"Title":"GIs and Fruleins: The German-American Encounter in 1950s West Germany","review":"&quot;GIs and Frauleins&quot; presents a comprehensive review of the cultural and economic impact the massive American military machine imposed on a small, agrarian, and relatively poor German state at the peak of the Cold War. This book presents a seminal work for the comprehension of later cultural clashes that dominated both the United States and Germany and continue to the present.I recommend it for both the serious scholar as well as the casual reader of social and demographic history."},{"Title":"GIs and Fruleins: The German-American Encounter in 1950s West Germany","review":"Unlike the previous reviewer, who took issue with the allegedly \\"academic\\" style of the book, I found it was very readable, avoiding a lot of the \\"constructing the other\\" and \\"conflicting gender identities\\" type of language one might expect to find in an academic book of this sort. This does not mean, however, that the book does not address the kind of conceptual, academic issues that are frequently raised in such stilted terms. In no sense is the book merely an antiquarian show-and-tell kind of catalog; it quite thoroughly discusses the \\"holy Trinity\\" of race, class, and gender issues. I found the discussion of German and American forms of racism to be especially interesting.The content of the book has, for the most part, been adequately addressed in the \\"official\\" Amazon review as well as in the previous customer review. There is one aspect, however, that deserves further mention, and which I found particularly insightful: H&ouml;hn's discussion of whether the changes that came to the rural areas she discusses would be best described as modernization or as Americanization. This sort of issue is something which would interest anyone who is concerned with the cultural issues of globalization and the dominance of American cultural products in today's markets. Because she focuses on an area in which there was a very strong American presence in the immediate post-war years, it is not surprising that her evidence shows a significant American component to the modernization process. It would be interesting to compare her conclusions in this regard to those of someone studying an area where American influence was less direct and personal. This comparison would better demonstrate whether the American influence was a necessary, or merely a contemporary, component of German societal modernization. Such a comparison, however, would not fit very well into a book titled \\"GIs and Fr&auml;uleins.\\" H&ouml;hn is to be commended for putting the abundant evidence which she presents into such a larger context of modernization debates, and not faulted for not being more encyclopedic."},{"Title":"GIs and Fruleins: The German-American Encounter in 1950s West Germany","review":"I bought this book because my half sister, who was given up for adoption after she was born and was raised in Germany, told me that the woman in this picture was my mom.

Just in case you are unfamiliar with the term Comic Caper, a lot of Westlake's earlier independent storylines were classified with this title by his fans and the media. These books usually have a main character or two who is basically a nice guy/s but not always the most moral or ethical person. This person usually has a sudden monumental hurdle come their way and to achieve their goal or get their normal life back, has to deal with a range of eccentric characters along the way. The majority of these comic capers are crime capers.In Cops and Robbers a couple of New York policeman named Tom and Joe have had a rather hard life. Each day they carpool into Manhattan together watching Yuppies in their cars travelling in air conditioned comfort and wonder why life is so unfair. It is during one of these mornings that Joe tells Tom not long ago he walked into a convenience store in his uniform and robbed the place. These two decide that some crimes are justifiable, and decide as cops, due to their access they can pretty much commit any crime they want. They are also fully aware they will go to jail if they are caught so decide to limit themselves to just one crime. And if they are going to commit a crime it better be a big one. What to steal, what to steal? Tom and Joe will come with a grand plan, but to pull it off they're going to have to contact the mafia.Cops and Robbers has very likeable main characters. Written in 1972 it does show its age at times such as obviously they'd now have mobile phones and things like this, but then again their scheme probably couldn't work in today's modern world anyway. A very enjoyable novel, of Westlake's comic capers I've read so far this is one of my favourites.If you haven't already done so check out Westlake's other comic capers. The best three at an absolute masterpiece level are,Smoke,The Spy in the Ointmentand aNew York Dance(also published asDancing Aztecs). Other comic capers also worth checking out are The Fugitive Pigeon, The Busy Body, God Save the Mark, Who Stole Sassi Manoon?, Help I am Being Held Prisoner, Castle in the Air, Enough and High Adventure."},{"Title":"Cops and Robbers","review":"Involving,full of action,humorous but sad.Absolutely to read"},{"Title":"Cops and Robbers","review":"this comic crime caper will make you laugh out loud and chew your fingernails at the same time. I'm convinced Donald E. Westlake is a genius....or at least immensely talented. He creates great characters whose dialogue sounds like real people talking, and his way with a plot is intricate, complex, and fun.In Cops and Robbers, Joe and Tom are two of New York City's finest and also friends living next to each other on Long Island. It is summer and the city is hot; Joe and Tom, both married with families, are tormented by the city, the people they arrest every day, and the difference between the have and the have nots, especially since they number among the latter. Carpooling into the city together, they begin to fantasize about a scheme which would allow them to escape what they see as the deterioration of New York and the daily grind of their jobs. Soon the fantasy begins to seem not only real but possible, and before they know it they are committed to a plan so outlandish it seems destined to fail. By now your moral compass is compromised; you know Tom and Joe are doing wrong but you really like them and you don't want them caught. This is where the nailbiting comes in; Westlake is a master at creating scenes made up of little ordinary moments that build unbearable suspense. Part A of Tom and Joe's scheme will leave you gasping and puzzled; Part B will make you squirm. Joe and Tom are two wonderfully realized characters, as real as people you know, and you'll miss them when the book ends.My first exposure to Westlake was God Save the Mark, another look at the ironic side of crime, with a very different but just as affecting \\"hero.\\" Now I am delightedly making my way through his entire collection. Treat yourselves; join the Westlake readers club. You won't be sorry."},{"Title":"Cops and Robbers","review":"Tom and Joe are two New York cops who are getting tired of being cops. So, they plan to heist a New York brokerage firm of bearer bonds and sell them to the mob. But the big problem is, where to store the bonds until the Mafia buys them, and how to keep the mob from silencing them after the bonds are sold.This is an atypical Westlake book. It's certainly not as funny as the Dortmunder series but it is clever and entertaining. The way the two cops solve their problems of safekeeping and getting away from the mob are clever. I didn't like this as much as other Westlake novels, but I'd still recommend it."},{"Title":"Cops and Robbers","review":"This is an early Westlake \\"caper\\" novel from 1972. As you would expect from the master of crime fiction, this is a humorous, light-hearted tale of criminal activity. Two cops decide they would prefer to make some serious money, deciding to get involved in the other side of the crime business. Although a fun read, I didn't think this was nearly as delightful or full of engaging characters as his beloved Dortmunder novels. But if you've enjoyed Westlake's other comic crime tales, you will find this to be an entertaining read too."},{"Title":"Cops and Robbers","review":"I enjoy Westlake's humorous Dortmunder series, and I really like his Parker mysteries (written under the pseudonym Richard Stark,) so I was expecting more from this 1972 \\"comic caper.\\" Contrary to these others, this book contained little that I found funny. Although the cops' plot is very clever, and the story has a few surprises, the narration often drags even though it is a short book. There are lots of digressions concerning the cops' lives and inner thoughts, perhaps designed to provide motivation or rationalization for their wanting to pull off a two-million-dollar heist. Dortmunder and his nefarious buddies are interesting, eccentric characters, but I can't say the same for Tom and Joe. Some may say that the novel is just dated, but I would disagree. The conditions for cops in New York have not changed so much over the years, and Westlake's Dortmunder series, initiated around the same time, is not out of date. I rate this effort as just o.k. As an aside, Westlake also wrote the screenplay for the movie version, but it was not a very successful or highly rated production."},{"Title":"Cops and Robbers","review":"My first Westlake book, read years ago.

I read it again several years later, and it doesn't hold up real well over time as so many things have changed, but it's still a good read and a good introduction to early Westlake."},{"Title":"Cops and Robbers","review":"This book is over thirty years old, and in a lot of ways evokes mental images of grainy color film from early 1970's cop movies like \\"French Connection,\\" or \\"Serpico\\". Not that the plot has anything to do with those movies, it just has the feel of that time and place. A more innocent, slower read than what you would pick up today.I have read a lot of Westlake, and he is allways enjoyable. Westlake has made a career out of writing from a certain vantage point not too many other authors attempt. He follows the efforts and travails of the bad guys. This book, \\"Cops and Robbers,\\" follows two police officers who are bored with their mundane lives. Events pile up on each other and they come to realize that the badge they carry gives them opportunities to steal, or pull off a big heist. Once this idea gets into their heads, it is too much for them and the story follows their plans to pull off a big one.As I said earlier, this is a slower book than I would expect to find todays mystery thriller writers produce. It is deeply concerned with the two officers motives where as today, the author would jump right into the action. Some of the plot structure I deeply disagree with, but it still works in the end if you suspend your cynical side.Westlake has not put out a book that I have come across yet which would put me into the position of saying dont try reading it. And Cops and Robbers is no different. Good, simple, fun."},{"Title":"Cops and Robbers","review":"I read this twenty or more yeaars ago and have re-read it 2 or 3 time.

(I'm also female, and a successful tournament player.) My elementary clubs run about 50/50 boys and girls. By junior high, the female participation drops to 25% or lower.None of the books I'd read about social development helped me as a teacher understand why this was occurring and what to do about it. We already had positive role models, a supportive school environment, good early training. We knew the girls COULD play chess--and so did they. The question was, why DIDN'T they?Marone's book, a gift a friend received for Father's Day, opened my eyes.

It is also reflected in the books theme and attitude.I have read three chapters so far and this is what I have gleaned from the book:1) Your daughter will only be \\"successful\\" if she chooses male oriented occupations.2) Your daughter will only be \\"successful\\" if she is a doctor, NOT a nurse. Heaven forbid she be a nurse, housewife, teacher.3) Your daughter won't be \\"successful\\" if she goes to a coed school. Send her to a female only institution, that way she only has to compete against other girls.4) Your daughter won't be a success without playing poker, chess or other strategy games. Don't even think of pulling out Dora or some other \\"girl\\" game.Surely there must be better books for Dads to gain some info on theie daughters and ways to help them along as they grow. I could go on with more examples from this feminist rant, but frankly don't have the time. My daughter and I are going to kick the soccer ball.And BTW, don't even let her enjoy an english class or play with dolls. Force her into that science and math slot.

The main issue of this book is that we by ourselves are diminishing our daughters' abilities by upkeeping the dogmas about women that we've inherited from our parents. Examples of such beliefs are that girls are not good in sciences like math, are never possessing the necessary skill or talent to become a skilled professional in traditionally male (and thus higher paid) occupations. The differentiation of professions by gender is a dogma by itself.The beginning of the book is quite noteworthy, the middle of it seemed to me to consist repetitions of previously said and kind of dull, but the ending of the book seemed deserving attention again.The advises or the book couldn't be equally applied to all the cultures. Being an American author, Nicky Maroon had exposed the American gender gap that is deeper than it is in Russia, where Soviet Power since the beginning of 20th century took many efforts to gain the complete equality and liberty of women. Just estimate Lenin's publications on the status of women, or judge Olympic results. Former East Germany, the Soviet Union, and the Former Communist Bloc dominated women's running in the 70s and 80s, taking nearly 70% of the final placement points in those two decades in Olympic and world championship races."},{"Title":"How To Father A Successful Daughter","review":"Child development psychology does provide evidence that fathers involvement in their daughters lives have a noticeable positive effect on life outcomes.

If one considers Gloria Steinem, a lesbian, manhating, abortion supporting woman a successful woman then by all means buy this book. Our idea of a successful daughter is one that is happy, honest, loving, compassionate, her cup is half full and she knows how to be a winner and a loser. This author seems to think if a man treats his daughter like a princess then she will not be a successful woman. Any man that treats his daughter like a princess within reason absolutely will reap a confident, outgoing daughter. Time and attention and never telling your daughter she cannot do something because she is a girl is all any Father needs to know.

I thought that Spielvogel was leaving out chunks of history, and revising the ones that he included, and I wanted to double check my facts before making any accusations. Well, boy was I right. This book makes the Publisher's tag line, \\"Changing the Way the World Learns\\" seem a little too true..If you DO get this book, here are some things to look out for:1. He is wrong on just about everything that has to do with art or music. He cites obscure artists and names them as the most popular, most of them had Christian themed work.2. He glorifies Hitler and the Nazis and makes the Holocaust seem like nothing but a minor glitch in history.3. The author has a degree in Reformation History and seems to be unable to help himself from relating every single event in history to religion. So keep in mind that Voltaire had more to offer history than an anti-Christian revisionist account of the fall of the Roman Empire, as Spielvogel states.If I were you, I'd buy a different history book to read as well as this one, if this is required for a course. Preferably one that was published for the first time in the thirties or forties and has been updated since, so that its more clear it isn't revionist history.

The first part of THREE JUNES is excellent, but the rest of the book is so tiresome that it is hard to believe it was written by the same person. The author should have left &quot;Collies&quot; as it was - a beatifully written, somewhat heartbreaking account of the family. The rest of the book is quite uninteresting, and frankly, quite boring. I found myself in the middle of the book saying, &quot;I don't care about this Fenno dude, nor his AIDS-stricken friend.&quot; For such a powerful topic, the book could have been much more moving."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"I recommended this book to my book club based on the positive reviews I had read and am so sorry I did. The three Junes described in the title follow three characters through part of a summer. The first and the third section are very brief and I had no real sense of the featured charator at the end. The first section is told from the point of view of Paul McLeod, who has been recently widowed and is vacationing in Greece, where he flirts with a young girl he meets on an island. The second section is almost a novel unto itself and relates the story of Fenno, Paul McLeod's son. Fenno's angst over being gay and living in self imposed exile from his family in Scotland gets very old very quickly. And then in the third June of the book, out of the blue, along comes Fern (the girl Fenno's father flirted with in the first section)to wallow in her unhappiness.I kept waiting for the plot to emerge, but the narrative seemed to meander on without ever coming together. I'll have to apologize to my book club for wasting their time with this book."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"This book was VERY well written. Quite beautiful in its language & overall construction. However, I was woefully disappointed by its content as based upon the jacket description. I was expecting a sweeping book about the lives of a Scottish family, and it started out with some great characters, but then it just turned into a depressing commentary on the destruction of 1980's homosexual as caused by the AIDS epidemic. I don't mind this topic at all, but was not expecting such a novel based upon the description."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"I had high hopes for \\"Three Junes\\" when I first got my hands on the book. The National Book Award seal is displayed *very* prominently on its cover, and the summary suggested that the storyline would be engaging. Overall, I wasn't disappointed with the novel. I got drawn in by Fenno, the protagonist whose voice tells most of the story. The book follows his life and that of his family, based on events that happen during June in various years. For several chapters in the middle of the book I had a hard time putting it down. And that doesn't usually happen.A couple things about \\"Three Junes\\" prevent it from being a really great book. For starters, the dialogue is really fake in parts, particularly that of Malachy (Mal) Burns, Fenno's close friend in NY. And Tony, a prominent character late in the novel, is so unauthentic that it feels like he's cut from cardboard. I respect the author for the effort, but I think she had a hard time relating to some of the characters that she created -- namely, the gay Scottish man, his acquaintenances and his would-be lover.These issues aren't trivial, but they don't overwhelm the enjoyable aspects of the book. From the very first page, it's obvious that Julia Glass is a talented writer. Her prose is a pleasure to read. The shifts in time and place, which some may find grating, kept the story interesting and engaging to me. I expect that some of the rough edges in \\"Three Junes\\" have worn off in her two more recent works, which I look forward to reading."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"Three Junes was a bit tedious because of the plethora of lengthy in-depth descriptions, but it also gave you a clear picture of what the author was trying to communicate. Great insight into the many facets of life of an entire family. Not a lot of action, but eventually the reader becomes involved with the characters and it is hard to pull away from reading sessions. Ended up thoroughly enjoying the experience."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"Every once in a while when reading a good book, you encounter a phrase or sentence that's so beautiful it's almost painful. Makes you groan a little, like a soccer ball to the stomach. Shake your head, because it's just too remarkable, someone putting together words that way. Or if you also fancied yourself a writer, makes you think that maybe you'll never touch a keyboard again.There's a lot of that in Three Junes, a lot of that aching goodness, a lot of descriptions and images that leave you asking the ceiling, \\"How'd she THINK of that?\\" A few samples: contrasting English and Greek skies, she says \\"Here, too, there are clouds, but they are inconsequential, each one as benign as a bridal veil.\\" Or \\"the low sun seems to linger indefinitely, a party guest reluctant to leave.\\" Of a dying mother, \\"Her breath sounded like a handsaw fighting through a dense green tree.\\" And even the concise bon mots: a \\"fusillade of children,\\" a \\"curdled sky,\\" a \\"Dionysian mass of fruit.\\" It's linguistic truffles like that every few pages . . . for 350 pages. (That was a laughably small sample; I'll leave you to discover the rest.)If you're not clicking Buy already, I don't know why we're still talking, but fortunately these evocative, envy-inducing turns of phrase are not the book's only virtue (though they alone would place it above most). The characters are realistic, as are the relationships between them--unless of course, you've never had parts of yourself you could never reveal, family members who misunderstood you, or lovers you couldn't accept yet couldn't quit.I can't wait to give her more of my money."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"This was a remarkable first novel by an author. I don't feel that I will be giving anything away if I reveal that the title is a result of the book's organization. It is written in three parts, each a significant event in the life of a family that takes place in June. The book opens with the Father, Paul, participating in a two week tour of Greece with ten other people. He has booked the tour in an effort to move on with his life after the death of his wife from cancer six months before. In the first part of the book we walk with Paul through reminiscence of his marriage and the rearing of his three adult sons in Scotland. We come to understand the conflict he feels about his wife's memory, as unresolved allegations of infidelity color his thoughts. He is torn trying to figure out a balance that will include his sons and at the same time free him from a painful past. He meets a young American woman while on the tour, forty years his junior, and begins to imagine a relationship with her.The second section of the book is from the perspective of Fenno, Paul's oldest son. It takes place seven years later, when the three sons and their families come together for a week at the family home in Scotland to celebrate the funeral of their father, Paul. Fenno is gay, and has chosen to live his life in New York City since graduating from college twenty years earlier. Fenno was closest to his mother, and has spent his adult life feeling distanced from the family by miles, his sexual preference, and the feeling he was a disappointment to his father. As well, Fenno is dealing with the fact that he is living a gay lifestyle in the 1980's and 90's, where he has witnessed the death of many friends to the ravages of AIDS. The AIDS epidemic leads Fenno to choose abstinence, which further isolates him. The funeral brings the family together for the first time in years, and it is fraught with personality clashes, lifestyle differences, perspective arguments about parents and childhood experiences, misunderstandings, children, infertility, memories, and love. Although Fenno has become rather bitter with age, he finds ways of bestow life-changing gifts of love on those around him. This was the longest, and my favorite section of the book.The last part of the book takes place in New York four years after the funeral. It picks up with the life of the young woman, Fern, that Paul had met and fell for in Greece on his tour ten years before. We come to know Fern, and learn of some of the unfortunate events and struggles in her life. Eventually Fern meets a young Greek man, Stavros, from a wealthy New York family who has made their money through real estate. They own apartment buildings, and Fern and Stavros begin a rental and a romantic relationship. A year goes buy, and Stavros leaves for a two month stay in Greece with his mother to visit family. Fern finds out she is pregnant after Stavros is gone, and doesn't want to break the news of the pregnancy in a letter or by phone. When Stavros' trip is extended from two to five months, Fern is embarrassed she hasn't mentioned the pregnancy sooner, and a baby bump complicates the possibility of breaking the news in person. When Fenno's younger brother, Dennis, comes to New York to visit Fenno for the first time, they find themselves at a weekend house party at the shore. The party brings together Fenno, Dennis, the pregnant Fern (who is nervously avoiding a reunion with her recently returned boyfriend), a gigolo, and a man who turns out to be the ex-lover of both Fenno and Fern, as well as the weekend lover of the gigolo... Rather convoluted, confusing, and a tab unbelievable in the end. Nevertheless, this was a very good book with a deep and emotional story, full of rich descriptions and analogies. It was awarded the 2002 National Book Award. Definitely worth the read."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"Our book club chose this book on a whim, and I could not have been more pleased with the results. The characters are beautifully crafted, and I am not sure I have ever cared for fictional people more. Having to read this in the weeks following the death of a love one, this book helped in the healing process to no end, as you one easily identify with the family and realise that you are not alone in hurt. The intricate details make the family feel so real and you begin to feel you are one of them."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"The equation of a true artist, per Glass, is as a \\"proud pilot of an improvised life.\\" (Page 277) Glass can really write: that is, her style is elegantly crafted and a joy to read. She reminds me a bit of Michael Cunningham with her rich syntax and sonorus, articulate style as well as her themes and the descriptions of characters and places. I picked up this novel because it won a National Book Award and my wife adored it. I like the way that Glass moves effortlessly among disparate settings to transport the reader from Greece to NYC and the English countryside. At the close of the novel I admit that I was somewhat annoyed that Glass was still introducing long expositions of characters. But I really felt that characters like Fenno, Tony, Mal and Fern were roundly and compassionately drawn figures. The story line takes unexpected and for the most part rewarding turns: Mal's illness was very Michael Cunningham and has emerged as a contemporary theme that we've had a great many literary opportunities to dwell upon. I'm not sure when this thematic focus of the plague will simply cease to be considered original or engaging among contemporary novels but, personally, I'm already there. What makes this novel interesting is what Fenno does both for Mal and Fern as their friends in light of their situations. Tony is an intriguing antagonist to Fenno's protagonist and becomes key in the plot's denouement. I consider Three Junes a very good but not great literary novel. The straight-ahead, traditional, narrative style makes for quick reading and Glass, by her own definition, artistically pilots the reader adeptly through her intelligently improvised world."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"This well crafted story, especially about the interrelationships between members of a family, but also between those with whom they interact, starts slowly, but improves in speed and quality. Taking place in Scotland, Greece and New York City, three chunks of time, during which the month of June falls, are covered, each period narrated by a different person. The first, \\"Collies 1989\\" (55 pages) is told by a melancholy widower during a group vacation to Greece. Although it is the dullest section, the middle part \\"Upright 1995\\" (205 pages), narrated by one of the man's sons, more than makes up for it. The descriptions are wonderful as are the characters, especially a sarcastic witty gay man named Mal. The writer delves into the relationships between Paul, his three sons, and their spouses and children. The loose ends are neatly tied up in the final section \\"Boys 1999\\" (85 pages), which is narrated by a woman unrelated but connected to the others. Three Junes, winner of the National Book Award, is a literary treat.

One of the best books I've read in a long time."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"It has been a while since I read any fiction and this was for school, hence why I read it. After reading 20-30 pages, I could not put the book down. The author draws the reader into the world of the characters that she created and paints a vivid picture of their surroundings. I can rightfully say that I will be reading some more of her work."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"3 stories interconnected via various members of the Scottish McLeods family set in 3 chronological Junes of '80's and '90's backdropped by Lockerbie bombing and AIDS epidemic illuminates the basic, vital blocks of human conditions - loss, betrayal, dying, desire, love and birth. Poignant and dynamic, the book translates the emotional life into words with gusto and gravity."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"I admire the works of Julia Glass for her finely tuned prose and her intense way of delving into the human heart. However, \\"Three Junes\\" fell a little flat for me in the final portion. Having looked at a couple of other reviews here, I see am not the first to feel the ending was odd.The opening, \\"Collies,\\" creates a vivid portrait of a marriage, strange to be sure, with Majorie mainly interested in her dogs and Paul, the tall quiet type. Their children, twins David and Dennis, and elder child Fenno, are raised in Scotland. Fenno never feels quite comfortable in the family, as if he lacks what others have. Fenno departs for the US. Paul vacations in Greece. Family tensions run deep.The second book, \\"Upright,\\" is the most compelling, drawing us into Fenno's world, a book store in 1995 New York. We find Fenno still unhappy, dealing with his sexuality without dealing with his way in the world. Mal, a neighbor, comes to share daily rituals with Fenno, but not the emotion Fenno needs. He acquires a parrot and one of his mother's collies. The animals open him to love in a way humans have not. And AIDS continues to decimate the communities in which Fenno and Mal have lived. Tony appears and disappears from Fenno's life in a way that Fenno accepts without knowing why he allows Tony this freedom.The final book, \\"The Boys,\\" comes about with only four years having passed. Yet Fenno seems strangely old. The third-person focus is on Fern, newly pregnant, deciding whether to tell the baby's father of her state. She knows he will marry her (he's Greek), but does she want marriage after her first one failed so dismally? Fenno and Dennis appear in the picture as Fern worries and frets although she is also joyous about this baby. Fenno's new volunteer work and the reappearance of the character of Tony bring some new insights into Fenno's story.This was an enjoyable read and a true journey into the heart of those who choose to hide from life rather than live each day because of childhood traumas and their own harshness in judging the world itself."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"I was not as captivated by the first chapters as many have been, but it kept me reading. And as the family dynamics emerged, and particularly when the focus shifted to Fenno in New York, I realized that I was hooked. He's a complex and likable character -- quite unconventional, in fact, in a contemporary novel, as he is not drawn to navel-gazing and sees himself more often as ridiculous than tragic. (We could all learn something here.)"},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"In a particularly cynical moment I borrowed this from the library and it's just what I needed to restore my enthusiasm for...well...participating. Glass's characters are earnest and thoughtful, carefully observed and rendered. The narrative, unlike most recent NBA winners, is more conventionally structured than not, thus requiring little stitching by the reader. I found that to be a relief: good story, told more or less conventionally, well-written. Not much, if any, evil; little gritty inexplicable. The book is full of kindness and color, but not at the expense of mystery. If what you'd like more than anything is to spend the weekend with thoughtful, intimate friends who know books and art and good food, yet don't feel you have much to offer in return, Three Junes is the way to go."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"There seem to be two schools of thought about this novel; those who loved the book, and those that could not stay awake while attempting to slog through it. Alas, I fall into the latter category. Typically I'm good for hours of reading, not with Three Junes, 20 minutes tops and the old lids were droopin'. Every time the story would get even remotely interesting, the author would stop in her tracks and switch to a different time or character. Her choppy writing style became incrediably annoying. The father, Paul seemed like an interesting guy, but we never got to know him. The mother Maureen, certainly earned her place in the history of memorable characters. I mean how many puppy drowning adulteresses have you come across lately? However we were left sorely wanting with her story too. Which leads to the rest of the book; a snorefest about Fenno their gay son, his brothers, and his dull life. Nothing much of any interest happens, I never cared about any of the characters, and I couldn't wait for it to end so I could move on to something that could hold both my interest and my consiousness."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"I tend to read first novels of upcoming authors. Most often, the novels are much better reads than those from seasoned pros. I suspect the reason to be that their first story has been rolling around inside their heads for some time before they decided to commit them to paper. And, that story is most-likely the REASON they become novelists. That's a shame with Ms. Glass' first time out: this attempt had little plot and no point. It doesn't give me much enthusiasm for any of her future endeavors. While this book was somewhat of a tough read (although I suspect the typeface used more the culprit than Ms. Glass' writing), Ms. Glass' is a good writer. At times, phrases and passages jump out at you, giving you false promise that the book will indeed redeem itself. It never does. What we need here is more plot and substance. Actually, we need a plot and substance. Sorry to break the four- and five-star ratings other reviewers gave this, but, quite frankly, I'm really sorry I wasted the time in reading this."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"Is it me?? This is an award winner and recommended by a few friends, but to me it's slow-paced, unfocused and unengaging; the characters are bland and the story uninspiring. I'm 200 pages in and not sure what the point is. The NY Times reviewer calls it a plot-driven novel, but to me it's nearly absent a plot, and the characters aren't interesting enough to carry it. I tried it once and put it down, am plodding through it now for my book group. Otherwise I'd have given up."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"I liked \\"Three Junes\\" so much that after two years I actually re-read it with great pleasure. I got if for my birthday from my husband, who skimmed it and decided it will be a good gift. And he was right. It is a strong, emotionally gripping debut book.The story revolves around one Scottish family - the McLeods. Paul, the family head and owner of the newspaper, is the main character in the first of the three parts (which won the award for the best novella, and it is, in a way, separate), when he goes to Greece after the death of his wife in 1989. We are introduced to the family from his perspective, learning about his wife, Maureen, and his sons Fenno, David and Dennis, with numerous retrospectives interchanging with the pictures from the Greek trip. The oldest of the three sons, Fenno, the owner of a bookstore in New York, narrates the second, the longest and - in my opinion - best part, which takes place after the death of Paul in 1995, in the family home in Scotland, but is full of Fenno's memories and reminiscences of various times in his life. The third part centers on Fern, a girl who made an impression on Paul on his trip to Greece, and this is maybe the weakest point of the novel, but it brings a catharsis in a form of Fern's conversation with Fenno, giving the reader some necessary answers.All the characters, even the background ones, are very rich, each of them really comes to life and is absolutely original. My favorite is Fenno McLeod- I do not agree with one of the reviewers who said that Fenno's self-consciousness is unnatural in a man in his forties - I know many people, who because of their sensitivity and culture behave and feel in a similar way; amateur psychology aside, Fenno is definitely a complex, interesting person who has many dilemmas and although tries to order his life in a simplest possible way, is faced with choices which lead to his full maturity but leave him still uncertain and doubting... Great character.My second favorite is Maureen, the wife of Paul, dog breeder and lover of the outdoors, seemingly not well matched to Paul and all the time promising some (unsolved) mystery; the funny thing is, that although dead from the beginning, she is all the time present, her strong personality made her mark on the home and each member of the family. Of the secondary characters, although all are special in a way, I would like to mention Mal, Fenno's sophisticated friend, dying of AIDS, and Veronique, Dennis' French wife.The only downfall of this otherwise great read is that the author inexplicably seems to want to show off with her knowledge of the world, putting loads of information about places where the story is set (Scotland, Manhattan, Paris, Greek islands, Long Island) and petty, albeit interesting, details about whatever comes to her mind really, from almost any field. This is the only thing that comes out as unnatural... I would imagine that it would have a good effect on the novel's clarity if this clutter were reduced. I am very curious about Julia Glass' second book and would like to read it soon despite worse reviews - my own will probably appear soon.Enjoy \\"Three Junes\\", especially that it is best read in summer!"},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"I put off reading the last four pages for a few hours just to hold on to it a bit longer, but when I finished, I was smiling.Contentedly."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"The Three Junes is actually three different stories from three different time periods, all inter-related. I enjoyed the characters and reading what they went through. But I just thought the story was really slow and did not hold my interest. It did get more interesting towards the end of the book. I was expecting more since this book has won so many awards and received such good reviews. It just felt to me that the writing was really \\"blah\\", and there was very little excitement to the stories. The best thing about the book was that the characters were very interesting. But the stories themselves could have been told in a more interesting manner."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"After finishing Middlesex last month, I was adrift looking for another writer with the same skill as Eugenides at crafting characters who steal our hearts and emotions which resonate with honesty. Thank you Julia Glass, for filling this void, and for now leaving me to seek yet another writer as gifted as you. Not only is her division of the novel into three sections a deft accomplishment, but her time-shifts within those sections is handled in a way which proves that our lives do not simply move in a linear forward motion - we are the sum of every age we have ever been, and of every action we have taken. My bookshelves are filled with the works of TC Boyle, Margaret Atwood, Anne Tyler, John Irving, Jonathan Franzen, Barbara Kingsolver, Rohinton Mistry, Amy Tan, Russell Banks, and I just wish that there were more of Julia Glass to enjoy."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"I found this set of three, intertwined novellas a remarkable, if imperfect work. Glass is a marvellous stylist and is more interested in conveying mood and images -- a city approached by jet is a &quot;jewelbox&quot; -- than in plot. The entire book is structured as a series of alternating episodes from the present and an important time in the past. Not an easy read by any means. Like the previous reviewer, I found the outer 2 novellas to be the best. &quot;Collies&quot; in particular is a special piece of writing. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"I read a lot of novels and this book tops my list for the summer. Unlike many reviews, my favorite section by far was the middle where we learn more about Fenno -a fully dimensional character who I will never forget. The relationship between Mal and him is poignant, witty and very interesting.. Mal is a character I would love to have know .His lines and observations had me laughing out loud on more than one occassion. I just don't comprehend why some people have a hard time reading about gay people (as per some of the reviews ). Get over it! It is reality. Look at this wonderful, rich, deep character this author has created - (I saw so many characteristics of myself in Fenno and I am a heterosexual female!) The second part 's wrapup where he is sitting up in the secret hide-out of the home he grew up in Scotland pondering where his life would lead while discovering where his precious niece has hidden her grandfather's ashes left me in complete awe and admiration for the gift of writing. Fern 's character was less interesting to me, but I was glad to see Fenno moving along in his life and displaying the wonderfulattributes you knew he had in him. A moving, lovely book."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"Julia Glass has woven a fine mesh of rich characters, intricate plot and intimate details into a story that I hated to put down. One of the critics I read indicated that they wished there were \\"Four Junes\\" so that this novel wouldn't have to end quite yet. I heartily agree. At first the three stories seem separate from one another, but as you get pulled into the fine intricacies of these peoples' lives, you realize that they are all intertwined, and in such fascinating ways. I adore these sorts of stories, and Ms. Glass has done this one to perfection."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"\\"Time plays like an accordion in the way it can stretch out and compress itself in a thousand melodic ways. Months on end may pass blindingly in a quick series of chords, open-shut, together-apart; and then a single melancholy week may seem like a year's pining, one long unfolding note.\\"In \\"Three Junes\\", first-time novelist Julia Glass paints a vivid landscape about life - the choices we make, the parts of ourselves that we dare to show, and the feelings we have - in a seamless portrait of beauty.The tale revolves around three characters, each linked by a specific event in their past. Paul McLeod is a recent widower hoping to find a new life in the Greek islands; Fenno McLeod is a New York bookstore owner dealing with the death of a close friend, and Fern is a pregnant dreamer unsure of her future. Each character is forced to make choices in the wake of grief and new love, and each responds differently.This is by no means an action story. It is more about the characters and the relationships that they have than any dramatic tale. However, Glass's exquisite prose (as seen in the leading quotation) keeps the reader engrossed and evaluating his or her own life."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"In my opinion, \\"Three Junes\\" does not live up to its rave reviews or to the National Book Award bestowed upon it. The story, which recounts the lives of a Scottish family through flashbacks into the past and three slices of time in the present, does not seem to have focus. The first section of the novel, covering newly widowed Paul's trip to Greece, is the best. Through Paul's reminiscences, the reader is introduced to the McLeods. As the perspective shifts to son Fenno in the second section, the story begins a downhill slide. I do not see the point of the third section at all, which focuses on Fern, a character who is peripheral to the McLeod family. Nor do I see a common thread binding the three sections of the book, other than the presence of some of the same characters.The eldest son Fenno is the best portrayed character, and the family's history unfolds mostly through his eyes. Yet Fenno is not a very likable person, and since he is the family's \\"black sheep,\\" gay and living in Manhattan, using him as the chronicler of the McLeods seems a poor choice. His opinions of his siblings and other relatives is colored by his physical and emotional distance from the rest of the family.This book is a slow read. Although it is beautifully written, that is not enough to hold one's interest without a good theme or plot behind it. If you want to read an excellent award-winning family saga spanning both sides of the Atlantic, read Eugenides' Pulitzer Prize winning \\"Middlesex\\" instead."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"I generally try to read award-winning books as a way to avoid bad or uninteresting books. This was a mildly interesting story involving largely one-dimensional characters who whine a lot about their lives, their parents, their siblings. I found the author's persistent use of parentheticals tedious. I may be missing something, but I would not place this book in the same category with Cold Mountain, another National Book Award winner that is far superior to Three Junes. The best I could say about Three Junes is that it is good for a first novel."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"I loved this book. In fact, unlike my usual speedy style, I read it really slowly to savor every aspect. The characters, the different time periods - all were drawn so well. I found myself completely absorbed in the smells and tastes and sounds of each part of the book. I might even read it agin!"},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"Some books have transcendent plots that carry you away on a fictional journey. Others are like fine works of art; you read them to be swept away by the sheer beauty of the prose. Still others are clever or thrilling, always staying one step ahead, compelling the reader to try to figure out the what is going on and why. Then there are the detailed character studies--these books bring a single character to life so effectively that readers feel they know this person better than almost anyone else.Every novel tries to deliver deeply wrought characters that spring to life off the page. But once a reader puts a book down, and goes on to another, generally these characters slowly disappear from memory. But not all fictional characters fade away; with some novels the entire focus of the work is on such fine and deep characterization that readers will remember that character for the rest of their lives.\\"Three Junes\\" by Julia Glass is just such an incredible character study. The character we come to know so deeply is Fenno McCloud. It's a brilliant creation...no wonder it won the National Book Award in 2002!And what type of character did Julia Glass bring to life in Fenno McCloud? Is he some larger-than-life role model? No, Fenno is just another decent human being struggling to live a good life in a difficult world. Perhaps he is unique because he possesses a strong moral compass and this is what attracts us to him. Fenno is gay, but his sexuality is not important in the overall scheme of this book; also, there is nothing in this book that is titillating.Through its artistic three-part structure, Fenno McCloud comes alive. Much of the depth of the character study is derived from the book's unique structure. The author describes it as a triptych--a three-part work consisting of a large center novel flanked on either end by two small novellas. Each piece could stand alone, but together they perform symbiotically to create something far greater. It is a structure that allows the reader to learn about Fenno from different perspectives.The first part, named \\"Collies,\\" tells the story of Fenno McCloud's father, Paul, during June of 1989--a time in his life when he is vacationing in Greece recovering from the death of his wife, Maureen. There are many flashbacks where we are introduced to many of the major characters in the novel including Paul's eldest son, Fenno. There is a young American woman on the trip named Fern. Paul finds her disarming, and soon he is telling her his innermost secrets.The long central novel, named \\"Upright,\\" is set in June of 1995. Fenno is living in New York at the height of the AIDs epidemic. And the mantra that runs through his head is \\"stay upright and you will stay alive.\\" In this section we are introduced to Fenno's friends and move with him through his everyday home and work life. There are numerous flashbacks where we learn about Fenno's Scottish family.In the third part, named \\"Boys, \\" and set in June of 1999, Fern again plays a pivotal role. Fenno and Fern meet each other in New York, never knowing that Fern knew Fenno's father in Greece ten years earlier. Just like his father before him, Fenno finds Fern disarming, and soon he is opening up to her and telling her his innermost secrets. That father and son, would find Fern and both see her as the perfect confidant...well, that makes the serendipity of their coming together even more magical.The three sections permit us to view Fenno not only from his own point of view, but also from the points of view of those people who are most important to him. The action of the book is centered around Fenno's relationships--those with his father, his mother, his two brothers, the brothers' wives and children, his friends and lovers in New York, and even his beloved parrot, Felicity.This novel is not for everyone. If you need a strong plot or a compelling storyline, look elsewhere: this novel is decidedly a realistic portrayal of everyday life, nothing more. If you love a novel with deep character development, look no further: this book is about as good as they get.If after finishing the book, Fenno becomes so much a part of your life and you want some more time with him, you will be happy to know that Fenno reappears as one of a group of major characters in Julia Glass' latest novel \\"The Whole World Over.\\" Both novels are excellent and highly recommended, but \\"Three Junes,\\" is truly exceptional."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"This book is in three parts, each narrated with a different point of view. Part I is narrated in third person, limited to Paul Macleod, a retired newspaperman and the father of a Scottish family that is the focus of the story. Part II, is narrated by Paul's son Fenno, and comprises two-thirds of the book. Part III is narrated in third person limited to the point of view of a young woman who befriended Paul on his trip to Greece.The main action of these three narrations occurs in June, 1989, June of 1995, and June of 1999. The first June, in 1989, recounts Paul's vacation in Greece; the second June occurs when Fenno and his farflung brothers and their wives convene at the Macleod family home in Scotland for their father's funeral in 1995; the third June occurs in 1999 when Fenno, his brother Dennis, and Fern (the young woman who befriended Paul in Greece) enjoy a weekend at a beach house in Long Island, New York. Interspersed throughout the action of these \\"three Junes\\" are numerous flashbacks, enough to give an indepth look at the complications in the relationships among the Macleod family. The book is Faulknerian in the way it weaves a complete story using flashbacks and time shifts.As I was reading this book, I described it to those who asked about it as a very \\"suspenseful\\" book. When I described the plot, however, it was obvious that the plot isn't suspenseful. The suspense derives from the tension between characters' relationships. The family exhibits passive aggression, attacks disguised as humor, spite, jealousy, envy, guilt-tripping each other, perhaps even hatred. The relationships among the family members are very psychological and plausibly described by author Glass.A story about such a family would seem to be depressing and trying on a reader, but the narration about the Macleod family is interpersed with scenes from son Fenno's life in New York, and the smart dialogue and repartee of his friends Mal and Tony prevent the gloomy accounting of the Macleod's saga from becoming too overbearingly depressing for the reader. Fenno's friends Mal and Tony are cynical characters yet likable for their wit and admirable in many qualities. Fenno, the narrator of most of the book, is a bit gloomy in spirit, but his narration and his perception of events in the story are intelligent, nuanced, and sophisticated.Fenno is gay and lives in New York during the eighties, and there are many flashbacks to his experience there. Therefore, the book includes accounts of the AIDS epidemic of that period, and Fenno's best friend is afflicted with the disease. However, the book is not an \\"AIDS book\\" that focuses narrowly on the effects of the disease on gay lifestyle. AIDS is an element of the book, and Fenno must deal with it, but it's not the focus.This is a book about the complications of family relationships; competition among brothers, homosexuality, disappointing one's parents, disappointing one's children, choosing a lifestyle contrary to one's parents, infidelity, pathological emotional isolation of family members from one another, and so on. Yet at its heart the book is mostly about the high cost of love. The Macleod family's way of loving one another does cost them. But the book offers hope for a better, more open, sense of love. Fenno is cautious with love, and his cautiousness makes him turn away from the opportunity for love, not just a life partner but all kinds of loving relationships. He remains mostly celibate in his gay lifestyle not just because of the threat of AIDS but because he's reluctant to invest his emotions in others by loving them and allowing himself to be loved by others.The book is an account of how Fenno, the eldest son and the gay son, overcomes his skepticism of love and his isolation from others by embracing the possibility of love and by developing his attachments to family, friends, potential lovers, and society even. There is a lot of trouble in the Macleod family that threatens human attachment among the parents, their sons and their wives, and others too. But the book has a positive ending in that Fenno, whose voice is primary in the novel, finally begins to reach out to others by the end of his story."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"Every once in a while, a novel comes along that makes you reexamine and reevaluate the life you lead. In Three Junes, Julia Glass has created characters that we yearn to understand and in so doing, come to love. Her appreciation for life and its idiosyncrasies is at once beautiful and reassuring. This is what the 21st century novel is supposed to be and what we are so often lacking in other's writing. This is a must read for anyone who appreciates serious fiction today."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"I bought this book because it has a gay protagonist and then sat down to read it after it won the National Book Award. Contrary to one reviewer, I think the writing is extraordinarily fine--the reviewer seems unable to understand that there are literate and articulate people who do speak like Fenno and his friends and family--realism need not simply be the scratchings and cursings of too many of today's novels. Fenno is a wonderful character--Jamesian in his psychology and sensibility--and the movement between his present-day narrration and his memories of his life with Mal is fascinating and genuine. The framing of his longer narrative by that of Paul and Fern works quite well, I think, without ever feeling forced. That not all is resolved seems to me a plus rather than a negative (though, of course, I, like everyone else, wanted Fenno and Fern to connect the dots--someday, I suspect they will).Every so often I read a book and wish I had the gift for language and storytelling the author did: this is so with the novels of Jane Hamilton (with whom I went to high school--and I envied her writing even then), and The Lovely Bones, and it is true with this one. I look forward to Julia Glass's next novel--though it will be hard to top this one."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"This book starts so well, with a miniature of a Scottish widower on his group tour of Greece. This chapter is beautifully drawn, clever and tart, not a spare word to be had. One can readily see how this novella-length segment won awards. It reminded me of the very best of Anita Brookner.Then the lengthy second segment begins, suddenly and without pity, and we think, \\"Wow, what daring this writer Glass has!\\" Alas, over many hundreds of pages, this wonder dissipates as the principal character's alienation from his native land, his family, even from the microculture of gay life in New York City is portrayed. I didn't enjoy this as it is a grim, realistic portrait of survival.The third segment shows Glass more in her element again, but I was not feeling quite so charitable by this time. And at its conclusion while the main characters are clear-eyed and have earned their determined hopefulness, we are apparently left with the facile, Oz-like realization that there's really no place like home. Like that movie, a bit of a letdown after such a lengthy trip.Though I admit growing weary in the long middle section, I did admire Glass' skill in cunningly conjuring the dead from the memories of the living. There were times when you'd swear you could \\"see\\" the outline of a ghost from its influence on the living. The dearly departed haunt us still, and seemingly always will. That resonated with me."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"Yes, the author can write but can she be imaginative and take us on a journey? I enjoyed the second part of the book the most about Fenno an interesting character. The 1st was OK, the 3rd part; I'm not sure why she even bothered to write this part! I'm getting tired of reading books about people's every day lives, nothing spectacular. I have an every day life of my own thanks. When I read a book I want rich characters, entertaining plots, perhaps a few twists & the use of a strong imagination on the part of the writer. Although the book is not horrible it's nothing to write home about and it's not a book you'll ever tell someone, or ever hear someone tell you: \\"You gotta'read\\""},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"This book is one that I thought I would not be interested in reading. It just did not seem so exciting by the description. Then one day I had to go on a plane, and I noticed, that the book had won the National Book Award. I immediately bought it, and I was transfixed.The amazing thing about Glass' writing is that it does not really matter what the subject is; but how she writes that is truly incredible. Out of the box with her first book, the novel is gripping. Not from suspense, but from the structure, the feelings, the emotions, the conversations and the narration.Glass is quite the brilliant author and person. What she conveys in this book are feelings that no one would even consider. Feelings, that are so subtle, yet when she paints the picture with her profound and literary sentence structure, seem so clear, so obvious.Her insight into mental transaction is acute; her analysis astute. And her entire construction of the book is illuminating. This book is a must read for all lovers of modern literature in fiction."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"Three Junes was difficult for me to rate because, although I recognize the artistic achievement of the novel, it really was not a book that I enjoyed reading. The language and character development by author Glass was well done, but at the same time the characters were so full of angst that I wanted to shout at them, &quot;Lighten up! Life is not meant to be so tortured.&quot; The story covers three summers (or Junes) in the lives of a Scottish family. The first part describes the life and marriage of Paul McLeod. Although it was interesting, it didn't seem to be developed fully enough. The next section, about Paul's eldest son Fenno, was longer than necessary and seemed to drag in parts. The last part was about Fern, a woman who was important in Paul's life and seemed to be destined to become a big part of Fenno's as well. Their relationship developed unrealitically quickly and seemed to magically defuse all of the doubts which had tortured Fern for many years. The author has real potential, but will hopefully be less heavy-handed in future novels."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"...from wasting their time on this dreck. It's one of those books you slog through, hoping against hope that one of the meaningless coincidences will be unmasked, will turn out to be significant (\\"Woah! That was your father?

Nothing but page after page of dull lists of dull activities (\\"She sponged down the counter. He washed the plates. She loaded the dishwasher. He washed the pot they had boiled the corn in.

Glass gives the impression that she is retelling the same story, but with little depth as we read.Number Three: the novel is marred by clich&eacute;, a kind of PC enrichment of sentiment, which appears to mask for a lack of authorial skill. When a writer can't pull something off, it is easy to hide behind well worn cultural solipsism to generate sympathy and support."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"It's rather intimidating to review this novel because it's so deft. It addresses the complexity of relationships - whether between lovers, between family members or between humans and animals. It's like weaving a tapestry and when the participants run out of thread, they have to face their demons. Siblings treat each other cruelly but they still love each other. Homosexuals experience sexual longing and it's ok to talk about that. A major theme is guilt - Fenno (if this was \\"Shakespeare in Love\\", Joseph Fiennes would say here \\"good name\\") the eldest of a Scots family, is guilty because he will not carry on in his father's chosen profession, journalism. He is also guilty about his sometimes clinical observation of a dying friend and sometimes he thinks he only takes care of this friend because the friend is brilliant. Fenno's father has always suspected his wife of being unfaithful and it is a kind of revenge for him to abandon the family estate for Greece following his retirement. Fern, the American artist, is guilty because she realizes her marriage is a mistake and then her husband dies at the time she has these thoughts. Sometimes when your siblings get married, you won't like their spouses. Sometimes you will love your pets more than other people. Nature in all its splendour, whether a Grecian isle or Long Island, often mocks the pain that people are experiencing. It may be a stretch to say that the boat cruise in the Aegean alludes to Shakespeare's Tempest but the novel deals with big issues that are rather Shakespearean in scope."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"Reading this book was like watching a foreign film: Did I really read/see that? Was this worthy of Nat'l Book Award? I'm still trying to answer that question. Would I recommend this? Yes!!"},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"We read this book for our book club and we were all disappointed. It wasn't anything like what we were expecting from the description on the back of the book. The lady who picked it was afraid we would be offended by it, luckily we weren't. It was just hard to get into until almost two thirds of the way through, then when I finished I was very disappointed because some of the issues she bought up weren't resolved very well."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"I purchased this book after reading a sample so I should have gotten something I would enjoy. Unfortunately, it wasn't til I got the full version that the shifting back and forth in time and then back and forth in generations started. I suffered through a third of this book and then gave up. Too hard to follow and not enough in the story to put up with the changing back and forth for me to want to continue. It is now in archive and incompletely read."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"I really found Three Junes by Julia Glass to be tedious beyond belief. In a way, Glass seemed to be copying The Hours. The triptych, the gay man dying of AIDS, etc. But her novel doesn't have the depth and emotional complexity that The Hours, at it best, manages to give us.Instead, she takes refuge in a kind of narrative \\"niceness,\\" and the sentimentality of The Three Junes becomes a smoke screen she can hide behind. But the cost to her (and to her readers) is that what remains is evasive, chatty, charming, shallow and disingenuous.There! I've had my little tantrum...and she is only one of literally thousands of writers who treat novels as if they are potluck: a little of this and a little of that and let's hope for the best."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"I bought this book expecting great things based on the award. From that point of view I must admit to being more than a little dissapointed. There were several other books I read this year, like The Kite Runner for example, that I fel were much more deserving of this recognition. That being said it is worth the read. I found the character development to be very good and the story to be interesting. I would buy another novel from Ms. Glass."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"This book is very well written, and I believe that Ms. Glass is very talented. I am half way through the book and bored, however.My main criticism is of her treatment of grief. The father, departing to Greece on a tour, seems very one-dimensional. That is intentional, I'm sure. But even Fenno's narrative voice seems weak. One would think that his voice wouldn't try to be so analytical in arriving at the church for his Mother's funeral. When one is grieving, you don't notice everything. Snippets are good, the sense of trying to anchor oneself in the face of grief, but the whole thing feels like a construct, and it shouldn't. I know Fenno is reserved, but there is no real sense of shock and grief at all, so the conceit really doesn't work for me.I plan on finishing the book."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"I was disappointed with the novel, based on the fact it was a National Book Award winner. Perhaps it was too \\"literary\\" for me, but I found myself not really caring about the characters. Although I'm far from a prude, I felt the parts about the gay character was way more than I needed/wanted to know.I have purchased Glass's new one and hope I'll enjoy it more."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"Ellegant, sophisticated and, maybe, too subtle for some readers.Fabulous debut."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"I just can't get through this book. I have dragged myself through 100 pages and I am starting to feel my life is wasting away. I don't care about the characters because I don't know a thing about how they feel. The entire book is either a monotonous recounting of events or dialogue between extremely flat characters. Save yourself $12 and buy a book that is well-written and relatable...may I suggest &quot;Crow Lake&quot; by Mary Lawson, &quot;The Red Tent&quot; by Anita Diamant or &quot;Raising Fences&quot; by Michael Datcher. There you go, something for everyone and a 100 times better than Three Junes."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"I honestly don't get it. What made this book a NYT Bestseller and winner of the National Book Award? Not a fan of the \\"short story\\" type sections, even if the characters are remotely connected."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"A well written book with an ultimately uplifting message, I found myself pushing through to get through some sections that seemed ponderous. Similar in style to Michael Cunningham's \\"The Hours\\", the book is broken into three stories that interweve along a family bloodline. Each story melds between the present and the past, with the last story bookending the first in a clever way. My problem with the book is I found the first and last sections far too short and the middle section too long. It also reminded me of \\"The Hours\\" for it's themes of life and death, I just felt \\"The Hours\\" did it much more sucessfully."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"I am still surprised that this book won a major prize like the National Book Award. Maybe that year the other entries were more terrible. This novel is complex, but it has zero character development. I understand that some of the characters are meant to be affected, but Ms. Glass really gilds the lily. I don't care how affected you are, you just don't talk that way. The prose in this novel was like nails scratching a blackboard. Ms. Glass also abuses the coincidence device, which I hate with passion. Old Scottish man meets American girl in Greece, and years later, she and the old man's son happen to meet through a common lover. How convenient, and how Danielle Steel. The whole dynamics between the three brothers were painful to watch. The marriages the brothers had made no sense at all (the French affected bitch married to the California surfer dude brother? Really?!?!). The sterile brother and emotionally fragile wife asking Fenno for his sperm really did me in. This is the sort of stuff that the writers at the Hallmark Channel resort to when writing scripts. And this got the National Book Award?!?! From now on, beware!"},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"I read about 2/3s of this book and gave up. It's extremely boring and pointless. Nothing happens in this entire book. No murders. No action. No nothin'!It's called Three Junes not because it's about three people named June, but because the book is split up into 3 parts that all take place in June of different years.The first part is about Paul McLeod. The entire story is about him on a cruise. That's it. Nothing happens on the cruise.The second part is about Paul's son Fenno. This was probably the best of the 3 stories. Fenno is gay and owns a book store in Manhattan. His neighbor, Mal, asks him to take his bird Felicity for him. He wants her to have a home after he is gone. You see Mal is dying of AIDS.Fenno also meets Tony. A gay photographer who's house sitting in Manhattan. They have wild sex every day for a while and then Tony disappears.And I didn't finish the 3rd part. I tried, but I just couldn't make it.Please, don't read this book. It's a total waste of your time."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"Reading this book made me feel as if I was watching life. No conclusions, no moral of the story, no agenda. I thought the story telling was fluid - one of the few novels I have read where I didn't have the impulse to flip through the pages looking for the ending."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"This book was interesting. It was not my favorite to read. Although written poignantly and beautiful, I found myself getting mad at the character's reserve. And yet, I have found myself, more than other recent books, thinking about the characters and their reasons for behaving as they do. The characters all ring true.The book is divided into 3 sections which at first glance seem like 3 different stories with the same characters. The main character, Fenno is seen with finer detail in the 2nd section. The first section is about his father dealing with the death of his wife and flashing back through their married life. The second section is about Fenno and his brothers dealing with their lot in life and the pecking order in the family. The third section is short and sort of ties it all together in a not so final, clearly drawn way.I enjoyed the book. I know the characters will stay with me longer than most. The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is not a good reason. I felt the story covered some areas that seems not to add much if anything to the overall effect. This is not a criticism, but should be known that it doesn't come up with a cute, pat ending. I really enjoyed the ending. It seemed very real-life to me. I still very much recommend this book."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"Julia Glass has managed an impressive debut in \\"Three Junes.\\" In three almost-self-contained novellas she dissects the many forms of love, each unique in its own mysterious way. In the first chapter, a widower wanders Greece on a tour, remembering his marriage, an outwardly happy one. We get tantalizing hints about Maureen, first through her husband's puzzled eyes, then much more clearly as we come to know her children. Can two people be married for so long and not know each other? In the second \\"June\\" the family re-unites for the funeral of their father, and we see two very different marriages, both puzzling to older brother Fenno, who is struggling with his own unique ways of loving. In the third chapter, the story comes full circle, as a character from Greece re-surfaces in a surprising way.This isn't a plot driven book, which explains many of the poor reviews. It is beautifully written, with unique fully-developed characters and a fresh perspective on human love. But don't expect it to end wrapped up in a neat package. In fact, this is my one big criticism--perhaps an editor felt the book needed a little trick to keep the reader guessing, and so one races through the last chapter waiting for the \\"Six Degrees of Separation\\" to be revealed. But Glass leaves us hanging, in a false note that mars an otherwise genuine story."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"I just finished this book this morning and felt compelled to write a quck review. For some reason, it took me a little bit to \\"get into\\" this one but once I did, I could not put it down. It is very well-written and I am sad that it is over. I really enjoyed the characters, especially Fenno and even Fern, and it left me hungry for more...I want to know what happened when Fern told Stavros about the baby...I want to know if she ever realizes that she met Fenno's Dad on her trip to Greece...I want to know about Fenno's relationship with the twins. But despite my longing for more of this story, I am happy to have had the oprtunity to \\"know\\" these characters and I can highly reccommend this bookI thought this book was great and how anyone can call it flat is beyond me. This is the first novel I have read that tells about life from a gay man's perspective. Sometimes he seemed to be reluctantly gay but gay none the less. I was sympathetic to siblings that remembered things differently from their childhoods, almost like they lived with different families, as is the case with siblings. This story was so deep and the characters so involved and intertwined it was unbelievable. What a wonderful depth and ability this author showed."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"As someone who reads very quickly, I generally have to read quite a few books before uncovering a book that makes an impression on me. There are very few books that make me stop and reflect upon either a great writing style or a great story line. This book has both. The characters are so well drawn and the backdrop of their individual lives is wonderfully interwoven over a period of three years. The author simply but richly portrays her characters and, although there really are only glimpses into their lives, it is easy for one's imagination to fill in the pieces. Fenno was a wonderful central character, a (...)man without the obnoxious affectations that one generally encounters both in literature and, sometimes, in real life. He is a man struggling with relationships, just like us all! This is a rich and delightful book that should leave most readers very satisfied."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"Novella #1 \\"Collies\\", was achingly beautiful and left me yearning for more. Anyone who has ever seen a reticent man grieve a loss will understand and empathize with Paul.The middle section was a bit long and tiresome, but Fenno is a great character and I found his relationships with his mother, father, brothers, Mal, Tony, etc. to be very believable (To reviewers who criticized his dialog: how would you EXPECT a gay Scottish literati to speak?).The last novella, \\"Boys\\", seemed like a rather contrived way to tie everything together and bring closure to the story. Fenno's altruistic transformation was a bit much. There was no use for Dennis even being in this section, and he seemed very much out of character. Fern is such a coy and deplorable leech of a woman, it was disappointing to end on her story rather than on the touching and selfless caregiving we see Fenno provide Mal in the middle section. If this is ever made into a movie, they will have to cast Winona Ryder as Fern!Although pleasantly surprised at how well Glass developed this mostly-male cast of characters, I share other reviewers' frustrations with the gaping plot holes and overall cumbersome structure of this novel. But, I like character-driven stories, esp. ones depicting complex relationships between men, so I was pleased with this book. A good first novel."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"THREE JUNES is a nuanced, layered book. After I finished it, I re-read the first section and realized how beautifully the pieces of the book fit together. Glass is too sophisticated, too knowing of the realities of life, to come up with pat endings or make everything fit together too neatly. However, even small characters that are introduced in the first section, Fern's friend Anna for instance, are re-introduced in the later sections with appropriate follow-ups. She shows how different the world can be viewed from various perspectives. For example, in the first section, she details a character, Marjorie, a schoolteacher from Devon, who gets on the nerves of Paul, the main character. Later, Marjorie shows up at Paul's funeral and they seem to have remained in touch through the years. The reader assumes: she kept pushing herself into his life. Paul's son Fenno has a different take on Marjorie-and he wonders-were they good friends. NO , no you want to cry-she got on his nerves-but Fenno never gets to realize his father's take on herth-nor would most people in real life, after someone has died. [...]"},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"I loved this book. It's witty, it's fun and it's a fast read. Typically, when I finish reading a book, I journal my favorite passages. Journaling Julia Glass is like trying to capture Wallace Stegner. It's nearly impossible to enter all of the great excerpts.There is a broad range of characters in Three Junes. Sweet, senstive Paul... His colorful wife, Maureen,... The description of Paul's caretaking of the dying Maureen was incredibly tender and touching (yes, I cried on the airplane while reading it).Fenno, the son of Paul and Maureen, is an introspective sort with a good soul and a hilarious, cynical friend Mal. Mal's description of a friend going through fertility treatment: ...There is much sensitivity and life wisdom peppered throughout the book...That hope and optimism is indeed the essence of this wonderful book."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"I must admit that at the start of this book I was unimpressed. I had quite a hard time getting involved, and while it was technically speaking a decent read I felt uninvolved and worse uninterested. Then somewhere toward the middle of the book I found myself enthralled. All of a sudden it was clear that yes, this book did in fact win the National Book Award for a reason. Julia Glass masterfully weaves a heartfelt and captivating narrative that is deceptively simple and light. The characters have depth and are well drawn out and realistic, particularly Fenno. In the end it is hard not to like Three Junes, and I would indeed recommend that you read this delightful tale of love and relationships, in all of their forms."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"I'm surprised that this novel won the National Book Award for 2002. It's not a big or ambitious book (as its 2001 predecessor, \\"The Corrections,\\" was). One of the characters is a photographer whose metier is extreme closeups of familiar sights: a lover's hip, a baby's fist. The book is very much like that: an extended close up of several domestic arrangements. It's an extremely well-written, elegantly structured miniature.The first novella in the series, \\"Collies,\\" deals with Paul McLeod, a Scotsman whose wife has recently died. This is the gem of the collection. It's easy to understand why Glass's novella won awards: it is spare, understated, elegant. As we learn what Paul's life is like in the present without his difficult but beloved Maureen, we also discover what his married life has been like for decades and we witness his attempts to envision a future on his own. A couple's entire life together, a man's past, present, and future, all in only 50+ pages. Miraculous! \\"Collies\\" stands on its own as a wonderfully complete read, well worth the time invested in it.I don't know if Glass's original conception of the book were a three part novel or if she decided to extend the opening successful novella, but the remainder of the book suffers by comparison. There are a number of small clever touches to link all three stories together, but the links at times seem forced. The most interesting characters in \\"Three Junes\\" are the McLeods Senior, Paul and Maureen, older people on the verge of being senior citizens, a demographic whose stories are often ignored in contemporary fiction or made the subject of satire. Here Glass treats them with respect and restraint, and they are worth getting to know. Unfortunately, they do not appear in the rest of the book. Other reviewers have admired the long central section, the story of Fenno McLeod, the eldest of three sons, but his story is a fairly familiar one, however well told. The final section of the novel brings some of the earlier characters together and moves along rather briskly, but feels much less substantial.Perhaps the weakest aspect of this book is its unbalanced structure. The disproportionately lengthy middle section is actually longer than the other two sections combined; by itself, it could well be a complete novel. So one is left wondering why \\"three Junes\\" rather than just one (the first one)?Glass is an accomplished writer. The book is, on the whole, less than the sum of its parts, but it is worth reading, particularly its opening section. I remain perplexed, however, as to what recommended this book to the award panel. I can't imagine reading it again or urging others to pick it up."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"\\"Three Junes\\" is a trilogy of sorts, with its distinct parts set in 1989, 1995, and 1999. Each section could be read on its own (and, in fact, the first, \\"Collies,\\" won an award for best novella in 1999), but, taken as a whole, they encompass a multifaceted portrait of Fenno McLeod, his family, and his friends.Told from the third person, \\"Collies\\" serves as a prologue and introduces us to the three sons of Paul McLeod, who travels through the Greek islands and reminisces about the poignant family reunion in Scotland effected by his wife's death. The second part, \\"Upright,\\" takes up most of the book. Fenno is the narrator, skipping back and forth between his father's funeral and his expatriate life in Manhattan, where he befriends the catty and urbane Malachy Burns, manages a bookstore in Greenwich Village, and has a unexpected dalliance with a photographer named Tony. Fenno's reserved relationship with his two brothers mirrors his tense friendship with Mal, who, dying of AIDS, maintains his own dignity and an admirable drollness that challenges both his mother's intrusive (yet occasionally endearing) rectitude and Fenno's \\"constipatedly humorless\\" aloofness.Drastically shifting perspective once again, the final section, \\"Boys,\\" is a fitting epilogue seen through the eyes of Fern, whose getaway with Tony in the Hamptons is unexpectedly augmented with a visit by Fenno and one of his brothers.The change in perspective, dramatis personae, and even tone between each section is certainly peculiar and seems to puzzle some readers; the character of Fern especially resembles a late arrival crashing a family gathering that's almost over. In an interview for Bookbrowse (an online magazine), Glass described her book as \\"a triptych--that is, a strong central image flanked by two narrower, more modest images,\\" and she compared her novel to a medieval altarpiece in which a \\"central panel--be it a picture of the annunciation, the crucifixion, or a martyrdom--is flanked by panels depicting portraits of the altarpiece donors.... Here was Fenno's large, rich story at the center, told directly to the reader, with Paul and Fern portrayed in intimate detail to left and right but seen from the side.\\"For me, it works. And Glass's tri-fold \\"painting\\" is enhanced both by the enviously discerning empathy for her characters and, above all, by a genius for infusing wit and warmth into the decidedly melancholy core of her tale. Fenno and his brothers, Mal and his mother, and even the latecomer Fern are characters I won't soon forget."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"This book isn't my standard cup of tea, but the reviews were so universally good, I decided to give it a try. It was wonderfully well worth the time. This is not a book you can idly pick up and scan for a while, then return to it as time allows. It is a well-told family story with personal intrigues and family secrets, none of which are so outlandish that we don't have a few of them littering our own closets. Because she needs for us to know the Scottish McLeod family well in order to propel the story along, Julia Glass takes a lot of time and pages to get us acquainted. For the reader who requires action to move a story along, this is a bit of a test, because it is the unfolding of the characters themselves that moves the story along, beautifully, heartbreakingly. It is easy to become impatient with Fenno, our main character and mini-hero, because he seems so paralyzed by his life, but read on and you will come to appreciate the many fine qualities of his character and those of his well-meaning family. I felt very satisfied upon finishing this - and ready for a trip to Greece (subplot)!"},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"\\"Three Junes\\" is elegantly written and highly entertaining, though its compelling plot is difficult to describe succinctly. It's partly a family saga (the story of three generations of the Scottish McLeods), but it's also an elegiac story of New Yorkers in the era of AIDS and a hopeful meditation on impending motherhood by a 30-something single widow. The book is both heartbreaking and hopeful; it's about the fragility of life, whether it is extinguished in a single act of terrorist madness or by the modern plague of AIDS or cancer. \\"Three Junes\\" is filled with articulate, civilized characters--witty, intelligent sophisticates--who must face the inevitabilities of life--birth, love, and, of course, death. (Those elemental themes, I think, give the novel a remarkable urgency, helped along with a great deal of narrative skill; it's a literary page-turner.) These people face life, for the most part, with grace and dignity and decency; virtually all of them are compelling, vividly sketched and fully realized. And the scenes that propel the reader forward are incredibly well delineated, from an emotionally draining funeral to an impromptu dinner party in Amagansett&#65533;the narrative momentum is intense. An interesting subtheme concerns the world of pets--collies and a spectacular parrot--and how their life cycles mirror (and sometimes transcend) those of their human counterparts. The writing is lyrical, painterly and often poetic, but never narcissistically so. This novel is a real accomplishment--difficult to fathom that it's a first novel--and should be very engaging to anyone interested in contemporary fiction."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"I read this book almost all in one sitting and it's not an easy read. I was very impressed by the quality of the writing and I didn't want to put the book down. I was particularly impressed by Glass's ability to write convincingly from a male point of view. But I found the last third of the book the least interesting, and the second section too long. I think Glass has some fascinating characters here--but the McLeod characters deserved more room. I also thought the flashbacks worked against the power of the story and I think the story would have worked better if told chonologically. I also thought the character of Mal became a gay stereotype and I cringed when he told Fenno to \\"live\\" like a character out of Auntie Mame. Mal's mother also borders on a stereotype. I'm sorry to be this critical--there is much I admired in this book, particularly the sections in Scotland, and Fenno's relationship with his family. There just should have been some more editing. For instance, the character of Veronique who we're told over and over again is unlikeable has too much weight in this book. And although I liked Fern and Fenno meeting, I found Fern's story pretty boring. I'd still recommend this book, though, and as I said, I read the book almost entirely in one sitting, which means it grabbed me despite its flaws."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"Three Junes is a lovely read, one that begins strongly and only gets better. The story concerns a Scottish family and begins in June 1989. Paul McLeod, recently widowed, takes a tour to Greece, contemplating his future, his past, his family. Jump ahead six years and we are in Scotland, where Paul's three sons are preparing for his funeral. Jump again four years, to Eastern Long Island, a weekend get together with two of Paul's sons and Fern, a woman Paul met on his trip to Greece. It is hard to do justice to this novel in a few pithy sentences. The writing is beautiful and Glass gives us characters we can care about deeply. Their lives are complicated, but without any melodrama or pyrotechnics. Her writing is simply beautiful and I believe gets stronger as the novel progresses. I thoroughly enjoyed this beautiful novel and highly recommend it. Enjoy."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book, and was surprised to see all of the low ratings for what I felt was a truly beautiful piece of literature. I decided to read through all of the lower ratings to see what people disliked about the book. The primary negative complaints were as follows:1) Boring - no action2) The characters are unlikeable2) Disconnected - no cohesion between parts3) Gay sex sceneHere are my rebuttals:1) This is not an action book. Not a murder mystery. But it's not a book where nothing happens. A lot happens. You have to calibrate your sense of action to include subtler events.2) Like most people in real life, the characters have multiple dimensions and are sometimes unlikeable. People who prefer the good vs. evil two-dimensional type of characters will not appreciate the growth and nuances of these characters. I loved them. Not because they were perfect but because of their imperfections, because that makes them relatable.3) The sections are connected. You have to pay attention to the names of the characters but it's not difficult to make the ties between the three parts. I don't mean to offend anyone who didn't realize who the characters were in the 3 transitions, but most people shouldn't have this problem.4) Someone complained that they threw the book down and recycled it because of an explicit gay sex scene. I honestly don't remember anything resembling explicit in the discussion of gay sex. It's unflinching in other aspects, such as how the AIDS epidemic affected some of the characters. But those who claim this is a book about gays and AIDS are missing the point. It's about people. Sure, some of them are gay. But just as many are not.Anyway, as with many things in life, expectations can make or break your experience with this book. So if you can get past the items mentioned above, then you have a decent chance of enjoying the book."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"I chose this book because I try to read all of the National Book Award winners, and I was a little surprised by its plodding, detailed format, but not disappointed. _Three Junes_ is split into three sections, and Fenno, the main character, plays a part in each one. The first section, &quot;Collies,&quot; focuses on Fenno's father in Scotland and Greece; the second section, &quot;Upright&quot; is about Fenno's life in New York City (the bookstore he owns and the man he falls in love with); and the third section, &quot;Boys,&quot; focuses on a woman whom Fenno's father met in Greece and now is meeting Fenno's accquaintance in New York as well. It is a little difficult to shift gears between the sections, but they are connected by thin strings of coincidence and fate, actions and reactions, so ultimately the reader can get comfortable again. Glass deals with some difficult subjects including infidelity, AIDS, and infertility with remarkable smoothness, and makes you really feel the characters' guilt, love, and confusion, as well as hope. It is hope, I think, that permeates the novel most of all. My only criticism is that I felt there were one or two minor subplots that weren't tied up sufficiently, and there also weren't too many ups and downs but just a slow crescendo of choices and misunderstandings. On the whole, however, this is a very rewarding book, and well worth the time it takes to get to know the characters and their environments."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"For the second year in a row, the criteria for winning the National Book Award seems to consist of novels with pretentious and verbose writing, unlikable characters, and a condensation of other (and better) books. Three Junes lives up to these criteria in spades. As a very voracious reader I rarely spend more than a week or two with a book - it took me over eight months to plow through this muddy mess of a book.In a novel without a story or plot line, one expects that there may be some serious character study or some insightful gleanings about life as we know it. Unfortunately, Glass has done a mediocre, at best, job of creating such a book. Her characters (including her heroes Paul, Fenno, and Fern) are shallow, cold, unlikable, self-absorbed and completely underdeveloped. The novel's three barely connected sections just graze over the surface of an insight about the continuation of life and perpetuation of love and friendship despite, or maybe because of, the passing of those closest to us.Overall Three Junes is a disappointing read covering topics and characters that were better written elsewhere. For an endearing bookshop clerk read Parnassas on Wheels by Christopher Morley. For a great book about gay relationships, AIDS, and fathering another's child, read A Home At the End of the World by Michael Cunningham."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"Apparently Julia Glass waited until middle age before writing Three Junes, and the book exemplifies the kind of wisdom that would simply be lacking in a younger writer. It is an elegantly structured novel primarliy about people dealing with grief and loss. Divided into three sections, like a triptych, Glass manages to simultaneously make each stand on its own as a complete work of fiction but also bring all three together in a way that makes the whole exceed the sum of its parts. And as a gay reader, it is refreshing to read about Greenwich Village queens who exist primarliy outside the cliches of a gay ghetto. My only reservation is that the emotional climax of the book comes too early--at the end of the middle section--with much of the final section feeling like denouement. Still, the final section is not at all boring because the characters, especially Fenno, are by that point so compelling. If your looking for a book with a great plot, you probalby will be bored by Three June, but if you're interested in a book that will provide you with some truths about you own life, then I suggest you check it out. It's well worthy of its National Book Award."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"The National Book Award judges must like books about families. This year's winner, \\"Three Junes\\", a three-part novel held together by a couple of casual common character threads, isn't a million miles from the subject of last year's winner (Jonathan Franzen's \\"The Corrections\\"). Both make the event of homecoming - a parents' funeral in \\"Three Junes\\" and Christmas in \\"The Corrections\\" - the flashpoint for the subtle outbreak of sibling hostilities and the restoration of calm via an uneasy truce that comes with the recognition that family love binds us all.\\"Three Junes\\" is a linearly constructed three novella whose centre and emotional core lies clearly in the middle story. Nevertheless, the opening vignette about the recently widowered father's escape to Greece to deal with his bereavement is both poignant and heartbreaking in conveying the deep sense of longing experienced by Paul McLeod for the missing intimacy with his late wife, Maureen, an independent and feisty woman whose life seemed to have been tied up more with her beloved collies than with her family. In his travels, Paul strikes up a casual acquaintance with a young woman, Fern, who will be written out of the script only to make a mysterious reappearance as the central character in the concluding episode of \\"Three Junes\\".In the middle and most substantial story, Paul's three grown up sons, Fenno, and twins David and Dennis and their wives Lilian and Veronique, return home for their father's funeral. At the same time, another story emerges in parallel, that of an earlier homecoming when the boys visit the family home to spend time with their dying mother and to subsequently attend to her funeral. It pans out that nothing is quite what they seem on the surface. The cerebral and intellectual Fenno is most like Dad but sides with Mum. Subconsciously, he admires her fiercely independent streak. Who can blame him, when he has the privacy of his secret gay lifestyle in New York to protect ? Music critic and bosom pal, Mal, is mistaken by the family for Fenno's lover while secret lover Tony remains invisible to all but Fenno. The ever pragmatic David - his mother's son - thinks he knows something from the past about Mum that may haunt them.....but does he, really ? As it turns out, his life isn't nearly as perfect as it seems. Even Veronique, Dennis' French wife, shows she isn't quite the shrew we all came to expect. Ultimately, the McLeods don't let the half-truths, secrets and lies that permeate their lives to destroy them. They overcome the odds to show each other the meaning of love. It is in this middle story that Glass impresses most with her strong characterisation and her gorgeously written and luminous prose that speaks straight to the heart. If she had ended with this middle story, \\"Three Junes\\" would have been an unconditional triumph.Sadly, she didn't and lost her way in the concluding episode, which feels dramatically out of place, flat, and unsatisfying. Why would anyone be interested in Fern so late in the day ? She is after all a long forgotten minor character from the opening story. Had Glass stayed with Fenno, she would have had a more convincing wrap up.\\"Three Junes\\" is a flawed but smashing debut from Julia Glass. It is gorgeously written, emotionally resonant and one of the most delightful reads this season. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"Because I found the review above written by reader \\"Kathleen\\" to be so terribly inaccurate, I feel I must respond to encourage all those interested in a genuinely brilliant literary experience to read this book. Although I found the first section of this book to be phenomenal, the second section (which focuses on the trials and inner struggles of a gay man) to be equally if not more compelling. When recommending a book, one must be careful not to let one's personal biases form the basis of one's opinion. \\"Kathleen\\" did not find the second part of the novel to be compelling. Perhaps that is because of her personal discomfort with the character? This section is truly enlightening-- it is poetic in its brilliance. And, though I confess moments of discomfort myself, is that not the true mark of learning?"},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"I never reread books; there's simply too many new and interesting things to warrant going back over ground already covered. But I make an exception for \\"Three Junes.\\" I have read it three times and I have a plan to go back to it every other summer, as a special treat for my summer vacation. The year after I got it I gave it as a Christmas present to everyone in my family who I thought could remotely connect with this. Glass makes Fenno and Mal as real as any characters I have ever encountered in literature. You will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"In \\"Three Junes\\", Glass explores the intricacies of relationships among family, friends and lovers. Paul is the patriarch of the McLeod family, a Scottish clan consisting of three sons; Fenno, the eldest, and twins Dennis and David. The story begins in Greece where Paul is vacationing after the death of his wife. Through shifting scenes and flashbacks, Glass reveals the lives of her characters and their relationship to each other with meticulous detail and artistry. Fenno leaves Scotland after college and settles in New York where he tries to negotiate life and relationships during the AIDS crisis of the eighties. While in New York, Fenno befriends a host of people who teach him about love and loss in ways quite unlike the detached manner he's experienced in his family. After Paul dies, the brothers gather in Scotland for his funeral. During their time in Scotland, the brothers learn how each of their lives was shaped by their parent's relationship. In this section of the novel, Glass does a superb job of depicting how siblings raised in the same household by the same parents can have vastly different experiences.In addition to the storyline that explores the McLeod family relationships, are the storylines that examine relationships of the non-familial sort; the love with which Fenno cares for a dying friend and his pets. The love of life as expressed by Tony who finds it easier to love life and freedom than commit to the day-to-day challenges of loving people.\\"Three Junes\\" was an enjoyable read overall although at time it moved a bit slowly for my liking. Glass's writing and imaginative abilities are on point. Each character, no matter how minimal, is flushed out in sufficient detail to make him/her real and endearing. The story is a complex and layered study in love - its hardships and rewards. My favorite line from the novel: \\"Mind what you love. For that matter, mind how you are loved.\\" The novel was well worth the time spent reading it."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"I just finished this book this morning and felt compelled to write a quck review. For some reason, it took me a little bit to &quot;get into&quot; this one but once I did, I could not put it down. It is very well-written and I am sad that it is over. I really enjoyed the characters, especially Fenno and even Fern, and it left me hungry for more...I want to know what happened when Fern told Stavros about the baby...I want to know if she ever realizes that she met Fenno's Dad on her trip to Greece...I want to know about Fenno's relationship with the twins. But despite my longing for more of this story, I am happy to have had the oprtunity to &quot;know&quot; these characters and I can highly reccommend this book."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"Despite a slow beginning (I almost put the book down since the first few pages seemed trite), the Three Junes is an inventive and compelling look at a Scottish family - their loves, their losses, their miscommunications, and some of their hidden secrets. The author, Julia Glass, writes beautifully and draws you into wanting to know and understand the MacLeods better. Although as a reader, you are only invited in to visit the family in the month of June.Fenno MacLeod is the main character that Julia Glass uses to reveal many of the family dynamics. Fenno leaves his Scottish roots behind and moves to New York in search of a different life. By staying in New York, he believes he can hide his homosexuality from his family and even himself. A tight-lipped, traditional Scottish family does not discuss such family issues - and for that matter, avoids conflict at almost any cost. Plus, Fenno does not want to take over and manage the family business. By living across the ocean, he knows that he won't give in to his father's wishes.Julia Glass creates a lifelike story about an everyday family and vividly captures the inter-generational changes. Glass explores how the family endures and deals with death, how much the MacLeods love and value each member of their family just as they are, and how the family will evolve as they marry and begin raising their own children. It is through these experiences with life that Fenno comes to terms with his quiet nature, his sexuality, and, of course, his family."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"Three Junes is this year's National Book Award winner for good reason. Julia Glass has that rare gift for gracefully interweaving the lives of her characters and effortlessly bouncing back and forth between different places and periods in time. She also draws her characters full of life, emotion, and humanity. This novel is an excellent portrait of the modern family. Each member leads his own life in its own unique direction, and yet what they have in common ultimately proves stronger than their differences or the distance that separates them. Fenno is one of the most charming characters I've come across in modern literature recently. Funny and kind, insecure and self-deprecating, sensitive and compassionate, he is loveable for both his strengths and his flaws. This is excellent writing."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"This novel weaves a tale of very complicated characters. It was difficult to feel sympathy for Maureen's illness once shown her brutal cruelty in a scene involving puppies she labeled 'Mongols'. Yet she's perfectly adapted to accepting the fact that one of her sons is gay and her conventional husband, Paul, struggles with his stew of turmoiled emotions concerning Fenno's homosexual lifestyle. At times, the father seems spineless and distant while the mother appears callous and obsessive over her collies. But the reader is quickly shown that the characters of this novel are much 'deeper' than these surface observations.Though at times it is difficult to read on as several of the characters battle with reality of death, often at a young age, one will come away from this book with a richer sense of understanding how family relationships influence our entire lives.Chrissy K. McVayauthor of 'Souls of the North Wind'"},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"I loved this from the first sentence to the last. I actually tried to take my time reading it because I knew when it ended, I'd be sad. I enjoyed the author's writing style and lush descriptions of the three locations of the separate sections. I liked how she took her time unfolding the characters and how pieces from each fell into place with information gleaned from a different person's section. I enjoyed the first and last sections, but it was the second (and longest) that focuses on Fenno that captured me. I deeply love Fenno, and was thrilled he popped up as a minor character in her next otherwise-unrelated novel. I was so emotionally invested in this book that I actually cried real, hardcore tears when it ended, which is a bit more melodramatic a reaction than I normally have at the end of a good book. I didn't find myself obsessing over getting questions answered or having bits fall perfectly into place. I was content to be swept along wherever it went. The author writes beautifully, and her characters are vivid. If that sounds like your cup of tea, please give this one a try as I think it's one of the best. If you're more into heavy plot or fast moving action and a tidy wrap up at the end, skip it because it doesn't match that criteria."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"I had the rather strange experience of reading this book AFTER Glass's newest offering (\\"The Whole World Over\\"), and so was delighted to see some characters, notably the ultra complicated tortured soul Fenno, again.Because I knew that Fenno, who is the epitome of a dour Scotsman in Three Junes, had mellowed, I had more patience with him than maybe I would have had. I never really liked him in this book, but was that the point? This brilliant collection of interwoven vignettes had me spellbound throughout. I loved the tapesty of the written word. I loved the visual pictures the words evoked. I loved moving from Greece to Scotland to New York and back again through different sets of time.In short, I loved everything about this book, and I am so glad I discovered Julia Glass, to to me, if a quintessential writer."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"I found it impossible to put this novel down (and dreaded its looming conclusion). The writing is so beautiful, the characters are completely unique but real. A novel hasn't made me cry in a long time, but this one did... It petered out a bit in the final chapter, but the overall experience far outweighed the conclusion. In all, a fantastic read."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"One of the best books I have read in a long time. It holds your interest in so many ways, but especially by changing point of view and voice and tense. Can't wait for her next one to come out."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"Whatever the draw for this book was, I missed it. I know it got awards and great reviews, but I couldn't find the wonderful.

The book paints rich portraits of people and the world around them."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"I loved this book from the beginning to the end. Characters were so richly drawn, plots intriguing, and writing stellar. Recommend to anyone who wants an engrossing novel that is a pleasure to read."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"The book was a compelling read but I didn't think that the characters had distinct enough voices. The author described their emotions or lack of them well enough, but I wasn't all that moved."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"A good solid read - but not the best. I found several of the characters to be annoying, at best. But, I was still interested until the end."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"Sometime ago I read my Sunday paper and noted that \\"Three Junes\\" was listed as a popular book choice. The title sounded interesting so I bought it. That was 2 months ago and I am still trying to get through the paperback edition. It is difficult to follow the timeline, to understand the characters and where they fit, and to get involved in the storyline. I will finish the book because that's my style. It has not been a book that I could not wait to get back to."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"The book is divided into three parts, each following the life of a different character, but all three characters are connected in one way or another. Personally, the first and third parts weren't too terribly interesting to me. But the second part was rivetting, I sped through it, I never wanted to put it down. Read it simply so you can read that, it'll be worth it."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"I'm sure that Julia Glass has a real talent and decriptive ability, but for the average person, this was a complicated, hard to follow epic. I found it disjointed and felt as though I was left hanging at the end. It was a very unfulfilling conclusion.I do feel that Ms. Glass's decriptions were brilliant and feel as though I can picture all that she wrote about it.Good luck to all who attempt this novel. It was not well received in our ten person Book Club."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"I just didn't care about any of these characters and found many of them to be literary cliches (especially Fenno and Mal). A previous reviewer compared Three Junes to something Maeve Binchy might write. True, but she would've done a better job."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"This book is so &quot;flat&quot;. It lacks characterization. I should have put it down after she drowned the puppy. The first 2 sections are centered around funerals with flashbacks that do not offer any insight. I am not sure if I will get through the third section. This book sounds like it was written by a high school English student. It lacks depth. It is such a disappointment. Perhaps if it had a better description on the book I wouldn't have bought it. I feel I was mislead into this purchase."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"I read only to page 102, but could not finish this dreary book. While I do think the author is talented, I simply don't care about her characters - especially the cold, unfeeling mother who breeds dogs then cavalierly drowns the \\"imperfect ones\\" in her kitchen sink, her complicit husband passing through the room, casually commenting on the murders like he's talking about the what's for dinner. Yes, I know that in real life there are people who run puppy mills and probably do this routinely - however, I do not care to waste my time reading about them. Sickening!!"},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"This book was picked by my book club. The first 50 pages skipped timelines so much it lost me at times and just when you started to get interested it switched again and again and again. It finally stayed more on one timeline but was so boring I was falling asleep. I finally gave up halfway through. This is the first book club book I didn't finish. Got a call from another book club member and she only lasted to page 20. I don't understand the good reviews."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"\\"Mal flicked his eyebrows at me once, his only admission to the acute self-consciousness we all feel, regardless of age or station in life, when anyone meets our parents.\\"This is from Fenno, the narrator of the central, longest portion of Three Junes. It's false - such self-consciousness isn't something we all feel - and it's unworthy of someone who seems to be in his forties. I have no doubt that Julia Glass knows this; I think the passage is there to show us Fenno's solipsism. I spent most of the book annoyed at its main character. Fenno redeems himself in the third and final section, but that's fewer than 100 pages, of more than 350.It never occurred to me to stop reading, though; I barely thought to take a break. This immature, self-centered man compelled me onward. He isn't thoughtful enough to care about others on their terms, but I cared about him on his. This is a wonderful book."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"I cant say much other then this book was so dull and boring....I was actually angry that I was spending my time reading it. I didnt smile...I didnt laugh...I didnt cry...it was so dry, dull and lifeless.....ugh. I was so anxious to get to the last chapter..maybe then FINALLY something would happen or perhaps a huge twist to bring the story together...but nope. Beginning was boring...middle boring...and the ending was even more boring."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"I felt that the author really explored three different people thoroughly."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"I found the characters and the story to be less than engaging. I was unable to grasp what the author was trying to communicate. It was very difficult to finish the novel because it simply did not hold my interest. The characters are not at all well developed and the story, itself was dated. I expected more from Julia Glass. Her novels are generally much better."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"I love reading, especially a first book. But this is one of the worst books I have ever, ever read. How did it ever get into print? Let alone win an Award! Amazing. No plot; lots of ends left hanging; sloppy grammar. Save your time and money."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"Not for me. This book got very low ratings in our book club. Glass has an agenda that I don't agree with. A very liberal view of life. Would not recommend."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"After reading all the glowing reviews on this book, I couldn't believe how bad it was. There are loose strings all over the place. The novel seems to be 3 short stories put together, but with no resolution on any of the significant issues that could tie everything together. The best characters are not well developed, although there are hints that these characters could have made up a compelling story. The main character, who is well drawn, is completely uninteresting with unclear motives.There is no denying that some of the writing is exceptional. But a novel commands that there be a plot and that it has characters that the reader will care about. Neither happened in my case. I only finished the book, because I kept hoping that something would happen and because I am reading the book for a book club. Fluff isn't enough.I would recommend this book to no one."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"Loved this book, one of the best reads I've ever experienced. Perfectly written, quite beautiful prose. Great characters, i wanted to know them all. I was bummed when it was finished I could have read about these people forever"},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"I really enjoyed Julia Glass' novel, The Three Junes. I enjoyed the intricacies of the interwoven nature of life and relationships. This novel does a wonderful job of weaving these complexities into an interesting story about families, both the ones we come from and the ones we choose. I liked the humanness of the characters and the curious misunderstandings about what has happened that we didn't even understand at the time. The way that people are capable of seeing only what they choose to and thinking they have the full knowing of the thing. This is a story that really explores people, their lives and how we know what we think we understand."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"One of the most beautifully written books I have read in many years! It's hard to believe this is Ms. Glass' first novel. This is not written for the masses -- like blockbuster films with lots of action and explosions to mask the fact that there is no depth or artistry involved. If you loved The Da Vince Code you will not like this book. However, if you enjoy books written with mastery of the English language and sensitivity to the human experience you will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"I thought this book was great and how anyone can call it flat is beyond me. This is the first novel I have read that tells about life from a gay man's perspective. Sometimes he seemed to be reluctantly gay but gay none the less. I was sympathetic to siblings that remembered things differently from their childhoods, almost like they lived with different families, as is the case with siblings. This story was so deep and the characters so involved and intertwined it was unbelievable. What a wonderful depth and ability this author showed."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"The three best books I have read in the past year are: Lucky Monkeys In The Sky by Michele Geraldi, The Five People You Meet In Heaven by Mitch Albom, and Three Junes by Julia Glass. Each book takes you deeper than ordinary run of the mill fiction. Each book has a real story to tell, a real meaning, an education, if you will. Each book celebrates family and individuality. Each book promises that orginality is the key to happiness, success and love. I am glad to find real authors such as these, authors who don't write for money, but simply want to tell their story instead. I will keep these novels for my children to read one day when they are old enough."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"This is my favorite of the last 3 months. The plot was dense enough to keep me thinking, and the characters well described, so that I really cared about what happened to them. The NYC JG. evokes is the real NYC I live in, and so I figure the Scotland must be accurate too. This is great writing."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"I started reading this book, but had a hard time getting into all the different characters and plot in this book. Skipping from here to there .... I found it was not easy to get through. Would not recommend it for light reading."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"I started reading this book about three weeks ago - I am usually done with a book by the end of the week....but this one is hard to get into!! I think that Julia Glass writes Three Junes with an amazing ability to paint a book with such artistic expressions! The &quot;painting&quot; however is confusing....the timetable is kind of all over the place, and it makes it hard to read the book, put it down, and then to pick it up and remember exactly what was going on... but I HAVE heard it IS worth reading, and I will write my final review when done with the book.....I thought that this might help other readers who are struggling to read what is a lovely novel!"},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"I admire the author's beautiful writing, especially the opening of the book, when Paul joins a group tour of the Greek Islands. From the second part on, I found the story difficult to follow. Fenno's switch-back-and-forth narration lost me a few times and I almost gave up. But I forced myself to stay on to the end. Not that I enjoyed the suffering, but I was curious--I wanted to be convinced. For a book to win the National Book Award, there must be a reason. I was disappointed."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"This book was recommended to me by a friend, who also loaned the book to me to read. I am fairly certian that I would not have purchased the book on my own, but I really enjoyed it, and was grateful to have a friend who did not underestimate my taste in books. At the beginning, not having read any reviews, I wondered where the title came from, since the book was not really about women or relationships among women. I finally realized that the JUNE refered to the calendar month, not a name.I thought that all of the characters -- the mothers, fathers, brothers, lovers, relationships, -- were real, complex and interesting. THREE JUNES is appropriately hailed as a \\"dazzling portrayal of family life,\\" but it isn't really an exciting book, but rather an insightful one. The characters really see and analyze and dissect the their lives and the events around them, and their thoughts give the book a beautiful substance.Although the families and connections are memorable, my favorite thing about the book is the language. Glass has a great way with words, which came through the most vividly in the middle \\"June' of the book, in which the character Fenno shares his story. (From another view, I could say that the other characters of the book served only to help me understand and appreciate Fenno. His \\"June\\" clearly stood out among the three.)The ending was thoroughly unsatisfactory, but I suppose that is what critics like. I wanted to know more about Fern as that point, I feel that I knew what happened to Fenno and to his father, but Fern's story was left dangling. I was really enjoying her story, and was disappointed not to have at least more clues as to how her situation played out."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"Engaging characters such as I would like to know better, though the format seemed a bit contrived for piecing together the sections, with the last portion making the least sense to me in terms of a good fit. But I was intrigued by Fenno, and rather liked Mal's razor wit and assertiveness. It's a fair portrayal of how our lives are tethered to others by mere threads. Plus, there's a lovely bookstore, and a type of unrequited love, and a sense of how blue life can seem at times."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"This was the 2002 National Book Award winner. It is told in three parts ranging from 1989 to 1999. Not surprisingly, the three parts each take place in June of different years hence the name of the novel. The second section makes up the core and largest section of the book and the first and third parts fittingly serve as an introduction and conclusion.This is a novel about characters and about family and friends. It is very character based and I think Glass does a wonderful job at creating deep and interesting characters. Some of the one star reviews on Amazon noted that the characters were one dimensional cutouts. I couldn't disagree more. The characters are the strength.The plot centers around a Scottish family headed by Paul and Maureen McLeod. Their three sons are Fenno,the most main character, who lives in New York. The twins David and Dennis are a vet and chef living in Scotland and France respectively. They run through family crises, death, disease and betrayal. Again, I think Glass does a wonderful job at character development.The novel is structured very much by cutting back and forth through time. She goes from past to present and back quite often. These transitions are very smooth and coherent which is not an easy thing to do.Fenno, the eldest son who is gay is the main character. The 2nd section is told completely from his perspective. He is a complex character who I neither liked nor disliked. He neither hides nor flaunts his sexuality with his family and he searches for his place in the world.I've talked about the positives but there are some negatives.The story has wonderful moments but does become tedious at times. The large middle section drifted in and out for me. Every scene with Fenno's friend Malachy Burns is interesting. Fenno's non-Malachy sections drag on a bit and my interest waned as the section progressed.I saw some great things in this book but was disappointed by the tedious periods that went on for too long.I recommend Three Junes but it has some issues."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"Like a travelogue full of detailed descriptions of places, this novel will take you on location with characters that seem very real."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"Three Junes might resonate well with those who enjoyed The Hours. Like The Hours, Three Junes is divided into multiple story lines and times, which ultimately all connect. Unfortunately the weight of extraneous characters deterred from the few well developed and multi-dimensional characters, such as Fenno and Mal. Ms. Glass's novel would benefit from some editing, even cutting it down to a novella focussing on Fenno and his life post-Scotland. I admired the attempt at creating a rich theme of motherhood, but it was underdeveloped and non-contributitive, better suited to a separate story."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"Three Junes is a novel written in three sections, covering the three summers in the life of a Scottish family, where significant events are displayed over a ten year period.In the First part entitled COLLIES, we are transported to Greece where the elder Paul McLeod a newpaper publisher is mentally recuperating after his wife's death and where, in his lonliness he meets Fern an American artist whom he is somewhat attracted to.In the second section entitled UPRIGHT, which is my favourite section, we are given an in-depth look at he McLeod family and this is narrated by Fenno one of the sons who is gay and runs a bookstore in Manhattan. The other sons Dennis who David who are happily married, one living in the family home of Tealing where he does his veterinary work and the other lives in France with his wife Veronique.Glass showcases the lives of this family as they come for their father's family in Tealing Scotland. This section was very arresting to my mind which I consider the nucleus and focal point of the entire book. Joy and tears reign looking back at the old times and reminiscing about the past lives of their lost parents, friends they used to know. There is a lot of compassion here too causing you to start rallying around this family who sometimes does not know if they are going or coming, but they are lovable nevertheless. Featured in the book too are quite a lot of Fenno friends all artist in their own right.......photographers, music reviewers, writers, book lovers and the beat goes on.In the third section entitled BOYS, this is the shortest section yet and this is when Fenno meets Fern, his father's former lover in long island.This is a wonderful contemporary novel to be savoured and not rushed through. If you have a partiality for the arts and travel, please read this book or make it a wonderful gift for a friend. It was much more than I expected and I am a lot richer for having read it.It deserved a wonderful five stars for this first novelist. Thank you Julia Glass."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"Part Two is long with tiring flashbacks back in time. The story drags and I longed to see some warmth in the characters. The cold and selfish characters did not capture my attention. Some clever and witty writing kept me reading but it was slow going."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"I read this book because it was highly recommended. After the first 59 pages I was not happy, but I kept going. The middle 200 pages were wonderful - I felt a kinship with Fenno and suffered along with this repressed man. Then there was the third part, which left mew confused (why Fern?) and unsatisfied (I thought books needed closure? - but maybe life isn't wrapped up in neat packages. Not to sound pompous, but Ms Glass might benefit from a little refresher course in plot-making. I was convinced that something would happen at the end to wrap the book up. Nevertheless this is a fine book and worth reading."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"I read this book in a very relaxed setting on the porch of a vacation cabin overlooking a lake....so I had no distractions other than time passing!

Still, it's a really good read for the intelligent reader who enjoys an interesting story woven well. Bravo."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"What a wonderful book. These are characters that you know in your life.

This is one of those books you finish wishing it could have lasted longer. (Don't listen to the negative reviews--the readers must have eaten some bad haggis sometime.) I didn't give it five stars because I did get slightly confused in the second part where I had trouble figuring out who was where when (read it to see what I mean). But that is a minor complaint, really. Just enjoy!"},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"Very ok. I just don't understand what all the hoopla is about.The story was just interesting enough to keep me reading, but barely. None of the charactars were well developed or likeable enough to make me care what happened to them. The Fenno charactar was ok, but the story really didn't let you get into his head. Just when you were starting to get interested, the book would switch directions. This book was recommended to me by several people, but obviously they don't read many books."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"I had heard how wonderful this books was, but I found it slow, boring, and the writer jumps around from past to present so often, that I found myself not even knowing who the characters were - I had to stop and either think about who the character was or actually go back through previous pages to refresh my memory as to who they were. To be quite honest, I so loathed the way this book was written that I didn't even bother finishing it. If a book doesn't pique my interest in 50 pages, then it isn't worth my time to finish. This book DEFINITELY was not worth my time."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"I really have been trying but I am now halfway through the book and still completely uninterested.

How it won the award is beyond me. I didn't even finish it because the third story with the young girl( I don't even remember her name) wasn't compelling. I didn't find the writing as good as many other reviewers did. And much that happened seemed improbable. With so many great novels being written I hope we can award the very best."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"At first, I was drawn into Ms Glass's luscious narrative and couldn't wait to get back to it. By the middle of the book I became irritated with Fenno's negative narration. Mal was unrelentingly angry. I was relieved when that section ended, then the third narrative about Fern didn't round out the book in a satisfying way. Why the hell doesn't Lillian ask Dennis for his sperm-did I miss something? Dennis seems much more obliging and besides, he's her husband's twin. Why wasn't the connection illucidated between Fern and Paul? You don't have to be obvious and heavy handed, but obtuse seems worse."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"With so many excellent reviews, I thought this book would be a slam-dunk. Unfortunately, the story wasn't even compelling enough to finish.I agree with another Reviewer who was not able to get involved with the characters or care anough to see how the story ended (even trapped on an airplane for 3 hours). I felt no compassion for any character, and kept hoping some event would draw me in. So many deaths should have been interesting enough to keep me reading, but the author was so detached from the characters that I really couldn't find my way to caring.It was just too dull and cold of a book for my taste."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"I did finish this book because someone recommended it. I never did get what was the author's purpose for this story. I found it full of superfluous ramblings that had nothing to do with the story and caused my mind to stray so that when it came back to some relevant point, my mind was no longer engaged. I found it so frustrating to keep having to go back to figure out what mattered and what didn't matter. The author is a good writer but not a great writer. A great writer can do these sidebar ramblings adding richness to the story. This did not happen for me. I finished it and thought \\"what a waste of time\\". That said, I would give her another try because so many people seem to like her writing."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"This book is basically 3 separate short stories, yet there are characters from each story that are related in the previous stories, but yet not always explained how they were related. I kept thinking it would all come together in the end; yet it never did. At times it was entertaining, but in the end, I didn't get the point of the stories. They just seemed to ramble on, with no clear storyline. If I had to summarize the book: it's about a gay man, who moves away from his family in Scotland to live in America. He has poor choices in friends, and many of them die of AIDS. Oh, and his deceased mother was good at breeding Collies."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"audible.com audiobooks may or may not work. may or may not take longer than reading the book. tech dept keeps banking hours and has one phone line."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"I enjoyed the first part of the book but I was not prepared for the gay sex in the second part.

It took me three months to finish it (reluctantly), and I didn't understand nor did I like the \\"design\\" of this novel...three separate stories, the last of which didn't connect to the first (I was expecting it to all along).

Fenno, main character, was a tiresome (and tired) pseudo-intellectual without an once of umph or ambition to get himself out of his blah's. Also, why the blah's? Get off your self absorbed/self pittying [backside] and have a little fun - which is my take on all the main characters in this book. This book is a complete discredit to the National Book Award. Skip it and go on to something more insightful and less precious. It doesn't even deserve one star."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"This review is for the First Anchor Books paperback edition, May 2003, 353 pages. THREE JUNES, first published in 2003, was on the USA Today top 150 bestseller list for 49 weeks between May 2003 and July 2006, reaching a peak position of fourteen. It is Julia Glass's first novel, which won the 2002 National Book Award for fiction.THREE JUNES is a three part literary work about events involving the McLeod family that occurred in June 1989, June 1995 and June 1999.In June 1989, Paul McLeod, the protagonist, is vacationing in the Greek Isles with a small tour group. The narrative switches between Paul's sedate interactions with his tour companions and the back story of his life in Scotland with his recently deceased wife and their three sons.In part two, the McLeod clan is gathered at the family home in Scotland for Paul's wake. The protagonist is Fenno, Paul's eldest, gay son who lives in Greenich Village. Again, the story switches between the narrative present with Fenno, his twin brothers and their wives at the wake and their back stories, particularly Fenno's. Two minor characters from the first section reappear in part two, one of which becomes central to the story.The final section is set at a home in Long Island, which is under the care of Tony, a professional house-sitter. Tony is Fenno's long time friend and former lover. The occasion is a happenstance dinner gathering, which includes Tony's young lover for the night, Tony, Fenno, one of Fenno's brothers and the surprising protagonist for this section, Fern. Fern was in the tour group with Paul ten years earlier. With the reader knowing more about the dinner guests than they know about each other, it's an extraordinary gathering of characters."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"Julia Glass's Three Junes is a somewhat successful, somewhat disjointed narrative following a Scottish family through two generations, from their own perspective and from those of another whose life intertwines with theirs. The first part of the novel, 'Collies' is by far the strongest and describes how Paul both fell in love with and married Maureen and the aftermath of her death. The chronology, as others have noted, is slightly convoluted, but in this section it is much clearer than later in the novel. It is in these first few pages that I think Glass dazzled the National Book Award committee as her ability to subtley capture Paul's mourning as well as reveal a terrible secret really shows of her skills as an author; these skills, however, desert her in the other two parts of the novel. The second part of the novel is told in the first person through the eyes of Fenno, one of the three boys Paul and Maureen have. His story is by far the most interesting, but somewhat crudely done - the beautiful range of emotion that we experiences in the opening pages is replaced by something I still can't fully describe, other than say everything seems more clumsily done causing me to wonder why Glass even chose to continue her story, as the first part was published originally on its own. Fenno's role as caretaker to Mal, an opera and music critic often seems unbalanced. The final section finds us learning about some characters who we originally only see on the periphery of Fenno's narrative, who presumably are supposed to enhance our understanding of this family. Unfortunately, Glass seems to preoccupied with filling the pages with cliches about love and trying to leave the reader with some deeper understanding of live and relationships that she forgets to really finish her tale. I really do think she should have stopped the story after the first part.So why the 3 stars instead of 1 or none? The writing is beautiful. Glass has an eye for description and some of the details are so exquisite that even while becoming increasingly annoyed with the text, I couldn't help but still smile at some of the wonderful things she does. The description of the parrot is great and the dogs and their relationship to the family is wonderfully rendered. They are both object for rememberance and object of ownership.Overall, the book once again does not live up to its National Book Award as many others recently have not (seems like the Pulitzer and the Booker have a monopoly on awarding the quality books being written these days), but it's still a wonderful start for an author who I expect great things in the future."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"This book was recommended to me by the owner of our local bookstore. I hadn't heard anything, positive or negative, about it so I read it with no preconceived notions or biases. I agree with all the accolades the book has garnered. This is a well-paced, well-crafted family story that manages to be exotic and familiar all at the same time. It would be worth five stars if the loose end of Paul's (the first main character in the book) unresolved death were covered a bit more clearly. It's one of those books you wish went a little longer. Exceptional for a first novel."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"After finishing this book I was left with mixed emotions and thoughts. I was expecting a marvel of a book based on some of the reviews here; but found I related a bit more to those who were confused about why this book was so special. And let me say as an avid reader I have read many books I'd consider masterpieces- and I know they do not come in all one form. However, I felt whatever Julia Glass was trying to do when creating her \\"work of art\\", escaped me.The book is divided into 3 parts- 3 Junes. The first is a summer vacation that Fenno's dad- Paul- decides to take where he is with a group of travelers all trying to connect. He is reliving his past life- his marriage to his deceased wife, while also intrigued with his present situation and companions. These first 60 pages let me down the most, I had a hard time getting into the story and enjoying it.The second part of the book featured Paul's family- including the 3 sons- dealing with their parents deaths and the things going on in their own lives. Fenno, the eldest son is the centerpiece- as we see his life lived out through memories of his past and through the present. I found his relationships very interesting, but also lacking in really getting to know some of the characters- and understanding them. Towards the middle of this part the book picked up.The final part features Fern, a woman that Paul met on his travels and became fascenated with. We see her now as more of an individual and the things she has gone through in the years since she met Paul. In her present- she's become acquainted with Fenno. I found this part of the book the most interesting. I think it was because I finally felt like I was beginning to know some of the characters.Over-all, if I could go back, I don't think I'd bother to have read this book. While it had redeeming qualities, I don't think it fully outweighed the rest of the negatives- I felt some of the writing very sloppy. Also, I agree with the other reviewer that the ending leaves you short-changed. I will say though that there were some very poetic paragraphs included, several things that did make me think. I guess I'm half and half with this book!"},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"This book was chosen by my book discussion group this month simply because of the title. \\"It's June,\\" we figured, \\"so why not read Three Junes?\\"The book starts off well enough. The reader is introduced to Paul McLeod and his family in the first of three sections, almost novellas. Paul is on vacation to help him recover from grief over the death of his wife Maureen. The reader is told about their life together and their three sons, Fenno and twins Dennis and David, in a series of flashbacks. It's a simple domestic portrait and fairly well written.The second section, the longest and the best part of the book, is about Fenno, who has moved from the family's Scotland home to New York City. Fenno is gay and the section mostly deals with that aspect of his life. Fenno is taking care of his neighbor, Mal, who is dying of AIDS. I pleased at how well this part of the book is written. The last part of this section about Mal's death, is especially good.And then the bottom falls out. If the book had ended after Mal's death, Three Junes could be considered almost a great book. Instead, Ms. Glass writes about Fern, who was a minor and not likeable character in the first section. It's ten years after the first section. Fern and Fenno are staying at a friend's house, unaware of their connection through Paul, who is now deceased. The quality of the writing takes a nosedive here. Ms. Glass also reintroduces Fenno's brother, Dennis, who is totally unrecognizable. In fact, I first thought that Dennis in part 3 was a different character than Dennis in part 2 until he is specifically referred to Fenno's brother. Ms. Glass gives the reader all this detail about people that we don't even care about. I kept waiting for the parts about Fenno, who I really liked.It seems that Three Junes really has two endings, the end of the second section and the end of the third. The reader would be much more satisfied if he or she just stops reading after the second section.Whenever I read a book, I ask myself if this is a book that I would read again. I would read the second section of Three Junes again, but not the rest."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"I so wanted to enjoy this book and was doing so during the first novella, the story of Paul and Maureen. Julia Glass has a wonderful way with descriptive writing: I could feel the Greek sun and taste the ouzo. This, I believe is her strongest writing skill, but not enough to carry an entire book. The second and longest part of the novel centers on Paul and Maureen's son Fenno and those who enjoy this character probably will enjoy \\"Three Junes\\". Fenno was too embittered and distant for my taste. He misread almost everyone he was related to or allowed himself to become involved with - hard to root for the guy. By the third section he seems to have turned his life around a bit but because this section is not told from his point of view - but rather from the p.o.v. of a fairly minor character - it's hard to know.The book is divided into three sections - Three Junes - over a period of ten years. Within each section Glass uses flashbacks liberally so that the three sections fold back on each other. This technique is a tough one to pull off - Anne Tyler's \\"When We Were Grownups\\" and Guterson's \\"Snow Falling on Cedars\\" are brilliant examples. The constant playing with time in Three Junes became tedious for me. By the time we meet Fern again in the third section, we don't care about her past but we get it anyway: mother, father, siblings, dead husband, in-laws...all these people are trotted out, the reader knowing all the while that there's not enough of the book left to explore them. What about the McLeods??? I wanted to scream. Fenno might not be my favorite guy but at least I've spend all this time getting to know him and his family. I wanted to hear from them and find out from them what had happened over the past four years when we left them last.And poor Paul. Our charming guide during the first section, dead by the second, forgotten by the third. Marjorie showing up at his funeral with promises of letters to be sent to Fenno on her death...I thought at least I'd hear more from him by book's end. But no, Marjorie disappears as well. Even Paul's ashes seem to have evaporated somewhere. And we're left with the conclusion that Fern and Stavros have a shot at happy- ever-after. Who???? Well, if you haven't fallen asleep before the last 20 pages you'll know their story. But will you care?"},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"This book is dreadfully dull. So dull, in fact, that I actually felt angry when I finally reached the last page. Not only did I waste money buying this drivel, more importantly, I wasted several precious hours of my time that would have been better spent picking up dog doodoo in the backyard.The entire story, save Part III, is a collection of flashbacks and \\"current\\" events. It's like a tennis match. The reader's head is uncomfortably jerked side to side in an effort to keep track of the rocketing volleys between past and present. It wouldn't be so annoying if we could at least see an impressive overhead smash in the storyline once in a while. Unfortunately, little excitement is found during Julia Glass' emotionless depiction of the McLeod family and the events (or lack thereof) of three different summers.The Scottish patriarch, Paul McLeod, is a good man, reserved, a little sad, a little lonely (during his marriage as well as after his wife's death) and a lot boring. The mother is somewhat distant. She is not a traditional cookie-baking, over-involved mother. She breeds and sells dogs and is perhaps more dedicated to and affectionate with the dogs than with any member of her family. There are occasional references to her likely infidelities, but we never get the whole story. The mother could actually be quite interesting, but the author only allows us glimpses of her. Instead, she focuses on the eldest brother, Fenno, a reserved, lonely gay man living in NYC who is, what else, bloody boring! Afraid of the HIV/AIDS outbreak during the 80s, Fenno protects himself by avoiding promiscuous sex, effectively isolating himself from significant relationships. I was thrilled when the AIDS-stricken Mal, Fenno's friend and neighbor, finally commands him to LIVE! I thought, \\"Thank goodness! The author DOES realize how boring a character Fenno is. She's finally going to get things moving.\\" Alas. It is not to be.Fenno's younger twin brothers and their wives offer a bit of a distraction. Dennis' controlling French wife, Veronique, is entertaining while David and Lil's childless circumstance and proposed solution provide a much-needed rain shower in the otherwise endless expanse of dry desert. However, both distractions dry up and evaporate quickly, leaving the reader feeling cheated and still parched.The last \\"June\\" introduces a new character, Fern. Who is she? Where did she come from all of a sudden? Why should we care about her? Don't ask me. I haven't a clue. Yes, she does have a connection and forms a friendship with Fenno as they are both former lovers of Tony. In this last section of the book, Fern, Fenno, Dennis, Tony and Tony's current lover, Richard, are all staying together on a sort of holiday. Tony is a promiscuous, self-involved photographer who possesses few likable qualities. Why Fern and Fenno continue to hang around him and why Tony keeps them around is beyond me. Fern is recently widowed and now pregnant with her boyfriend's child, which he knows nothing about as he has been on an extended family visit to Greece. And this fits into the story about the McLeod family how? *shrug* Got me.Fenno continues to be shockingly uninteresting as does the conclusion of the book. Maybe I'm overly critical and simply didn't \\"get\\" the point of the story. I think I was supposed to gain all kinds of wise and subtle insight into the poignant beauty, misperceptions and melancholy that surrounds a family and the interwoven relationships within. Sadly, the only thing I got from the book is a whole lot of nothing. On the other hand, I definitely recommend this book as it is a most effective sleep aid."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"Of course, fiction is fiction. But as I read this book, I was often struck by the feeling that these characters just did not exist in the real world. They felt made up and I was very aware of this throughout much of this book, especially in the second and third section. The first section which deals with Paul McLeod, the patriarch, is as wonderful as the rest of the book is flat. It's lilting and spirited and engaging and I thought I was in for a real treat. Somehow this character came brilliantly alive and I was sorry to let him go so soon. The second section narrated by Fenno, the gay son, seemed like a cliche. He was described as a great reader and an intellectual, but his dialogue did not display this. Plus, he was never observed reading or discussing even one book. When the brothers got together in Scotland, it seemed too fussy - more like the way sisters would get together than brothers. I just didn't believe it. The twin brother's wives did not seem like women who would marry either of them - a gorgeous, sophisticated French woman marrying a wayward pothead (who later got his act together) and a sexy, free-spirited hippie marrying a conservative, boring stiff just didn't hold true. Much of the dialog seemed written, not real. Often, it was corny and filled with platitudes which seemed more suited for a greeting card. Despite all of these criticisms, I found the book to be an easy, somewhat enjoyable read. The last section, however, really lagged and seemed unnecessary. Why was Fern, who had met the father in the first section, brought back to befriend Fenno, when the original connection was never established? I guess we're left to assume that when Fern accepts Fenno's dinner invitation, she'll see that drawing the father had left him when he died. Three Junes is not worthy of any award, much less the ones it's received."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"Julia Glass' \\"Three Junes\\" is less a novel than a set of three loosely connected novellas telling the story of the McLeod family--newspaper publisher Paul; his wife, Maureen, breeder of champion border collies; and their sons--bookstore owner Fenno, veterinarian David, and chef Dennis. You could call it a family saga, except that Glass sternly resists all temptations to give in to the overworked conventions of that genre.As the title indicates, the novellas tell the stories of various McLeod family members on three separate Junes: 1989, in Greece; 1995, in New York and at the family home in Scotland; and 1999; at the Long Island seashore. All three stories deal strongly with bereavement--dealing not only with the grief of loss, but also with the complicated situations the dead have left behind. Characters outside the family recur from story to story, but not in any Dickensian or O. Henry sort of way--indeed, the characters don't always even realize the connections. Glass is a master of descriptive prose, always finding the right detail to bring a scene to life. She's also a master at creating character, her brainchildren complicated and believably contradictory, never reducible to a few traits. I'm still not certain what I think of most of the characters--which, I believe, is why so many reviewers on this Web site have reacted so strongly against the book. \\"Three Junes\\" never tells us what to think of the characters, and never envelops us in the their cuddliness--indeed, they're more often prickly than cuddly. But they're never less than three-dimensional, and in the end they are sympathetic. They're not fantasy people, but more like your next-door neighbors and your colleagues at work. (Two of the most charming characters are Rodgie the border collie and Felicity the parrot--both fully as realized as any of the human characters.)If you're looking for a story that ties everything up in neat little bows in the end, avoid \\"Three Junes.\\" But if you want a book as messy, vivid and believable as real life, this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"I read this based on other people's recommendations and glowing reviews.The book is well crafted, and serves as a sort of travelogue. The descriptions of places are excellent. From the expanse of a Greek island to the aisles of a tiny bookstore, you can imagine how every thing looks, feels and smells.Somehow, this does not extend to the author's character development. If you are looking for a book where the characters have a moment of redemption, or epiphany, or even purpose then this is not the book for you.I found that disjointed story lines rambled to unsatisfying conclusions, and that characters who appeared in overlapping story lines were just coincidental.To say that the book reached a conclusion is a stretch. It would be more accurate to say that it rambled to an ending."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"Three Junes is a beautiful reminder of the pleasure of reading good writing. It is by no means a beach book, and it will disappoint readers in search of a page turning, plot-twisting story. However if enjoyed with every word, Three Junes lures the reader in with nuanced characters and a carefully constructed plot.The book is divided into three parts, each centered around a different character. Each segment offers a distinct perspective in the search to understand love and family in the context of relationships. However, unlike many books of its genre, Glass gives you the satisfaction of intertwining plots and characters between its divisions. This makes the book more cohesive, leaving the reader with a sense of fullness and satisfaction."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"Like many of the books I read, this book was the selection of a book club I belong to, and I quite liked it. Just before the meeting to discuss the book, I checked out the Amazon.com reviews, and then was surprised to discover that the Amazon reviewers accurately reflected the diverse opinions of the ten at the meeting: although a small majority liked the book, the rest did not; two couldn't finish it and two couldn't even get into it. Amazon reviews, when there is a good number of them, are obviously a good guide.This is a story of family life, for better or for worse, told in three stories, as seen through the eyes of the father, then his three sons, and then a friend of both the father and the sons. The father lives in Scotland, with two of the sons, but his story takes place in Greece, while he is on vacation there. One of the sons lives in New York, and flies back and forth to Scotland. The friend's story takes place in both Greece and New York. The result is a quite complex, interwoven family story that is easy to understand but hard to describe. The writing is sensitive; for example, the description of the death in New York of a friend of one of the sons, due to AIDS, is sympathetically done. Overall, I found the family's story to be very interesting and well written, but not a story I would recommend for everybody."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"I read this book over a year ago, but I am so baffled by some of the negative reviews that I finally felt the need to post my own. The characters here are lived-in and real. The second novella is an absolutely heartbreaking story about a love that couldn't be - one of the most resonant and poignant pieces of writing that I have read in a long time. The only reason I can think of that some people don't connect with this book is that they simply don't know people like these, people who have experienced heartbreak and had to move on with the rest of their lives. I loved it."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"_Three Junes_ is a story about a prominent Scottish family, their relationships with each other and the various people they connect with in their lives. The theory of the &quot;three junes&quot; signifies 3 separate and poignant summers in the character's lives.In the beginning of the novel, the shortest chapter introduces Paul, a recent widower attempting to reconcile the loss of his beloved wife and the lingering insecurities he has felt as a father to his children and the fidelity of his late wife. Some of these impressions are deeply subtle, and for some readers, this can be frustrating and unfulfilling. I feel, however, it is an adequate and realistic representation of how most family members relate to each other. Afraid to shake up supposed harmony, family members will go to great lengths to suppress disturbing impressions and the past.The next and more satisfying part of the novel is about Paul's oldest son, Fenno. Paul is still trying to come to terms with the young man's homosexuality, where his late wife knew early on in the boy's life where his true nature was. Fenno's story is the meat of the novel, rich and substantial. His life is a careful ballet to avoid &quot;the plague&quot; (AIDS) and his sacrifices are a heavy weight. The relationships he developes with his brothers, their wives, their children, his friends and lovers are bright, humorous and heartbreakingly real. A favor requested of Fenno by one of his brothers and sister-in law adds an aching dimension to Fenno's life as he struggles to fit in amongst the family reunion at his father's funeral. Here is where subtle family events are teasingly implicated, discussed but not entirely resolved. Again, my sentiments are that this is so appropriate, so reflective of how families actually behave.The last third of the novel was my least favorite, and I see this reflected in other's reviews. It would be tidy to validate the connection of Fern, a young, pregnant, widowed woman that Fenno meets through his friends and buisness associates. But, as the reader, we know the connection. The book's ending is reflective and suggestive. There is no great bang. Could there be? I understand the need for many to need that, and I craved it as well. But, here, again is another reflection of real life...it goes on, and neatly tied up loose ends are uncommon.After reading this novel, and the reviews, I feel it may be helpful to say if you don't want to read a cryptic, thought provoking, open-ended novel, this may not be for you._Three Junes_ is subtle and unfortunately for those craving resolution and finality, this may be troublesome."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"If NY editors were still giving newly published writers the nurturing they used to be so good at, this still superb debut novel would have been spectacular. With such a great premise, the characters portrayed during three separate Junes over the period of a decade - and in a handful of lovely settings from Greece to Greenwich Village, Julia Glass's book is still a sterling read and provides fodder for long book group discussions. Focusing on the members of the McLeod family and their acquired friends, Three Junes explores relationships over time and tries to answer questions about What is family?Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"I have to admit at first I thought this book was rather slow in taking off ~~ but I kept reading ~~ something about Fenno keeps bringing me back. Once I wasn't in a hurry to finish this book, I ended up enjoying the lyrical flow of the wording in this book ~~ soft and gentle, very descriptive and insightful of the characters in the book.The book starts out with Paul, Fenno's father, and his trip to Greece after his wife had died. Paul meets Fern, a lovely young American, and was rather intrigued by her hopefulness and dreams. The last part of the book is about Fenno and Fern ~~ how they met up on Long Island. In between pages, the story is riveted on Fenno and his chosen lifestyle in America and his reflections on his brothers and childhood in Scotland. There is a lot of skipping back to the past then back to the present in this book but Glass does a wonderful job of keeping you on track ~~ you don't feel like you've lost your balance in this book like you would in other books. In fact, it makes you long for a glass of good wine, and to settle back on the couch to enjoy a leisurely read.This book is not to be rushed ~~ you must savor the stories Glass is telling you. All the stories are connected even if you don't make the connection right away. Fenno becomes a man to admire ~~ very human in all his faults as he struggles to find meaning in his life. Fern becomes a woman of courage once she faces the truth about herself.It is just a neat novel. If you like to read about people, this book is it. Glass writes passionately of people and their lives ~~ as if she was an observer ~~ an intimate observer. It's not a make me feel good book ~~ but rather, life can be good, book.3-6-03"},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"I bought this book because of the reviews. I'm astonished. This book is not only second-rate, but it is genuinely irritating; the characters are cardboard cutouts and elicit nothing from the reader. This embarrassing attempt by an American writer to create the dialogue and lifestyle of a Scottish clan conjures up one word---faux. The book is peopled with characters who seem to exist solely to blurt out 'witticisms,' which unfortunately are created by a writer with a tin ear. To make matters worse, there is no character development, which makes the lines all the more absurd. Open any page of this book, and you'll see what I mean. Ok, try page 160, and check your cringe level.--&quot;Oh Fenno, your education has left your brain too full to be smart. I am asking you to be the--I think it's called, ironically, 'health' proxy--on my living--ironies everywhere--my living will. The job is, basically, to keep me from getting stuck full of tubes.&quot; He walked to a window........He sighed. &quot;And I find you dependable, and I like you, and you have a cold enough eye not to go all rubbery if and when you have to pull the plug.&quot; He lauged again, and coughed again. He leaned out the window until the coughing had passed. When he turned back to me, he said, &quot;I wish the pear trees would bloom all summer long.&quot;--The book is filled with this stuff. To all of you truly talented writers out there, don't give up. Quality always prevails. I guess the National Book Award is not that different from the Miss America contest. Who knew?"},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"Sometimes, we began to read a novel and we don't really know what to expect fromit. We just assume some things beforehand and expect that our assumptions to betrue. When I started reading \`Three Junes' I wasn't sure of what to expect.Maybe another \`chick lit', or something alike, but I couldn't be more wrong.\`Junes' is a wonderful novel, an impressive debut. It is hard to believe thatthis is Julia Glass's first novel, because she has such an use of language and aconfident style that many veteran writers don't have. I read an article on Glassand she says to be interested in how people manage to survive after having theirheart broken, and that's exactly what she does in the novel. Sooner or later,every character have their heart broken at least once, and they try to survive--if they'll be able to accomplish that is another thing. That is where Glass'spower as a writer is. Her creations are very vivid and believable.The book has its own pace, and the story changes time without much explanation--what brings a major charm to the novel. The flashbacks come and go, but theymake total sense to what's being told at the moment they pop up. It is a giftfor avid readers to have such a \`slow' novel in this time of disposable and fastliterature. You read word by word and be transported to another time and place,and you start feeling you know those people, and that they could be your friendsin another life.Somehow Julia Glass reminds me of Michael Cunnighan --which is a great thing inmy opinion. Of course, each one has his and her own style and peculiarities,what make their prose unique, but they share a lot in common: mostly a tenderview of some so called \`outsiders' that aren't cool enough to be a beatnik, butstill that can't fit in the common place of society.My suggestion is be good to yourself, and give your inteligence and good tastethis lovely gem. And mark this name, I believe we will hear a lot more of JuliaGlass. We, readers of prose with quality, deserve that. The National Book Awardis more than deserved!"},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"I really enjoyed this novel of three interrelated stories. The character and relationships were well-drawn and the characters seemed believably complicated. Although many of the characters had failed relationships, there seemed some hope at the end that they could recover from the past and start again."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"I found the writing sytle of Ms. Glass to be extremely well thought out and creative in terms of her expressions and story line. She does especially well in the area of character development."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"Three Junes is a story about one Scottish family, their relationship to one another and to the people who touch their lives. The book is broken into three parts. Each part is either set in the month of June or alludes to the month June.This is a book about the interconnection between people. Each character, by virtue of their actions or, many times, their inaction molds the lives and personalities of others in the family. Chance meetings turn into life long friendships, connecting the characters through the Junes.It is human nature to want to belong, to something or someone. But all of us, at some time or another, find ourselves feeling like we are on the outside looking in. I think Ms. Glass did an exceptional job at showing this disconnect and the main character's struggle to connect with the people in his life.This is Julia Glass' debut novel and a National Book Award winner. I can't wait to hear more from her."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"Emilie BarkerApril 2004Exploring the matters of love and loss is a very difficult thing to do for some people. Especially when trying to untie the intricate bonds joining members of a complicated Scottish family. In this story, Julia Glass does this with grace and agility. Once I began this book, I couldn't seem to set it down! This was definitely a wild adventure that pulled together wonderfully in the end.This outstanding story started out by exploring the roles of fate and destiny in bringing people together, as well as the communication gaps and closed emotions that often keep them apart, and it really does show this in three connected sections, in which characters interact over a decade. These people are entirely at home in their beautifully detailed homes and lands, which include Greece, rural Scotland, Greenwich Village and the Hamptons.Paul McLeod, the reticent Scots widower introduced in the first section, is the father of Fenno, who is the center character of the middle section. He is a reserved, self-protective gay bookstore owner in Manhattan. Both father and son have dealings with the third section's young artist, Fern Olitsky, who feels guilt from her husband's death that leaves her longing for beginning anew. Other characters are memorably individualistic. I say this because there are characters such as: a bitter music critic dying of AIDS, Fenno's emotionally hard to pin down mother, his sibling twins and their wives, and his insomniac lover.I would have to say that this book achieved its goal and in the end it tied together very nicely. The book really didn't leave that much out, I didn't think. It was very detailed, and I liked the way Julia Glass made you paint yourself a picture of what things really looked like. You could almost imagine being in the same room as the father of Fenno, and hearing his loud voice! I was very convinced about a couple of things in this book, but now I am even more convinced. I guess I can really relate to this book mainly because my family is a lot like the family Julia Glass described.I would have to definitely recommend this book to anyone who wants to sit down for a good couple of hours to read this crazy novel! You really can relate to a lot of it, and you can see the description so vividly that you will dream of it the next time you take a nap or go to bed for the night. It really makes you think, and it most definitely makes you wonder about your own family. Of course, don't take these family things too seriously. After all, it really is just a book."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"I am normally a fast reader. This book is well written, but the story line is slow and drages. It took me some time to get through this book. The book was a dissapointment, considering it won the National Book Award. Not something I would recommend."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"The first part of the book held my interest and I cared about the character. The second section, &quot;Upright&quot; is just plain too long and boring. I really don't want to hear every detail about Fenno, a very uninteresting character. I'm about ready to quit the book. Can't imagine how it became a best seller."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"This is the worst book I have read in a long time. It is boring, disjointed, and goes nowhere. Part 1 started off okay. Part 2 went downhill and I thought it would never end. Part 3 -I expected that section to develop the lives of Fenno's brothers and their families. WHY FERN? WHO IS FERN? Who cares?I could hardly wait to get to the end and throw the book out. I won't even give it away to a friend. How in the world could this book ever have received rave reviews and awards?????"},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"This book has to be one of my all time favorites. I couldn't put it down, but I didn't want it to end, so when I finished it I started reading at the beginning again. The characters were so endearing, each in their own way. I would like to read about them some more, so Julia, Get out your pen, and write a part II, and III and etc."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"This book was so slow! Normally I fly through books and this one took me over a month to finish becaust it was so boring! The first part was relatively decent, Paul's life was pretty interesting. After the first section though, it's not worth reading. Way too much on unlikable characters: Fenno, Mal, and Fern. I was hoping that the book would tell one of the other brother's stories after Fenno's, but for some reason it switched over to Fern."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"I would love to see what this author could do with a GOOD storyline. Her wonderful style of writing really caught my attention and I thought I was going to thoroughly enjoy the book; however, I just could not get into the confusing and drawn out plot."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"Julia Glass' descriptions are vivid. Her compelling characters all come to life. I couldn't put the book down waiting to see what would happen to these people. Excellent writing!"},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"Before reading \\"Three Junes\\", I had read several light, summertime reading novels, so when I started this novel, I was thrown for a loop through no fault of the author's. At first I thought this book was full of cumbersome language that was hard to navigate. After giving this book a second chance I discovered that every word written on every page is there for a reason and the author weaves us into the tapestry of this story with effortless skill. This truly is a literary novel; one to be savored like fine wine or wonderful chocolate.Quite simply, I fell in love with the McLeod clan. The first section of the novel is dedicated to the patriarch of the family, Paul McLeod in the wake of his wife Maureen's death. We are introduced to his children, the oldest Fenno and the twins, David and Dennis. Paul McLeod is a proud proper sort of man whose Scottish roots run very deep. I literally felt the love Paul had for his life and all its facets even if he wasn't able to express it to his children. He admires all of his sons even though they choose not to join the family business and each follow their own path. The section dedicated to Paul ended much to soon and I was left grappling for more.I disagree with some of the reviews I have read that say the middle section that is told Fenno's point of view is too long. Fenno very tenderly and unsentimentally tells about his life as a gay man living in New York. I was touched by his relationship with Mal and at many points in the book, I found myself smiling through tears.The last section of the book tries to tie up all the loose ends, but doesn't really succeed. I felt happy and relieved about certain aspects at the end, but again was left wanting more.Even in the face of death by Cancer and AIDS, this book is filled with so much life that it overflows. It is a wonderful multi-generational book that feeds the soul."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"This is a really good novel, impeccably written but also heartwrenching. It is not a reading that you cannot put down, but it certainly is a book you will remember. Mal's character is fantastic.Avoid if you look for light hearted-entertainment."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"It's not like any other book I've read. It's fresh and exciting, and full of wonderful characters and locations. The book has some beautiful settings: Greece, Scotland, Greenwich Village and the Hamptons. And when it comes to characters, Glass has created some of the most complex portraits yet: Paul McLeod, a widower, is the father of Fenno, who is the central character of one the sections. Fenno is a gay bookstore owner in Manhattan. Some other interesting characters include a overly-hostile music critic (who is dying of AIDS) and Fenno's mother--she's cold and unmoving. Then there's the twins and their wives. Too much really to tell here. All I can say is read this book"},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"I was not as enamored of this book as most of the critics - especially those who gave it the National Book Award. The book is written in three distinct sections that all get neatly tied together with a bow at the end. The first section deals with Paul McLeod, a recent widower who has left his home in Scotland and is wandering around the Greek isles. The middle, and longest section, deals with his son, Fenno, a gay bookstore owner in Manhattan. Fenno's relationships with his family are explored here, as well as his relationship with Mal, his friend/neighbor who is dying of AIDS. The last section is devoted to Fern, who is so newly impregnated she hasn't had a chance to even tell the father, who is out of town. Fern is staying with Tony, an ex-lover of Fenno's, and somehow all the characters in the book come together in this relatively short section. The descriptive writing is beautiful, and the relationships under glass are interesting, but it is a slow moving, forgettable story."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"Julia Glass is a very good writer but seems to try too hard, especially in the first section, to mine metaphors, so the writing comes off to me as studied. The middle section, on Fenno, is much better but I got tired of him rather quickly. With his friends, he is accommodating and charmingly reticent, but with his family members, somewhat of a peevish bore, quick to take offense and see a slight where none may exist. There is a part of the book where he feels quite put-upon when he is asked by his family to contribute something of himself. I find this ironic since it's the very thing he freely dispenses to virtual strangers in somewhat furtive encounters. Also, the world Fenno inhabits in New York, particularly with his friend across the street, is presented as rarified; i.e., their tastes in art, food, music, etc., are so much more cultivated than those who aren't part of their circle. This got tiresome. The overall writing skill of Glass, however, despite these criticisms, is very good."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"This book is very flowery and ornate in its language. I found it a real slog to get through. It's very suprising to me that it has been well-received by critics."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"After reading all the glowing reviews on this book, I couldn't believe how bad it was. There are loose strings all over the place. The novel seems to be 3 short stories put together, but with no resolution on any of the significant issues that could tie everything together. The best characters are not well developed, although there are hints that these characters could have made up a compelling story. The main character, who is well drawn, is completely uninteresting with unclear motives.There is no denying that some of the writing is exceptional. But a novel commands that there be a plot and that it has characters that the reader will care about. Neither happened in my case. I only finished the book, because I kept hoping that something would happen and because I am reading the book for a book club. Fluff isn't enough.I would recommend this book to no one."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"This book had a slow start but was well worth continuing. The writing is wonderful and the story engrossing. I highly recommend the book if you are interested in family relationships and thoughtful writing."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"I read this novel a little while ago and was really disappointed in it. I'd bought it because it had won the National Book Award, hoping for a really well-written, memorable and thought-provoking book; it disappointed me on all those counts and I'm surprised it won that prestigious award.Unlike most of the reviewers here, I found the first section, 'Collies,' the flattest and least emotional, the hardest to get involved with, though I never did really care about any of the characters. And yes, the second novella is overly long, but I did pick up interest in the book with this section as it's in first person and somehow that seemed to help the book become a little more alive. I did, however, find the subject matter of this second section somewhat 'deja vu'; somehow it didn't present anything much new to me in exploring the interior life of a gay man. And I hated Mal, who seemed so cliched a character (and so dislikeable!).I did, however, like the last section of the book the best! Connections were being made over an ordinary dinner, the dialogue seemed sharper and more interesting; I found this last novella refreshing after the previous two, and akin maybe to a British skit. I was disappointed, though, that the sketch/drawing from the first section--which seemed such a perfect link between Fenno and Fern--never found its way into this last June (I wonder why not?). I also found myself actually liking Fenno in this last section, when I'd been either neutral or not liking him before; he seems to transform here, into a kinder, more likeable man than he was earlier on, and somehow this seemed a bit out of kilter.I did like the idea of three novellas which connect sometimes disparate characters--the way life miraculously does sometimes. But on the whole, I didn't think Glass succeeded in pulling this off, and it seemed like she was trying too hard with her writing, which I did not find either lyrical or beautiful. The previous Natl. Book Award Winner,'The Corrections' by Jonathan Franzen, was also about families and in comparison with Glass'novel, I found Franzen's SO much better written (though yes, a very different style), with more to say about families. Maybe Glass will do better the next time out, though I'm not impressed enough by this one to seek out future books of hers."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"Well-written literary novel tells family story from three points of view. Insightful look into a variety of personalities, lifestyles & issues from 1960s to present."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"Julia Glass' debut novel Three Junes just did not hold my attention throughout. A sad but hopeful story of three time periods of Fenno McCleod's life that take place in the month of June. Ms. Glass did an excellent job of weaving flashbacks with current time, but the overall theme was at times depressing and stagnant. We see Fenno (and family) from his father's point of view during the first June, then we see Fenno's life from his own point of view in the second June and finally from a friend in the third June. The ending fell flat to me and did not tie in that Fern (the friend) was actually a person of interest during the first June. This book was a good look at gay life during a critical time of the AIDS epedemic."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"I picked up &quot;Three Junes&quot; reluctantly. Julia Glass is a highly-literate writer, and (not to insult myself), I'm a reader looking for escapism and romance. I tend to like to have anything and everything spelled out for me (Danielle Steel). In short, I read for pleasure, and am easily distracted, as I read, usually in crowded lobbies, waiting rooms etc.. So, I need something that's easy to tap into, as well as put down and pick up at many intervals.These are edgy characters, too, in &quot;Three Junes&quot;, with clever and sometimes vague dialogue.However, I was able to follow along with the characters and the often-times complex descriptions author Julia Glass writes. Part of it is my familiarity with the setting (Scotland) that author Julia Glass writes about. I've read a lot of Rosamunde Pilcher, a romance author who also uses Scotland as a setting.&quot;Three Junes&quot; is essentially about the life of Fenno McLoed, who grew up in Scotland, but immigrated to NYC.The novel is told in 3 parts. Part one tells about Fenno and his Scottish family in first person, narrated by his Father. In part 2, Fenno, himself, takes over the narration. And, Part 3 is done in third person, by entirely new characters, who are acquainted with Fenno later on in his life.This is a very clever way of telling the story of one man's life, and full of observations, reflections, inferences about what it's like to be an ex-patriate from another country: Scotland.Again, anyone who reads a lot of Rosamunde Pilcher, might like this. Pilcher is from that Northern England Countryside area known as Scotland, and writes frequently about the Scots. However, Rosamunde Pilcher is a romance novelist, and &quot;Three Junes&quot; is not romance.It's basically just a highly-literate, clever, and sometimes edgy (jargon) story of a Scottish family and their imperfections. There is a strong sense of movement and the passage of time, as main character Fenno travels back and forth between Scotland and NYC for various deaths in his family.It's not a novel for everybody, as there's not a lot of action/adventure, and given the avant-garde, quirky dialogue. But, Julia Glass thoroughly explores and explains her characters, and I was willing to stay with it till the end. I must say, Julia Glass has a bright future, considering she'd never written a novel before."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"I read this book over vacation, which was a terrible choice I realize now. I should've known when I started it that it was going to be depressing. I have read my share of sad books and often enjoyed them when they offered insight into human nature or offered a message of sorts. This book has literally nothing to offer. It doesn't leave you feeling good or even remotely satisfied. I would summarize the book as others have done but a reader of this would be bored to tears by the summary. I hope that after reading this no one will choose to read or buy this book. The ending was the worst part. I actually threw the book across the room when I finished reading it because I was so absolutely dissatisfied. The most terrible thing was that the author set up a really good outline that could have had the most moving ending with so many twists that do not serve the point they could have. There was a chance for this book to be entertaining but it is not worth the time it takes to drudge through it."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"What a wonderful story, what elegant writing, how neatly it came full-circle! If this is Julia Glass' FIRST effort, imagine what we lucky readers will have to look forward to!"},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"So, I just finished this book tonight. When I was done, I thought it was a good book, but I also thought the last part about Fern seemed like it was just tacked onto the the story of Paul and Fenno MacLeod, father and son. Of course, I had missed the fact that Fern was the same artist from the beginning. That may have had something to do with the time machine quality of the narrative (it's five years earlier, five years later, etc.) or the fact that I listened to the book instead of reading it, which made it a little hard to keep track of things.Anyway, the more I thought about it, the book really is about love, or the absence thereof. It seems that Paul's marriage had fallen into a loveless or at least independent pattern. After his wife's death, he found a new place for himself and found love and companionship.For Fenno, Mal is the lover with whom he never falls in love. After his death, we learn that he does develop a more solid relationship with Tony. We also learn of the love that he feels for his children, which, for the most part, he will never really get to express.And there's Fern who is freed from a loveless marriage by what she thinks is a freak accident. Accident or not, she eventually finds love with Stavros.That final part does end up seeming a bit disconnected, but when viewed with this theme the three sections do seem to fit together a little better. I personally would have enjoyed a little more time with Fenno or even the next generation of MacLeods, but as someone else pointed out this structure allows us to see Fenno from his father's perspective, his own, and an outsider's with Fern's section.Overall, it is the MacLeod's who drive this story and who are the most interesting two thirds of it. Through their stories of life and loss, we can see how love can elusive, often tragic, but also fulfilling. I also enjoyed the book's realistic portrayal of the nuances of family life.I would definitely recommend this book. If you like audio books, this one is a great option. The Scottish burr alone makes it all worthwhile.Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"Great book that allows one to think instead of just reading for pure entertainment!"},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"This book contains 3 novellas presenting interlocking stories of a single family. Overall, they are beautifully and gracefully written, each section bringing its main character to a key turning point in his or her life. The first section, focusing Paul McLeod as he travels through the Greek islands and copes with recent widowhood, nears perfection. The second, longest, and weakest section, the story of Paul's estranged son Fenno, throws so many issues into the mix that it could have been a 500-page family saga all by itself. The third section, tangentially related to the first two, is slight but refreshing after the overwrought middle story. The book is worth reading for its descriptive detail as much as for its plot and characterizations."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"Julia Glass has written a luminous novel about family ties those we are born with and those we acquire through life. The novel is divided into three sections that each include the McLeod family memebers. In the first and most interesting section we meet Paul McLeod who is recovering from his wife Maureen's death on a trip to Greece in June . Paul's reminiscence of Maureen is poignant as he describes their meeting and early years of marriage together. The reader is treated to beautifully written passages about their rural Scottish home and the interactions between these two people. Paul is left wondering if he ever really knew his wife, certian that he loved her, yet regretting not having the courage to really know her. Part two of the story centers on Fenno, Paul's oldest son, who arrives home from NYC to attend his father's funeral. It is in this chapter we meet the rich, interesting characters in Fenno's life; Malachy Burns a music critic dying of AIDS, Fenno's lover, his neighbor and twin brothers Dennis and David and their families. Fenno keeps his emotions to himself and like his father, questions why he sometimes doesn't have the courage to connect in a real way with the people in his life. This is the longest section of the book and at times drags as Fenno philosophies about his life and relationships. The last section of the book is by far the weakest, with Fern Olitsky being the central character who ties into the McLeod's life in an intesting way. This scene is set in the Hamptons, at a beach house where a dinner draws Fenno, his brother Dennis, his ex-lover, Fern and a new man. The interactions are interesting, but this was disappointing as the rest of the book was superb and the ending just seems to drop off. This is a story that is meant to be read slowly, with wonderful imagery and details to characters and relationships, but ends somewhat weakly."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"As I finished the first section of &quot;Three Junes&quot; I felt deep disappointment: I didn't want it to end, I wanted to go further with Paul as he continued the grief process for his wife, Maureen. I was curious about the \\"supportive cast\\" as well. What would happen to them all, post Greek holiday?I was mildly annoyed to find the next section had my least favorite character as its protagonist. Because Ms. Glass writes with such beauty, I continued on in spite of the initial distaste.What I found was as I read further, I actually found myself caring deeply about these people. I had a startling \\"a-ha\\" moment when I realized what happened for me in relationship to my feelings about Fenno paralleled the feelings Fenno had for his relatives and friends. As he turned his corner, I sighed remembering my own turned corner... and it became richer also as the result of his corner.Intriguing and compelling.There are also some beautiful tidbits along the way, turns of the pencil such as \\"proud pilot of an improvised life\\" and \\"I hate it when people talk about twists of fate\\", Anna liked to say. \\"When it comes to life, we spin our own yarn, and where we end up is really, in fact, where we always intended to be.\\"The integration of characters crossing into each other's lives is another subtle nuance. I was reminded of Miles Drentell (character from \\"thirtysomething\\") remarking \\"People are like magnets.\\"I wonder if Ms. Glass was a fan of that show?"},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"This is a fine novel, giving an expansive account of a Scottish family at three points in time several years apart. The middle section is the most detailed and compelling, telling how son Fenno missed out on passionate love in his relation to a magnetic friend dying of AIDS; yet the measure of insight, and connected humanity, Fenno gains is genuine and redemptive, and informs the final \\"June.\\" The two flanking sections provide back- and fore-story that add depth and connectivity to the entire history and other characters. All in all, the book reminded me of a medieval triptych painting, in which smaller side paintings point to and enhance a greater and more substantial central portrait, which is given its setting and context by the others. The writing is graceful and witty, for an excellent reading experience."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"Breathtakingly beautiful and well-crafted novel. It is in my top three of all contemporary novels, and I have given it away to all friends and family members who are readers; everyone who has read it so far as has been equally moved. Glass's lyrical prose is intoxicating, the plot compelling, and her characters breathe on every page."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"I can't believe this book is averaging 3.5 stars, so I had to put my two cents in. Fantastic! Don't miss it."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"this novel took me until about halfway through to decide I liked it. I read bits and pieces of it for over a month and then finished it in a few days. The family of this novel is reserved, and that comes through in the emotional impact of the book, at first. Then the reader comes to understand the characters, to feel what they feel, and in the end to love the family as their own."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"While Three Junes is not without faults, it is overwhelmingly thoughtful and assured in its voice. I think Julia Glass is a beautiful writer in a style that is becoming less common: each sentence is well thought, and although some reviews refer to the pace as slow, I disagree. Every page abounds with nuance and delightful observations. The characters are vivid. For fans of Jeffery Eugenides or Ian McEwan, Three Junes will be welcomed."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"It's difficult to believe that this is Julia Glass' first novel, and makes you hope it won't be her last. Had I known ahead of time about the heavy themes that this story tackles, I would never have picked it up. That's the brilliance of brain candy at the checkout aisle. Its unique appeal circumvents the electric fence of your conscience's natural filters, and allows you to explore wonderful, hidden gems you'd have otherwised missed. I was in an airport in Boston, waiting for my flight home, when I spied a little bookshop across the way. I picked &quot;Three Junes&quot; up on impulse, and from the moment I possessed it (it possessed me?) I simply couldn't put it down. Reminiscent of Lisa Carey's tapestry approach in &quot;Mermaids Singing,&quot; Glass weaves the lives and disparate timeframes of several characters in synchronously to the plot, but marks it uniquely, like bookends, by moving from third person to first person and back again. This is Julia Glass' true strength: that she's not afraid to break the rules. She invents her own along the way, and instead of the disjointed folly one might find at the hands of a less masterful storyteller, Glass guides us patiently and seamlessly through the urgency of this tale. Her characters demand your attention, and plant themselves firmly in your heart. I felt homesick once the book was done, because I couldn't dwell in the heady world that she'd created with these people that I'd absolutely come to love. Glass doesn't overstay her welcome. She draws you into a tight, believable, provocative dialogue; displays an almost encyclopedic knowledge of the domains that she conquers; and crawls confortably into the skin of each new character she asks us to take on. Each raw word and thought feels like a grain of sand planted under the skin, coaxing out the final pearl. Taking the minimalist approach to closure, she at times hints of the outcome, and lets you draw your own conclusion without feeling marooned. An alchemist and a shapeshifter, Julia Glass conjures up a handful of lives that spans, over decades, three months of Junes, and leaves you wanting more."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"This was a well-written, interesting book. I really enjoyed the parts from the first two points of view. I thought the author went didn't create a very interesting narrator for the third part of the book, though, the only part told from a female perspective.I enjoy looking into Scottish lives, although as an American, I can't really judge how accurate the authors representation of the Scottish characters is.I thought the characters faced interesting problems, and that the book did a good job of showing how little we know of each other, even when we live in the same family!"},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"I thought this was one of the most beautifully written books I've read in a long time. Every sentence was rich and well thought out. If you prefer books that are written and edited in a day, this is not for you. I did not find it difficult to \\"get into\\", yet I did not approach it with criticism in mind. I thought it was wonderful and such a pleasant change from the mass produced, grammatically incorrect, 8th grade reading level fiction that is out there today. Well worth reading."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"For some reason, it took me awhile to get into this, but, once I did, I was hooked. The second and third portions of the novel were so strong and emotional - yet so subtle and graceful. &quot;Collies&quot; felt as if it stood alone, although equally enjoyable. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"I truly enjoyed reading Three Junes. I found the characters interesting and likeable. I really liked the way the author released details about each character slowly and at different times in the book. The book clearly shows that lives can connect across time and through pure coincidence, yet provide joy to everyone involved. The second section about Fenno portrays a poignant story of what it might be like to live his lifestyle with dignity and yet maintain a sense of family..and humor."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"I have a long drive to and from work, and I must admit the story never really climaxed, but I was entertained and looked forward to hearing more about these characters and how they perceived the world. It may very well have been the character's insights into why they did and felt what they did, that made it compelling to listen to. I looked forward to getting back in my car and that alone made the 12 disc set worth the investment."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"I loved this book! Along with The Life of Pi, this was my favorite read this year. You owe it to yourself to sit down with this gem!"},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"A curiously circular contemporary family saga that meanders from Scotland to Greece to the United States. A tale of 3 brothers and their family, told mostly through the eyes of Fenno (the gay son) and Paul (the widowed father) and Fern (who unexpectedly intersects these lives). I struggled a bit with a certain lack of identification with the distant Fenno, and the meandering plot. Charm, grace and tension share the pages of this very interesting generational study. Ms. Glass exhibits maturity as well as a skillful and artistic ability in this writing. I have to wonder how she developed and understood the Fenno character, who was without a doubt an eccentric and atypical protagonist."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"The opening novella was as resonant and beautiful as anything I've ever read. I'm revealing my biases, but I think the first section reaches the upper limits of what descriptive and insightful writing can do. What a shock then to discover the second section which I found unreadable with zero charm and substance. I didn't have the heart to read more than four pages of that. I never looked at the final section; I was too dismayed. But the opening section of the book remains with me as the best novella I've ever read."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"Ironically, before our book club had our official meeting for this read, everyone complained about it's complexity; however, after the meeting we all agreed that Three Junes provided us a bounty of discussion. Personally, I found it to be wordy at times rendering it difficult to digest. (An English Major in college yet I felt there were times when I had to \\"plod\\" through it.) The flashback sequences were distracting at times and many of the plot line issues seemed to be unresolved...e.g. Fern's purpose seemed unclear to us; we desired more information regarding Paul and Maureen's marriage or lack thereof, etc.I didn't really embrace any of the characters in this book. I found Fenno especially annoying and for the most part, aloof and too self-directed. However, his actions in Mal's death scene I found particularly poignant. It certainly is worth the read, but won't be for everyone."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"Do you like reading for pleasure? Do you want to read a book that is not funny but is touching in a way? Then how about Three Junes, written by Julia Glass!?! Three Junes seems to be a book that looks at relationships among family and friends. This book seems like it is not intended to be funny. Instead, Glass seems to have written this to remind readers of how relationships among family and friends are very crucial in a person's life.While I read this book, I felt that I was being taught many important life lessons. Family members depend on each other and are influenced by each other. Children grow depending on their parents. Their life is shaped based on their parents. Even through families may be well bonded or seem to know everything about each other, there are many misunderstandings and things that they don't know about each other.Throughout the book, I found it sort of annoying how the book jump back and forth in time. For example, in part one of the book, the story seemed to be jumping back and forth of Maureen's death and Paul and Maureen's marriage every page. However, I think this was because Glass is a postmodern author and is just her style.Overall, I enjoyed reading this book because it reminded me once more about why families are crucial in people's lives and how family relationships can be good and at times distorted. However, I think Glass is a wonderful writer. This was her first novel and she managed to leave her readers with something important to consider and also won a prize (National book award). I cannot say that she is a perfect writer, but I think she a person with deep thoughts and has the ability to write them out."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"Compelling, thoughtful and thought-provoking. Strong and memorable characters, though somewhat flawed by the occasional piece of clunking dialogue.By the way, I have to say that the following quote, from a reader's review below:&quot;I felt I was not prepared for this much gayness when I read the book. It deeply disturbed me that the publisher had to go in such length to ?hide? the main plot from its potential readers.&quot;is the funniest, most moronic thing I have ever read on Amazon. It takes quite a skill to be so neanderthally, point-missingly stupid."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"I do not understand why this book is winning such rave reviews. I struggled frantically against boredom, getting 2/3 of the way through, before I had to &quot;throw in the towel.&quot;Neither the storyline, nor the characters captured my heart. I did not care about the characters. They felt flat, contrived, one dimensional.BANAL!If you are looking for a book about the relationships within a family try &quot;THE LOVELY BONES&quot; by Alice Seabold."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"This debut novel is divided into 3 parts:June 1989 The Collies, Part 1June 1995 Upright, Part 2June 1999 Boys, Part 3The titles of the above mentioned parts are strange. Only Part I was understandable to me. The others - I can't even imagine why.Part 1 introduces us to Paul, on a voyage to get over losing his wife Maureen, a kennel owner. Neither of these people or the company Paul kept on his trip was extremely interesting or likeable. Anyone who can drown puppies is not on my likeable list. This part was the hardest to get through because it doesn't grab your interest right away. I probably wouldn't have finished the entire thing it if it wasn't our book clubs selection of the month.Part 2 introduces us to Paul's sons - Fenno, the homosexual, and his 2 twin brothers, David and Dennis. Mal, Fenno's gay friend, dying of Aids, was witty and a bit interesting at times. The writing flits back and forth from past to present. One needs to pay attention to whether it is now or then, it is not always evident and often abrupt. One wonders if it's worthwhile sorting it all out. One also wonders throughout this whole section whether Fenno agrees to donate sperm to impregnate his sister-in-law, but it is never clear until the last section.Part 3 - introduces us to yet another new character, Fern, pregnant by an absent lover, living with Tony, Fenno's former gay lover, with whom she had a brief affair, but who is not the father of her baby. This novel is supposed to be about a family in today's times, here and abroad, with a strong Scottish influence. I hoped for more. The only part that evoked any emotion from me is the part where they were burying the Mother and having to leave her casketed body out in the cold until the snow melted so ground could be broken for the coffin. At that, I could only feel emotion by imagining my own mother, not the one in the book. The reader can't feel much emotion for mom, Maureen. She loved her dogs more than her own family and the author didn't give us much from her perspective, as she was dead through most of the book. The ending was just that, it stops, and thank heavens for that. I was relieved to get it over with. I can't imagine what qualified it for this prestigious award."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"I thought this book was so thoroughly bad, I could not believe it won any award! It was boring, boring, boring. I did not enjoy the characters, from the mother who drowned puppies to the very unlikable and promiscuous bisexual character, Tony. It's pretentiousness and lack of passion truly made me want to throw it in the trash can. The only reason I finished it was because we had to read it for our reading group."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"This book was hard to get into not an easy read!!! It was beautifully written though. Very descriptive of the characters and country. I found if I put the book down and wanted to get back into it it would be difficult."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"I enjoyed this book, however I found some plot answers missing.For instance, did Marjorie ever send any of Paul's letters to Fenno? I don't recall a further mention about this later...(I, for one, found Marjorie to be quite an interesting women, but not enough information was written about her..)Did Dennis, David, Veronique, and Lil ever find Paul's ashes in the attic?Maureen had had an affair-but with whom? The owner of the estate nearby, or the \\"Handiman\\"?"},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"Three Junes tells the story of a Scottish family in the aftermath of the mother's death, but mostly it deals with the life of Fenno, the eldest of three brothers, who lives in New York and runs an eclectic bookstore in the Village. Fenno becomes the caretaker of a music critic dying of AIDS and the on-again-off-again lover of a photographer unwilling to allow himself to be pinned down.Like so many books these days that pick up prestigious awards, this book is well-written, the characters are finely drawn (particularly Fenno, who serves as the narrator for the second and, by far, biggest chunk of the novel), but I was left rather non-plussed. A year from now, I'll probably look back on this novel and will remember enjoying it, but won't be able to remember much beyond that. While I wasn't disappointed, per se, I wasn't overly impressed. Julia Glass is a decent writer, but there's nothing particularly memorable about her style or her narrative voice. At times, this novel reminded me of something Maeve Binchy might write. There have been several great novels published of late, I'm surprised this was chosen as the National Book Award winner.Again, there's nothing really wrong here. Three Junes is a pleasant diversion, but not much beyond that."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"Three Junes is a novel for poetry lovers, written with acuity and precision. The first two parts have as background two vivid, full-of-life characters who are lost to premature, awful diseases, first Maureen, then Paul McLeod. The family lives in Scotland and raises sheep and sheepdogs. The second section is narrated by their eldest son Fenno, a sensitive, introspective gay man who has moved to the New York's West Village, and opened an electic bookstore featuring avian lore and a talking multihued parrot. In developing Fenno's fully drawn character, the author has described an outgoing, animal-loving mother and, like Fenno, a quiet, unassuming father. Maureen's vivacity breathes much life into the first part, which was previously published as an award winning novella called \\"Collies.\\" She gives much of herself to raising her \\"smart, beautiful dogs,\\" and it seems that Fenno carries with him a bit of a burden from an early displacement of human affection.Glass writes musically, and she writes about lacunae, the air between people. Her voices are mostly male and her prose is written in a slight Scots accent, not challenging like Irvine Welsh, and sometimes too simple, identifying its origin by substituting \\"boot\\" for car trunk, for example. Another small quibble concerns references in the second and third parts, events taking places successively in months of June, to the first section. This makes it a little too obvious that \\"Collies\\" was published separately.But this is a small detraction and doesn't hurt this beautiful saga of family and friends, the spaces between them, the effect they have on each other without sometimes knowing. I have left out quite a few finely drawn characterizations; the novel's strongest point is that it is full of them."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"The best book I read in 2005. This is a taut sensitive interesting read that feels emotionally accurate. A really enjoyable, subtle book."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"I noticed that some of the reviews are less than stellar because \\"nothing happens in the end\\". Well, isn't that just ordinary life? Glass makes ordinary life with ups and downs a very compelling read. I thoroughly enjoyed the book and didn't want it to end. I would love to read her other works in the future."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"I love reading.. I love most books I read. Simply stated, this just did not do it for me. I could not get through it."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"I normally read mysteries, but since Three Junes had such great reviews, I thought I would try it. I was so disappointed. The book was so hard to get through. The book is partially based on flashbacks, but those became confusing. I often lost track of time. I never fully figured out the ages of some of the characters or what time frame that particular part of the book was written in.One of the reviews written on the book stated that Three Junes was full of life...HAHA. The only reason the book progressed was because of numerous deaths. Each new section began with a death. I finished the book feeling extremely depressed. Even mysteries that include murders and suicides are never this depressing.The only part of the book I enjoyed was the first section, Collies. The people were happy and seemed to have a purpose. I also enjoyed the visuals of Greece. After reading this book, I would love to visit the Greek island described in the book....it sounds so mysterious and calm.The third section did not have any relevance to the rest of the book. The first two sections were about Fenno and his family....the death of his parents, his mother's obsession with Collies, his own sexuality, and the relationships with his family. The third section was based on one of Fenno's lovers, Tony. I was officially lost.I believe that Julia Glass has a wonderful ability to write, but she should stop trying to write a classic. She needs to develop the book more and perhaps make it more lively. It was so depressing! I don't think I will be interested in trying another of her books, though. If you decide to read this one, make sure you have a funny, upbeat book to follow it up with."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"I enjoyed the first part of the book, Collies, which made me feel loyal enough to the author to finish it. Mistake.The main character of the 2nd part, Fenno, is a thoroughly boring, unsympathetic character. I felt nothing for him at all. The relationship between him and his two brothers, though pondered on ad nauseum, is not dynamic or interesting. Only the wives had any depth, and they weren't even likable.By the 3rd part, I was irritated. I can only hope that Fern and Fenno realize she met his father for a brief moment in Greece 10 years earlier. Ms Glass could not even give us the satisfaction of knowing that.What about Maureen's infidelity? What about the letters that Marjorie had? What about the relationship with Mal's mother? Why would ANYONE like Tony? Why did Fenno like Mal? He also was unsympathetic and shallow. Why, why, why did I waste my time on this book? Why did it win an award?Lifeless book with some pretty prose that does not make up for it's unanswered questions."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"A slow start , but, picks up speed 1/3 of the way into the book.The ending was a let down."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"This book was very well written, but I felt the characters were not fully developed. Paul, Fern, Maureen, Fenno, Lucinda, David, Lil, Dennis, and Veronique were all interesting but were either not fully developed or were left hanging. Maybe the author wanted us to write our own stories about these characters."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"I liked this novel a lot. There were a couple of lines I wanted to try to remember, which is rare for me, as I usually read fast and then forget, no matter how great the novel. Good treatment of family relationships."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"As others have said, \\"Collies\\" - the first section - is wonderful. The characters are interesting and make you want to keep reading. \\"Upright\\" - the second section - dwells on Fenno - the gay character who has no idea how to live, love, or simply exist. He's completely uninteresting and reading the overly long section is painfully slow. \\"Boys\\" - the third section - concentrates on a completely different character who is only slightly more interesting than Fenno. The writing throughout is overly showy and detracts from the story. Read the first section and move on to your next book. The second and third sections are snooze city."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"Yes, the author can write but can she be imaginative and take us on a journey? I enjoyed the second part of the book the most about Fenno an interesting character. The 1st was OK, the 3rd part; I'm not sure why she even bothered to write this part! I'm getting tired of reading books about people's every day lives, nothing spectacular. I have an every day life of my own thanks. When I read a book I want rich characters, entertaining plots, perhaps a few twists & the use of a strong imagination on the part of the writer. Although the book is not horrible it's nothing to write home about and it's not a book you'll ever tell someone, or ever hear someone tell you: \\"You gotta'read\\""},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"this book toke a while before it got me. But then i could not put it down. Love the way it is written"},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"There is really not much else I can add to the other reviews of this book, except to say that I really enjoyed it. It was not what I expected at all (for some reason I thought I was about three women.)One thing I did want to mention was the telling of the story in three parts. I enjoyed the first two parts quite a bit. That's not to say I did not like the third part. In fact I liked it a great deal. I do not, however, feel that it was necessary. I think the book could have ended with the second part and I would have been quite satisfied with it's completion. It seemed to me that the third part could of (perhaps should of) been a book on it's own. Regardless, It was still a wonderful book that I highly recommend."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"Three Junes is set apart by it's central homosexual theme, but even more central than the homosexuality of the main characters is the theme of finding &quot;family&quot; in friends who accept you for who you are. Personal angst, bad choices, New York City, and the beautiful Greek Isles all entwine in a great page-turner with unforgettable characters. Parts One and Two are sublime, but honestly Part Three is too long. The gay friends Fenno and Mal are one of the greatest and most poignant romantic couples in literature.A &quot;Good Morning America&quot; Read This! pick."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"this is a quiet character-driven story with some fine moments in it and a structure that adds interest. The release of details is mostly well-done, the depiction of grief and its aftermath especially well-done, family dynamics handled realistically, and each segment closes strongly. Unfortunately, I found that by far the best moments come in the first section, and while not all of them are there, other good ones are too few and far between for me to have enjoyed or been captivated by the middle section, which left me all too impatient for the close by the time I reached the third and final segment, which veered a bit off the focus for me. I'd recommend it for the first section alone, and then advise to at least try and skim through the rest rather than completely give up on it if you find yourself, like me, losing interest in section two."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"I tremendously enjoyed this book. The McLeod family's struggles and conflicts engaged me. My only criticism is the inclusion of the character Fern. She was an irritating distraction. I would have preferred learning more about Davey, Dennis or, especially, Maureen."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"National Book Award, what were you thinking? The writing is extremely tedious. The numerous parentheses and flashbacks in the book stop you from really getting into the story (which is okay, I guess, since the story is not that exciting). It's like if you were jogging (or biking) and someone constantly stopped you and then you were allowed to continue for 1 more block and then stopped again. I could excuse that kind of writing if there was good character development (this happens in some books. I once read a book where the writing was awful but the story was interesting) or a fun story. Save your money and more importantly your time and pick another book. I actually did not buy this book (my wife bought the book 3 years ago).If the choppiness of this review annoyed you, then Three Junes is especially not for you!"},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"Honestly this book was so slow moving I never ended up fisihing it. I read over half of it and could not bring my self to waste any more time. Just getting through what I did took me for ever because I had to make my self pick up the book and read it. I would not recommend this book. It is just to slow."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"After all the positive reviews, I was shocked to find that this book was completely lifeless and drab. I kept reading more to make sure it wasn't going to get better and then I just had to finish it because I had gotten so far. A major time waster, don't bother!"},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"I has read the reviews before I bought this book and thought I would enjoy it. I really had a hard time getting through it. It was very slow moving. I wish I could get my money back."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"Julia Glass buried her finely designed characters in excessive, useless words. A discard. Not National Book Award Material."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"One of the worst books I've ever read1! I can't believe I wasted my money on it. Extremely boring, and lacking content. The style was most tedious -- like trying to keep up with a perpetual ping-pong game. Characters are shallow. Don't waste you time!"},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"I finished this book yesterday. Surprisingly I got through it in 4 days considering how utterly boring and pointless the book was.First of all, there are no interesting characters in the whole book. The father might have been interesting, but so little time was spent on him and so little information was given about his feelings toward his wife. The gay pathetic son was indeed pathetic and boring. How can you be gay and living in NY and have such a boring life? The music critic, the professor, the brothers and then all of a sudden this pregnant girl had nothing interesting to say. They were neither likable or unlikable. The only interesting thing I can say about the characters is that they all had great jobs (almost too perfect): music critic, chef, veterinarian, bookstore owner, horticulturist, etc.Secondly, nothing happened in the whole book. No great family secrets were revealed. Well, there was a little bit about the mother's affairs, but the book never delved into it very deeply. The people who died were expected to die. The father went to Greece, but nothing happened there. We were never told why Greece was so special to him. There were no great romances in the story. The pathetic gay brother did nothing special.Thirdly, little things would happen in the book that a good writer would expand on and reveal to us some meaning behind people's actions. For example, in the book the brothers find some medals in a vase that they never used. They wondered a bit who the medals were from, but then forget about it. They were probably from the neighbor who probably had an affair with the mother. The reader knows it, but it is not revealed to the brothers. So, what was the purpose of finding some stupid medals in the stupidest place of all - a vase that no one ever knew existed. Pointless.How did this woman get this book published and why are people buying it? She must have really good relations with her publisher to get her so much publicity for such an awful book."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"This is an awful book. I got it as a present and force myself to finish it. Now I don't know what to do with it as I would not inflict it on anybody. Will probably recycle it."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"Award material? I don't think so. Maybe I should start writing books with controversial subject matter. Who but a gay man wants to read about a gay man's affairs and lusts? I wish the reviews and summary had told me what I was going to read before I -in haste- bought this book. I didn't even bother to finish the book, and I am left with a bad taste in my mouth for having tried. Not only does the book delve controversially, but it also proceeds at an exceedingly dull pace (in Book Two). The characters I like most are a tube of lipstick and a parrot...does that deserve accolades? Where are these book award judges living? Mars?"},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"I picked up this book with it's golden seal of approval in haste before a flight departure. I wish I had not bought the book. At the start, the book had some interesting bits, and I could have said at one point that I enjoyed it, but to read the second of the three stories was awful. Case 1: A plodding pace and a character who's life seems to only breathe occasionally. ugh. Case 2: The gay lifestyle does not fit my idea of pleasant reading, with it's deep lust, unrest, turmoil, and the ever present fears and realities of AIDS. For some, possibly this is normal, but I would rather have been told up front that the book was largely narrated by a gay man with many of the accompaniments of that lifestyle; as it is I think the book summary and reviews lead unsuspecting readers into this dark world without fair notice.I do not understand how this book received several rave reviews and the book club award. I agree with so many other reviews that point to shortcomings that should not have been met with top accolades."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"This book was beautifully written, except I felt I was deceived from the beginning. When you read the book from the front cover, back cover, even inside the book with numerous positive commentaries and plot summaries, there is not one word mentioning that this novel's main character is gay and how his gayness affects his family/friends relations. I have nothing against gay people or stories about gay characters. Don't get me wrong (I am from California!). But I felt I was not prepared for this much gayness when I read the book. It deeply disturbed me that the publisher had to go in such length to \\"hide\\" the main plot from its potential readers. Why? Just be honest and come out of the closet! I felt as if I bought a candy that it is supposed to be strawberry flavored. But when I open up the wrapper and eat the candy, I find out it is chocolate flavored. I don't mind chocolate, but not when I want to eat strawberry flavored candy.I believe many readers are like me and would like to know what we get ourselves into before we get involved. Having said all these complaints, I would still read the book after all. I would read it not because I enjoyed the book, but because the book won the \\"National Book Award\\". I try to read as many awarded books as possible."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"I found Julia Glass's writing to be entirely unremarkable. The second section, with Fenno, is by far the most involving of the three, but what frustrated me as I read the book is that it doesn't really feel like a 'novel' to me -- it's three stories (maybe one novella) arbitrarily linked together by small devices (references to Marjorie, etc.), some editor's idea of how they could sell this as a novel rather than a collection of stories. I felt the effort to link these stories forced. Did anyone actually feel as if the Fenno/Tony relationship in part three had any real connection to the Fenno/Tony relationship in part two? Tony was like a different character altogether. And what was Dennis doing with any role in the third story? That too felt forced, as if he did not belong there (and I didn't find his characterization true for a second). It also felt to me as though the children, in the second part -- in Scotland after their father's death -- had no relationship to him at all -- the author had to keep reminding us, or herself, that this story was connected to the first, that they are here because the character in the first story, their father, has died. Do they even miss him? Do they relate to his death in any real way? It seems they have forgotten him. I nearly quit reading this book before the end but forced myself. An unsatisfying experience."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"Three Junes is a nuanced, layered book. After I finished it, I re-read the first section and realized how beautifully the pieces of the book fit together. Glass is too sophisticated, too knowing of the realities of life, to come up with pat endings or make everything fit together too neatly. However, even small characters that are introduced in the first section, Fern's friend Anna for instance, are re-introduced in the later sections with appropriate follow-ups. She shows how different the world can be viewed from various perspectives. For example, in the first section, she details a character, Marjorie, a schoolteacher from Devon, who gets on the nerves of Paul, the main character. Later, Marjorie shows up at Paul's funeral and they seem to have remained in touch through the years. The reader assumes: she kept pushing herself into his life. Paul's son Fenno has a different take on Marjorie-and he wonders-were they good friends. NO , no you want to cry-she got on his nerves-but Fenno never gets to realize his father's take on herth-nor would most people in real life, after someone has died.Bravo!"},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"The first section of this book, \\"Collies,\\" is superb. It depicts Paul McCleod dealing with the death of his longtime wife, Maureen, their relationship on a Scottish breeding farm and Paul and Maureen's three sons--Fenno, and twins Dennis and David. If the quality of that writing had continued, \\"Three Junes,\\" would have been a great book. Sadly, this is not the case. The middle section, \\"Upright,\\" dealing with eldest son, Fenno McCleod is too long, and ultimately uninteresting. The last section, \\"Boys,\\" is better, but unsatisfying because the middle section has failed to fulfill the promise of the first.Julia Glass shows great promise as a writer. Hopefully, she will continue to improve her craft and offer us more selections in the future."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"I started this book and read the first 50 pages and found it torture! I put it down, waited a week, and started it again. I ended up re-reading the beginning 3 times! I really hate to give up on a book - but this one just didn't grab me. Sorry....."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"I had to make myself finish this book. Procrastinated for months. I wanted to fall in love with it, based on a couple of other people's enthusiastic raves, but I just couldn't mesh with the characters. Had a hard time caring about them. The writing is beautiful, true. The book as a whole feels like it's supposed to be an important book. But the motif with the letters frustrated me too much and I started to feel toyed with by the plot. It's impressive, all of it, but maybe wanting too hard to be impressive."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"This novel is excellent for its character development, plot, prose, and so much more. Julia Glass deserved all the praise she received for this tour de force. There are as many good books out there as there are bad ones, but only a few, once in a while, are great like this one. Also, for anyone looking for a great book to discuss in a book group, this would be an excellent choice."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"I have almost finished the novel and must admit that it took some time to get into it at first. I feel that I am now part of the family and that once I finish, I will lose new friends. I recommend this book highly- give it some time in the beginning, however. It is extraordinarily written."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"Julia Glass has a undeniable gift for writing, all the more astonishing since it is her first novel. I was immediately drawn into the lives of the characters who are fully realized and compassionately drawn, and I longed for more when I finished her novel. Although she writes of current issues, I had the sense that the reader was being transported to a different time, perhaps when Henry James and Edith Wharton crafted works of elegant fiction. I look forward to future gems from Ms. Glass."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"Like many before me, I found the first section, \\"Collies,\\" to be superb. Unlike many before me, I did not find Fenno, the subject of the very long second section, to be uninteresting. I found Fenno to be an increasingly common individual in our society who wants to achieve something meaningful in his life, but doesn't know how because either the traditional routes to life's happiness are closed to him (due to his sexual orientation) or he assumes that those routes should not be followed blindly. Could you blame him -- his parents' marriage did not seem to be the perfect match to to any of the siblings. Also, Fenno's experience caring for his dying friend along with the everyday reminder of what intimacy in the gay culture can (in those days, unwittingly) lead to, must have been paralyzing. I HATED Fern -- an absolutely uninteresting character -- what was JG thinking? We're first introduced to her as a young woman in her early 20's as a \\"love\\" interest of Fenno's elderly Dad's, with whom she pals around in Greece. Then we reintroduced to her in the third section as a supposedly sensitive, introspective individual that is worth some of Fenno's most intimate moments?! I think JG tried too hard to tie up loose ends in that book and it showed. Despite the last section, I thought book was worth reading, although questionably worthy of its awards."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"I very much appreciate this book, and really enjoyed reading it after getting over my initial doubts. At first I was so struck by the language. The book is written in astonishing style, but felt to me over-&quot;styled&quot;, in a way I felt the language so called attention to itself it overpowered the story to some extent. The other side to this was my frequent surprise/admiration of the author's choices of language. Another thing that I noted was that the dialogues or even passing comments by the characters were almost uniformly always polished, witty, and overly similar in style from character to character; I often thought, oh please, nobody talks this way. But this book is able to achieve amazing insight in the most subtle ways. Nothing is hammered home. The reader is not spoon-fed the important things, but rather gathers the beautiful pieces of insight, tenderness, and understanding in unexpected places, and sometimes between the lines. It is not a fast, easy read or a painfully slow read. It is the kind of book you savor rather than devour; every once in a awhile I put it down just to absorb what I had just read. All in all, in my view, a real accomplishment."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"This book is divided into three intertwining sections; each section has in common some of the same characters and the month of June, where Important Things happen &#65533; people die and babies are conceived. This is NOT a quick read; it is a literary novel that you can either tire of or admire (or in my case, both). As in many literary novels, there are many reflective passages that do little to move the story forward or tie up loose ends in the plot.The story focuses on the McLeod family, a Scottish clan from which the eldest son, Fenno, has departed for NYC, only to return after the death of his mother, Maureen, and several years later his father, Paul. There&#65533;s a lot of back stories to learn about Fenno and his younger twin brothers, David and Dennis, as well as the secret life of Maureen, and later Paul, who moved to Greece after his wife&#65533;s death. There&#65533;s also Fern, a young woman Paul meets and develops a crush on during his first trip to Greece, and who resurfaces in the book&#65533;s last section. Needless to say, there&#65533;s a lot going on here, and much of our information comes from Fenno&#65533;s perspective, and he is not the most likeable character.Criticisms aside, this was an interesting, elegantly written novel that&#65533;s worth getting through, even though you may feel somewhat shortchanged at the inconclusive end."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"Although beautifully written in certain places, the writing is more often pendantic, plodding, obtuse, and self indulgent. Rather than a novel, this book is more realistically a collection of three loosely related essays that would appeal only to the most patient of readers. Characters are introduced, the reader comes to care about them, only for the author to abandon them altogether. Major issues are introduced (i.e., the mother's possible relationships with another man, Paul's possible relationship with Marjorie in Greece, and the chance encounter between Fenno and Fern -- who had met Fenno's father a decade before), but are never explored, fully developed, discovered by those who should have discovered them, or resolved. There are so many loose ends, the book nearly unravels. The ending is equally dissatisfying, as the \\"novel\\" merely peters out. Perhaps the author simply ran out of ways to twist a sentence into near oblivion."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"When Jonathan Safran Foer's name first hit the bookstores on the cover of his debut best seller, Everything is Illuminated, expectations were high and eyebrows were raised. Widely hyped, admired, and considered the newest literary sensation, Safran Foer's absence from the National Book Award nominations made waves within the book world. Heads turned when the his fellow debut writer Julia Glass's novel won the coveted prize for fiction. Comparatively unknown, Glass wrote her book at the age of 46, while Jonathan Safran Foer was merely 22 when he completed his novel. He had spent practically a lifetime preparing for his massive undertaking of language, studying writing under Joyce Carol Oates and winning every Creative Writing contest Princeton offered during his time as an ambitious undergraduate. Another Ivy graduate, Glass left Yale with an Art degree and half a lifetime of the unknown in front of her before she would achieve the success that would rival Safran Foer. But according to one of Three Junes vivid characters, \\"When it comes to life, we spin our own yarn, and where we end up is really, in fact, where we always intended to be.\\" If Three Junes is any indication, then award-winning contemporary fiction is exactly what Glass intended on.Julia Glass' age and experience in studio art are reflected in her beautifully composed narrative. Three Junes manages to cover death, secrets, and heartbreaking love between friends, family, and lovers. Surprisingly, Glass is able to evade the painstaking sentimentalism that a lesser skilled author, like Safran Foer, might fall victim. The novel is constructed as a tryptic, or a painting consisting of three canvases fastened together, the middle canvas often the larger focal point of the composition. The first section, Collies, introduces the reader to Paul McLeod, a recent Scottish widower vacationing in Greece in 1989. Paul's interest in a young, vernal American art student (aptly named Fern) and his moving, yet matter of fact, memories of his late wife are enough bate to reel the reader in. However, it is not until the second section of the novel that one realized the complexity and intoxication of Three Junes.In second of the Three Junes entitled Upright, Paul's oldest son, Fenno, is narrating his father's funeral arrangements at the McLeod's Scottish estate in 1995. Back and forth through time, Fenno presently admits his envy towards his younger twin brothers' ideal, yet problematic, married lives. In discovering Fenno's past, the reader witnesses his isolating intellectual strength, as well as his paralyzing fear of his own homosexuality. Most potently depicted through his friendship with Mal, here, Glass fully fleshes out her characters into living, breathing people by combining rich, descriptive prose with sharp, realistic witticisms.\\"Mal's eyes were his most striking feature. A very pale blue, the color of shaded snow, they could appear almost white, like a blind man's eyes, when caught in the sun. Now they brightened with tears, and a ghastly silence spread between us. He said at last, \`I am regrettably, to use the medical softshell, \`immuno-compromised.'\\"Glass proficiently describes Fenno's preoccupation of contracting HIV. \\"Upright, I would tell myself as I savored the visual innuendos of a trimly mustached business student, as I pictured us falling together into my bed. Stay upright and you will stay alive.\\" Though the entire novel deals with death, this is Fenno's only admission that he, himself, fears for his own mortality.Boys, the final section of the novel, focuses on Fern's retrospective view of her own life as she makes plans for the future among men that have ties to her past. It feels more of an epilogue than another completed section, tracing Fenno's reentry into life, and tying up some important loose ends that make the section ultimately worthwhile.An author often needs to clear her throat before she gets to the meat of her writing. Glass, in one way or another, has been accused of this by many critics, who argue that Upright is the pinnacle of the novel, totally outweighing its adjoining parts. And although Upright could arguable stand on its own, its role as the large, important center of the tryptic must be considered before any disdain is relegated towards its counterparts. The choice of focus remains in the artist's hand, or in this case, pen. Fenno's life is the centerpiece, totally in focus, while Paul and Fern are on the peripheral, framing Fenno's dominant story, creating a marked centerpiece painted in a rich textural experience.Glass' dense writing is lush and arresting, forcing the reader to absorb every sultry phrase before continuing on with the story. Although overwriting is a typical weakness of many beginners, Glass manages to create rich, slow-moving images without weighing down Three Junes in any unnecessary literary baggage. But throughout her sumptuous prose, she includes contemporary references to OJ Simpson and fertility drugs that send a jolted rush of reality through the timeless world she creates.Three Junes' elegant portrayal of a young man's life that revolves around repressed homosexuality and the AIDs epidemic is reminiscent of another highly acclaimed novel of 2002. Jeffrey Eugenides' Pulitzer Prize winning, Middlesex, concerns a young, hermaphroditic Greek individual who similarly suffers from academic brilliance and a well-detailed lineage in addition to her sexual apprehension. However, Glass manages to bring a distinct light to pleasure and pain of family, as well as a fresh way of dealing with the trauma of being in love-- in life and in death. \\"Some of us get love just . . . exactly . . . right-- as right as it can be,\\" Glass writes, \\"--and others get everything else right but.\\"\\"I will need to sleep for hours and hours before waking to look again at the life I am learning, just learning to live,\\" Fenno says at the end of Upright. For a novel that so grimly delves into the depths of post-mortem anxiety, Glass succeeds by filling the pages of Three Junes with an overwhelming sense of life. Her maturity and artistry foster a winning story cradled in impressive prose that skillfully trades the typical sentimental panacea for realistic poignance. Julia Glass certainly proves herself worthy of the National Book Award and a highly esteemed spot in contemporary fiction-- Whether she intended to be here, or not."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"It has been said that Three Junes \\"rescues and refurbishes\\" the plot-driven novel, and it is easy to argue that the relatively mild-mannered main characters are pulled about by events that are not of their own making. Julia Glass makes particularly striking contrasts between many of the prominent male characters and the much more fiery and strong-willed women in their lives --generally their mothers and wives. Those who study the craft of writing will be impressed with the way the author weaves past and present action and first and third person narrative. While I recommend this book fairly strongly, particularly for its craft and introspection, I suspect some readers won't feel completely satisfied at the end as the book doesn't seem to build to a climax or tie up every loose end completely. For those who feel that literary fiction is always depressing, this book touches on tough subjects such as AIDS, childlessness and failed relationships while keeping an ultimately hopeful outlook. Those who liked the strong characters of Michael Cunningham's The Hours or the episodic narration of Barbara Kingsolver's The Poisonwood Bible, will probably find this to be a fine novel."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"After starting this book once before and putting it down from boredom, I was determined to finish it the second time around. (Upon finishing the book I realized I should not have been so determined).The novel, broken up into three parts, lacks reader interest, good story flow and connectivity. The author tries to tell the story and history of the McLeod family but I found it way too complicated to comprehend the story the author was trying to convey."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"Julia Glass offers her readers a personal connection to the lives she unveils in this brilliant first novel. The writing style practically sings the stories of the three main characters. I liked this book as much if not more than I enjoyed Michael Cunningham's The Hours. The themes in both books are similar, but unlike the characters in Cunningham's novel, Glass provides the backdrop of the commonality of love, life, and relationships. I felt that I could have been any one of the main characters and that any of the supporting characters might have stepped out of my own life. You will appreciate the honesty in Glass' words as she reveals the merging lives of her characters.I found this book to be a quick read. Even more so, it kept me impatient at work, wanting to return public transportation or a lunch break just to read another few pages. Yet, because of its sensitive content regarding homosexual relationships, some may feel less of a connection with the book. I was also disappointed that some tangents went unclarified. This, again, is so similar to life--we don't have all the answers. It also leaves a sense of wonder and imagination in the reader. We can interpret these mini-story lines as we want. A FANTASTIC read!"},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"This is without a doubt a beautiful book. It is well-written and so clear that you can feel and see the places, people, events and emotions. It is so full of familial love in spite of the imperfections of human lives. The characters are interesting and well-developed. However, I felt like there were some loose ends or plot twists that needed to be tied up to give the story more sense and depth. The character of Fern comes to mind. She pops up at the end in an almost unbelievable turn of events and her story takes away from the focus on the family. Also, Maureen's love affair with the neighbor should have been addressed in more detail to feel better the impact on the members of the family. I felt like there was too much implied in the relationship between the parents and not enough presented in detail. Besides being confusing, it contributes to an overall lack of depth. On the other side, the friendship between Fenno and Mal is so beautifully presented and developed. It is one of the most outstanding parts of the book. I wish that all the relationships in the book were developed like theirs. That would have made the book entirely unforgettable."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"THREE JUNES, for this reader, succeeds on many, many levels. Julia Glass has written a cohesively intricate tale that picks up characters from a Whitman's Sampler and manages to make them all intertwine, alter, grow, and learn.The story of a Scottish clan whose history and present tense span a decade has been well documented in the other reviews and in the editorial comments. Read all of that - after you've immersed yourself in this lovely book - and come to your own conclusions.There are many wonders in this gifted author's first novel. For one, how as a woman she can write so sensitively, so innately intelligently about the psyche of her gay male narrator is proof of a humbling talent. That is not a sexist observation: many male novelists have attempted to convey the fears of self acceptance, of living life as a gay male, of struggling with the need/repulsion of being in a meaningful relationship, of coping with the quiet knock of death that has accompanied the evolution of HIV, the will to be a whole human individual while fearing the shedding of the comforting skin of family history. These are the only a few of issues that Julia Glass addresses in this eminently readable novel. She has created unforgetable characters (the at once flagrant yet emotionally elusive Mal - a music critic whose true history is revealed to his closest friend only after he ends his life on an AIDS bed, the daunting Fenno whose life choices drive this maze of interconnected families and tangential friendships, the hilarious Dennis and his glowing French wife, two unforgetable parents in Paul and Maureen, the tender/vulnerable Lil whose connections to the clan into which she marries alters the story at every turn, the artist Tony who seduces everyone including the reader while he avoids living in the present by making photographic art of it all.Glass seems to be addressing the fact that each of us pays mental and verbal homage to the concept of love but spend our lives trying to grasp it like the elusive gold ring on the carrousel. This is a panoramic novel, delivering the sights and smells and air of Scotland, Greece and the New York as a wonderfully rendered backdrop to the human comedy of errors. In her words \\"Never talk yourself out of knowing you're in love...or into thinking that you are\\" and 'Mind what you love. For that matter, mind how you are loved.' This multifaceted story will linger in readers' minds long after the last page is turned."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"Three Junes is an authentically startling novel both in it's lyrical beauty and in the emotional openess and fragile self assessments that ensue. This novel takes place over a ten year period, focusing on the pivotal month of June in three separate years. The story begins with a widower Paul, in Greece with a tour group, taking a clear look at his life, what his dreams were, what his desires were and where his life took him. Did he settle and consider himself lucky, does he decide to turn things around and direct his future from his true heart? In the next section of this novel the focus is on Pauls' oldest son, Fenno. He is a quiet, bookstore owner who left Scotland for America in order to live his own life and now ponders these same thoughts after the death of his father. His return home for the funeral opens his eyes to many paths in life, those taken, those not taken out of fear and those that remain open. The final portion of the novel involves a young widow, pregnant less than two years after her husbands death. She too approaches these life lessons from a different perspective and yet with very much the same results. The author, Julia Glass creates a beautiful novel in which people are pulled outside of their lives and given the opportunity to examine their past. The characters take the chance to look at the map of their life and make the decisions to alter their path to continue the journey and to take it to where they choose for it to go."},{"Title":"Three Junes","review":"And, yes, the title of my review is either a backhanded compliment or a roundabout criticism. You may choose.What I mean by it is this-- Glass is skilled at the small vignette. The individual sections of the work have been justly praised for their warmness and luminosity. The first section, \\"Collies\\", is particularly strong. She writes the moments extremely well. She captures and unfolds them like little bits of paper, or found photographs. I enjoyed the book for her pure skill at exactly these things.Unfortunately, Three Junes works much less well as a novel. The interwoven time threads become unnecessarily complicated. The structure forces the reader to work for an understanding of the plot. That work remains unrewarded, since the plot isn't weighty enough to really sustain that kind of work. The book functions best as a kind of character study, moments-in-time book. The moments of realization themselves are in the end rather standard-- very sentimental and nearly banal. The structure focuses the reader away from the strongest parts of the book and onto the weakest, unfortunately.As a first novel, it was enjoyable and impressive. I would recommend the book. Think of it as the literary equivalent of sitting on a hot beach in the summer. It does not need to be the nicest beach or the most beautiful in order to bask in the general warmth."},{"Title":"Inequality Reexamined (Russell Sage Foundation Books)","review":"I read this book in one sitting, and let me say it is a great book.It is odd so few books are written on such a basic philosophical question as equality, and reading mister Sen is akin to drinking a cold glass of water for a man in a desert of political philosophy.The prose is somewhat weak, the stye is stilted, and that oddly only seems to add to mister Sens' achievement: I never get the feeling that when I turn the next page I will be bored or watch him say something unnecessarily pedantic. The whole book is carried solely by the interesting subject at hand and mister Sens endlessly excellent commentary on it.That having been said, I agree with none of it. I do not value equality in any way, and my politics are thoroughly aristocratic and Old Right. So perhaps the possible reader should take that into account: I have nothing but praise for mister Sens books, and this book in particular is an excellent dive. Perhaps praise from a trenchant enemy is worth more than praise from the ideologically like minded.I will be reading it and making notes and attacks on it for a year to come, at the very least. No matter how you view equality, I advocate mister Sen without reservation. This is excellent. Please buy it."},{"Title":"Inequality Reexamined (Russell Sage Foundation Books)","review":"Sen, a Nobel prize winner, has had many great ideas in his career, but this book just sticks to a few of them. The big point he hits early on is that all political theories are theories of egalitarianism: The only difference is how they answer the question, \\"Equality of what?\\"For instance, libertarians believe that everyone has an equal right to negative liberty, utilitarians believe in a right to an equal weighting in the arithmetic social well-being function, and Rawlsians believe in a right to equal \\"basic goods.\\"Where does Sen fit in? A little hard to tell from this work--he's good at the \\"consider this alternative\\" style of writing--but he emphasizes a blend of utilitarianism and Rawlsianism, one that takes seriously what it would really mean to give every human being a decent shot at a humane life. His standards are actually quite low--non-utopian to be sure--but he looks in every nook and cranny and finds much more than you'd expect.In particular, Sen emphasizes how accidents of birth such as health create an underlying inequality across people that often can only be reversed at great expense. On a non-health-related issue, I often ask myself how many tax dollars the people of Britain had to pay to ensure that Salman Rushdie was able to enjoy his right to life and his right to free speech. The point, of course, is that it often costs quite a bit to guarantee some citizens the bare minimum of liberty.So egalitarianism requires unequal government action, as Rushdie himself could tell you. In many different ways, Sen makes this point throughout his text.If you're looking to read a book by Sen, I wouldn't make this the first one: Read his Development As Freedom first--it's his summary of his life's work, well written and deeply insightful. My economics students love reading Development As Freedom. But if you're looking for a second book by Sen, one that will challenge you and please you, I can recommend this book without hesitation."},{"Title":"Inequality Reexamined (Russell Sage Foundation Books)","review":"The most basic idea, that one person's equality is another's inequality, is explored in detail. Sen illuminates many of the flaws in standard economic thinking, and how the philosophical underpinnings of economics guide and distort economic reasoning."},{"Title":"Inequality Reexamined (Russell Sage Foundation Books)","review":"I just received my copy of this book thinking it contained current ideas of Amartya Sen only to discover it was published in 1992.

It is indeed a marvellous piece of work."},{"Title":"Power and Restraint: The Moral Dimension of Police Work","review":"Every line officer and every police manager can benefit from this book. Anyone involved in hiring new police officers should have this book on the short list of required reading. This country has a need for improving ethics and morality in police work. Now more than ever the very best police officers must be hired and serve the public fairly and objectively. This book articulates the ideal. It is not theoretical, but practical. The book explains how and why police decisions should be made."},{"Title":"Heritage of the Desert","review":"Perhaps, with the exception of Riders of the Purple Sage, Heritage of the Desert is the best western Zane Grey ever wrote. It combines every thing one expects to find in the genre, and then adds a little bit more you don't expect to find. It is the basic story of a young man, John Hare, who has come west to regain his health and to find his place in life only to be branded \\"Dene's spy\\" and becomes a hunted man. There is the Mormon element, only in this book they receive favorable treatment by Zane Grey; there are animal heros; a faithful Indian companion to the heroine, a half-Indian girl, Mescal; rustlers and land thieves; a favored son gone bad; and the canyon country of Utah described as only the master detailer can depict it in all of its glory and spendor. With this book Zane Grey set the standard by which he himself had to live up to with each succeeding novel, and HE DID."},{"Title":"Heritage of the Desert","review":"A classic western novel. Zane Grey is one of the best writers of the old west. His novels were written of the time when the west was being populated by people from the east.

While older sister Nessa was portrayed very accurately as a nagging, uptight, meddlesome worrier...after a while I just wanted to scream!! Half of the nagging was unneccessary for the plot or character development- and it just left me aggitated.However, the younger sister, Bree, is what really took away from this book. The lack of reality that went into developing this character is mind-blowing. O'Flanagan is almost partronizing any reader who attempts to learn about Bree....does O'Flanagan honestly think that Michael was ever Bree's \\"boyfriend?\\" Let me just say, the continuous referral to Bree's \\"ex-boyfriend\\" (whom she ALMOST, but never did kiss- at the age of 25....) left me wondering just how immature the writer, or the reader, was expected to be to believe this. At first I was able to dismiss it, thinking this continuous reference to the guy she \\"loved\\" after three dates, who was her \\"boyfriend\\" even though they never even kissed, was O'Flanagan's way of expressing Bree's immaturity and lack of experience. However, when the seemingly worldly sisters started referring to Michael as Bree's \\"ex-boyrfriend\\" I just about stopped reading this book altogether.Aside from this, the only character that really did it for me was Cate. But unfortunately, the author only skims the surface with her, and we are left seeing her through other character's eyes, rather than directly into her.The plot was great. I can only imagine how wonderful this book COULD have been with better characters."},{"Title":"A preliminary investigation of groundwater contamination in the downtown Tucson area, Pima County, Arizona","review":"I wanted a book to entertain me while traveling and this book did the trick. (I needed a book that I would not feel out of touch if I was not able to pick it up for a couple weeks.) Nessa, Cate and Bree made me laugh, yell, etc. with the sibling problems and love for one another. Through thick and thin your sisters will always be there for you.This is the first book I've read from Sheila O'Flanagan and I really enjoyed it. I plan to read more of her books in the near future."},{"Title":"A preliminary investigation of groundwater contamination in the downtown Tucson area, Pima County, Arizona","review":"In Ireland, of the three Driscoll siblings, Nessa seems to be the one to have it all together. She has lived in comfort as a Riley with Adam for almost a decade and they have an eight year old child. Her sisters Cate and Bree are poster girls for failed relationships.However, Nessa believes paradise may be lost as evidence mounts that Adam is cheating especially when she consults her horoscope. Nessa wonders what to do as economically she cannot just dump Adam. She has no one to turn to for advice as her mother lives on the other side of the once emerald isle; Cate the crabby one is having problems with her boyfriend radio host Finn over her pregnancy; and finally Bree the mechanic has a host of trouble as she can't get to work on time though Adam keeps her supplied with repairs and the father of her boyfriend is in love with her.HE'S GOT TO GO is an entertaining relationship drama starring three solid female protagonists about a decade apart in age and even further distanced in how they see male partners. The story line effortlessly swings back and before between the three women though the concentration is more on Nessa, but does not neglect Cate and Bree. The characters are all well developed, not just the three Driscoll sisters. Though the ending ties up for the most part the lives of Nessa and Cate and to a lesser degree Bree, it feels much too crammed inside a short climax. Still the audience will enjoy this fine tale and want to seek more works by Sheila O'Flanagan.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"A preliminary investigation of groundwater contamination in the downtown Tucson area, Pima County, Arizona","review":"Keeping in mind European relationships are vastly different than American, I found this book to be extremely entertaining.

Cate is the successful career woman, living with media star, Finn. Bree is the tomboy, working as a mechanic and never seeming to settle down. All their lives are thrown for a loop - or two, when Cate finds herself pregnant, Nessa finds Adam has multiple women on the side and Bree finds an ex's father is interested in her! The girls turn to each other and eventually sort things out - with lots of laughs in between.A clever twist to the familiar combination of sisters as a basis for a book. I was a bit disappointed that the book ended without the birth of the baby, or the divorce, though. Most of all, the author missed-out on Michael's reaction to Bree seeing his father, Declan. Maybe this was to leave room for a sequel? Marvelous twist to the common affair and kudos for Finn's grand gesture.

Each quiltmaker is profiled and a gallery of exciting work is displayed. In addition, each artist shares a project. Each project is well-illustrated and many detail interesting techniques as well as insights into how other quilts were constructed. The layout of the book is stunning--beautiful, rich color and crisp, clear photographs. It's a joy to look at as well as to read. Quilts from Europe is a wonderful addition to any quiltmaker's library."},{"Title":"Quilts from Europe: Projects & Inspiration","review":"I purchased this book unseen and was bissfully enthralled when I finally viewed it. WOW! The work showcased is diverse and thrillingly divine. Use of colour is totally inspiring - exquisite - a colour &quot;hit&quot; (for you colour junkies out there). For me this book evokes a great feeling of spontaneity, but also respect for true craftwomenship in colour and design - the artists make it look sooo easy!The photos through out the book are very clear so the quilting can also be seen well on most pieces. Some of the photos could have been bigger (where there is more than one quilt per page), but generally the photo size has been chosen with great skill balancing maximum number of pictures per artist with maximum detail.All the quilts are DEFINITELY contemporary ie not traditional, although I would have called Rennee Gosse's (France) &quot;boutis&quot; pieces more traditional. I have seen a similar technique called French trapunto.It was the most wonderful surprise to discover that each artist provides a project and shares their secrets to recreate that fabulous project. All the projects are a joy to look at and are crying out to be started. In particular, Anne Woringer (France), Dorle Stern-Straeter (Germany) and Odile Texiers (France) projects are truly sensational and I thank them for being so generous in sharing techniques that can only be considered as THEIR OWN as they are the trademarks of each of the mentioned artists work. So, so amazingly exciting!!!Beginners or unconfident sewers/quilters may not find the projects easy or detailed enough as the directions are brief, although, I consider them precise enough, enabling me to reproduce the particular technique I'm interested in. Personally I really like the layout with minimal, to the point text supported with diagrams. Again the spontaneity of the works shines through as many of the artists improvise as the work is created.This &quot;treasure&quot; has not left my bedside all year and has been like a key opening creative floodgates. Numerous blocks and quilt designs have gushed forth from reading this fantastic book and realising the unending possibilities for the techniques demonstrated.Anyone who likes contemporary works, consider this a MUST for your bookshelf. A true delight, a visual feast and high powered fuel for creativity. I can't wait for the next book in the series (yep, that IS a hint! - please I beg you!)"},{"Title":"Quilts from Europe: Projects & Inspiration","review":"I had seen this book at a friends house and really wanted one of my own.

I was studying in Rome, and I recall the hangdog looks of my American classmates. They were deeply ashamed. America tried to cope by setting up a commission, interrogating witnesses, running the video over, and over, and over... It must have been just like that for the first Jesus People. Crucifixion meant deep degradation. The first Jesus People, being Jews, coped by turning to their Scriptures. There they began slowly to see things they had never seen before, to find answers to the question: Why this? Texts from Isaiah, Jeremiah, the Psalms, started froth from their original context, and were pieced togther into patchwork quilts, old pieces in new patterns which would evolve over decades into the passion narratives of Mark, Matthew, Luke, John. In this process the initial earthquake of the crucifixion would be followed by historical aftershocks: the destruction of the Jerusalem Temple; the Great Fire of Rome; the expulsion of the Jesus People from the synagogues... Each aftershock would provide fresh impulse to the process of recycling Hebrew Scriptures into Christian Gospels. The Trauma of the Cross is an extended look at this process of coping with crucifixion and the resultant birth of the New Testament. As such it will appeal not only to Jews and Christians by highlighting their shared heritage, but it will also appeal to the strictly secular historian of ideas by tracing the genesis of an Idea of unprecedented staying power."},{"Title":"Winning the Oil Endgame: Innovation for Profit, Jobs and Security","review":"I have always admired Amory Lovins and his Rocky Mountain Institute, but this book does not impress me at all. I recommend instead \\"The Long Emergency\\", by James Kunstler, and Richard Heinberg's latest two books on peak energy (\\"The Party's Over\\", and \\"Powerdown\\").Also, Winning the Endgame is availabe free as a download, from the RMI site, so I can't imagine why anyone would purchase it.Look, the energy problem is insurmountable.....just two examples are enough to make this point. First, Lovins' book (in the Executive Summary) says that we can again \\"make natural gas abundant and affordable...\\". This is an absurd statement and doesn't even deserve more of a response.Secondly, within the next ten years or LESS, the world will have consumed an additional amount of oil, EQUAL TO the ENTIRE proven, recoverable reserves of Saudi Arabia, and Arabia has for years been considered the world's swing producer!Finally, Lovins' dreams of building millions and millions of ultra light-weight vehicles are just that, DREAMS! The remaining world supply of crude oil and natural gas are simply not great enough to bootstrap our efforts to create a new, pervasive light-weight transportation fleet, even if government and private industry had the money to capitalize the effort. And what exactly would we DO with the billion or more \\"inefficient\\" vehicles that exist in the world now?As for bio-fuels, and other alternatives, there is no way they will or can provide anything close to the future energy-density that the world needs. Furthermore, growing \\"bio\\" fuels requires massive amounts of crude oil (for fertilizer, pesticides, processing, not to mention the vehicles needed to harvest and transport these crops, plus the energy required to pump the water to irrigate them).Just read Kunstler's book, and Heinberg's books...the party IS over...."},{"Title":"Winning the Oil Endgame: Innovation for Profit, Jobs and Security","review":"This study was co-funded by the Pentagon -- a plan for reducing U.S. oil use by 50% by 2025, and ending foreign oil dependency. Amory Lovins has been pursuing energy efficiency and renewable energy since the 1970s, when he wrote the influential SOFT ENERGY PATHS. That initiative was thrown off-track by the drop in oil prices in the 1980s. Now Lovins is back in demand in the post-9/11 world with the global Hubbert's Peak for oil upon us.This is not a radical strategy. It is market-based, and is all based on existing technology. According to Lovins and his co-authors,\\"...it will cost less to displace all of the oil that the United States now uses than it will cost to buy that oil. Oil's current market price leaves out its true costs to the economy, national security, and the environment. But even without including those now \\"externalized\\" costs, it would still be profitable to displace oil competely over the next few decades. In fact, by 2025, the annual economic benefit of that displacement would be $130 billion gross (or $70 billion net of the displacement's costs).\\"WINNING THE OIL ENDGAME involves 4 shifts -- 1) doubling the efficiency of using oil, through measures such as ultralight vehicle design, 2) applying creative business models and public policies to speed the profitable adoption of superefficient light vehicles, heavy trucks and airplanes, 3) embarking on the crash development of biofuels, cellulosic ethanol in particular, and 4) applying efficiency measures to save 50% of the projected 2025 use of natural gas.Lovins goes on to elaborate necessary policies, such as feebates as incentives for consumers, government acquisition plans, federal loan guarantees, and so forth. He notes that while eminently practical and market-based, the plan will not benefit all companies. He points to the examples of Shell and BP, oil companies that are in the process of tranforming themselves into energy companies, as models for success in this energy transition. (see www.oilendgame.com for more)I admit that I am not by nature optimistic about the human condition, but Amory Lovins is, and he always makes me feel more confident about the future. Despair and fatalism produce nothing of value, so each and every one of us should join Amory Lovins and the Pentagon and fight for an end to foreign oil dependency, and fight for renewable energy! That will certainly mean fighting the Bush/Cheney Oil Administration -- let's roll!"},{"Title":"Winning the Oil Endgame: Innovation for Profit, Jobs and Security","review":"This study was funded partially by the Pentagon and written by scientists from the Rocky Mountain Institute, led by Amory Lovins. According to them, the US could end the need to import oil by 2040, and not need oil at all by 2050. \\"Winning The Oil Endgame\\" talks a game of improved efficiency, making cars out of lightweight carbon instead of steel, powering them with hybrid engines, substituting with biofuels, and using saved natural gas until Hydrogen fuel technology takes over in 2050.Unfortunately, some data indicates the oil will already be all gone by 2040.Lovins's plan requires extensive subsidy input from lobby-infested Congress. At the same time (for those businesses that would profit), it's business oriented and would create business savings and profits.BTW, before I forget to mention it: No wonder the Pentagon is concerned about oil usage: every tank that proceeds at 1/2 mpg is followed by two fuel trucks. Enemy artillary units have quickly learned to target those trucks first.I don't share Lovins's optimism about voluntary Congressional, political, corporate, or personal compliance with this plan. I have noticed, however, that every time gas prices go up, fewer people buy SUV's and more hybrid vehicles are sold. I believe most of his technologies will occur as societies become convinced that we really are ruining the atmosphere - and especially when they find oil really is running out and is pricing itself out of reach. They will then be forced into making do with less oil - and eventually doing without it altogether. Meanwhile, PV solar panels are way too inefficient, I don't see wind power taking off, biofuels are inefficient to produce (and their production uses energy), and I wouldn't discount prematurely the need for many more nuclear plants.Very much worth reading - you can read it on the internet as I did - downloaded from RMI homepage."},{"Title":"Winning the Oil Endgame: Innovation for Profit, Jobs and Security","review":"The book is available for download in pdf from the author's site without charge."},{"Title":"Winning the Oil Endgame: Innovation for Profit, Jobs and Security","review":"OK, I've never written a review - but I feel really passionate about this book.

I run my business on wind power. I drive the most fuel efficient car on the market (2001 Honda Insight) and compete in fuel economy competitions. In short, I've done a ton of research on this topic.This book, however, has everything I know and contributes 10x as much that I don't on almost every page.Note: It covers topics ranging from the biofuels, nuclear, our government's actions versus others, military strategy, hybrids on the market, etc, etc, etc. If it weren't so expensive, I would give copies to family and friends."},{"Title":"Winning the Oil Endgame: Innovation for Profit, Jobs and Security","review":"This is one of the few books around on actually trying to solve the energy problems, and he puts up enough thinking and new concepts that the book is definitely worth reading. For instance, his main thrust is for the auto industry to develop untra light vehicles that get double the gas mileage.Having watched the auto industry over the past few years go on a spree of building bigger and heavier SUV's I am not encouraged that they are willing. The auto industry fought the CAFE (corporate average fuel economy) rules that were in place, and they got the Republicans to kill it. The auto unions fought it just as hard because building SUV's required more workers, so they got the Democrats to kill it. Now this book says that we could give the auto companies government backed loans to help them do what other companies (Toyota, Honda, etc. have already done). Maybe I would agree if you cut management and worker incomes.Hey, if you want to get double the gas mileage, reduce the speed limits. You save 40% by reducing speed from 70 to 55. Or take a penny or two out of the highway trust fund and put it into Amtrak - perhaps free travel for students, military, seniors and greatly reduced fares for anyone riding the train rather than driving.This book was at least partially funded by the Defense Department and they state: 'We adopt only options that provide 2025 mobility transparently to the user, with no change of lifestyle or loss of convenience.'Sorry guys, it isn't going to work that way.

His assemblage boxes of materials on topics ranging from rabbits to Lauren Bacall to the ornaments and symbols of childhood make for fascinating viewing. Cornell is a curious personality. On the one hand, he self-documented to a far greater extent than many artists, so that a relatively rich record of &quot;what the artist was thinking&quot; exists. On the other hand, he lived his life in a reclusive, introspective, elusive way, so that the viewer never quite feels that s/he has &quot;gotten one's arms&quot; around his perspective.Lindsay Blair's &quot;Joseph's Cornell's Vision of Spiritual Order&quot; uses as its critical basis the foundations of Cornell's beliefs and influences, in an effort to help make the more elusive aspects of his work a bit clearer. She writes excellent passages about the way in which Cornell was influenced by, but certainly not at all co-opted by, the surrealist artists. She adroitly uses passages from Cornell's own writings, as well as analogies from his personal history, to provide cogent criticism which is less &quot;art critic projection&quot; and more a sincere, highly readable attempt to &quot;get into&quot; the mind of a man whose mind assiduously resisted such invasions.Ms. Blair recognizes that Christian Science, Mr. Cornell's faith, has an impact on his work. In this respect, her writing is less revelatory, as her summation of the new thought ideas of Christian Science are a bit reductive. Mr. Cornell's work obviously has strong religious roots. Although Ms. Blair seems to have read up on some basic ideals of the faith, the passages in which she discusses Mr. Cornell's faith's influence on his work seem much less insightful than her discussion of the effects of other aspects of his personal life upon his work. One wonders if Mr. Cornell had been from a more &quot;mainstream&quot; faith if the explicitly religious motivation for some of his work (as revealed in his own writings) might have gotten a more comprehensive and detailed treatment than Ms. Blair accords here.This is a very fine book, certainly one worth owing, but ironically, the reader is left wanting a bit more discussion of the actual &quot;vision of a spiritual order&quot; and perhaps a bit less traditional art criticism.This book has wonderful photographs of Cornell's work, and functions well as criticism, as biography, and as a thought-provoking piece on Cornell's curious place in the art world. If one is familiar with Cornell's work, this is a fascinating inroad further into its meaning. If one is, as I am, less a hard-core Cornell devotee than one who has encountered his work relatively recently, this is a well-done introduction to his art and thinking. The book is relatively free of that self-serving &quot;look how smart the critic is&quot; art talk that besieges so much of this genre. Despite my quibbles about its &quot;flaws&quot;, I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"EMULATION-WORKING EXPLAINED.","review":"What an incredible book!!! plenty of information and a definite source for the brethen dedicated to review Emulation Ritual.

He has evidently researched his material thoroughly and has mastered the subject matter.

I have taught using a variety of math texts and, in my professional opinion, IMP is the best by far. Compared to traditional curricula that teach procedures and algorithms, IMP teaches students how to understand math--not just how to *do* math. The program is problem-based, which allows students to interact with math in a much more authentic context than traditional texts that just require students to manipulate algebraic symbols without really understanding what any of it means. Students who use IMP enjoy taking math, understand how it is relevant to their lives, are more likely to take future math classes, are better able to communicate their ideas, and still score as well or better than peers taking traditional math. In fact, IMP has been identified by the U.S. Department of Education's Mathematics and Science Expert Panel (1999) as an exemplary mathematics program (See The Mathematics Teacher. Oct 2001 Vol.94, Iss. 7; pg. 540 for a detailed review).For some reason, there are a lot of opponents of IMP and other reform curricula. I believe they feel threatened by a new way of learning math that is different than the way the learned it growing up. When I was in school, I learned traditional math and did well grade-wise. I got excellent grades and eventually majored in mathematics, but I did not really understand a lot of what I learned. I knew how to *do* it extremely well, but I didn't understand how to use it in the real-world. I have learned as much math *teaching* with IMP as I ever did as a math major.There is a great deal of research on the subject, and I encourage anyone interested to look more into it instead of listening solely to myself or those with opposing opinions."},{"Title":"Interactive Math Program: Year 4","review":"I loved this program. I can say that I was far better prepared for college than any of my peers. These problems forced me to understand math in my own way, not to simply learn a formula, memorize it and learn where to use it. I learned how to form my own formulas, why they work, where they're useful and so much more. Some of it made me want to pull my hair out (I always had problems with the In/Out tables!), but I was forced to think. I could actually feel the strain of trying to comprehend, and it was wonderful. It gave me a thirst for knowledge, and I can honestly say that it heightened the rate in which I come to understand things today. Even now, when I am between semesters and I feel my mind start to dull, I just pull out one of my IMP books and resolve a problem. This is an excellent program, a valuable resource that I plan to use when my children are ready to learn it."},{"Title":"Interactive Math Program: Year 4","review":"When taught from books like these. This type of instruction presumes that kids learn only in the class room. If you are an engaged parent wishing to help coach your child at home, this book is maddeningly frustrating because all the context is with the class room teacher and you are given a book that is lacking context and is full of meaningless tripe. If your child had any interest in math, this book would make sure they'd start hating it.

What about the tiny helicopter in You Only Live Twice or the car/submarine combination used in The Spy Who Loved Me or the safe cracking gadget in Goldeneye? There is seemingly an endless supply of gimmicks, gadgets, and secret agent tricks in the James Bond franchise that extends back to the first film in 1962.Emeritus professor of physics Barry Parker has written a fun, illuminating book on the reality--and the fantasy--of the gadgets and stunts from James Bond films. He includes chapters on amazing devices, death rays, cars, car chases and other stunts, spaceflight, and nuclear weapons. Yes, the jet pack is real and how it operates is easily understandable; Parker explains it in an accessible manner. Lasers do exist, but their lethality is an overstatement in every Bond film in which they appear. The cars are real, and most of their enhancements are possible. Any the stunts are certainly possible, but don't try it home.Barry Parker does a fine job explaining the physics of each of these gadgets and gizmos, as well as the stunts and epic struggles. \\"Death Rays, Jet Packs, Stunts & Supercars: The Fantastic Physics of Film's Most Celebrated Secret Agent\\" is an enjoyable reading experience."},{"Title":"Death Rays, Jet Packs, Stunts, and Supercars: The Fantastic Physics of Film's Most Celebrated Secret Agent","review":"When I bought this book, I was expecting some brief descriptions of the various stunts, gadgets and weapons used in the James Bond movies, along with a brief scientific critique of how realistic they are (or could be) in real life. Although the book's content wasn't quite like that, I did thoroughly enjoy it. The author, who clearly appears to be an avid James Bond fan, has written a book that seems to have a double focus: (i) to describe several scenes from all the James Bond movies along with a summary of each of the plots, and (ii) to describe some of the physics involved regarding some of the stunts, gadgets, weapons and technology portrayed in these movies. The scene descriptions that are presented are very exciting and well detailed (in some cases, too detailed), but most are without commentary on the reality of the physics involved; some of these descriptions are repeated in the book. The physics that is described, complete with simple formulas, is quite entertaining, although there are several misprints and a few errors, e.g., use of \\"increase\\" when \\"decrease\\" should have been used - something that more careful editing would have easily fixed. In some cases, the author does comment on physical possibility of some of the technology used in these movies. The writing style is very engaging and the book is difficult to put down.

Parker is clearly a huge fan of 007 James Bond and he lists the movies, the actors that played Bond, the plots and all the incredible stunts and gadgets carried out and used by the super spy. However, there is relatively little space devoted to the physics of the stunts or the devices. There are images of some of the most memorable vehicles as well as simple pictures of Bond's favorite pistol and a GPS receiver. I didn't do a precise count, but it seemed that images of the devices outnumbered the images similar to those you would find in a standard physics textbook.Don't misunderstand; I loved this book, the summaries of the movie plots kept my interest throughout. However, that is what it really is and the sections where the physics is described generally seem to be an afterthought rather than the primary point of the book."},{"Title":"The Memories--JFK, 1961-1963, of Cecil Stoughton, the President's Photographer, and Major General Chester V. Clifton, the President's Military Aide","review":"If you're looking for some splendid (and rare) photographs of President John F. Kennedy and family, then this richly-detailed book should certainly be given due consideration.\\"The Memories -- JFK -- 1961-1963\\" is a 200-page hardcover volume that is loaded with top-quality images of JFK, the First Lady (Jacqueline Kennedy), and the two young Kennedy children (John Jr. and Caroline). Every picture in this publication (save one) was taken by official White House photographer Cecil Stoughton, who snapped hundreds (if not thousands) of shots of the good-looking First Family during the \\"Camelot\\" years, which spanned precisely 1,037 days, beginning with President Kennedy's memorable inauguration on the snowy Washington afternoon of January 20, 1961 .... and ending tragically at just about the same time of day (noontime) nearly three years later, on November 22, 1963, when JFK was shot and killed in an assassination attempt while riding in a motorcade through the crowded city streets of Dallas, Texas.But those 1,037 days of JFK's truncated Presidential term still provided Mr. Stoughton many opportunities to keep his camera's shutter busy. And a great number of those pics are presented in this volume (some in color).I mentioned that just one photo in the book was not taken by Stoughton -- that one being a shot of Stoughton himself, snapped by 2-year-old John Kennedy Jr. (pretty good pic, too, by the amateur Kennedy photog).In addition to Mr. Stoughton's superb camera work and heartfelt captions and recollections of being in the Kennedy \\"inner circle\\", this book also contains the remembrances of President Kennedy's military aide, Major General Chester V. Clifton. The book is narrated by \\"Time-Life\\" correspondent Hugh Sidey, who was a close friend of the Kennedys.Among the many photos enriching these pages are some very rarely-published images of the \\"family living quarters\\" on the second floor of the White House. There's also a charming two-page photo spread showing Jackie (and offspring) riding in a small horse-drawn sleigh on the White House lawn. That exquisite photo would make an ideal Christmas postcard, especially if a color version of the photo exists, which I am unsure of. It's printed in black-and-white here.The cover photo used for the hardback edition of this title -- showing a very relaxed-looking President Kennedy, wife Jackie, and their two children -- I have heard was one of Jacqueline Kennedy's favorite pictures ever taken of the First Family by Mr. Stoughton. (It's one of my personal favorites, too.) That's a cropped version of that photo on the cover; but the book also includes a full-sized (and full-page) version, also in color, which occupies all of Page #190.In 1980, a paperback re-issue edition was released, with a different cover image. The softcover version depicts JFK and brother Robert Kennedy on the front cover.The hardcover edition's first printing was in 1973, coinciding with the tenth anniversary date of JFK's assassination. This large book, published by W.W. Norton & Co. of New York, has a \\"coffee table\\" quality to it, with high quality paper stock used for its 200 pages.I've owned this book for many years now, and hadn't re-visited its contents for quite some time until just recently. Upon re-examining these pages, the obvious devotion and fondness that Mr. Stoughton, Mr. Clifton, and Mr. Sidey had for John Kennedy and the First Family during those magical days in the early 1960s becomes readily apparent via the stellar photographs and sincere text and captions that adorn each page. I found myself enjoying this material just as much as I had years ago. It was like seeing it for the very first time.This is a very \\"personal\\" book about the Kennedys. There are no \\"conspiracy theories\\" espoused here, and no talk of JFK's political enemies. Instead, what we get are the firsthand reflections of three of Jack Kennedy's friends, via a brief amount of text and lots and lots of captivating photographic images.The grace, elegance, sophistication, style, and humor of the Kennedy White House years are vividly realized and illustrated in this sleek and well-done publication."},{"Title":"Wood preservation in the United States (Bulletin / Forest Service)","review":"I purchased this book because it was written by my Great Uncle but was suprised and delighted at the information that it contained. It is a book that is very useful even today and recommend it to all."},{"Title":"Data structures & other objects using C++","review":"I thought this book was great. Yes, others may say it was very difficult to get through (i agree) but with persistence there is a big reward. The book provides full implementation details for a bunch of data structures and even sections devoted to the STL and iterators. I don't believe the implementation in this book was meant to be compiled under MVC++'s IDE. The back of the book provides a website containing a free compiler (GNU) to download along with other tools like the emacs editor (That runs on MS Windows). I have never experienced any problem compiling any of the example code under this free compiler (and using MVC++ for the code in the book is like trying to kill an ant with a shotgun anyways). This book was also not meant to teach basic C++ coding but rather to teach the concept of data structures (which should apply to various programming lang. anyways). If you want to learn how to code in C++, I recommend Deitel &amp; Deitel &quot;C++ How to program&quot;. However this book does teach some areas of basic C++ coding like the importance of the const keyword, using templates, and the new and delete operators. This book also includes some run-time analysis for various algorithms."},{"Title":"Data structures & other objects using C++","review":"After reading the poor reviews I felt bad having to buy this book for a university level data structures course. However, after using this book for a short time I really grew to like it. It is an excellent introduction to classes and OOP in addition to data structures. It picks up right around where most introductory C++ texts leave off. I found the authors explanations to be very clear and the examples to be very relavant to the topics in each chapter. The author seems to build on topics chapter after chapter so it is hard to forget what has already been learned. This is one of the few text books that I am going to keep for future reference."},{"Title":"Data structures & other objects using C++","review":"This book is being used for CMIS 240 (the second semester computer and information science course) at University of Maryland University College. It's quite academic and geared towards the more intelligent reader. The examples are simple and go well with the text, but are not detailed enough to help you to debug your own code."},{"Title":"Data structures & other objects using C++","review":"I more or less liked this book. Upon reading many of the reviews before purchasing the book I was somewhat discouraged from buying it. In the end, I really had no choice since this was the book required for the course I am taking. But, in general it is a very good book. The material itself that is covered isn't the simplest to get a grasp of. You need patience and plenty of hard work. It covers a lot of major topic areas, from linked lists, to sets, to stacks, to queues, to trees, to graphs. Also dedicated chapters introduce and develop upon the concepts of recursion and inheritance. And there are two chapters dedicated to sorting an searching algorithms. The author assumes that you have a relatively good grasp of object oriented concepts. This is not an introduction to C++ book. You should have good groundings in C++ especially with the use of pointers and working with dynamic memmory. Also, if you can think recursively you will be greatly rewarded since most of the examples in later parts of the book rely on this mind twisting yet important concept. If you are using VC++ make sure to use #pragma warning(disable:4786) when working with STL multisets it will save you from the 100 or so compiler warning messages you will get."},{"Title":"Data structures & other objects using C++","review":"This book is actually worse than a 'C masquerading as C++' type book. It mixes crappy C toolkits (linked list, etc) with C++ code. You NEVER EVER break encapsulation like this! Any students learning to code from this book will produce sloppy/amateur code at best, and are developing bad habits that will hurt them later. This book has been used at the college I go to, and ultimately students come out more confused about how to appropriately use C++. The toolkits themselves are amateur at best, and the functions inside them don't handle the special cases. I assume the authors left this as exercises for the students, but it really defeats the notion of their 'toolkits' -- it just leaves students confused. That said, the textual portion of the book is so-so, but the quality of the code leaves MUCH to be desired. I don't expect production quality code from books, but it should at least have good style and appropriate use of the language constructs. This book has neither. You've been warned!"},{"Title":"Data structures & other objects using C++","review":"An excellent text for a pre-Computer Science II class. The book was clear, concise, easy to understand for me, and the exercises really helped to emphasize the major points of each chapter. Most importantly, it is the most error free text I have ever had the pleasure of working with."},{"Title":"Data structures & other objects using C++","review":"The authors seem torn bewtween writing a C++ tutorial and a data structures tutorial. As a result neither topic is presented as well as it could or should be presented. Their approach also seems fragmented sometimes as though they start to explain something, think better of it, and jump to another topic. I am glad I am already experienced in these data structures and C++ since I would dread trying to learn either from this book."},{"Title":"Data structures & other objects using C++","review":"Contrary to the other reviews, I found that this book was easy to read and the examples helped tremendously with my homework assignments. The book gives detailed, step-by-step instructions on how to create arrays, linked lists, queues, stacks, b-trees, etc. It then goes on to show both the algorithm and C++ code to make the data structures. In addition to that, the book carefully explains the code and why the authors chose to code in the manner that they did. Even better, the code uses variable and function names that make sense!! With the code and detailed explantions, I think that most new C++ programmers will benefit greatly from using this text. The easy to read code and laid back style of writing is not at all intimidating. My only gripe is that some of the toolkit functions they propose in the book, do not handle special exceptions. This means I had to manipulate a lot of the code they showed in the book to work with my homework assignments. But then, the point of this book is to learn, right? Bottom Line: A good book. I'm keeping it for reference. I'm glad I used it."},{"Title":"Data structures & other objects using C++","review":"It's a thick book, with lots of figures, and with very readable prose. If you intend to read it cover to cover, working the examples as you go, you'll get a decent introduction to both C++ and to data structures. Unfortuntantly, you won't get a really good introduction to either.As a reference text when working on assignments or projects unconnected to the book it feels especially poor. It's easily readable prose comes at the expense of brevity, and dipping into it to refresh an idea or approach means wading into a peat bog of example code and implementation specific advice.I've read only one other C++ data structures book, but I'd certainly recommend it (\\"Data Structures and Algorithms in C++\\" by Adam Drozdek) over this one."},{"Title":"Data structures & other objects using C++","review":"I more or less liked this book.

Due to travel for work I had to drop theclass, but decided to keep and read the text. What a completedisappointment.This book is not bad as an introduction to programming withC++ as the introductory language, but it is not thorough orcomplete enough in its coverage of C++ to be a good C++ text,and it is most certainly not a Data Structures text. Even more,it is not in any way an advanced or graduate level text.It is a reasonable introduction to basic programming andstructure concepts. It adequately introduces such ideas asqueues, stacks, linked lists, although coverage of these topicsdoesn't really start until halfway into the book. Coverage oftrees and graphs is also present but light, and doesn't occuruntil the final quarter or so.I didn't care for the style or presentation, but that's reallya matter of personal taste.

How else do you learn?An improvement to the text (5 stars instead of 4 stars) would be including a chapter on shared memory. The author discusses dynamic allocated memory, but does not address shared memory. Most text books avoid the topic, but it should be covered for completeness."},{"Title":"Data structures & other objects using C++","review":"Ok, maybe it only deserves 4 stars, but I have to counterballance some of the computer snobs below -at first I thought this was a mediocre text.

If you have a very firm grasp on c++ and are looking to learn data structures you may have better luck with this book than I have. The book is very repetitive on parts that most programmers at the level where they should be learning c++ data structures should already be very familiar with, but when it comes to the new material they are a bit vague. I do like that the example programs from the book are all online and can be accessed easily, however I have found that I have better luck learning the data structures by reading my first c++ book which was on learning c++ from \\"Hello World\\" to Binary Trees. I would not recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Data structures & other objects using C++","review":"Our teacher assigned this text because we all had such a good experience with Savitch's \\"Problem Solving with C++\\". This book is however quite horrible. The text goes on and on and on and on! If you only needed a page or two of concise reading to get an idea, this book will make sure that you read through eight pages of unnecessary garbage to get there. Our teacher would assign the chapters as reading, and I would try staying up to 3AM the night before trying to read the very long chapters, and it is ridiculous!Our teacher even turned on it later. The book breaks rules for good coding in its examples that our teacher had to explicitly point out (and she did take off for those errors in our own programs). I think there is only supposed to be \\"one entry, one exit\\" and no breaking out of a program, and the book has other errors too."},{"Title":"Data structures & other objects using C++","review":"I've just finished my second course in C++ where this book was required. This book covers a huge area but not very well. It's confusing and the examples aren't very good, since he uses an &quot;unpretty&quot; approach to things, bad coding habits, and many of the examples are incomplete. If you want to learn the thoery, use another book. If you afterwards, as I do, wan't to use it as a reference guide, it is no good at all, since the examples are incompelete, scattered all over the place, or at worst you have to make them yourself in a selvtest excercise. And what's with all the trick questions?!? It does how ever earn it's 2 stars because it does cover areas such as trees and hashing. Although they are advanced areas of C++. But once again; &quot;Use another book!&quot; I would recommend Ford &amp; Topp - &quot;Intro To Computing using C++ and Object Technology&quot;. Which unfortunaltly does not cover trees and hashing.Conclusion: There are other and better ways to spend your money and learn C++. If it is required that you read this book, then I'm sorry for you.

In short, this book is down-right scary. Not only does it suggest that students use strange, esoteric, and sometimes frightening code and habits (assert()? for trivial code fragments? Students should learn to deal with it, not break the program for every little detail), it also does a very poor job of explaining the material. Furthermore, it spends most parts of any given chapter (~80%) giving drab, pointless examples and then proceeding therewith to waste valuable space implementing the code. While the book does implement the classic data structures (stacks, queues, etc), it does a poor job even at that. At no time during the entire book did I feel that I was enlightened. Mostly, I just felt that I had wasted many greenbacks buying a book that was neither useful nor interesting. Unfortunately, it seems to have the flavor of many standard academic programming books. This book goes even further: it misses the point of data structures, and does a horrid job of teaching them in C++. Spare yourself. There are plenty of better, CHEAPER books on the topic. Don't buy it even if it is a required text!

I could hardly imagine a better data structure book than this one: it is VERY well written, goes in very progressive steps, and only an elementary knowledge of C++ is assumed from the reader. Thus, most C++ beginners will not have to refer to another text to read this one.Besides teaching data structures, this book accustoms the reader to using a sensible standard in program documentation and clarity, which is of course well-needed in the profession, and which will be of use for students who want to get an idea on not to lose any points in assignments because of deficient program documentation. I used that standard in my assignments, folks, and I really left the other students in the dust! (Other students were learning with the very mediocre compulsory book) This is probably something that I will use as long as I program, in any programming language.Some people (including me) have a problem with the fact that the code is designed to work only with the GNU or Borland compilers, as they conspicuously ignore the popular VC++ development environment, classifying it under the heading &quot;older compilers which doesn\`t support static data members&quot;... gimme a break! I usually have no patience with Microsoft-despising academics, but at least they make the minimal effort of posting VC++ compliant code on the web site, although &quot;with no guarantee of it being correct&quot;.

(But you can figure out some of the identities based on Jenny's descriptions.)I was expecting to read about more famous bands in this book, but the only &quot;big names&quot; are Pink Floyd (aka Satin Odyssey), the Jimi Hendrix Experience (aka Jacklin H. Event), and the Animals (aka the Savage). The rest of the bands mentioned in the book had moderate success in England and never really crossed over in a big way in the U.S. or much of the rest of the world.The '60s counterculture lingo in the book is somewhat hilarious (&quot;groovy&quot; and &quot;scene&quot; are two favorite words), but much of Jenny's story goes downhill after she describes &quot;pulling&quot; (having sex with) a musician she calls &quot;Ben,&quot; who's obviously Syd Barrett from Pink Floyd.After telling that story, the reader has to wade through too many chapters describing Jenny's slide into an emotionally abusive relationship with the manager of a local band. Jenny also dates other men from the local music scene, but the relationships ultimately end up nowhere.The book ends on a disappointing note, leaving the reader wondering if the '60s really were as much fun as Jenny would like us to believe."},{"Title":"Groupie","review":"As commented by other reviews this book is rather dated in its wildness athough at the time of its initial release was a a mild shocker.

It is essentially the findings of a study on how feminist women relate to Protestant and Roman Catholic Christianity, told through quotes from their responses to the study questions. There is some commentary on the responses, which provides a valuable framework through which to view them, but the real power of this book comes from hearing the struggles and triumphs of women in the church (and out of the church) in their own words, as they try to come to terms with spirituality and God without sacrificing their own personhood. If you have felt alienated from the church because of your gender, you are not alone! I would recommend it to any woman who has committed herself to a spiritual path and who is struggling to find her place in what is essentially a patriarchal religion. I wish more male priests and pastors would read this book as well, because it would really open some eyes as to what women are feeling and thinking and how much we are often excluded in conventional worship. The final message of the book is that women are creating a feminist spirituality to make up for the lack of a place for us in more conventional congregations, and that this is not only possible but healthy and liberating. Overall, inspiring."},{"Title":"Defecting in Place: Women Taking Responsibility for Their Own Spiritual Lives","review":"This is a wonderful piece of research that reveals the thoughts of a silenced body of women who sit in the pews at church on Sunday for all sorts of reasons and quietly believe little of what is coming from the pulpit"}]`),S={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:H},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:C,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},G={class:"card-container"},L=["disabled"],q={key:0},W={key:1};function B(n,e,s,c,r,i){const m=g("PoemCard");return t(),a("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=o("div",{class:"top-banner"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),o("div",G,[(t(!0),a(w,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(h,f)=>(t(),p(m,{key:f,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),a("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(t(),a("span",W,"Loading...")):(t(),a("span",q,"See more"))],8,L)):b("",!0)])}const F=u(S,[["render",B],["__scopeId","data-v-f13c84aa"]]),P=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"library/34.md","filePath":"library/34.md"}'),M={name:"library/34.md"},E=Object.assign(M,{setup(n){return(e,s)=>(t(),a("div",null,[v(F)]))}});export{P as __pageData,E as default};
