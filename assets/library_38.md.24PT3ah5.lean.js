Definitely better than the movie. Talk about revenge being best served cold. This is the epitomy of that."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"Not your too-boring-to-read classic, this adventure will definitely keep your interest. The story line is well known. Edmond Dantes returns from a job at sea at age 19 to the promise of a beautiful bride and captainship of the vessel the next time it sails, only to have others send anonymous allegations about him to the crown prosecutor, who has his own reasons for Dantes to disappear. So, in Marseilles of the early 1800s, Dantes, without trial or due process, finds himself for reasons totally unclear to him, in the dungeons of an escape-proof prison. From his first moments imprisoned, Dantes vows to avenge his undeserved incarceration. Plot description stopped here to avoid spoilers, but be ready for a wild ride, unrequited love, riches and poverty (one or the other sometimes coming surprisingly quickly), locales primarily in France and Italy, but on the sea and in the islands, too. There are notorious bad guys, good guys who get their just rewards, and bad guys who do, too, as well as love, death, friendship, betrayal, politics at its worst, duplicity and ulterior motives, and moral goodness and, uh, not-so-goodness. There are the sticky issues of vengeance - its propriety and appropriate degree, and questions of wisdom/knowledge and divine representation Descriptions and characters are terrific. Dumas' literary references and some points of geography, politics, and monetary denominations and their relationships went past me, but those modest issues aside, I found it a truly special read for both its writing (in the Penguin Classics modern translation - easier to follow than older translations) and a story line that keeps the reader completely engaged. Is it worthy of \`classic' status? In spades. A fine addition to the short list of the finest books I've ever read."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"I have read this book 3 times and it is still my absolute favorite. The language, detail, and life of Edmond Dantes as depicted by Dumas is unlike any other book I have read. There is no filler or boring moments. Every line gives great insight into the characters. The idea Dumas presents is novel and paints revenge different than any way I thought about in the past. The movie is a disaster and distortion of the main points the book presents by the way. A must read."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"I can't believe with all the books I've read that I never read this one. It was wonderful. enjoyed every page right to the end."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"I love this book!

Translated and introduced via Robin Buss.As a newcomer to the world of e-books and e-readers, I was very happy to discover all of the free classics available both here at Amazon and elsewhere (e.g., Project Gutenberg). Unfortunately in regards to translated works, not all translations are created equal and the other versions of this classic pale in comparison to this one.One of my favourite books of all time!"},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"Sometimes books are listed as Classics, and you have no idea why. English teachers are an odd lot as a whole, and I guess they're the ones who more or less determine what is considered classic. Some are clear choices, however, and to me \\"The Count of Monte Cristo\\" falls into that category.To begin with it is immensely readable, a point of necessity often overlooked on modern lists. It is a page-turner of the highest order, with romance and intrigue, suspense and drama, and as complicated a morality play of revenge and justice as one could desire. And the reader isn't harmed by a decent dose of French history in the process. There was an old movie version, with Tony Curtis of all people as the Count, that was amazingly true to such a long and complicated story. The more recent movie was forgettable, and if you don't recall it don't feel bad.Back to the story. It is well worth the reading, or re-reading, and personally I enjoyed it far more even than the Three Musketeers. It starts a little slowly, but if you stay with it through the point of Dante's (the Count) imprisonment, you'll be rewarded with a story you can't put down."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"Wow, where to start on this? If you haven't seen the movie starring Jim Cavaziel and Guy Pearce yet, I suggest watching it before reading the book. The movie was a great movie also, but completely butchers the book, so to enjoy both, watch the movie first. My fiance bought this book for me, when I told her it was my favorite movie and I would like to read the book. When I first recieved it, I was intimidated. 1243 pages of pure classic literature! I was afraid that since it was a classic novel, it would confuse me greatly with the writing style, but Robin Buss (the translator) did a spectacular job of making it easy to understand. Also in the back of the book, he has included notes of certain words and phrases that are used to help clarify even more. The book is quite enjoyable to read, and I find myself laying in bed until one in the morning reading it. I have to force myself to put it down so I can sleep. Basically, a well written, very gripping book that I recommend to anyone. This is not my normal style of reading, but I have enjoyed it greatly. Again, watch the movie first so you can get the best of both worlds."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"Please note that the product details dont mention it but this is an ABRIDGED edition and as such, leaves exactly those details out that make the book a classic. Dont get suckered into buying this edition coz it's cheap."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"Every year amusement parks around the world spend millions of dollars trying to build the biggest and fastest roller coasters. These parks seek to give their visitors the greatest thrills possible on these rides without actually endangering the riders and thrill seekers flock to these parks by the thousands in order to take what they hope will be the ride of their lives. My advice is to skip the long trips and even longer lines and take a ride with Alexander Dumas and Edmond Dantes. No technology known to man can match the excitement and adventure you will thus find.Make no mistake; this will be a long and sometimes bumpy ride. Dumas occasionally will drop his reader into a chapter that seems to have no relevance to any of the chapters before it. After a while though, it will all become crystal clear as this master storyteller weaves his magic. There will be twists and turns that the reader will not be able to foresee and in the end you will marvel at the scope of the story and the extent of both the vengeance and kindness of the story's hero.As with many great works of literature, there have been many film adaptations of this book. Some were of course better than others were but none of these films come close to doing this book justice. If you have watched any or all of these films, be prepared to find that the book will often only resemble the films in that the characters have the same names. At least the characters that make it into the films will have the same names but many of the characters in the book never make it into the films. This book is simply too rich and too deep to be captured on film. To really experience Dumas' work you simply must read the book.This is a story of love lost, of deception, jealousy and murder. Within this book the reader will find villains so vile that they seem almost inhuman but when their downfall comes it is so terrible that one almost feels for these wretched creatures. All through the book the reader sees the story building to a climax, but it builds slowly. So slowly in fact that the reader will be almost on the edge of his or her seat as they wait for the inevitable falling of the ax. When the final act does finally come, the reader will know the characters so well that they will almost be able to feel their agony. On the other hand, the reader will also see that the Count's victims would not have become victims but for their own greed and pride. The traps laid by the Count simply would not have worked had not his victims been ruled by same vices that led them to wrong Dantes in the first place. As with all great works of fiction, the moral lessons are there, but buried under the surface so that they don't interfere with a great story.This is indeed a great story."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"Updated to 5-star: Originally I gave this a low rating because it was incorrectly marked as the Unabridged version. Amazon has corrected this, so I'm editing my review. Great book at a great price. Thanks, Amazon!Old Review: Note: 1-star rating is only to bring attention to the edition of the book! I'm sure this is a great book, I'm really looking forward to reading it, but after much debate I decided to get the Unabridged version, and ordered this item - I got the book in the picture, but it's Abridged. Not worth returning (Great deal, $5 book!), but just a heads up for others in the same boat."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"I only give this book 2 stars because I love the story. But I can't rate this edition higher because... well, to say that there are chapters missing in this edition would be to say nothing. I have read the original: it consists of two volumes each one of which is twice as thick as this book! Because chunks are take out, a lot of times you can't quite catch the story and figure out why things went the way they went. The story of Cadrousse and Andrea is missing completely, the reason why Villefort had a change of heart is not clear, the story of Danglars being kidnapped by the Roman bandits, Danglars' daughter running away from home, the results of Monte Cristo's visit to the telegraph... and that's not all! Good 3/4 of the original story is completely missing! It's sad that classics are disrespected in such an outrageous way."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"Dear prospective Count of Monte Cristo buyer,Having read and loved the abridged version of TCOMT, I expected the extra 800 odd pages of this version to be endless dissertations on armory and town history. Not so! This is 800 more pages of delicious PLOT, whole twists, conversations, and characters that are chopped out in the abridged-glued-back-together versions! It went from being my third all-time favorite to my all time favorite book.As to versions: I LOVE hardbacks so after reading this one I *ahem* sold it to my sister and went about purchasing a hard back. I was unable to find a hard back in this addition and so looked at others. Thankfully I was able to compare other translations/editions that were hard-back on-line with *this* version (as it was still in the house) and I gladly proclaim that this is THE BEST VERSION OF COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO OUT THERE! It has richer, more natural, language (i.e. the difference between \\"see Spot run\\" and \\"the auburn Setter skipped down the steps towards me.\\" -lol) and far more satisfactory paragraph divisions. Read it, I just KNOW you'll love it.Twice bought. Twice loved."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"For a generation used to sound bytes and Cliff's Notes, this is an easy book to miss: the title sounds old-fashioned and boring. The setting (Napoleonic France) is an abstraction to most of us today. And at 1000+ pages, this is the antithesis of what the Sesame Street generation is used to.But pick it up and you soon discover that people back then were just as devious, greedy, deceitful, and vengeful as they are today. In other words, the book is captivating.This is a fantastic story in both the full and abridged versions. It is a study in what it means to have character: Dumas explores both the corrosive impact of petty and unethical indiscretions, as well as the awesome power born from personal responsibility. He keeps the protagonist human by tempering that power with a insatiable taste for revenge. As a reader, your heart breaks as you stand, helpless, while human weakness--greed, fear--bring ruin on a truly good soul. You find yourself oddly conflicted as that soul survives, strengthens, and flourishes while pursuing the dark goal of revenge... your desire to enjoy the journey is never without a nagging feeling that the evil that was done to the protagonist has left its mark...I cannot recommend this book highly enough... if I had a sixth star to give one book and one book only, this would be the one."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"This was the first book I have read by Alexandre Dumas, and I have to say I loved it. The size is rather intimidating, but it is completely worth it. Despite the large size, I decided to read it, and I could not put it down. You know, I had those late nights where you just stay up and read for hours.The story begins with Edmond Dantes arriving home off his ship to marry his beloved Mercedes. The novel dives right into action with a plot made up by his \\"friends\\" to ruin him for some gain of their own. Edmond is falsely accused of being a Bonapartist involved in a scheme to overthrow the King and gets arrested right during his betrothal feast, and is thrown into prison. Right when he begins to give up hope, he befriends a very intelligent, old Abbe, who helps Edmond escape. The novel continues many years later with Edmond, or rather, the Count of Monte Cristo, and his brilliant, conniving plot of revenge.\\"The Count of Monte Cristo\\" is a tale of adventure-yes, it is a tale of love-yes, but what this novel truly is, is a tale of revenge. How one's past haunts them because of one's wrongdoings and losses. But also how revenge cannot fix everything. Things in life do not usually work out perfectly, but there is always hope.This is a book full of twists and turns and those \\"Oh! What happens next!? I want to know!\\" moments. I can't wait to read more of Dumas' books. He's a gifted writer- able to write a thrilling plot and portray realistic characters and their true feelings. If you're a sucker for good literature, like myself, this is the book to read. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"i had a similar experience as previously indicated. in fact i ordered both the unabridged and abridged versions of this product and received the exact same product (despite the fact that the allegedly unabridged version was 2X the cost.) if you'll notice, the picture are confusing and therefore you don't know what you will be receiving. now i am looking elsewhere for an unabridged version as the information on amazon is inconclusive and ultimately unhelpful."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"The Count of Mote Cristo is a really exciting and fabulous story; I really enjoyed the book while reading it. The main character Edmond Dantes is about 21 years old, and for him, life is just full of success. He is a successful merchant and is about to be promoted to captain of a ship. At the same time, he is also about to marry a beautiful young girl whom he has loved for a very long time. But amidst all of these happy things, misfortune strikes, and Edomnd Dantes finds himself to be a prisoner in the Chateau D'If for life. He is a prisoner because he is betrayed by his so-called \\"friends\\" and rumored to be a servant of Napoleon Bonaparte. However, something miraculously happens, so read it to find out.Although this novel is usually thought of as a story of revenge, it has an even deeper meaning than that. This story not only warns people who betray others, but it also promotes love, friendship, and most of all hope. When the Count of Monte Cristo comes back and seeks revenge, he also meets some friends on the way that move his heart. Some of his friends become poor and have a sad life because of his imprisonment long ago, but they still hope that he will return and they wait for him day by day. The count rewards them in a secret way, and shows how important it is to have hope in one's life even when there looks like no hope. So when you read this book, keep in mind that there is more to it than just vengeance.This book is very pleasant and I finished it in a couple of sittings. It will definitely put you on the edge of your chair and you will hardly be able to put the book down. This book is for all kinds of people, but it is especially for people that think life is hopeless, because as this book will point out, nothing in life is ever hopeless."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"I am reviewing the Pocket Books Enriched Classics version of the novel The Count of Monte Cristo. At about chapter 30, I was hooked on the story and reading reviews and doing research on it. At that point I discovered the Pocket Books version is an ABRIDGED version with about 70 chapters. The real version has around 117 chapters. This frustrated me immensely because nowhere on the Pocket Books version does it say it is abridged. That is my biggest complaint.I then found a complete version of the book and read it. If I was going to read the book, I wanted to read the whole thing. However, if you want a more tightly written book, I guess I could recommend the abridged version. It won't take near as long to read and will probably tell the same story. Just a quick comment about the 2002 movie starring Jim Cavizel and Guy Pierce. The 1st half of the move covers Dantes' imprisonment and escape, while in the book, it is maybe 25% of the story. While the movie is good, it in no way does justice to Dantes' life as the Count of Monte Cristo. I don't see how it would be possible to make a movie that follows the book closely, the book is just too long.Dantes is madly in love with Mercedes. On the eve of their wedding, Dantes is betrayed by 3 supposed friends. Dantes spends 14 years in prison and there he meets a priest he teaches him many things an tells him where to find a massive treasure. Dantes escapes, finds the treasure and sets out to get revenge on those who betrayed him. The revenge plots are long, detailed and sometimes farfetched. It seems Dantes can do anything he wants and is always able to buy what he needs or be in the right place at the right time. Still it is fun to get to know the characters and to see how Dantes exquisitely exacts his revenge. Many characters view suicide as a honorable way to deal with grief, which is ridiculous today but was accepted back then. In spite of leaving out 1/3rd of the novel, the pocket books version does include an large reference section that includes plot summary, character lists and other commentaries.If only Alexander Dumas were alive today. The Count of Monte Cristo is an amazing novel with an intricate plot, numerous characters and plenty of twists and turns. Unfortunately, it is written the style of the times, and is as not as exciting as it could have been. The dialogue all has a poetic feel to it. I wish this story could be told by an author today. This book oozes sexuality (affairs, lusts, lesbians) just beneath the surface. There is so much sexual tension that could be exploited without crossing the line to obscene. Also, so much of the behavior of the characters is wrapped up in French social customs that are hard to understand at first but the reader will quickly pick up on them.I recommend this book to anyone interested in books of this era or of a good adventure. Just decide if you want the abridged version or full version before you buy this book."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"This is a story that must be read to be truly appreciated.Set at a time of political turmoil in France, with Napoleon in exile,Edmond Dantes is an ambitious young sailor with prospects, and a beautiful fiance, Mercedes. Three people conspire against him to ruin his life, one wants his girl, another his position. He is banished to the notorious Chateau d'If, and is believed by his friends to be dead.In prison he meets the Abbe Faria, who becomes his teacher, and together they plan to escape. Edmond escapes with a treasure map 14 years later, claims the fortune, and becomes the mysterious Count of Monte Cristo, bent on getting revenge against those who wronged him. With his new found fortune he effortlessly penetrates the highest levels of society, and unrecognisable to his enemies, he now befriends them.The revenge comes slow and sweet, as he plots the downfall of his enemies. He is ruthless, deliberate and unrelenting, and appears to know everyones dark secrets, although we don't always know how he knows.There are many sub characters and subplots that are not in the movie versions of the story. There are some genuinely good characters whose path to love is blocked, and he is in the background pulling the strings to work the situation for those he loves. He is also pulling the strings on those he is out to get.He refers to himself as providence, as he takes the archetype role of flawed hero avenger, and wreaks his awful vengeance. He mysteriously appears everywhere, and knows everything, and uses it. He is karma incarnate.The society and manners of the time are brilliantly evoked by the beautiful writing of Alexandre Dumas. As the words leap from the page into your imagination, you see the characters, you hear their words, and feel their emotions.Most of all, you feel for Edmond Dantes. Will revenge bring him some measure of satisfaction, and make him happy? Or, will he be forever unable to forgive, and be happy. In some respects his life is our life, as you hope for some measureof transformation in his experience that you can apply to your own.Will he reunite with his beautiful fiance, now married to one of his enemies? Can he get revenge, and be forgiven by her?This is a story to be savored. So, go for the unabridged version.If you have seen the original movie with Robert Donat, and the more recent one with Jim Caviezel, who subsequently went on to play the contrasting role of Jesus Christ, I love both of the movie versions.There is way more in the book than can be conveyed in a two hour movie, and so the story is condensed and some of the characters altered to make the story more movie friendly. So, if you are like me, and enjoyed the movie, you will love the book."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"First off let me say that I love The Count of Monte Cristo. It is a great and exciting story that will leave you reeling.However the Signet Abridged version is not a great clipping of the long saga. For the most part the book seems to flow well enough with only a few potholes. The story of his neighbor who let his father starve is completely dropped without it ever being resolved. However the largest problem I have with this version is at the loss of one of the books most important points. This version shows how Edmond Dantes/Count of Monte Cristo takes out two of his three enemies and leaves them in ruin but completely ignores how he finishes off with his final enemy (As you can tell I am not trying to give away too much of the plot). This leaves his final actions to seem confusing.Please please read The Count of Monte Cristo, but I recommend getting yourself an unabridged version. But if you simply do not have the time then do not try this version as the cuts are so deep that it leaves the plot to bleed to death."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"I often enjoy reading a book, and then checking out the movie. Almost always I enjoy the book more, although it is fun to see the movie version after reading the book. I don't think it would really even be possible for a two hour movie to do Dumas' classic justice (although the movie is enjoyable). This book is very entertaining, involves an intricate plot with many intertwined characters, and elements of suspense that could not be understood in a movie. It also covers a 24 year time span. The story is of Edmund Dantes, who after being promoted to captain of his ship, is brutally betrayed by those he trusts. On the day before his mairrage to his beautiful fiance, Mercedes, he is arrested for treason and taken to a prison on an island off the coast. He holds the image of his fiance in his mind, but unknown to him, she assumes he is dead and marries his friend who betrayed him. He is in prison for years, but life becomes barely tolerable after a tunnel is dug from a priest's cell to his. They are able to meet daily, and the priest is able to teach Dantes science, language, and even defense. Through his torturous incarceration, Dantes vows revenge on those who betrayed him. The two plot an escape through a tunnel, and the story continues to tell Dantes' life after prison.This is an excellent book and certainly a classic that most people, even younger readers, will enjoy. I plan on reading it again in a couple of years, and just may read it again after that. It is that good!"},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"This is the only Unabridged edition of The Count of Monte Cristo I have been able to find for Kindle. It looks like a public domain copy that has been adapted, but it is formatted well. It doesn't say who the translator is. It has the whole 117 chapters. It is worth the 99 cents, if you want the unabridged version. I think if you read the abridged you are missing out on some great parts of a great story. I gave this 4 stars because it looks like the public domain and has no extas that a lot of the big publishers have, but still, a great buy and a great version."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"I got this download from Audible.com and it is brilliantly read by James Lee. I was completely captivated and transported to the world of Edmond Dantes and early 19th century France. I did consult spark notes every 5 or 10 chapters, because when listening to a book of this magnitude where aristocrats are changing their names (and sometimes needing aliases) and getting titles, it could be easy to get lost and hard to keep track of who is who. But I never felt lost or dragged down by this story that must be the blueprint for every romantic, adventure or character study novel that came afterwards. The novel is rich with sumptuous prose and unforgettable characters and is on par with other masterpieces like Lord of the Rings. It has everything and feels surprisingly contemporary. The language is not stilted at all and I found it to be extremely witty at some points. With Monte Cristo the first superhero is created by Dumas as he seems (to characters in the book) to posses superhuman strength, wealth beyond imagination and can always see 10 moves ahead in this very intriguing game of revenge chess he is playing with the people who falsely imprisoned him. John Lee is an amazing reader, so if audible books is your thing, go for it. I was never bored and was sad when it all, finally ended. It could have even been longer for me. I can't imagine being satisfied with an abridgment of this novel...it is too rich, and why let someone edit it for you when you can have the whole, glorious tale. And if you prefer print books, then I really don't see how you could go wrong. The Count of Monte Cristo is a hell of a good ride and deserves every single recommendation it gets. This is one of those once-in-a-decade books that deserves a whole constellation of stars instead of just five."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"You are not getting the full story with this edition and I am afraid you miss a bunch if you try the fast food variety of this book. While you will get the basics of the story, you miss too much background for it to be believable. The abridged version takes you from a dirty convict one day to a suave and loaded Count the next without showing you the transformation. The story is too good to skip 800 pages!Anyway...This is a really cool story! Not many of us know what it is like to be extremely wealthy and all powerful, but this book shows us this. After poor fisherman Edmond is thrown in prison for nothing, his fortune turns around and he escapes to the world again (after a decade and a half!) and finds trillions upon trillions (?) of dollars in jewels in gold that a fellow prisoner had discovered a map to. He spends alot of money over the next decade setting up the ultimate vengeance on those responsible for his earlier arrest. VERY ENTERTAINING THROUGHOUT!!! You will get an early view of not only early 19th century Paris but also a beautiful panoramic from life along the Mediteranean to the Catacombs of Rome. A truly sweeping narration!5 stars for the story!3 stars for this edition!"},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"Often when I read, I have the television on (but muted). Imagine my surprise when I saw a trailer for the new film Count of Monte Christo while I was actually reading the novel. I suspect that the film will in no way measure up to this monument of world literature. This book is phenomenal. It is truly a magisterial work of the ages. The copy I read was the Penguin unabridged version, which clocks in at 1,078 pages in very dense font. I've never read the abridged version, but I imagine that cutting even a small bit of Dumas' work does it a great injustice. Read the unabridged version. It takes longer but always pays off. In fact, always read the full version of any piece of literature. Why cut corners?On the surface, the book seems to be a simple tale of revenge. Edmond Dantes, a young sailor with a bright future, has his life turned upside down when three men get him arrested on a false charge. Dantes ends up in prison for 14 years, where he meets a man who tells him of a hidden treasure. When Dantes escapes, he finds the treasure and emerges as \\"Le Comte de Monte Christo\\" and wreaks havoc on his enemies. Simple, right? There is so much more here than simple revenge. Dumas uses his sprawling epic to cast aspersions on the French aristocracy, as well as examining the relationship of God and man. Is man right to seek earthly revenge? Is it acceptable for man to assume the role that has been eternally given to God? It's all here in eloquent prose. Dumas also weaves into his work the European fascination of the time with anything Oriental, as some of the characters and events have a distinctive Turkish and Balkan character. As stated above, this book is brilliant. Dumas has an exceptional eye for character, and he loads this book with plenty of interesting people. The scheming businessman Danglars, the crown prosecutor M. de Villefort, the Greek slave Haydee, and Albert Morcerf are all characters you will meet during your journey through this book. My favorite character was Monsieur Noirtier, Villefort's father. What a tough old bird! Noirtier often saves the day.I was almost done with the book when I realized that I was reading a soap opera. All of the elements are there. It's the high level of melodrama that is most apparent. Eyes are constantly cast upwards towards heaven, chests are clutched in agony or joy, and sighs and blanching occur frequently. I felt sorry for the chairs and other furniture in this book. People are constantly collapsing into them over some agony or other emotional breakdown. Despite these constant emotional outbreaks, the book is still great. The book closes with the typical happy ending (even a ride off into the sunset occurs).This book is a classic and you'll quickly see why within a few pages. I would sure like to read other Dumas classics, although I can't imagine when I'll find the time. His musketeer stories apparently encompass some 3000 pages in its entirety. Start with this gem and it will suffice. Robin Buss is to be credited with his translation. Devoting the time to translating this huge book certainly is a labor of love. Five stars just aren't enough!!"},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"In the same spirit of challenge that led me to read Pride and Prejudice and A Tale of Two Cities (and find that they have become irreplaceable parts of my bookshelf) and that will lead me to read others like Don Quixote, Ivanhoe, and The Three Musketeers, I have now officially read The Count of Monte Cristo, and I can say that it was the easiest and most thrilling of all the classics I have yet read.Oh, sure, A Tale of Two Cities was tearjerking and triumphantly sad, and Pride and Prejudice just made you want to squeal in happiness, but The Count of Monte Cristo makes you think, makes you tear up (not out of sadness, at the wonder of the dialogue and the love you have for the characters -- and this is a translation!) makes you wonder, and finally, makes you go to this page to write a glowing 5-star review for one of the greatest books ever written in any language.If you're not fluent in French you'll do fine with this book, though without a basic knowledge of just a few words you might have a little trouble with it, and without having heard of some of the places or having been to France, you might not know exactly what the Champs-Elysees or Chateau d'If is. It doesn't matter. Those aren't the focal points of the book. The story is Edmond Dantes, happy and fortunate young sailor, about to become captain of his own ship, marry his beloved Mercedes, and live happily ever after. Then success is snatched from his hand and he is unjustly thrown into the monstrous prison of Chateau d'If, where he spends fourteen years vowing to avenge himself.He gets out eventually, in one of the most dazzling and vivid scenes ever written, and makes his fortune finding buried treasure on the tiny island of Monte Cristo. Henceforth he is known as the Count of Monte Cristo: Enigmatic, a little surreal, and ready to exact perfect reward for those who did him well -- and perfect justice for those who did him evil.But there are complications that even the mighty count couldn't have foreseen: the son of his ex-fiancee and his bitter enemy befriends him, the son of his dead benefactor is in love with the daughter of the man who sentenced him to life in prison to protect his career, and the question comes up: When is revenge right, how far do you go, and do humans even have the right?It's a fantastic story, a memorable and fast-paced story, and, unlike a few books I could mention, truly deserves its label of classic. For those who like action: This book has prison, escape, treasure, poison, love, cruelty, redemption, revenge, forgiveness, ambiguity, sadness, triumph, and hope. Don't be daunted by the page count. It's a true work of art.Has anyone got a copy of the Three Musketeers?Rating: Masterpiece"},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"I loved this book and really can't believe I hadn't read it before. It's an old classic, and an excellent story. The version on the kindle is great - easy to read and definitely as addictive as reading the actual hardcopy book itself. Highly recommended! You won't be able to put it down."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"I can't believe I just read this for the first time. A grand and sweeping epic that is spellbinding. Do not question...buy it!"},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"This is probably the best revenge story ever written. As the back cover of the story states, \\"On what slender threads do life and fortune hang.\\" Edmund Dantes knows something about those threads. A promising sailor, he is arrested, thrown into prison, and succumbs to hopelessness. From there, he meets a friend, gains a boundless inheritance, and soon finds himself in a position to obtain his revenge on those who caused his predicament. The tone, like most Dumas books, is simple, elegant, and witty. Why I call it the best is that it is a revenge story, but it also involves the subtle emotions involved in going about revenge. How revenge can go wrong, who revenge forces you to leave behind, who you attempt to emulate in casting judgement on your fellow man.1200 pages is quite a long novel, but it moves quickly, I'm currently reading it a second time, more to refresh background details and characters. There are plenty in this novel, who act like real people, with distinct personalities and flaws. The count himself lives a life of luxury which modern people can still be jealous of. Rome, Paris, and Marseille are visited with great detail, for those of us who like to travel on a budget. As the count begins to succeed in his vengance towards the end of the novel, you may be surprised about the outcome.Dumas, a prolific writer, wrote many novels. Those that like this would do well to move on to The Three Musketeers and it's sequel, which supply similar historical action and quick dialogue. The investment there is even greater, probably working out to 3500 total pages of narrative. Exciting, yes, but not many have that sort of time to invest. Count of Monte Cristo is self-contained. If one was to read just one novel by Dumas, this would be it. This is a famous author at the height of his powers, telling a self-contained story about destitution, fortune, and the nobility between."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"\\"Only weak minds see the future in a black cloud\\" this is my favorite Count of Monte Cristo's remark, this and other similar pieces of wisdom kept me riveted to this great long read. Montecristo is a long consectrated piece of classic literature and for me is useless to rate it as good or bad, it is better to give a personal impression about what one felt after finishing its almost 900 pages. In my opinion this novel is about personal relationships, how can be fostered and then easily destroyed due to jeaulosy and personal ambitions. The ideas of spirituality, material ambition, fair revenge and Divine blessing and punishment hover over the plot all the time. The plot begins with one focus, the transformation of Edmond Dantes into the Count of Montecristo due to misfortune arising from a personal treason, and then shatters into small stories with many different characters, each and every one of them, related one to another due to events told throughout the storyline. On the final chapters the novel recovers the single focus, the idea of justice, in order to conclude in an ending based on moral reasoning. The story unfolds at the post-Napoleonic era in France."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"Among the best books I've ever read. It grabs you in the first pages and you're hooked. No wonder so many movies and plays and articles have been written about this book."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"I read this book when I was a kid and loved it so much I spent more time in the library reading and re-reading this book than I did playing with my friends.I recently saw the movie on TV for about the 5th time and decided I needed to read it yet again.I love this book."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"Our Christian book club read this book from the \\"classics\\" genre. Although I have enjoyed many classics, it's rare for me to read a book written in the 19th c. or prior that I would consider a \\"page turner.\\" This is a suspenseful, can't put it down book comparable to those written by many of our best adventure novelists of today. Great book!!"},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book...it was a long book and sometimes I found it hard to follow the dialect but overall a great book. I also had no problems with my kindle after downloading this book."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"Alexander Dumas was fascinated by the concept of revenge. It formed the core of two of his earlier novels, but nowhere else did he devote to it so much study and development as he did in his mid-19th Century gothic romance, \\"The Count of Monte Cristo.\\" Readers who choose abridged versions of this unsurpassed tale of vengeance short-change themselves, because it's only in the many sub-plots, the painstakingly depicted details of French elite society of France's Second Republic, and the subtle twists and interweaving of the activities of the novel's many characters that we truly come to appreciate this masterpiece in its in-depth exploration of what constitutes revenge in all its hideous terror and in all its glorious satisfaction.Edmund Dant&egrave;s suffers at the hands of brutal enemies, spends 14 years in one of the most awful prisons human perversity could devise, and through a series of suspense-filled circumstances gains his freedom - and a fortune - before spending an additional 10 years meticulously planning his revenge. He leaves nothing to chance. He watches. He waits. He is infinitely patient, and patience when wielded by skillful hands can be a weapon sharper than a sword. Edmund Dant&egrave;s, through years of training and practice, becomes dispassionate, cold, supremely calculating, supremely confident and capable - and implacable. The Count of Monte Cristo is born, and slowly, inexorably, he brings down retribution on those who betrayed him or forgot him rotting in prison. Even his former fianc&eacute;e, the lovely Merc&eacute;d&egrave;s (who certainly is no Homeric Penelope), does not escape unscathed.And in the end, for revenge to be complete, it must be cathartic. Dumas, after much carnage and financial destruction, leaves us with a few green shoots of love rising from the ashes, closing his magnificent saga with the line, \\". . . all human wisdom [is] contained in these two words - \`wait' and \`hope.'''"},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"This is my favorite novel. Extremely interesting, complex, detailed, contains so much history (along with historical fiction), this book is great (was that a sentence?).This is the unabridged version, which i recommend. Reading the abridged would be like watching a thirty minute version of Shaw shank. It is just so much more detailed and complex. I took me about a week to read, with most of my time doing just that. The second time i read it, it took much longer.Watching the movie first does not ruin this book at all as they are very different.General plot and style for those who don't know:This novel defines the expression 'revenge is a dish best served cold'. Its tells a story of an innocent and optimistic young man beset by misfortune, who then vows to exact a long and meticulous scheme of revenge. Because of the books great lengths, many other characters are examined as deeply as shorter books examine their protagonist. Obviously the book is very detailed with interesting insight into the time period it was written in and about.Truly an epic book like no other, I strongly recommend it. Even if you don't like it, chances are it would make a great gift for a friend."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"Last year my grandfather recommended this book to me. I snorted, thinking, yeah right, I highly doubt I'm gonna read a book like The Count of Monte Cristo any time soon. But after I picked up the novel and actually started to read it, I slowly became more and more fascinated with the plot. As a 12 year old reader I struggled with parts of the book, finding them dull and tedious, but the struggle is worth it in the end!Alexandre Dumas creates a fabolous tale of revenge and hate in which Edmond Dantes, a young sailor in love, is betrayed by three men of power. Edmond wastes 13 years of his life in the Chateau d'If, a terrible prison in which Edmond loses faith and all chances of ever being with his love again. While there, Edmond learns of a treasure buried on the island of Monte Cristo, and creates a master plan to seek revenge on his enemies, if and when he escapes.I highly recommend this book, and if you're too lazy to actually pick it up and read it, at least go and see the movie!"},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"I was surprised how brilliant this book was. After the first few chapters the story was so compelling that I could hardly put it down. Dumas has the art of telling a story whilst placing it in the context of history and making the historical characters believable.Each character seems real wth flauxs and all. A wonderful story perfect for everyone to read and perhaps easier than the Three Musketers and the Man in the Iron Mask."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"Everything about this book is good. I can't think of one negative thing to say about it.The story and charactors were fantastic. The level of the writing and mastery of the language are without equal.Alexandre Dumas writes and tells a story like no other.This is one book I can guarantee you will like."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"This book is excellent, the plot is captivating... I can't say enough about this book that already hasn't been said. I only regret that I haven't read the unabridged edition yet.My only complaint would have to be the numerous spelling mistakes. Examples would be, misspelling a character's name in the character list in the beginning of the book... and throughout the book simple words such as was or house are typos. These mistakes distracted me somewhat, because I had to stop reading and figure out what the word was supposed to be... but otherwise the book is great."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"Probably the best story I ever read. It had just about every quality one could have in a book. Everything fits so perfectly, and it's almost as close as pure genius as it gets. There are many classics that can be compared, but sometimes there are certain books that appeal to one more than others......I guess this is mine."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"A great book, my favorite to date, full of passion, love, vengence, and insight into human nature. The reviewer who said it's the &quot;reworking of a true story&quot; may be factually correct (I personally don't know) but it is irrelevant. The story is good but the writing is GREAT! It could have been the story of anything. Dumas' insight into the human mind and his style of writing, and his use of suspense is what makes this book a five star, not merely the story."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"This book proved to be a worthy companion during a battle with the flu. The magnificent story of Edmond's transformation from a love-struck innocent to a coldly calculating avenger elevated me from a sea of rumpled sheets and tissues to a place of high adventure. His story completely captivated me, and his methods of giving reward to his true friends and exacting careful revenge on his enemies enthralled me. My husband, who had read the novel, grew tired of my croaky requests of &quot;What happens next?&quot; but refused to give anything away. &quot;Just read it&quot; was his advice, and this is the advice that I give to you."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"Nineteen year old Edmond Dantes is falsely accused and incarcerated by three men; one sacrifices Dantes to his ambitions, one covets his fiancee, one is jealous of the young sailor's success. His unbearable captivity in the Chateau d'If lasts until his ingeniously conceived escape fourteen years later. When he returns to wreak his terrible vengeance on the men who imprisoned him, he is no longer the naive, idealistic Edmond Dantes; he is the cunning, cynical, and fabulously rich Count of Monte Cristo.The complex plot of this book makes it slightly challenging, but the suspense and intrigue more than compensate. I thoroughly enjoyed this fictional masterpiece!"},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"One of the best books I have ever read. It's the story of Edmond Dantes, who is imprisoned by his enemies. After a miraculous, but very believable escape, he plots his revenge.

Read this book, you will be thankful you did."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"When I was a student in high school, my English teacher attempted to convey to my class the meaning of a &quot;classic.&quot; Her effort would have been nearly nonexistent if she had only suggested we read this book. This book is everything a modern day novel dreams of being. It contains murder, mystery, love lost and found, suspense, hope, suffering, happiness, sorrow, ...the list goes on. My only fear is that I will never read an equal to this masterpiece. Now I am positive that &quot;classic&quot; is not a reference to soda, 50's rock and roll, or cars. Do yourself a favor and read this book."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"I have just finished reading this, which in my opinion is the best book in the world. Everything about it is amazing. The plot is captivating and fulfilling. Dantes's intricately planned vengeance on the men who ruined his life is so detailed and amazing it leaves me speachless. I love how the book leaves hints of future events and things which at one point may not make sense. Later, however, their purpose is revealed and they help the reader to understand the current events as well as show the how the past, present, and future of Edmond Dantes's life is connected. All those who have given this book 1 star are simpletons who were forced into reading it and never even tried to appreciate it."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"when i was 10 years i read this book. my auntie gave it tome as a present in my birthday. i read for five times then istill remember each part of that book.

And one that I think just about anybody would like"},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"In this review, I'm not going to say anything that has not already been said.In a numbered list, I'm going to give my honest opinion, clear up some misunderstandings about this novel, and explain why YOU should read this book.Let's go.1. SUMMARYI wrote a good paragraph summary of TCOMC once, but it doesn't stand up to the official AMAZON summary, shown here:\\"Imprisoned for a crime he didn't commit, Edmond Dantes spends 14 bitter years in a dungeon. When his daring escape plan works, he uses all he has learned during his incarceration to mastermind an elaborate plan of revenge that will bring punishment to those he holds responsible for his fate.No longer the naive sailor who disappeared into the dark fortress all those years ago, he reinvents himself as the charming, mysterious, and powerful Count of Monte Cristo.\\"2. MISUNDERSTANDINGSOne reviewer [PurpleKat] suggested that you should ONLY read this book if you have 3 days to spare, since \\"you won't be able to put the book down, or if you do, you'll move zombie-like through your everyday tasks while your mind stays with the adventures of Edmund Dantes.\\"...I'm sorry, but this isn't a genre piece. It's just not. You WON'T be able to skim through it like a Dan Brown or Stephen King novel.It's just not happening. Too bad, PurpleKat....I guess the main reason young people ignore this book today is because of its length - something close to 1,500 pages of small text.The length may seem daunting to young readers, since the books we read today average in the 200 page mark, if even. But step back a century and the books are a LOT longer.Think of some great novels from the 18th Century: War and Peace, Madame Bovary, the Hunchback of Notre Dame, the Man in the Iron Mask. Those books are looong.They are daunting reads. I'm sure you know the feeling of holding a 4 inch thick, 3 kilo, size 8 print, 100+ chapter book in your hands, or reading all day on your Kindle to find the progress bar reads 3%. It's enough to put off anyone.But, once you get involved in the narrative, the length won't matter. I have NEVER heard of someone not liking a good book because of its length,Basically, this is the promise that Alexandre Dumas makes to you when you start his book:\\"Are you willing to take a leap of faith [and stick with the book through the slow parts]? Or become an old man, filled with regret [for not reading Monte Cristo], waiting to die alone [in shame and embarrassment]?\\"That takes care of length.P.S. Don't even think about buying the abridged version! Trust me, I have read it by accident, and NOTHING made sense. I started to ask myself questions such as \\"Danglars - what? Who is Mercedes?\\"The abridged version is a CHOPPY, CONFUSING, mess.(Like the 3rd Pirates of the Caribbean movie!)3.

Reading a 700 page book in size 8 font on tiny pages is a little daunting. This is going to sit on my bookshelf until I get a real sized book."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"First I will say if it was not for the Kindle, I probably would not have attempted to read this book as I tend to stay away from long heavy books in hard to read typeface, however with the Kindle it becomes much easier to read such a book. I will not try to explain the book as many other readers have already done so. The one thing I found a bit difficult was that the same characters had different names and titles, this plus the number of characters made it a little hard to follow in some parts what was happening. Also I am not used to the French terminology which also hindered somewhat my understanding. Nonetheless it is a deep and complicated work which comes together in an interesting and comprehensive manner. It also gives a good picture of Parisian society as it existed in the early nineteenth century. I found a lot of similarity between it and Russian society as painted by Tolstoy in \\"War and Peace\\". One thing that surprised me was the Count's treatment of Mercedes, if I was in his position I know I would not have treated her as a betrayer and do not in fact think that she was. It was also surprising to see that hashish was so romanticized in that period, I would not have guessed that there would have been any great awareness of it at that period of time."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"Although viewers of the various movie versions may think that they know the story, the novel takes numerous twists and turns which are far too complex to be told in a couple of hours. The subplots are as exciting as the main plot, and Dumas weaves them together into a seamless whole.The Kindle edition is one of the better transcriptions that I've seen, with consistently good editing, no typos, and the placement of the footnotes does not distract from the flow of the text."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"There are two criteria for a review here, the book, and the actual story itself.The story is 5 stars out of 5 no doubt. It's a literary masterpiece. An absolutely compelling story of revenge with an amazing character dynamic.The book, which is unabridged ( what's the difference? About 500 pages; fairly significant ), is the best. I wouldn't recommend the abridged version, you don't get the feeling of satisfaction of reading the actual book and abridged is like reading a really long summary that actually makes less sense than the book because of the random introduction of characters.So we've established that the story is fantastic and a timeless classic, and the unabridged version ( which this particular penguin classics is ) is the best to get. Now I must talk about the elephant in the room, the actual book. I have a lot of Penguin Classics, The Epic of Gilgamesh, The Consolation of Philosophy, and Sir Garwin, etc. These books are extremely short, 2 - 300 pages max. Well, As we all know, The Count of Monte Cristo is a bit longer....about 1000 pages longer to be specific. So what's the result? A publishing company that specializes in smaller to medium sized books trying to bound a 1300 page monster. The binding is absolutely terrible! I feel like every time i pick the book up it's going to fall apart. I've been a long time fan of paperback books, but I really wish I had not bought this book as a paperback. Don't get me wrong, I'm a big fan of Penguin Classics and their books, but they definitely should have used a different binding method for this particular book.Overall:5/5 stars on the story, and plot2/5 stars on the actual book and binding"},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"I was impressed when listening to Bill Homewood abridged version and often wished that there was an unabridged version (by Bill Homewood) and there it was. I'm very lucky as my son Darin and his wife (Caroline) gave it to me for Christmas. It was incredible. He (Homewood)does, BY FAR, the best job and although I have listened to many versions Bill Homewood does the most outstanding job. As you see I can not say enough about his presentation, I have many other audio versions of the Count of Monte Cristo. It's a great book made magnificent by Mr. Homewood. Frank de Cesare, Mesa, Arizona"},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"A wonderful classic story butchered by a senseless editor who removed major portions of the story without letting the reader know. The description on the back cover misleads the consumer into thinking that one is getting so much more than the full text (the edition includes a brief introduction of the author, critical analysis and explanatory notes). I'd rather do without the side commentary and get the full original manuscript. The problem isn't that the editor decided to abridge the book, but that they chose to conceal this fact from the reader.The removed portions are integral to the storyline and I was left baffled by how disjointed the novel seemed, so uncharacteristic of Alexandre Dumas. Then I found out it's not the author's fault.Book is highly recommended, but I would also recommend that readers invest in more trustworthy versions out there."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"I thought this story was very difficult to follow. I even restarted it after reading the first hundred or so pages. Now I know why...there are several chapters intentionally omitted in this version, making it impossible to make sense of the text. I am angered that the publisher butchered the story without letting the consumer know that it had been done. Do not buy this book, or any other \\"Enriched Classic\\"."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"I strongly recommend readers to buy this version - the unabridged version with the excellent translation by Robin Buss. It was thanks to Amazon readers that I first found out about this version -> I had just read the Club Dumas by Arturo Perez-Reverte (which I also highly recommend) and I was curious to read novels by Dumas. I think I had read the abridged version of Monte Cristo back in high school (over 20 years ago) - but I learned from Robin Buss that the version most of us have read was an antiquated Victorian English translation which doesn't reflect the style of Dumas and omits key parts of the novel due to Victorian-era censorship. Here's what Robin Buss has to say on page xxv of his intro: \\"Anyone who has ever read The Count of Monte Cristo only in the \\"classic version\\" has never read Dumas' novel. For a start, the translation is occasionally inaccurate and is written in a nineteenth century English that now sounds far more antiquated than the French of the original does to a modern French reader.\\" I'd like to share that I thoroughly enjoyed this amazing tale with this excellent translation. I found it to be a gripping story and I had no problem sticking with this novel - all the way to page 1,243 - which I finished reading moments ago. Also - I found the detailed notes provided by Robin Buss to be incredibly valuable. In the notes, all the \\"nuances\\" and even \\"inside jokes\\" within the novel are explained. Some things that contemporary readers would simply understand (due to recent events, and the French revolution, etc) that are unlikely for most modern day reads to know.I whole-heartedly recommend this -and I will look for more classics that have been translated by Robin Buss, because I feel like I discovered a treasure."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"This is a must reading for any reading lover. It easily ranks among the best 20 novels ever in any language. Just one piece of useful information for kindle users. This is NOT the Modern Library edition. I downloaded the free sample from my kindle and I am glad I did. This is a mobile 'cheap' edition with the text only that I can get for free some place else. Amazon should be careful in listing books, because not all editions are the same. If this was the Modern Library edition, I would happily pay the $0.99 they are asking for."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"Ok, so the first time I read this book was when I was a senior in high school. Being the fact that I am a sucker for those love stories where the guy gets the girl in the end, it was only natural that I would enjoy this book. But the best part about it is the twist in the plot and how eventually The Count of Monte Cristo reveals himself to those who knew him before the self-appointed title.Its a classic by Alexandre Dumas and I do believe that this is one of those books (like \\"Catcher in the Rye\\") that you just have to read in this lifetime!"},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"It would be a futile effort to try to express in words just how excellent this story is. Stories that have been called &quot;classics&quot; have been labeled as such for a very good reason. I think anybody who has read and liked Tolstoy, Renault, Shakespeare, Leroux, Homer and R.L. Stevenson will enjoy this outstanding tale.I highly recommend that the reader keep a couple of sticky notes and a pencil handy. Be sure to compile a list of names and a brief description for EVERY character introduced...you'll need this reference as events unfold.The book cover/binding itself is rugged and can take a serious beating. For any story that's this compelling and 1400+ pages, the quality of the book itself becomes important since you don't finish such a long story overnight. My book survived the London subways, streets of Paris, German autobahn and my luggage to/from Ukraine--all without any problems. The font is larger than any paperback (or hardcover for that matter) and is easy on the eyes. As with any Modern Library production, the quality of this book is exceptionally top notch."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"I am unclear why the Modern Library version is called \\"unabridged\\". It is very obviously abridged.

The best book I've ever read; I'll miss it... I could not tear myself away from this book... My two year-old recognizes it as &quot;papi's book&quot; because I could not put it down.... I kept my wife up with the story and got a chance to relive it that way. She loved it too.Dumas makes you fall in love with his characters, with Mercedes, Edmond Dantes, Abbe Faria, Valentine, Haydee, M.Morrel.... and he makes you hate the bad guys, Danglars, Villefort, Morcef... But in the end you end up doubting just like M. Le Comte.... Every character has an incredible story and every story will take you deap into the time and place and the feeling of it all....This book cannot be described. It must be read. If you will only read one good book in your life; make sure it's this one."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"While I really enjoyed The Count of Monte Cristo, I felt that there was something missing. Imagine my shock when I came here and read the reviews stating that the unabridged book is 1400 pages long; and I realized that I had read the ABRIDGED version at 472 pages long!! Obviously, they cut a lot out of the abridged version. While it was still very good, it was lacking and I felt there were \\"holes\\" in the story (now I know why). I'll definitely be buying the unabridged version so I can re-read it."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"One of the best books I have ever read.

Robin Buss's (1996) translation for Penguin Classics is fantastic - delivering the complete and unabridged (1316 page) original story translated into smoothly flowing idiomatically correct English. Sure, you can pick up the 1850s version for free on Project Gutenburg, but if you're going to commit to a novel of this quality and length, why not spend the $5 and experience the best it has to offer?"},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"This is a repackaged version of Project Gutenberg's Count of Monte Cristo text.

When I first started this book I didn't make it past the first page because I just couldn't get into it. However, a few weeks later I opened the book again and couldn't stop reading. Don't let the page count deter you. This book is genius. The count of monte cristo has it all and just when you think you've seen the last of a character, he/she pops right back up. I love how everything comes together. Make sure to read the unabridged version because other wise you would just miss out on all the stuff that makes this book great. And you can't go wrong with the Robin Buss translation. Enjoy!!"},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"And I will keep reading it every year until I cannot see anymore and then I will listen to it. This will forever be my most favorite and loved novel. If for some strange reason you have not read The Count of Monte Cristo do yourself a favor and read it."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"Hi, I am from Glendale, California and I attend school at Clark Magnet High School; anways, I started reading The Count of Monte Cristo when my Mom refereed me to this book and at first I was kind of skeptical about the fact that this book was really long and was translated from French. Then really got into the book and finished reading it, in a week. This book is filled with philosophy, ideology, divinity and almost every other kind of study that has to do with our everyday life. Dante, who is the main character and the hero of the book is a mastermind of planning his attack though he waits for years and years and trusts god as his usher through the process of him taking vengeance on the people who have done him bad. I know that there are many translated versions of this book, but I have read the one translated by Robin Buss. The font on this book is very small and hard to see, but still if you can not find others, I would advise anyone to read this book. I personally think that this book is a little bit too complicated for a teen audience, but don't let my words stop you if you want to try this book. Alexandre Dumas has written many fiction novels including The count of Monte Cristo , but a think this one is his best novel and one of my favorites also. If you really want to read this book and comprehend every detail, I suggest that you take notes and write down all the names because there are people who bounce from section-to-section and some of them have many identities."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"There have been many heroes in the classics. None, however, equal Edmond Dantes. He is the most inspirational character in literature. Left for dead in a horrid French prison, he rises up and becomes a man of incredible means. Once a worthy ship captain, he comes to master such arts as chemistry, medicine, swordplay, gunplay, language, and disguise. Once an honorable young man, he now seeks vengeance from those who wronged him. Edmond is a calculating man in his ventures. However, he is not cruel. When he exacted his revenge on the lawyer who wronged him, he realized that he had gone to far in allowing the death of the lawyers child. His thoughts were &quot; God is no longer with me. I have gone to far. We shall spare the last&quot; (meaning Danglars, another man who wronged him). Noone can equal him in his prowess. His mastery of the duel is truly scary. He became a distinguished noble in French society, by using his charm. However, he always had a plan, and that plan was payback to those who ruined his young life. The Count of Monte Cristo describes his payback, in all his glory. The book shows that the world still has justice. A very thought provoking yet highly entertaining masterpiece!"},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"One of the VERY FEW books I've ever read more than once and still found myself drawn into. Full of suspense, twists and turns and a climatic ending that gets better by the page! A true classic of literature! A work of art! Brilliant!"},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"The Count of Monte Cristo is a moving, spectacular piece. It is the greatest novel that I have ever read and I hope others will give it a try. The novel is full of twists and turns, providing for a captivating story, as the reader follows the Count through countless changes and metamorphoses. It is a wonderful, creative story that is, in my books, heralded as one of the greatest of all time. However, as it is a complicated and long story, one should not choose to read the Count if one is looking for an easy read. I read it in my freshman year of high school, for the first time, so I think that the novel is appropriate for many different age levels in all its complexity. The story, in certain editions, comes with a table of characters, which makes the comprehension of the novel simpler, yet I think that it is much more fun to discover on ones own the outcomes in the book. What a wonderful literary classic! Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"I was absolutly intrigued from the very first page. The rapid sequence of events makes it impossible to put the book down. I particullarly favor the part when Edmond is in jail and befriends, and later gains immense knowledge, from the Abe. I was panicked when Dantes attempts to escape (and succeeds) after being hurled into the ocean in place of his dead friend. I love the genius character (Edmond Dantes)that Dumas has created. Dumas' wonderful way with words leads the reader to feel an array of emotions through the coarse of the novel. ~15 yrs."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"I have never read a book filled with such great plots of vengeance and justice!

This book is wonderful, and kept me on the edge my seat until the end.I suggest you read this book"},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"This is the best work of fiction I have ever read. You can make a good argument that this is the best novel ever written.

Do yourself a favor and read this book, you will not regret it, I guarantee it."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"The story is very captating, it taps into two of humanities' basic desires; revenge and power. Too many french words were left unexplained in the book, I assume that they were just copied from the original text.

If you liked the Three Musketeers, you'll love this book"},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"I was first introduced to Edmund Dantes as a child (circa 1946)and was enthralled by the child's edition of this classic. Even the movies of the day told the story of The Count of Monte Cristo (abridged and with the &quot;typical Hollywood altered screenplay.&quot; The story has been a classic since its inception; but Robin Buss translates the French with aplomb clarity and poetry. He has made this magnificent novel in French a magnificent novel in English. Read it and enjoy. It is a masterful translation of a masterful story."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"This book has been quoted extensively and has remained a part of the literary canon for centuries and with good reason - it's simply a phenomenal work of art. The kind of dense fiction with multiple storylines and huge casts of colorful characters has sort of disappeared in this day and age, which is why works such as this one will always continue to engage and inspire us. Dumas' novel of revenge paints a wonderful picture of what high society was like in Paris at the time, all while following Edmond Dantes' plans to exact revenge upon the people who put him behind bars due to their jealosy and greed. He was simply a good man who was too trusting of those around him and this trust got him locked away for 14-years. Everything that happens in this novel flows so smoothly, and although the 1400+ pages is daunting, it is certainly worth your while. I'd love to see writers today try to write again with this kind of density. I really can't say enough how fantastic (I'm running out of superlatives) this book is and I know that anyone who reads it will agree that Dumas is a literary genius. This book is \\"Infinitie Jest\\" if Wallace's book made sense all the way through, \\"Atonement\\" if McEwan branched out and tried to fully flesh out the personalites and traits of all of the characters, and \\"The Corrections\\" if it had a more exciting plot (All of these books rank up as some of my favorites, but each succeeds in only a few ways, while I feel this book does it all).Just make sure you're ready to commit a few weeks to this one. You won't regret it."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"dumas as evidenced by books like the count of monte cristo and the three musketeers has no peer when it comes to the adventure novel category. if you are sensible and believe that all those crappy nytimes-recommended-boring-serious novels are not all that constitutes good fiction, well you are on the right track with this one. 'made up stories' don't get any better than this."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"Don't be afraid of the length of this book.By the time you are done you will be wishing this story would never end.This book will satisfy everyone,the adventurer,the romantic,the young and the old,It is everything you want in a great read."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"Truly one of the great classics. I've read Le Comte de Monte Cristo 4 times now and each time it gets better. This printing was nice that it included endnotes to help explain some of the finer points of Dumas's epic tale of love and revenge. No matter how many times I read this I find myself wishing I could step right into Dumas's tale and take part. The power of Dumas's writing is best when you re-read the book and find yourself just as engaged and more than that you find yourself trying to will Le Comte to alter his course of revenge. A great book that is very difficult to put down until the final word."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"While it doesn't indicate it, this is a heavily abridged version of the story, and pretty much just deals with the elements contained in the 2002 film. It's still a good story, but gets 2 stars for not indicating that it's abridged, and because even at 1400 pages, the full unedited story by Dumas is MUCH richer and makes for a much more satisfying story. Do not cheat yourself of that satisfaction by settling for 1/3 of the story."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"I started this book with some reluctance. I already read and enjoyed the abridged version and was concerned that the extra pages in the full version were taken out for a reason. I'm happy to report that the full version is even better than the abridged. It fills in the abridged version's gaps, adds some exciting chapters, and provides more background on the characters. My only quibble is that Dumas wrote the original story for a series published in a periodical. He was paid by the line and in some conversations it shows.An added bonus is the introduction and footnotes provided by Robin Buss. The footnotes explain Dumas' historical and literary references. The introduction provides good background and analysis. The book is loosely based on a true story.Those who have only seen the movie versions will enjoy the book. Because of the book's length and complex subplots the movies can't do it justice. Hopefully someone will do a miniseries based on the book. In the meantime, new readers are in for a treat."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"This is the best book I have read. I am young, and yes I have not read many classic novels, but the immense amounts of joy I have recieved from finishing this story is far better than any other written material I have read!!"},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"The Count of Monte Cristo was a Superhero long before Superheros were cool.A 19th-century cross between James Bond, Batman, Zoro, and Dirty Harry, the title character is a seemingly all powerful and all knowing master of all trades, whether languages, art, chemistry, disguise, psychology, philosophy, theology, international relations, literature, protocol, diplomacy, or combat. But he is also deeply conflicted and brooding man who builds his life around a dramatic quest for revenge against the men who ruined him early in his life, but who along the way darkly questions his decisions and motives.As a young man, Edmond Dante had the perfect life: a beautiful fiance, a promising career, and dedicated friends. But the jealously of a few people around him combined with some unfortunate circumstances, ruined him, and he ended up jailed for life on the harrowing island prison Chteau d'lf. After an apprenticeship with learned co-prisoner Abb&eacute; Faria, Dant&egrave;s makes a daring escape from Chteau d'lf, finds millions the then-dead Faria had hidden away, and then changes his name -- Monte Cristo is the name of the fictional island where Faria's treasure was hidden -- and begins his epic quest for vengeance.It is not inaccurate to look at The Count of Monte Cristo as a novel about revenge, but it is much more than that. It is a story about love and anguish, about sin and redemption, and about light and darkness. It is also an extraordinarily captivating read, the rare example of important historical literature that is also a good fit for reading on the beach or during airport layovers, and an appropriate read for anyone in his or her early teens and onward into old age.The book is also a great conversation piece: while I was reading it, at least half a dozen people stopped me to ask what I thought of the story, often with nostalgic and wistful looks in their eyes.There are some flaws to The Count of Monte Cristo that are common with 19th-century literature: a complicated cast of characters, for example, means the reader must keep up with many names and relationships. And the reader must also employ a willing suspension of disbelief, not only to accept that the protagonist can rise from such humble origins to become so good at everything he does (this is the case with almost all Superhero stories), but also in order to believe that the cast of nefarious enemies in mostly modest circumstances who wronged him at the start somehow rose to become the wealthiest and most powerful group in early 19th century Paris. The neat ending in which no evil-doer is left unpunished and almost no worthwhile personage is not left standing seems too neat and pat, even by today's Hollywood standards. But are these really flaws in the book or of the times?I choose to think it's the latter, which is why I believe this dark and fascinating story is so important and worthwhile, a real thriller that puts modern representatives of the genre to shame."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"I have read this book once a year for about ten years, and it never gets old. A great story of revenge."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"alexandre dumas included love, vengance,action, and well thought out characters in to the triumphant tale of edmond dantes, latter to be come the awe-inspiring count of monte cristo."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"I read this in an unabridged edition (117 chapters, circa 1400 pages), which I don't regret. However, having plowed my way to the end, I am tempted to classify this along with \\"Dracula\\" as a \\"classic\\" novel whose reputation rests more on its great beginning than on its middle and end. It was great up to about chapter 30 (describing the betrayal, imprisonment and escape of the hero, and the reward of his friends). However, once the story starts to sink in to the prolonged revenge, it starts to lose its way for me.After chapter 30, the hero becomes a sort of divinely inspired madman, who imagines himself to be, and apparently is, a mere tool and agent of God's justice. His behavior transcends moral laws, his plans transcend human intelligence, and he becomes impossible to identify with as a character. Fortunately, there are plenty of other characters, and the story, from this point on, is rarely told from the mysterious Count's point of view. If you are willing to settle in and be patient, you can have some fun watching the weaving, interacting sprawling plot threads. Even so, when it was all said and done, it was wrapped up in a way that left a bad taste in my mouth.I would not, however, recommend reading an abridged version. Too many threads intersect, and you cannot trust an abridger to like the same parts that you will like."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"In this romanitc novel events do not develop quite as quickly as in another very famous Dumas classic, The Three Musketeers. A young Catalonian sailor, Dantes, is unjustly accused an imprisoned--his enemies believe for life. However, he gets an education in prison from Faria who also reveals to him the secret of the enormous treasure hidden, of all people, by Ceasare Borgea. The young sailor miraculously survives his daring escape, obtains the treasure, and uses it to inflict dreadful punishment on his enemies and to reward those who tried to remain loyal to him. Dantes, who morphs into Count Monte Cristo and, along the way, into a cast of supporting characters, sees himself as an instrument of vengeance in the hands of God, whose name he constantly invokes (too often perhaps). But his faith is peculiarly non-Christian, since he harbors earthly hatred and a burning desire for revenge, and has no intention of forgiving his enemies, until they have been reduced to utter misery. Hence all the trappings of the Orient in Monte Cristo's retinue, his furnishings, and even his eating habits--remember he refused to eat when he met his once beloved Mercedez. He is not ready to be merciful and forgiving. Dumas mentions, kind of warily, that Dantes at one instance, toward the end of his vengeance, did reflect that perhaps he has gone too far, but overall, it's still a nice romantic story of love, hate, and ambition where God and faith intervene on behalf of Earthly justice."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"Judging by the reviews here, criticizing this book is like criticizing Shakespeare -- anything less than full throated praise is dismissed. Let me be clear: I loved this book and it was well worth the time it took to read. It is deservedly considered a timeless classic.Nevertheless, it definitely has a pace that is not seen in modern books. If this had been created by a contemporary writer it would probably be about 25% shorter. I'm not saying that would make it better, it would simply make it a book created for modern sensibilities.If you like fast-paced modern writing, you will definitely need to recalibrate your expectations. Once you accept this book on its own terms, it is a very rewarding read."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"After having let this book languish on my TBR pile for over a year, intimidated by the sheer size of it, about a month ago I found myself in the mood to read a \\"chunkster\\", and so gave it a go. And now, having made my way through all 1462 pages, I can best sum up my opinion of the book by simply saying - it is very long.Alexandre Dumas' classic tale of revenge tells the story of Edmond Dantes, handsome young French sailor. The story opens in Marseilles in 1815 when he is in his early twenties; having just been promoted to captain of his own ship, and about to marry the love of his heart, his life is full of promise. But alas, in his circle of acquaintances are three people whom he considers friends in some degree or another, but who are actually enemies. Motivated by jealousy and simple, pure hatred of the enviable Dantes, they frame him for treason and he is thrown in prison for life without even the benefit of a trial. After 14 years in prison, through a series of providential events he manages to escape, finds himself in possession of a vast fortune, and begins the long, slow process of enacting revenge on all those who caused his wrongful imprisonment.The first 500 or so pages, which recount the story up to Dantes' escape, were well-paced and interesting. Likewise the last 300 or so pages, in which his elaborate schemes of revenge are finally realized and his victims fall like so many dominoes, was fairly interesting (although by then I was mentally through with the book and so sped-read much of the ending). It is the 700 or so pages in the middle where the story lags, sags, and drags on endlessly.This is not a tale of redemption, forgiveness or any other noble human trait -- although at the very end Dantes (now the self-styled Count of Monte Cristo) does feel a bit of remorse as he finally realizes he has gone too far. This is a tale of a man whose life becomes consumed with seeking all-out revenge, pure and simple. It is also a tale of adultery, murder, betrayal, depravity and numerous other ugly human traits, played out by a large cast of characters whose relationships are more intertwined than a plate of spaghetti (making the story, for me, the equivalent of a 19th century French soap opera). At the center of it all is the Count of Monte Cristo, a totally unrealistic and over-the-top character who is a master of disguise, omnipresent and omniscient, and who has a masterful command of seemingly every topic from the arts to finance to arms to soldiery to you name it. Just how he came to possess such varied knowledge and talent in the 10 years or so between his escape from prison and when his elaborate schemes of revenge began to play out is never really explained. Nor is the reason behind his vampire-like paleness and aversion to eating, although it seems to be important since the author has various characters commenting on it throughout the book.If you just want to read an over-the-top tale of elaborate revenge then I suppose you would enjoy this -- obviously many people do since it is such an enduringly popular classic. I would highly recommend an abridged version, however, since there is much that could be cut out of this doorstop of a book without losing any of the meat of the story. If, however, you are set on reading an unabridged version then I do not recommend this particular one (published by Modern Library Classics). It is full of typographical and punctuation errors and it doesn't have any annotation or notes, which I would have found very helpful in understanding many of the comments and references throughout the book.I don't totally regret having spent four weeks on this book, if only to be able to say I've read it. But this will probably be my first and last work by Dumas."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"What I'd like to write to Blackstone Audio Classic is 'why did they leave out the chapter towards the end when Edmond returns to the Chateau d'If?'

I've read many of Dumas's works, and this far surpasses each of them. The characterization, the way that each of the \\"bad guys\\" had their own reasons for being bad, and Dumas forces us to understand, the way that the Count is caught up in being (forgive me) torn away, the way that he believes himself unable to move on without revenge, and yet he has already in body. The wonderful Haydee (who is very similar to the Haydee in 'Don Juan' by Lord Byron), both passionate and demure, both constant and painless. She gives the Count a life he lost in the Chateau D'If. (Oh, the Chateau actually exists, so look it up on the 'net while readin that part for a visual, or, I should say, a secondary one.)And NEVER forget Luigi Vampa, the lord of the Count's underworld! The embodiment of careless mockery! Oh! Even Franz could love him!DO NOT ASSUME THAT YOU KNOW THIS BOOK IF YOU HAVE SEEN THE MOVIE. Do not give credit to the terrible abridgement the movie attempted to call The Count of Monte Cristo. All the \\"bad guys\\" were all rolled into ONE person, the Count himself was not nearly so evil, and many other terrible changes that destroyed the darkness of the book... The one that takes the cake is the AFFAIR between the married Mercedes and the Count! I couldn't believe it! The Count DESPISED her after she married his nemesis!Anyway, this was a really cruddy review.

I know; someone suggested it to me, and the first thought I had was what!? me, read that!?!?I'm not really fond of literature/classic kinds of books, so the Count and I didn't get off to a good start. I WAS a bit curious though..All in all, I found it an amazing book. I especially love how Dumas protrays each character--true, they can get a bit mixed up at times, but it didn't deter me!--with deep thought for each of their personalities and proper actions (At least, I thought their actions were very appropriate in proportion to the descriptions of them).Also, the plot is interesting and intense enough to keep you immersed. Sometimes Dumas explains things a bit too much, but skimming through those parts hasn't damaged the story (for me, at least). I highly recommend The Count as a leisure book, or for anytime, really. If you've got time to read, and want to enjoy it, read this!

It was only after I was reading through it when I noticed stuff different from my penguin soft back version did I flip to the front to discover the book was abridged.Who ever edited this book had to have been stupid because they did a horrible job of editing. I could understand cutting material which isn't critical to the story. Examples from the unabridged version included 'How to rescue a gardener from dormice who are eating his peaches' and 'the road for Belgium.' However to deliberately omit major portions which are critical to the whole of the story is wrong and causes the whole story to be misrepresented.Major portions which were omitted included the the final judgment of Danglars at the hands of Vampa, and also the story of Andrea Cavalcanti and how he ties to both Villefort and Danglars. Even the comic book version of the story I read as a kid managed to included all of these.This abridged version of this book isnt worth the paper it is written on. I am extremely disappointed at Barnes and Noble for putting their name on crap like this.

A proper COUNT audio book should be in the neighborhood of 30 CDs...this one is only 14, although this information is concealed in the product description. The picture shown is not accurate. BEWARE!"},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"This massive book has all the hallmarks of what you would expect in a classic: intriguing characters with great psychological depth as they evolve over a long period of time, an extraordinarily intricate plot of adventure and tranformation, and moral lessons along with rich ironies. So long as you embrace the complexity and can live in another world, the full version is utterly rivetting to read.Everyone knows the plot in outline. A gifted and yet simple sailor, Dantes, is the victim of a conspiracy involving thwarted love, greed, and unbridled ambition. By eliminating him, three men get what they want and move brilliantly into the rapidly changing and corrupt French society. They forget Dantes, who is isolated in despair in a notorious political dungeon, the Chateau d'If. While in prison, he meets an Italian savant who tunnels into his room and who teaches him the entire pantheon of classical knowledge, which he memorised as a tutor to princes; he also harbors a secret about an immense treasure on the island of Monte Cristo. Dantes escapes, finds the treasaure, and sets about creating an elaborate series of traps to wreak vengence on the three men who condemned him. This occurs in about the 1st 250 pages of the book. At this point, after doing some good for a family that had tried to help him, Dantes' interior dialogue - so vivid as he figures out who betrayed him and learns to hate them while learning the love the Italian savant as a 2nd father - becomes silent to the reader. What Dantes then does is insinuate himelf into French high society, creating relationships with the 3 men and their families with a cunning that can only be called genius. This takes place over about 700 pages and is an indictment of the society that Dumas despised. Though the Count is falling in love, his hatred is so implacable and cold as to render him an automaton of vengence. Then, in the last 3rd of the book as the train of destruction he created is set in motion, Dantes is again reborn as a man who can feel and reflect on what he has done. It is a moving apotheosis of redemption and regret.What is so amazing about the story is that, as outlandish as some of the plot twists and coincidences are, the reader is (or at least I was) swept into a fast-moving narrative that is irresistably readable. In doing so, Dumas helped to spawn an entirely new genre of novel: the psychological thriller, or adventure that provokes reflection and awe. Its depth is beyond a simple swashbuckler. Its world is complete in sumptuous and realistic detail while remaining too fantastic to believe. Its characters are so complex and yet such romantic ideals as they evolve. Moreover, there are also a number of symbols throughout the book, evoking Christian and pagan themes, so that the book can be interpreted on a number of levels.This is one of the best novels I ever read and certainly Dumas' best. Though it took me an entire summer to get through it, I will never forget it. For those of you who read French, Dumas' language is stunningly clear and graceful, while using a vocabulary that is easily accessible. Highest recommendation."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"The Count of Monte Cristo is the best book I've read in quite a long while. I wasn't expecting it to be. Frankly, I tend to have low expectations for 19th-century European novels in regard to sheer readability. Like vegetables and trips to the dentist, they tend to be more good for you than simply good. Add in the fact that the unabridged version is over 1000 pages, and I felt sure that the Count would be a somewhat difficult companion.Nothing could be farther from the truth! Edmond Dantes' adventures kept me fully engrossed from beginning to end. I was disappointed to turn the final page, left longing for more.If you've seen a movie version of Count of Monte Cristo, expect surprises. I had seen both the Richard Chamberlain and Jim Caviezel versions before reading the book (mmmm . . . Jim Caviezel), but neither were entirely true to the storyline or the mood of the original.Edmond himself is a thoroughly satisfying and seductive hero. (The reader must take with a grain of salt the numerous references to his drug habit; at the time, opium was unfortunatly de rigeur for a Romantic hero.) The secondary characters are equally engrossing, from the admirable Maximilian Morrel to the villainous Danglars; and the ingenious machinations by which Edmond contrives to reward the deserving and doom the guilty make the chapters fly by.I would encourage everyone to be sure and get the unabridged version of this masterpiece. It is by no means slow or ponderous, and the thought of what must be left on the cutting room floor to reduce this book to half its size makes me wince."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"This masterpiece is a story of triumph, love, jealousy, wisdom, mystery, revenge, suspence, travel, secrets, longing, all the things that make up life.

It makes me wonder, is it even possible to write a great novel anymore? (not that writing is some big competition or something). There is nothing about this book that could have been better. It is as close to perfection as you could get. The writers intimate knowledge of paris, life, and people is unparalleled. If you want to be a writer or simply want to see the artwork of writing at the height of it's powers, here it is. This has the power of a mozart symphony or a charle parker solo.

Buss's version is not available on Kindle!! :("},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"In these troubled times, we are facing a crisis that is not mentioned very much. We have grown teenagers who don't like to read and cannot pronounce the simplest words. If they do read, it's the latest Wal-Mart fad novel that will not be remembered in 100 years. As for the classics, they are shunned upon as being too complex and too long to read.At least I still got the reading mojo people lacked. This is probaly the greatest book I've read in awhile. Even though it was written over 160 years ago, it's still hard to beat.The basic outline of the plot is simple. It takes place in France, and even though it is written in English, many French elements remain. Edmund Dantes has it all. He's a well respected sailor who has a beautiful bride-to-be named Mercedes. But unknown to him, a man named Fernand, (who is also Mercedes' cousin 0_0) wants her as well. So with the help of a man name Danglers, he sends a letter accusing Dantes of being a traitor, and the prosecutor Villefort sends him without trial to the Chteau d'If, an island prison, which is a real place, by the way. There he spends fourteen years of his life, the only company he has is a secret communication with the supposedly mad Abbe Faria, who helps him figure out who the framers were. When he dies, Dantes replaces his body with his own and he is thrown off to sea, where he manges to recover and heads to the island of Monte Cristo, where Faria said there was a treasure at. After becoming rich, he plans his unique revenge against his accusers, under the alias of the Count of Monte Cristo.But it's more than a tale of revenge. The novel is filled with many characters who have their own agendas, as well as some extraordinary writing and many twists in the story. It's actually kind of sad that this book doesn't get as much respect as it deserves. While you may be turned off by its length (don't get the abridged version, or God forbid the Great Illustrated Classics version, AKA 'Literature for Dummies') and its archaic language, but anyone who actually knows how to read should understand this book.So yeah, the next time you're at the library or the bookstore, perhaps you should skip Breaking Dawn and read something good, like this."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"Without a doubt, this is the best work of fiction I have read in a long time. The depth and detail is just stunning. People don't write like this anymore. I'm only about halfway through this (it's over 1,300 pages), but I haven't tired of it at all. This is really a character study on the nature of man at its core. The author's observations in this respect are sprinkled throughout the story and are both deep and humorous at times. Truly a classic work of literature. This unabridged translation is very well done, and maintains a \\"classic\\" feel - slightly challenging and not at all dumbed down in the language. I would recommend it to any mature adult. However, it is not for children or adolescents, due to the wide ranging and at times harsh situations."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"Having just bought a Kindle, I decided to read some of the classics, since I can get them for free thanks to Kindle. I saw the Count of Monte Cristo movie some time ago and decided to give this a shot. The beginning middle and end of the book are fabulous. I had to push through at about 70% through the book though. I even watched the movie after reading this. The author does a great job detailing the agony of the Count's revenge, where in the movie its one nice little trap set that does not really show how the Count made the others suffer. It was a great read, and had me thinking in old English all week."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"This is one of the greatest tales of revenge of all time. We owe to Dumas's skillful hand a narrative rivaling WAR AND PEACE, a vast collection of characters and tales within tales, all finally ancohered together upon the dreadful downfall of Edmond Dantes and his in some ways equally dreadful rebirth as that mysterious agent of justice, the Count of Monte Cristo. It is a fascinating story, providing thrills -- but not at the expense of shallowness -- and provoking thought -- but without affectation.My only piece of advice to the reader is to take a few notes on the characters, since they disappear and reappear, and sometimes are referred to by different names and titles. However, for what it is worth, I was able to follow the story closely enough to thoroughly enjoy it even without notes, and despite occasionally being forced to set the book down for a few weeks between chapters.Because of the size of the book, the Modern Library Classics edition is especially useful, having comparatively large and legible print, decent spacing between lines, and, most importantly, a flexible spine which allows it to be set open on a table without creasing or cracking."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"i love this book! it is one of my favorite classics, and i higly reccomend it to everyone. however, DO NOT BUY THIS EDITION!!! i borrowed this book from the library, only it was a much older edition, in hardcover, and much longer. i loved it. i bought this edition because i wanted to read it again and again, and i thought that it would be nice to have a paperback that was shorter, so it wouldn't be so bulky. i got three chapters into this edition and realized that it was abridged, despite not mentioning the fact anywhere. not only was it abridged (not to mention not telling me of that) but it left out complete parts, parts that were important to the story, including when fernand and danglars write the note accusing dantes, danglars trying to make caderousse too drunk to remember, and renee asking de villefort to be merciful to the prisonr. i don't know what else they've left out, seeing as how i didn't finish beyond the seventh chapter. also, the chapters are only two to four pages in this edition, while in the real book they are much longer. i would strongly like to deter anyone from buying this edition. it is a waste of time and money. buy the real thing."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"The introduction to this excellent Modern Library edition says, &quot;The long journey of Edmond Dantes is one that we should all take at some point in our lives.&quot; I couldn't agree more. This novel easily ranks among the greatest epics--The Odyssey, Don Quixote, Les Miserables, War &amp; Peace and The Brothers Karamazov come to mind as works of comparable scope and moral grandeur.My only advice is: set aside some time. With 1500 pages, a complex web of characters (including many with shifting identities) and more than a few dispensible subplots, this unabridged edition is a challenge--albeit a rewarding one.The novel tackles all the great themes: war, revolution, love, power, money, justice, evil, God. But in a word, it's subject is REVENGE. A good-natured young man of exceptional promise, Edmond Dantes is betrayed by his erstwhile friends, unjustly imprisoned by an ambitious magistrate, and left for dead by the woman he loves. The first three hundred pages of the story are fast-paced and almost cinematic, from the wrenching scenes of betrayal and imprisonment, down to Dantes' miraculous escape and rebirth as a remarkable new man, the Count of Monte Cristo.The Count is part 007, part Stoic philosopher. He'll drop you in a duel, match wits with you in the salon, concoct potions from recipes in a dozen languages, be in three places at once, with three different identities, and exercise a kind of foresight and control over human events that we normally associate with gods and conspiracy theories. Oh yeah--and he's loaded, too.Dantes burns with a desire for revenge, but it's an entirely different sort than the Clint Eastwood/Charles Bronson variety. Instead of blasting his way into Paris with a semi-automatic (or less anachronistically, with a really big sword), Dantes methodically plots the downfall of his enemies using even more lethal weapons: the evil that lurks in their own hearts.All this takes a long time. There is a big drop off in intensity in the middle chunk of the novel, as Dumas transitions from the swashbuckling Napoleonic days to a more traditional European novel of manners set in the 1830s. A whole new set of characters are introduced. Later, we discover their relationship to Dantes' earlier antagonists--but for a time we are totally at sea. Meanwhile, Dumas launches various digressions that will occasionally cause the reader to wonder whether he was getting paid by the word (probably).But don't despair. The last half of the novel gathers steam like a freight train, as Count of Monte Cristo moves in for the kill. The suspense builds--not because we wonder whether Dantes will get his revenge, but whether he can avoid turning into a monster in the process.Ultimately, Dumas offers as sane and humane a message as you can hope for from 1500 pages of injustice and vengeance. In a novel where fortunes shift, names and titles are granted and extinguished, and identities are transformed on turns of luck, the old Stoic wisdom shines through. It's not what happens to you, good or bad, but how you respond to it, that determines true virtue in this world. One suspects this would be true even without an avenging Providence, even if Edmond Dantes' triumph were less complete."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"The single star refers to this version, not the book itself. Do not read this version if you want the complete version of the Count of Monte Cristo. Other reviewers have noted that this is an abridged version, but it is much worse than that, this is a 19th century English Bowdlerized version. Still worse is the fact that the publisher does not disclose this fact, which I consider to be quite deceptive. Significant subplots have been eliminated so as not to have to contend with what the Bowdlerizer considered unpleasant story elements such as: murder (two of them are eliminated in this version), an affair between two main characters leading to the illegitimate birth of a third character, the attempted infanticide of that third character and a lesbian relationship. Important characters become merely ciphers, and main characters just fade away because the chapters describing their fate have been eliminated. While important chapters are eliminated, the flowery 19th century prose (or at least the English translation of this language) is retained. Thus, this version is over 600 pages long. In contrast, the Lowell Bair translation and abridgement (published by Bantam) is about 200 pages shorter. However, the Bair version is more complete in terms of story elements and is a version that I recommend.This book contains some enrichment in term of additions of some historical background, information about the life and work of Dumas, chapter notes and interpretive notes. In my opinion, however, these enrichments in no way compensate for the trashing of Dumas' story. Also, beware if you read this version for school, you will suffer the double handicap of not getting the complete story while still having to wade through over 600 pages of 19th century prose. Read the whole thing, or at least an abridgement that uses a more modern prose style, while still retaining the whole story. Beware, however, the complete book is about twice as long as this version and many times the size of the Bair abridgement."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"I picked up the book because I found the movie very entertaining and thought it'd be nice to read the classic novel.

As soon as I found out I went and got the complete version of the book and started all over. It astounds me how much they cut out. They pretty much butchered the story. Please read the book because is fabulous, but not this version."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"Parisian bon vivant, drinker, womanizer and genius Alexandre Dumas has, in \\"The Count of Montecristo\\", given the world one of the greatest stories ever told.It is a marvel of literary invention. Its literary scope and scale and historical sweep is nothing short of revolutionary, and for all of its grandeur and jaw-dropping perspective, it is unfailingly intimate, brutally so.\\"The Count of Montecristo\\" is the story of young Edmond Dantes, a French sailor aboard the merchant-vessel Pharaon in 1815, who returns to the port of Marseilles with the glorious Catalan girl Mercedes waiting to be his bride, and with a promising future as the captain of the merchantman ahead of him.Or so he thinks: for there is no poison so bitter, so brutal, or so deadly as envy. And as Old Scratch slithered forth as a serpent to poison even earthly paradise, so too Dantes is stalked by an envious trio of the sort that put Caesar in an early grave: the bitter and calculating Danglars, supercargo of the Pharaon; Danglars's drinking buddy Caderousse; and Mercedes's cousin Fernand, hopelessly in love with his cousin and aghast at her impending marriage to Dantes.It is 1815; a time of shaky stability for France and Europe. The Ogre of Corsica has just been put down, exiled to Elba---but Bonapartist clubs assassinate Royalist generals in the capital, and the alleys of Marseilles are rife with whispers of Napoleon's return.It is into this poisonous, heated, feverish atmosphere that this trio of serpents work their vindictive magic, and with the flick of a plume the happy Dantes, on the very day of his wedding and at his nuptial feast, finds himself surrounded by soldiers, held at bayonet point, and hauled before the implacable gaze of Justice. And fatality!---Justice consigns him to the wretched dungeons of the Chateau D'If, a heartless, impregnable rock off the coast of France---for the rest of his life.To say anything more would be to give far too much away, but know this: \\"The Count of Montecristo\\" is both black book of revenge and horror tale: a consumptively engaging story of double Betrayal, Death, and Despair: a Man consigned to death and rot by his supposed friends and colleagues, buried beneath the Earth in a great black tomb, forgotten by his best beloved, lost to everything, left for the teeth of rat and Time.And it is also a tale of Resurrection---and Revenge.You'll want to get a copy of the unabridged version; Random House's The Modern Library edition (published in 1996) is a fine choice, and just so you can check (be warned: the shelves are full of sliced and diced pretenders) the unexpurgated version clocks in at a hefty 1462 pages. That means once you're through with it, you can use it to forestall a burglary or brain an assassin.Never have 1500 pages moved so swiftly and deftly. A rumor, bandied around the streets of Paris in Dumas's day which resurfaced in Perez y Reverte's mesmerizing \\"Club Dumas\\", is that the jolly-faced Dumas signed a blood-contract with Satan, and in return for his soul he was given a diabolic gift to be prolific.Diabolic or Angelic, there is no doubt that Dumas is pure genius: you marvel at the simultaneous breadth and depth and intimacy of \\"Count of Montecristo\\". There is no padding here; not one sentence is superfluous and every word tells. A paragraph sliced away here, a sentence taken out there, and the perfect, brutal, logical, coldly calculating structure would fall apart.In the meantime, the reader is introduced to some of the most fascinating and memorable characters in history: the tragic, beautiful Mercedes; her dandyish son Albert; her husband, the stiff and martial Count Fernand de Mortcerf. We see, in his middle age, the ever-calculating banker Danglars and his miserable family, including the boyish, driven, devious and ultimately foolish Eugenie; the Prosecutor of the King, Villefort, and his fascinating family: the hopelessly innocent Valentine, the paralyzed, rabid old Jacobin M. de Noirtier, and the Prosector's young---and tragically greedy---trophy wife.Beyond these characters, \\"Count of Montecristo\\" gives us even more, taking us deep into the lives of France's Rich & Famous---and villainous! We come face to face with the Old Ogre of Corsica himself, Napoleon Bonaparte. We pass the time in Latin and philosophy with the foppish, foolish, overly confident King Louis XVIII, who would rather count the angels on the head of a pin than martial his troops against the lively spectre of Bonapartism.And I have but scratched the surface: this story is the very essence, the pure, undiluted blood, of swashbuckling fantasy. Here we have pirates and Roman brigands, the famous Italian banditti Luigi Vampa, stories within stories within stories, buried treasure on a deserted volcanic island rising up over the waves of the Tyrrhennian sea. We have mad monks, and midnight assignations, and foundlings and changelings and villainous [...] sons appearing out of the blue. We have plots, and poisonings, and murder, and villainy, and great heroism; we have connections to the marvellous, tragic downfall of the great Abyssinian hero Ali Pasha.In short, we have a marvellous witch's brew of high treason and infamy, a Devil's Codex of revenge, retribution, and absolution. My flimsy prose is not worthy to provide adequate praise to this masterpiece: get a copy, close the curtains, have a bottle of your finest chianti at the ready, smoke some Montecristo cigars if you're a smoker (you should know that these, the finest the Dominican Republic offers, were inspired by this tale), turn off all the phones in the house---and transport yourself to a tale of betrayal, death, resurrection, villainy and revenge---served Piping Cold."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"Unfortunately when I ordered this edition, it was not shown that this is only the abridged version. I was looking forward to getting into a good story, when on the first page I see that is is abridged.

If you want the full version you have to make sure that you don't order this exact item."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"My dad twisted my arm into getting this book over War and Peace. Headed to Mexico, I was certain that I would not come even close to finishing it. Twelve-hundred pages for seven days in Cabo?The second day we were there Mr. Marty the hurricane blew through. I had been up until two o'clock every night reading this - reading it while dad drank margaritas, over breakfast and in the back of the &quot;Mexican Porche.&quot; During the night when the 'Caine raged at the windows, I was saving Morrell's life, sailing for Monte Cristo with Corsicans in tow, rescuing viscounts from the notorious Luigi Vampa, inducing Valentine to save her life through hallucination and speaking the same words four times to the enemies who locked my soul in a dungeon for fourteen years. &quot;I am Edmond Dantes!&quot;Dumas is an absolute MASTER crafter. Both my father and I found ourselves questioning the way we develop and uphold relationships and why bluntness seems useful to many in the place of eloquence and perception. The only reason that no one, excepting Mercedes, figures out who Edmond Dantes, the Count of Monte Cristo, Sinbad the Sailor, Abbe Busoni and Lord Wilmore are is because of the way the Count represents himself and 'others.'I think the real question that The Count of Monte Cristo is asking us today is why we have forgotten the things that were so key to the way people lived back then. Maybe we have gained in science and math, but we have lost so much! Thinking of the forgotten things is the real painfulness of this book. This one is at the very top of my list. Nothing holds a candle to this tale.I haven't stopped talking about it for weeks and I doubt I ever will. These guys are the stuff of Dreams! Believe me, this book will make you sing.SocraTDad's reading it right now! ;)"},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"The Conte of Monte ChristoThe Count of Monte Christo, written by Alexandre Dumas, is about a man named Edmond Dantes who experiences many twists and turns in his life. Edmond Dantes is a respected sailor who was going to marry a girl named Mercedes. Edmond was going to be the captain of his own ship and make a living. He lived in France in 1825 with his father. He is falsely accused of being a Bonapartist (a friend of Napoleon's) on the day of his wedding. Two men planned this accusation and they both benefited from his disappearance. Edmond was sent to a horrible prison and after a month an old man tunnels into his cell. The old man becomes Edmond's teacher in language, manners, and math. He also tells him the names of his two enemies, Danglars and Fernand. Edmond is filled with the power of vengeance and vows to avenge himself. Together, they plan their escape but the old man is hit by a disease. Before the old man dies, he gives Edmond a treasure map. Edmond uses quick thinking to devise a plan to escape and retrieve the treasure. Edmond gets out of jail and recovers the treasure making himself rich. He starts to do good deeds for others and changes his name to the Count of Monte Christo. The Count (Edmond) begins to slowly avenge himself while he helps out \\"Edmond Dantes'\\" loyal friends even though it is Edmond who is really helping them.My favorite quotes are \\"I have instilled in your heart vengeance\\" and \\"For the last four nights I have been watching over you.\\" These quotes show the two main meanings of this book, which are Edmond getting vengeance and Edmond helping his friends. The Count of Monte Christo is a fiction/adventure book that tells Edmond Dantes life story and his adventures. Alexandre Dumas creates great pictures in my mind with his fabulous details. He made the characters consistently sound the same in their dialogue. He used wonderful language and added a little bit of humor in some parts. I was amazed how he mixed English and French together.I would recommend this book to fourteen or fifteen year olds because it is hard to comprehend and the language is old fashioned. I think that it would be hard for younger children to keep track of all the characters. The Count of Monte Christo is unlike any other book that I have read. It is the only book that has had me guessing all the way through. I would infer something and then I was completely wrong, which makes the book exciting. I would compare the Count of Monte Christo to the Lord of the Rings because they are both great adventures. They are extremely well written books and I like them both. Another book series that I compare The Count of Monte Christo to is the Clive Cussler, Dirk Pitt series because in both of the books there are great schemes. In the books, written by Clive Cussler, the people who make up the ingenious schemes are bad. In The Count of Monte Christo, the good guy is the schemer who plots his revenge. They both have good schemes but what separates them is that the good guy is outsmarting the bad guys, Fernand and Danglars. The Count of Monte Christo is the best genre it could be. Very few fantasy or mystery books that I have read matched up to it. The Harry Potter series and Eragon were also good books that I would compare to The Count of Monte Christo.This book was really addicting and I read the whole thing in three days. I was completely hooked by the twentieth page because of the author's detail. I could not put down the book; I even brought it in the car for a two minute drive. The book ended with a twist that I never saw coming."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"My daughter had to read this book for school and really enjoyed it. she still remembers this book and makes constant referenses to the bookeven now. It's a classic that everyone ages 10 and up can enjoy. The storyline was great, and the main ideas were kept and recycled throughout the novel."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"This book is probably my all time favorite. The 1000+ were well worth the read for the amount of life lessons presented. The plot builds slowly and then picks up pace - the last 300 pages were so hard for me to fully appreciate because all I wanted to do was find out how it was all going to end. Try to read this during vacation because having to put it down is so torturous - I tried reading it on my daily commute but truly enjoyed it when I was on a beach and finished the last 600pgs without any interruptions. Beautiful story about love, revenge, patience and the ability to let go."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"This novel artfully provides the best elements of any story: Revenge, adventure, love, action...it's all there. A little slow to start but worth giving a try if you love an epic read."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"And yet the workout,in the way of Anna Karenina, or the whole of the Potter series like most quests for agility and strength is one well spent; what Dumas accomplishes in over a thousand pages is an epic story spanning the breath of the human experience. Drenched in the saturated sweetness of the Romantic tradition, the story of intrigue includes conjectures on things from the stock market, to immunization. Serialized, much like any rampant edition of Order and Law in an SUV, it heralds the imagination, in an age before accessibility and technology. Do yourself a favor: read it."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"I have to say that I have seen all of the movies and I was skeptical that the book could be significantly different. I was very wrong, I listened to the audio book and the narrator was fantastic! The book is beautifully written and this is by far one of the best books of all time!"},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"Even in the movie V for Vendetta, V was watching the Count of Monte Cristo. It was well worth the 3 months of on and off reading. With limited time I was able to squeeze in a 1% here and there. This writing of Dumas is absolutely amazing. His ability to captivate your mind and take you on a journey that involves so many personalities is without a doubt a stroke of genius. Now if we could only get Hollywood to make a movie that follows the book even if it was in two parts it would become an instant classic."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"One of the best pieces of fiction that I have ever read. Maybe THE best. Involved, twisting, emotional plot with deeply entwined subplots. Exceptional character development and growth. I cannot believe how lucky I am to have received my Kindle as a gift. I never would have read this, or Dumas' other works, and would not have known what I was missing. Very long, and very worth every minute spent reading it."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"This is an adventure that takes you to the heights and depths of human emotion.It is necessary reading for understanding thousands of enuendosand quotes peppered throughout our western culture.Mindsets and actions prevelant in the story are still recognized in our modern dayand insights of the author are valuable resources for any reader.Wonderful book to reread over again."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"I was a little hesitant to get the unabridged version upon seeing the heft of it.

I had to read it for English class and it quickly became one of my favorites.

Makes one reflect strongly on the emotions and ups and down of life. I wish I had realized the cross references were present at the end of the book as it may have clarified a few things.

I read reviews that recommended the unabridged versions and I am glad that I read it."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"In short, after reading this book, I have to rate the movie at one star because there was a minimal amount of similarity between the it and the book.

If you have not heard of the sequel, please take a look at the review I wrote on Goodreads.com: [...]"},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"I must say, this is one great book. A real classic, that in spite of being written a long time back, is still as engrossing and pleasurable as ever. The book is long, quite long. Even so, you do not find it tiresome. It keeps you guessing until the end as the Count of Monte Cristo's plan are revealed bit by bit.My advice - BUY IT! It is a great book, if you are not put off by the large size of the book. You will in all probability forget about the size as you keep reading, and the Count emerges as an enigma. Also buy get yourself a decent translation of the book, and the unabridged version. It makes what is already good better. I recommend theThe Count of Monte Cristo (Penguin Classics)"},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"I first read this book back when I was a sophomore in high school. At first I wasn't too excited because I knew the book was from the 1800's and I thought it would be a difficult read. I also saw the movie made in 2002 beforehand and remember not liking it too much. None of the movies they have made to this day do the book any justice though.As soon as I started reading it I was instantly hooked. Dumas has a way with words that makes you feel like you are actually there with the count from his downfall to his eventual revenge. The story is epic in scope and the language is easy enough to understand that I had no trouble following the plot. Each of the characters is believable and the subplots fit perfectly in to the overall story. Once I started reading this, I couldn't put it down.I'm now a sophomore in college, and I've read read the book 3 times now. I suspect I'll read it many more times throughout my life. It's no surprise to me that this book is still popular today almost 170 years later. I recommend everyone to read this book, it's what drew me into classic literature."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"I looked at samples of quite of few of the translations of this classic novel before deciding on this particular translation. I am very happy with it and highly recommend it to anyone who wants to read this classic. I had caught the last part of a version of the movie with Richard Chamberlain and couldn't quite fathom why he was so bent on revenge, so I thought I would get the book and find out for myself. This is not a story of 'forgive and forget' by any means and does not teach Christian charity and forgiveness. It is, however, a well told tale and a fascinating look at that time in history when Napoleon was in exile and looking to find his way back to power in France."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"I've always wanted to read this book!

I often wondered how John Ford was able to fit all the excessive verbiage of \\"Moby Dick\\" in to a film of normal length.

It's compelling, fast-paced, intriguing, romantic, heart-wrenching, and most of all -- the adventure of a lifetime. Alexandre Dumas is one of the most brilliant storytellers of all time. Just as you think you have the plot figured out, a new twist surfaces. Just when you think it couldn't get any better ... it does. Witnessing the transformation of Edmond Dantes into the enigmatic Count of Monte Cristo is both fascinating and tragic. It is, of course, the consummate tale of revenge. But how sweet is that revenge! And how harrowing. Just as fascinating as the Count himself is the cast of supporting characters. You will remember them all long after you've finished the book. Who can forget the villainous M. de Villefort, deceptive Fernand, beautiful Mercedes, greedy Danglars, mysterious Abbe Faria, noble Maximilian, innocent Valentine, loyal M. Morrel, or wise and gentle M. Noirtier? I could go on and on. Every one of them is intriguing in their own right. Just try to put this book down. It defines \\"page-turner\\". I did nothing but talk about this book the whole time I was reading it, and long afterward. I cannot recommend it highly enough. A must-read."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"The Count of Monte Cristo is a timeless classic to be treasure for all time. I want to become one with the Count. His power and passion for revenge is heart stoping. His lust of life suckes you in and don't let go until you come to understanding of yourself. If there is one book to teach young adult respect, disapline and selfworth this is the one."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"I just finished this book and I agree with all the positive comments previously posted. Just wanted to add a few thoughts.This book was originally serialized in a French magazine back in the 1840s. As a consequence, there are repeated cliffhangers at the end of every chapter. Now I don't mind cliffhangers (hey, they move the plot along) but after 116 of these it got a little old. In addition, some of the character transformations seem implausible and Dumas gets some of his facts mixed up from the early part of the novel (I probably would as well).I could pick bones about some part. What was the purpose of the whole Cucumetto bandit story? Maybe Dumas was saving him for later but he never does. They plot also needs a miraculous set of confluences to happen in say, well, every part of novel. Entertaining, yup, but at times I just said, &quot;Oh come on now!&quot; The character of Monte Cristo is a very interesting one. If he could ever hook up with Hannibel Lector, another guy who has the highest level of expertise in nearly every field and endeavor, the rest of us would be in big trouble.Buy this book and enjoy it. It's really quite fun and you'll learn a lot about French history and culture."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"This book didnt seem like the type I would like, at the begining I hated it.

Instead of dont judge a book by its cover... Dont judge a book by the first few chapters!"},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"I am reading the original (French) version side by side with this one, and I have to say that often the translation does not capture the strength and beauty of the original text.

Classics do not only thrill and teach, they also live.The Count of Monte Cristo by Alexandre Dumas is a classic.This tale of accusal, love, betrayal, imprisonment, redemption, and retribution, defies genre.Recounting the plot serves no purpose, so I will simply surmise that most readers focus on vengeance at the expense of reward. Edmond Dantes could not have desired living just to kill those who wronged him; he expected to return to those who remained faithful. Here Dumas, using Dantes, Sinbad, Albert and Abbe Busoni, championed a nonviolent stoicism which exposes a person to death to experience life.The Count of Monte Cristo is a vivid potrayal of French life after the Revolution, an epic account of a man's quest for closure and an inspiration for the Shawshank Redemption. It is never too late to read it."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"By all means read the long version.

While many people would have enjoyed their wealth, Edmund is obsessed with revenge against the people responsible for sending him to prison. He is willing to destroy not only those people, but also their families. Money can buy a lot, and he expends large amounts of his new found wealth on elaborate schemes to ruin the people. Down deep, he is actually not a nice person, and you do not want to get on his wrong side.

When he gets the manuscript of the Abbe Faria and his eyes fall on the epigraph, &quot;Thou shall tear out the teeth of the dragon and trample the lions underfoot, thus saith the Lord&quot;. That part gives me chills all over, the COunt has vanquished his doubt, it was God's will that he does what he does. I own several copies of this book, and always have one around to read parts of.

What I do know is that from the time of Dante's undeserved imprisonment, to the final acts of his revenge that bring a chill rolling through the spine, the reader feels an empty anger that only justice can sate. When the final page whispers against the closing cover, the reader, like Edmund, can again feel whole."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"I'm a high school English teacher. Over the years I've taught numerous novels, but only The Count of Monte Cristo do I never tire of teaching. It has the amazing ability of actually making students who say that they hate to read to suddenly want to read. Do you have a teenager who hates to read? Give him this 441 page abridgement. (Be prepared though for negative comments--he'll propably disclaim, &quot;And you call 441 pages an ABRIDGED edition!&quot;) Next, make him agree to try it at least to page 66 (Dantes's escape from prison).

The thread of Edmond Dante's life is undeniably intertwixed with the common everyday struggle we all share. What makes this book so captivating is the strength Dante draws within himself, and how much he achieves after being jailed unjustly. The intrigue of his revenge was one of the more exciting plot twists.A fantastic read for sure."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"This is one of the best books I have ever read.

Dumas' style is years ahead of his contemporaries. But you wouldn't know this from reading the Modern Library edition because its poor translation gets in the way of both the story and the storytelling. The translator - who is not acknowledged (you won't find his or her name anywhere) - chooses words poorly, punctuates badly, and uses English words that while literally correct are either archaic or inappropriate in context. (For example, using the word \\"bullet\\" for \\"cannon ball.\\") Alexandre Dumas is well worth reading and I recommend the Count of Monte Cristo to everyone, but choose another version. Most Modern Library editions are exceptional; this one is an exception."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"I purchased the Oxford Worlds Classics version of this book, amounting to over 1100 pages thinking I'd never finish this book. A friend told me how great the book was after the movie came out, and said unabridged was the only way to go. I figured I would give it a try, and I finished the book over a period of time.I was definitely surprised at how much the book kept me on my feet. I have not read many 1000+ page books, and this has to be my favorite. The story of Edmond Dantes' revenge on the people who imprisoned him is a true classic. One would figure that a man who has been locked away for 16 years for something he didn't do would come back with violent intentions, but Dantes does not. He keeps his cool, comes across a huge fortune and over time has truly obtained his revenge.A lot of death occurs in the book, but not by the hands of Dantes. Misfortune strikes each of the people who took everything from Dantes, and each time he reveals his identity to one of them, the suspense is very high. This book kept me on the edge of my seat for a long time, and I enjoyed every page of it.If you have the time to devote a few chapters of this book a day, by all means get it. It will remain a classic forever, and will hold a spot as one of the best pieces of French literature ever written."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"The Count of Monte Cristo is one of the best books ever written, if not the best. It is a great piece of Literature written by the multitalented author, Alexandre Dumas. It is a thrilling and exciting adventure story of a young noble boy named Edmond Dantes. He was young honest sailor who had the privilege of directing the ship called the Pharaon after his captain died. He is then betrayed by two people he thought were his fiends, Monsieur Danglars and Fernand. Danglars was jealous of Edmond because he was the likely candidate to be the captain of the pharaon and Danglars wanted the job. Fernand was jealous that Mercedes was in love with Edmond. The public prosecutor M. de Villefort confiscated Edmond's only proof of innocence. The reason is that the evidence proved that de Villefort's father is a Bonapartist, which would put the prosecutor out of the favor of the court. Edmond was sentenced to life in the infamous dungeon, the Chateau d'If. There he makes friends with a priest. They develop a father, son friendship. He spends fourteen long, hard years in jail. He has a daring escape and finally leaves the oppressing dungeon. He then plans his revenge on his enemies. He joins a smuggler ship to protect his identity. He returns to his village, to find his father dead from hunger. He protects himself by changing his name to the Count of Monte Cristo, and travels to find his enemies with his new found fortune. He comes to find his lover Mercedes married to one of his enemies. The book is an action packed, never ending and very exciting. You will go on the greatest thrill ride of your life and it will not stop until you close the book. I enjoyed the book and I appreciated the author's hard work to write a fine piece of literature. It is an adventure story unlike any other, which involves a great deal of mystery. The use of one character in more than one role might be at first confusing, but it only adds to the drama of the story. The story is an intricate web of what the word vengeance really means. The plot is forever rolling and unraveling until the final resolution. You will be on your toes for most of the book and apprehensive to see what is yet to come. I greatly enjoyed the passion of the protagonist, to make his enemies feel the hurt and despair he went through. The plot is nicely developed to intrigue the minds of young adults and to make them think. The reader feels the joy of Edmond his sorrow is also felt.There are a few negative parts of the book. The length of the book may intimidate the reader at first and might deter them away from it. Edmond playing more than one character could also confuse you at first until you read more about the book. There was also the use of many different characters, which confused me as the story progressed. The positive aspect of the book was incalculable. The author's use of plot was very good and used wisely, this added to the quality of writing. I liked the book a lot and I would recommend it to anybody ages 13-up.

I think that this book is a good book and really the movie seems as if it's from a completely separate story that just happens to have some connecting points.

But, it's a very, very long read. Not that the twisted (often convoluted) story isn't intriguing. Most of us are probably aware of the story and most of us have probably seen one (or two) of the hollywood versions of the book. Just like most movie-adaptation/written-word works, the book far exceeds the film(s). Differences are as small as location details and as large as, \\"That's how it ended?!\\"One of the things a book can do that a movie can't is give you a depth to its characters. And character development is what really lets us know (and love/hate) the heroes/heroines and villains in a story.

The version I had was the free amazon. I read another review stating that this version is a repackaged version of the gutenberg version which would be the way to go since it is unabridged and free. You can save yourself the. 99 cents if that is the case.The book itself is by far one of the best I have ever had the pleasure to read. The story revolves around Edmond Dantes and his multiple personalities (the Count of Monte Cristo to say the least) and how he embarks on a personal vendetta against those who had him falsely accused and imprisoned for some 20-30 years of his life.Even the part when he is in imprisoned is crucial to the story as that is what really sets things in motion as he realizes the true reason behind why he is there.If you have never read any classics this is the one to start with. It is a lenghty book but one well worth the experience. If possible, get the book directly from project gutenberg as it is free. Amazon's free version is jo longer available."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"I'm having trouble putting it down.

Plotted against by jealous rivals, Dant&egrave;s is implicated as a Bonapartist traitor and thrown in prison. Revenge ensues!Dumas writes revenge like no one I've ever read. Though at times the main character seems needlessly ruthless and not particularly likeable, I just could not put this book down - well, except when it got too heavy to hold (Whew ... 1200 pages is heavy!). This is a book that will remain on my bookshelf forever (though probably not one I'd read as a bed time story to a kid).Pick it up (if you're strong enough) and give it a go - I don't think you'll be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"It is not quite true that the publishers hide the fact that this is an abridged edition - it is printed under the title but is difficult to notice.

Well, in my view it is a poor taste to shorten a classic book. The book is excellent but get the full version."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"I highly recommend reading the unabridged version of The Count of Monte Cristo.

In the first chapter the reader is immediately enthralled by the evocative prose and lush descriptions.

Sadly, in the case of other Amazon reviewers, this appears to be completely untrue."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"My first exposure to the book was in an abridged format but soon i got hold of an unadbridged version. so much was the attraction for the book. alexandre is a master story teller and subtly interwoven the emotions of love, revenge, hatred, jealousy, greed, ethics and so on.the story begins with the conviction of Edmond Dantes, an innocent sailor to life imprisonment in solitude where he meets an incredible man in Abbe Faria who gives him wealth of knowledge and unbelievable treasure. Dantes returns to his native soil as Count of Monte Cristo and exacts revenge on those who were responsible for his misery.Alexandre has displayed his skill in mapping out the rather elaborate manner in which Edmond reduces his opponents to near despair but at the same time ensuring that no innocent bystanders get hurt. the episode in which he bribes a telegraph clerk to deliver a wrong message which ultimately bleeds one of his opponents by millions of francs is very reflective of his understanding of human nature.overall, a book that is a must for anybody who is keen on understanding human emotions at play."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"Alexandre Dumas, one of the greatest romance novelists of all time does it again in this post - Napoleonic swashbuckling tale of adventure, love, betrayal and revenge.

I watched the movie that came out in 2000 or 2001 and really enjoyed it but after reading this book, I think I would really HATE the movie. If you're looking for an incredibly intricate plot line then read the book and skip the movie. The movie takes pieces of the plot and twists it in such a way that leaves the viewer with little to know surprise or suspense. Alexandre Dumas writes in such a way as to put the reader right in the very scene that is being played out. As I read this book I felt like I was sitting in the conversations taking place amongst the characters. I don't know how he does it (I'm not a writer!) but he does it quite well.Believe it or not, I've not been much of a reader until recently (I'm 30, if that tells you anything). When I found this book and saw how long it was I thought I was jumping in over my head, however, I quickly found that this was a book that I could NOT put down and one that I did NOT want to end! One of the highlights in the book (at least for me) is how you'll be cruising along with the story and tracking pretty well with it when all of a sudden you take a hard left turn and can't figure out who is who and what is what. Just when you think Dumas has lost his mind and can't write to save his life, he pulls out this magic thread that pulls these mystery pieces together and out of nowhere you have a new and amazing concept introduced in a way you didn't expect. Understanding that these threads are intertwined into the story helps the reader get through chapters that may not make sense at the time but have a huge payoff in the end.One last thing, I have only read this version which is unabridged (nothing has been cut out). I've not read the abridged version (pieces of the story have been cut out to shorten it) but I can't imagine that it holds a candle to the unabridged, of course you'll have to determine that for yourself. I'm an all or nothing individual and so of course I wanted every aspect of the story included, I'm so glad I did! Buy this unabridged version, you will NOT be disappointed and please don't let the size of this book intimidate you. You'll be amazed (especially if you're not a fast reader like myself) at how quickly this book can read.Buy the book, you will love it!"},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"Dumas is the king of drama and the swashbuckling hero with a broken heart.

They said that the count changed, but with no satisfactory explanation of his change of character; and that the change of character (into a vengeful / resentful person) was not plausible. I don't agree. I have actually seen people in my own life who changed in exactly the same way. Also, there was certainly a satisfactory explanation!I think my favorite character is Albert.

It is the book that is mentioned in the movie \\"The Shawshank Redemption\\" and the author is called in that one \\"Alexander Dumb-ass\\" Which is a joke in that particular movie. I have read this book and seen that movie and seen the movie that is based on this book. I like the book but not the movie. Not the movie where they call him a dumb-ass, the other one that is based on this book, that is not very good compared to the book. If you like words more than pictures, I would say to you to buy this book and to read it. If you like the pictures more then I don't know what to tell you. I would also refer you to one of the other great works of this great writer, called \\"The Three Musketeers\\" I know you have heard of it. These books were written in and around the Napoleonic era.

Don't wimp out. get the unabridged edition and enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"Truly a marvelous classic, the Count of Monte Cristo is a challenging tale of vengeance and love. Having been thrust suddenly from a life he loved to a world he cannot call life, Mr. Edmond Dantes spends fourteen incredibly long years in a prison not fit for rats or cockroaches. While there, his mind fills with nothing but thoughts of vengeance, and even the most brutal of situations takes Edmond Dante deep into the recesses of his mind, where he recalls with hatred and and anger the bitter trap he fell into unjustly, the people behind it, and how he will avenge. No book I have ever read has expressed the soul of man with a spark of life against all odds as this one has. Edmond believes he will one day return to overtake all of his enemies, and it is that belief which gives the strength of the book real power. All Edmond has to do is wait. And hope.Don't miss this one."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"I have just returned to the land of the living, having hidden from the world to read all 1276 pages of &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot; in just under five days.

This book is his own creation, not one which his factory of writers wrote and he flourished and embellished. He found a story about a cobbler who after being imprisoned by presumed friends brutally murdered them all. Dumas entrigued by this occurence proceeded to write a glorified version of it. The book provides the tense atmosphere of France during the Napoleonic Era, the political dealings and believable characters. From the most vile villain to the Count everyone seems human and flawed. Dumas has created a world in which one can easily delve into and be absorbed. This work is truly worth reading!!P.S. Do not be daunted by the length- after the first 50 pages or so the story truly moves!"},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"The Count of Monte Cristo has to be one of my favorite novels. It's full of intricate plot twists, fascinating characters, romance, revenge, hope, despair, deception, betrayal, redemption and all the other emotions and experiences that make up life. All of the characters are multi-layered, no one, not even Edmund Dantes (aka the Count) acting out of easily-defined motives, and are intertwined in such beautifully complex ways with terrific backstories. Edmund takes revenge on these horrible people who ruined his life and took his fiance and future away from him, but one still feels a little sorry for them, because they're real characters. All in all, a fantastic book that really delves into the psyche of revenge. It's quite long, but it's worth it because it is so intricate and detailed and so beautiful."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"\\"The Count of Monte Cristo\\" is an intriguing tale of retribution. The complex and rivetting plot revolves around Edmond Dantes, a idealistic and principled young man who is unwittingly framed for a serious crime, and sentenced to spend the rest of his life in prison. There he meets a man who will change his life...and point him towards freedom and his means of vengeance on those who have wronged him. Without a doubt, this novel is a masterpiece, attaining the balance of true symphony between justice and revenge. The characterization and atmosphere portrayed is rich enough to evoke anyone's imagination. Dumas' attention to detail adds to the ambiance and vivacity of the tale. As a fitting testament to it's nearly be rushed, rather savored. The unabridged version (875 pages) is a must, with its banquet of flavorful scenes - it is a full course meal for any hungry bookworm - the abridged version is merely a buttered cracker. \\"The Count of Monte Cristo\\" is one of my most treasured novel and, without hesitation, by far the best book I have ever read!

This book is too good to cut out more than 70% of the book like some of the abridged versions have done.I mean who would go to see Matrix Reloaded and be satisfied with only 30% of the movie from random scenes?! Of course not!As far as the story itself, don't try to look at the story and if its perfect or what is believable or not.

No one is credited anywhere, though there's some worthy who contributed an introduction."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"I agree with everyone else when I say that the story of 'The Count' is gripping, exciting, etc. The translations, on the other hand, especially this one, leave much to be desired. The English is stilted and uninspiring, and many times it seems like the text was translated word-for-word without necessary changes in sentence structure.Alexandre Dumas is much better in the original French."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"What a book to cherish, this is one count who simply will not give up on what he believes is right, and what he believes is true justice, this man will do anything, and he is simply the kind of person that is so influential as his hidden self is shown, though the abbe helped him out, it was still mostly to himself. He is way too two-dimensional.Okay, that was a little fast for you, perhaps, but that is basically everything this book is amazing in, and lacking in. But you can't miss either if you want such an age--defying novel. Now, to start, I can't think of any other French novels worthy of being compared to it. Jean--Christophe, comparable if not better, The Wandering Jew, a breath--taking novel that might be the only other French novel that can say is better than this one without hesitation. Les Miserable, comparable, and the musketeers, surely rival the count. However, this novel is very singular, and though there are several novels in its class( betrayal then revenge ), this novel, in some incredulous way, pushes the rest away( sorry Kidnapped, but you'll have to understand ), and gives itself more room, more space. It deserves a genre of its own.The lenghth and added strenghth of this heavy book, both physically and spiritually, gives it more room for flourishes, for explanation, but most of all for perfection. Let's compare this book to a cake, like I normally do, and we'll see that the cake, as I shall refer the book, needs the ingredients. Add a little something not that good, the bad guys fits that perfectly. Now add something unreal, but truly something of your dreams, Edmund Dantes fits that description without hesitation. Now add the creamy stuff, for example, the romance, the ignorance, the jealousy, and the stubborness. Of course, the last ingredient, the most important thing you need on a cake, or else it's an amateur's work, is the CHERRY( if you eat yours with a cherry )! That, is the Count of Monte Cristo's ace in the hole, it's plot. This book takes a humble old--fashioned genre in fiction to a whole new level, it's got more details, its got more flavor, it's more of a good cherry. So now you see how expertly Alexandre Dumas picks his ingredients.Having the ingredients is one thing, but how to make it, I don't know how to bake a cake, so I'm just guessing, you would want to notice how the chronicle of Edmund Dante is actually an interesting one if you read it as a map, instead of reading it like: enemy beats you, face consequences, got a helper/mentor, survive, and get revenge, you read it as something like this, like on a map: face a dangerous cliff, fall, get a life--saver, with an effort climb up from the bottomless pit, seek, goal, go back to dangerous cliff, master it. If you observe it that way, you will see an even moreold--fashioned style, brought to another genre, and becomes something completely new. Thus, I conclude by saying that Dumas did something, whether he knew it or not, or did that through another pass with his genius, like that, which is kind of making a cake based on a hypothesis, using a new way with a little bit less risk, and being successful! Dumas did just that, except in literature, it's not so risky( I wouldn't do that for a cake though, one: it's too risky, and two: it might ruin the cherry! ). So Dumas successfully manuverered through the \\"baking\\" process.Alas, the cake is made! Now for the critics to make their comments/harsh and absolutely unfair remarks, or criticisms. The book might be better if Alexandre Dumas had just made the character more three dimensional and still be able to master all the harshness in his way. Then, the book will be even more the genius it is, and if Alexandre Dumas doesn't have the genius to do that, then leave it to Romain Rolland, or some other better unknown chef in the near future! And second of all, this should've been done more old--fashioned like, make the lady stay true to Dantes all the story long. If the reader look at it that way, that might be able to leave more space for stories for times gone by than before! Man, not old--fashioned when not supposed to--and old--fashioned, never!Oh, whoever said the above, and especially the last sentence, tell me, I'll go give him a piece of my mind.The text is wonderful, barely or never any spelling errors, the paper is thick for classics of its size, and it's still able to fit the entire book in one volume. Able to rival the Modern Library Giants or the company that published Harry Potter. Really!So, this review ends. I hope it's not too long for the reader, and I hope you like THIS small cake. Alexandre Dumas was a great writer of many novels, and The Count of Monte Cristo is not his only masterpiece. No doubt people at that time is calling The Count of Monte Cristo a \\"coming of age--story\\", like their calling Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix right now! He had a lot of literary friends, and many of my French favorites. So enjoy! And if you've already done that, enjoy again! Read more about his life. Trust me, it'll be worthy of your time. All in all, Alexander was a coming of age author, and he is one of the greatest novelist, etc. right now. His novels are timeless, pure arkenstones, never to be forgotten, leading leaders in literature right now, and have the words: big classics written, engraved/burned all over it.

It might be kind of hard to follow at first, but here is a little hint. The Count Of Monte Cristo = Edmond Dantes. That will make the book a little easier to follow. Now, BUT IT!!"},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"A very well-paced novel of classic romantic literature, the Count of Monte Cristo is yet another masterpiece from Alexandre Dumas. I have only read the abridged, but it was enough to judge by. While beautifully written and expressed with vivid detail, it was too dramatic to be given 5 stars. Dumas makes the mistake of making Dantes a god, and giving him infinite intellect. He is not a real-life character in the least! Therefore, it is hard to believe all the 'once in a blue moon' events that occur around and through Dantes.However, Dantes' revenge is so fantastic, that it is hard to discredit the book. Reverting from the classic 'kill-all' revenge, Dantes stealthily discredits all his oppressors, involving the reader with the plot. But Dantes himself knows perhaps too much, can do things that are not humanly possible... and so, I rate this book 4 stars."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"Forget any other translation of this novel, this is the now the definitive English version of this great classic of French literature. Robin Buss skillfully translates 19th century French into 21st century English without compromising Dumas' prose. Ample footnotes have been provided to help the modern reader with the details of French history between the Revolution and the rise and fall of Napoleon that are an important part of this novel. Yes, this is long but it will be time well spent! I purchased this as a Kindle download and found it quite easy to access the footnotes and return to the story. Unfortunately, there are a couple of places in the novel where Dumas includes some Greek text that renders poorly on the Kindle."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"This was an unbelievable book. I had read shorter versions in school and seen diferent versions in the movies over the years but now that I have read this unabridged version I feel truly slighted. The size of this book put me off at first but once I got into the book I couldn't put it down.Dumas manages to capture probably the best account of human emotions that I have come across in a written form in a long time. Love, jealousy, hate, despair, revenge, remorse, pity, grief, and the list goes on and on. Through our beloved Count, Edmond, we see all of these thing that make us human. We find by each turn of the page that it isn't these emotions that are bad or good but how we put them to use in our lives.I was truly stunned by this book and all that is contained within...and as the Count said in his last words I am left to \\"wait and hope\\".This book is a must read for everyone."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"I love the classics, but for a long time I held off on reading this due to its length and the ordeal of carrying around such a heavy book. Well, the Kindle version has made the second reason a non-issue and pretty much taken care of the first as well. For anyone who does love the classics or simply a rippingly-good read, this spectacular tale of love, politics, 19th-century hypocrisy (by the boatload) and plain old revenge is a must. Dumas, the son of a black slave~~whose last name he took~~and a father he barely knew had few compunctions about showing the sanctimonious sham that was much of post-Napoleonic France at all social levels. And seeing as how many of the same injustices and favoritism of the well-connected are still very much with us today, this makes The Count a very modern novel. As others have already pointed out, this translation by Robin Buss puts everything back that was apparently left out in previous translations, and does so in a way that is true to the language of the time, but still sounds more or less natural to us today. There is something for everyone in this wonderful book: for those who love fantasy, there is the island of Monte Cristo itself, where time seems to stand still; for those more into politics, there is post-Napoleonic France, with all of its intrigues and power-plays at all levels of society; and for those who just love a great story well-told, it is on every page. Not to mention that there is also a fairly hefty erotic charge through much of the book. So if you love adventure, romance, intrigue, great characters and enough plot twists to keep the tension ratcheted up almost nonstop, consider spending a few weeks or however long it takes~~with The Count. I guarantee you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"I just recently finished reading this 600+ page novel and was very disappointed in it. With the Count of Monte Cristo being considered such a classic - I was left asking \\"why\\" after reading this version? Apparently, it is not the entire book and that would explain some of my confusion with the relevance of many characters who are introduced and then left out.I'm very disappointed that this book is not listed by the publisher as \\"abridged\\" (nowhere on this book does it say abridged). After spending all the time to read 600 pages, I feel obligated to go back and read the recommended version, so I can find out what makes this a \\"Classic\\" and so many people's favorite book.I find it very beneficial that Amazon provides the reviews - this is an excellent resource that I use before I purchase almost anything. My wife purchased this book at a local bookstore and now I am purchasing the full version from Amazon after reading the reviews to see what I am missing. The version I read can't be so many people's favorite book, so they must have left out some important information. Thanks for the reviews, Amazon."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"I read The Count of Monte Cristo a few months ago, and it took me two months to get through it. It was the best reading experience I've had since reading The Lord of the Rings almost twenty years ago.Initially I wanted to read an ebook version of the novel -- I wanted to be able to carry it around easily in an ebook reader. So I loaded one of the free versions in the public domain onto my ebook reader and started in ... but it was no fun. The translation was very old, and latinate sentence structure and archaic words made it difficult to understand. After doing a little research I found that the only fully modern translation is the one by Robin Buss in Penguin Classics. And I actually had a copy sitting around my house, but I was reluctant to carry around a fat paperback as big as a Bible for the time it would take to finish the book. Yet I wanted to read this novel, so I gave up and started in on the paperback edition. (I see now that amazon carries a kindle version from Penguin that appears to be the Robin Buss translation. But I don't have a kindle.)As other reviewers have noted: don't bother with any other version than the one translated by Robin Buss. Seriously -- don't waste your time (unless you know French and are going to read it in the original language). The suffering quotient is just too high. And that would be true even if you read an abridged version. Yes, this is a very long novel, but any abridgment is going to have to leave out some of the most truly wonderful things in the book, because again and again, the things that make The Count of Monte Cristo such a pleasure to read are things that don't really advance the plot. So just resign yourself to slogging through the whole thing. It's worth it, believe me. Not only is the style of writing infinitely easier to understand, but the book is, as they say, \\"unexpurgated.\\" Earlier translations apparently leave out some of the weirdest and most fascinating parts of the book. In one section there's a lengthy description of a drugged, erotic reverie. In another section one character is portrayed implicitly and (by modern standards) humorously as a lesbian. And in yet one more section, we get a truly fascinating and horrifyingly detailed description of a brutal execution. Someone looking for things to cut from the book could easily cut any of these. But I know you'll want to read them.My impressions of the Dumas' novel overall are that it creates a whole world that's both remarkably similar to our own, yet remarkably different, and very strange. In fact the book creates several worlds, including the world of the young Edmond Dantes, before his incarceration; the world of the prison, the Chateau D'If; the world of Monte Cristo, Dantes island paradise, the world of carnival season Rome; the world of high society Paris; and several others along the way, drawn quickly and then not seen again (e.g., the world of the telegraph operator). Linking all these worlds is Edmond Dantes, aka the Count of Monte Cristo (and many other aliases), in his journey from innocence, through suffering, to vengeance and final repentance.From what I knew of the book before reading it, I assumed the greater part of the novel would be taken up with the adventures surrounding Dantes' arrest, imprisonment, and escape, with vengeance plot being somewhat secondary. But this is completely wrong: the section leading up to Dantes' escape and his finding of the treasure is all prelude: by a great degree, the book's main plot deals with Dantes secretly returning to the world and insinuating himself into the lives of those who victimized him. He does this over a period of years, and his essentially infinite wealth turns him into a kind of God, pulling the strings for almost everything significant that happens in their lives. Admittedly much of this very long part of the book is slow ... too slow. The plot becomes quite convoluted, and sometimes you wish the writer would just get on with it. But then, suddenly, when you're almost ready to give up, a big action scene will take place, and the suspense will be ratcheted up for another two hundred pages.One trick I used to make myself keep reading through the slow parts was to remember how the book was originally published: as a serial. Dumas had to produce a certain number of words for each installment, so even if he wasn't ready to make use of a planned plot development, he still had to write X number of words. This means some installments have little plot development. But at other times, the plot seems to move very quickly, and some action scenes seem oddly compressed -- again, probably because Dumas was limited in how many words he could write for each section.A significant flaw of the book is that the major characters who plotted Dantes' downfall in the early part of the book, and who disappear for several decades while Dantes is imprisoned and then while he is planning his return -- these characters seem hard to connect to the villains who appeared in the early pages. For the most part their characters seem unrelated to the people Dantes later tracks down. Since they also change their titles, this makes it hard to keep track of who's who. And the extremely complex plot makes it even harder. So, another suggestion: as you read, keep a little chart of the major characters (including ALL the villains, as they appear, and their families). As the book progresses and more details are revealed, you can add to your chart. Of course you can find this information in many sources -- wikipedia, CliffsNotes, etc. -- but these all contain spoilers. It's best to discover these things for yourself.In the end, The Count of Monte Cristo is not very deep, in the way Tolstoy or Flaubert are deep. To put it simply, what it is, is the most fun you can have in reading for the sheer pleasure of reading. Some scenes stay strongly in my mind even now -- for example the Carnival scenes in Rome, and the gruesome executions that follow it.I only wish I had this book to read one more time, for the first time."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"I did not get the opportunity to read this book in High School, which is probably for the best.

I have no intention of broadening my literary, historical or philosophical knowledge to impress other people so here is a review from a guy who just happen to read it because this book was on sale for $1 at the local library clearance.I read a lot. Most of books I read are popular paperbacks I see on best seller list. One day I was at the library and saw this thick book for a $1 and I thought I would give it a try.

The only thing that i didnt like was one character Eugenie Danglars, she is minor character but in the few chapters that she is in, the book seemed to slow down in pace and i found myself skimming those chapter. If it wasnt for her a think the book would be much better but w/e she isnt a major character so its not that big of a deal. I highly suggest that you jot down notes on the characters as you read the story since there are about 40 characters more or less also if you dont have any knowledge of The Arabian Nights you may want to consider at least reading a summary or movie on it because Dumas frequently makes camparisons to it towards the middle of the book.So as i said before this book is truly wonderful! dont be scared by its large size!"},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"I first read \\"The Count of Monte Cristo\\" in fifth grade.

I also found that this was going to be a long, wonderful relationship between myself and Dumas.\\"The Count of Monte Cristo\\" is a wonderful book for several reasons. One is that it is exciting. There is constantly something going, and the story never fully stops (though it certainly slows at certain points in comparison to others). Another reason is that the characters are beautifully made. You have a wonderful main character; a young man who seems to have everything, but then everything crashes on him, and he is instead left a slightly sinister, frightening man. Another wonderful thing is that every character has their virtues, and their flaws, including our main character, whose need for revenge leads him to do not-so-noble things.There are few books that top \\"The Count of Monte Cristo\\". Read and enjoy. There's no way you can't help but fall in love."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"I am a student, and I was recently asked to read this book for an assignment. When I first began reading the book I was stumped by the first couple of pages. I had to go back and do a bit of re-analyzing, because sometimes they call the characters by their first name, at times by their last, and some gain a specific title throughout the book. That really threw me for a loop, and if you don't pay attention to that you'll be confused the whole way through. The first couple of chapters moved a little sluggishly for me, but after I got to a point of interest this was a quick read for me. The thing that makes this book so interesting is the underlying theme. The whole point is someone will double cross anyone if they think they'll benefit from it in the long run. It also shows just how much revenge can cloud a person's mind. This was one of the first books I've been given to read for an assignment that I actually found meaningful. Much better than the \\"Oeidipus,\\" or \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" by far. Although this book is a classic, there is a very modern feel to it because much of the things menchined in this book happen today in different ways. Overall it was a wonderful book. I don't regret reading it at all."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"Review for THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTODumas' 1844 novel about passion, betrayal and justifiable vengeance provides exhilarating reading even in the 21st century. Opening in February of 1815, when France was polarized into either Bonapartist or Royalist camps; society risked reprisals as the pendulum of power shifted capriciously; personal fortunes and careers rose and plunged until the Emperor's final imprisonment.Nineteen-year-old Edmond Dantes, capable first mate for the Morrell Firm, is poised to enjoy life to the fullest: promoted to captaincy despite his youth and engaged to his beloved Mercedes. Betrayed by three \\"friends\\" with private grudges or weak natures Dantes falls an easy victim to the conspirators. Accused though innocnet, Dantes is not even tried, but thrown into a miserable prison on a rocky isle in Marseilles harbor--the dreaded Chateau d'Yf. Victim of the relentless wheels of political fate the young man languishes there for some 14 years.During his imprisonment Dantes undergoes a metamorphosis from desiring death to living for revenge against his unknown foes. With the help of Father Faria-a priest considered mad by prison authorities because he insists on possessing a vast fortune-he realizes the names of his unseen tormentors, how and why he was betrayed. Since time was in abundance Faria undertook to educate the embittered youth; eventually this passionate mentor considered Dantes his son and together they planned their escape. Ultimately Dantes reached the rocky islet of Monte Cristo, recovered the treasure and was able to live a luxurious life as the Count of Monte Cristo.The bulk of the novel chronicles Dantes' personal odyssey as the self-appointed hand of providence; he devised complicated schemes to enact ruin upon the men who destroyed his career and happiness and who allowed his elderly father to starve to death.Dantes' privately likens his power and justice with God's. Asself-appointed avenger he carefully schemes and patiently waitsto savor his moments of triumph.Dumas' style includes swashbuckling action, extensive dialogue and frequent flashbacks on the parts of various characters. His clever schemes and surprise counterfoils keep readers alert with literary suspense. A connoisseur of the darker side of human nature, Dantes often relies on the baser instincts of his targetswhich facilitate their ultimate downfall. Yet even he cannot always predict the feminine factor. Himself mentored in prison, Dantes treats two young men as his sons, and acts as guardian to two young couples. Despite this, does one mortal man-emotionally scarred---have the right to claim divine privilege?"},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"This one of my all time favorites. Great drama, mystery, and suspense. Also a fascinating portrait of an era. The age of this book (amazingly) does not dampen the excitement and intrigue. Get the unabridged version, its worth it."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"The Count of Monte Cristo, written by Alexandre Dumas revolves around the life of a young man living in France in the early 1800's. The novel begins with the handsome young sailor Edmond Dantes. He has just returned from a journey aboard the Pharaon, which is owned by a man named Monsieur Morrel. The ship's captain died on the voyage home, and Dantes assumed the post with admirable skill, so M. Morrel made him the new captain.Not only that, but Dantes is also abut to marry his beautiful fiance. Unfortunately, all of Dantes's good fortune causes some men to become jealous and they begin to plot his downfall...The rest of the story is about the 13 years Dantes spends in prison and then how he exacts his revenge on those who betrayed him. The story is much more than that however, it is also about a love and a man who must rediscover his soul after all goodness has been ripped away from him. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to read, even if only the slightest bit. From pirates to prisoners, love to war, this book has something for everyone."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"The synopsis on the back of this book doesn't at all do it justice, it's the equivalent of describing the aurora borealis as a buch of lights in the sky.

Just read it."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"I am a student who rarely reads \\"classics\\" in her spare time outside of school, but this one was totally worth my time! I took this book to the beach with me (i know, an unusual choice to bring to the beach) and i could not put it down - it is such a seamless story, clearly written and with so many twists and turns in the plot to keep you fully engaged in the novel. lucky you if this novel is on your summer required reading list for school but even if you are just looking for an intense and unforgettable beach read, this novel is for you."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"I can't decide whether I like this book or not. I suppose I should start with the bad, and finish off with the good.The first thing that bothered me about this book was the improbability of the events. How an ignorant, nave sailor could have become a powerful, knowledgable man with deep human understanding is beyond me. Admitedly, he did learn for many years from the Abb&eacute; Faria and later studied in the east, but I do not think that it could have turned him into the sudden enigma of the Count. The careers of most of the other characters, perhaps excepting Villefort, were improbable, too. For example, Fernand was a poor fisherman, and while he may have earned his fortune in the war, he could not have recieved enough knowledge and standing there to become a Peer of France.I also found this book bothersome because of the romanticized and unrealistic descriptions Dumas wrote. I know you will have accused me of extreme realism and cynicism by now, but in my defense, I do like many Romantic novels. This particular Romantic novel was pushing it, however. For example, in the oficial document that tells how Franz's father was killed, he dedicates a paragraph to describing how dark and stormy the night was and how there was snow on the banks next to the river, although technically it was a legal testament. The everyday converstation between the characters is similarly stilted. The love affair between Maxemilien and Valentine was so teary, fake, and idealized, that I wanted to slap them by the end of the book.And yet, despite all this, I cannot help but admire the book as a work of literature. The psychological twists and turns of this book are amazing. I love the way Edmond is convinced that he is an agent of Providence by doing justice, and how this \\"justice\\" goes out of control. I love the fact that the protagonist is in many ways an antagonist, and that this seemingly supper-human man can make mistakes. I always hated how the movies glamorized Edmond and his revenge. The book, instead, makes the revenge all the more profound because you feel a lot of sympathy for his victims.This book also has a great deal of mystery, and it is fun to guess what is going on behind the scenes. As one person once told me, it is very much like a chess game, in which Edmond is laying out all the pieces but you can never be sure what move he is going to make next."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"Sorry to disappoint the previous reviewer, but when Dumas wrote this book, the ideas and plot were not new, not fresh, and certainly not original. Robert Wilson clearly outlines the history in his introduction to the book. &quot;In 1838 a police archivist named Jacques Peuchet published six volumes of crime stories taken from the files of the Paris police. In one file was the story of a young shoemaker from Nimes who in 1807 became engaged to marry a rich and beautiful orphan, but because of a despicable practical joke played by four jealous friends was falsely arrested as a spy for the English against Napoleon and imprisoned until the empire fell in 1814. While in prison he had met a dying Italian priest who told him where a great treasure was buried. Upon his release he found the treasure and, using various disguises, cold-bloodedly wreaked his vengeance on those responsible for his misfortune, one of whom had married his fiancee. When Dumas read the story, he knew he wanted to retell it. That real-life melodrama is, pretty nearly, The Count of Monte Cristo in outline.&quot; There is also an island named Montecristo that Dumas found enchanting, so very little of this novel is &quot;original&quot; or &quot;creative&quot; material. On the other hand, this should not deter anyone from reading the book because the story itself is fascinating, easily holding the reader's attention. A movie of this tale was made several years ago, starring Richard Chamberlain, and complements the book nicely. I enjoyed both the book and the movie and happily recommend both."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"I am in awe of The Count of Monte Cristo!!! From the first page to the last, it is definitely a page turner. I loved it!"},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"A good translation from the nineties, but a definite product of the intellectually stilted academic elite, i.e. the translator takes pains to correct the \\"benighted\\" errors of the author by inserting common vulgar usage such as (and here I am quoting from memory) \\"We were surprised by him answering us,\\" \\"...he or she\\" rather than \\"his\\" as the gender comprehensive, \\"...as if it was\\" (rather than \\"as if it were...\\"). I guess we all can be thankful for the translator's avoidance of the awful \\"their\\" as the gender comprehensive.I found the annotations in the back surprisingly difficult to work with, considering the fine annotations extant in the other Penguin editions of Dumas. The weakness here is that the annotations are by chapter heading rather than page number, hence making their lookup much more difficult.A good read overall, however."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"Alexandre Dumas does an amazing job in book with in depth descriptions of characters and settings.

Dumas was a master storyteller and knew how to create a cast of tremendous characters. He put together everything you need in one marvelous story. The setting is perfect, and though a little too detailed for today's writing, it was necessary at the time when people didn't travel and see the world.Conflict permeates the book, and Dumas dishes out the suspense like a master, tossing a dash in just when needed.Every character has depth, lots of depth, and the plot is not only intricate, but devious. The mother of all revenge books. And who doesn't love a good taste of vengeance?Edmond Dantes ranks high on my list of greatest characters in literature, and Alexandre Dumas as one of the best writers."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"Undoubtedly one of the classics, The Count of Monte Cristo, in this edition, spans some 600 pages and takes us on a tale involving, love, revenge, high-society, intrigue, evil, greed and a few other facets that make for a grand tale.Written in the 1850's, the language in the book is of the verbose form wherein, 10 words would be used where, today, 3 would do. At first the reader may have to read, then re-read many of the sentences in an effort to garner the true meaning as, for most of us, this wordy text can be a little confusing and somewhat overwhelming. Not to far into the book, it becomes easier to handle and, in all honesty, it's a delight to read. Personally, I would enjoy being able to use words the way Dumas portrayed in his characters.Edmond Dantes is the main character who is falsely imprisoned due to a mixture of jealousy and self-preservation by others. He spends some 14 years in a dungeon where he is befriended by another inmate who schools Dantes and informs him of a fortune in buried treasure. Dantes escapes and sets out to garner revenge. In a nutshell, that's the very basis of the story.It's fantastic stuff and a welcome change from most modern text."},{"Title":"The Count of Monte Cristo: Golden Picture Classic","review":"For the price, this is a great copy of the book, however, I think 'leather bound' is a little mis-leading.

It is the best translation of the best novel ever written. I've read four different versions so I feel qualified to make this claim. Remember, Dumas' plot was virtually ripped-off by General Lew Wallace as he formulated the plot for another great novel - Ben Hur.DO NOT BUY an unabridged version, it will ruin this veritable work of art for you. It would be like viewing the Sistine Chapel back wall and never seeing the ceiling.Now, there is a self-serving purpose to my review besides giving Buss props. When I visited Venice for the first time in 1999 I fell in love with the place. When I returned home, I looked, in vain, for a Monte Cristo-esque story set in Venice. It didn't exist. Sooooo . . .

Before him, the Western world - and, disturbingly, a large portion of Russia - had only a faint idea of the true depth of lies, deceit, exploitation and murder that were being committed under the rule of the Communist government. The Oak and the Calf is his memoir of the difficulties faced in being published in Russia, at a time when even typewriters were controlled by the government and publishing without attack by the censors was unheard of. It is a clear, lucid portrayal of Solzhenitsyn's decades long battle to write.The book is split into four sections, of which the first two and the last two form separate wholes. The first half of the novel recounts his difficulties in first becoming published, then details the difficulties in making Russia and the world aware of Russia's mistakes; the second half focuses on Solzhenitsyn's battles with the KGB to ensure that he was able to publish his more incriminating works within Russia, while avoiding imprisonment, exile or death.Solzhenitsyn spent the first twenty years of his adult life first at the Russian front in World War II, and then in a labour camp, where he was sentenced after criticising Stalin in personal correspondence. After that, he contracted cancer; he spent time recovering in a hospital at Tashkent. During this time, he would compose prose in his mind - there were no opportunities to write down and store text. He relates that he would spend a week of each month while in the labor camp, going over what he had written in his mind until he remembered it perfectly. He composed his thoughts, wrote prose, plotted novels. From a young age, he wanted to be a writer. Thanks to his imprisonment, Solzhenitsyn gained the source material with which to write.When Solzhenitsyn was in his forties, he was finally able to publish his work. At home now, living with his second wife (his first abandoned him when he went to the labour camps), Solzhenitsyn could write, but the realities of publishing in Russia were slim.He had two options. The first, samizdat, an underground network of writers and readers. The second was to be published in one of Russia's literary magazines, but the requirements of publication included the necessity of government censure and approval. Solzhenitsyn, in his own words, 'lightened' a novel of his, Shch-854. Thanks to the confidence of magazine Novy Mir's editor, Alexander Tvardovsky, the novel was published under the name, One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich. In this book, Solzhenitsyn said what had never been said before - he accurately and honestly described life in the labor camps. What was once taboo was out in the open. It was a sensation, and his name was made.Instantly, Solzhenitsyn was one of the most dangerous men in Russia. What was the government to do? If they imprisoned him again, or killed him, the outcry would be horrific. But if they allowed him to publish further, then... They were in a terrible place, but so was Solzhenitsyn. His publisher, Novy Mir, faced increasing pressure to silence their new author, and on top of that Tvardovsky began to get wet feet. Still, Solzhenitsyn wrote and tried to publish.Imagine what we have here. An outstanding novelist is forced to shrink away and hide in the dark. His first published work has caused a sensation in his home country (and, later, abroad), and for that he faces prison, exile or death. And yet, for all that, he continues to write. He scatters his literature throughout the samizdat network, entrusting his terrible, accusative words to friends and strangers. He smuggles his work across the border, to a safe in the West, which is to be opened upon his death. From the very moment One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich is released, Solzhenitsyn must live as a man who can be seized at any time. In one chilling paragraph, Solzhenitsyn outlines what he was prepared to do if they took his children: 'They did not know that we had thought of this and made a superhuman decision: our children were no dearer to us than the memory of the millions done to death, and nothing could make us stop that book.' Can we in the West imagine such consequences for writing? Can we possibly understand what Solzhenitsyn dealt with every day?While attempting to publish further works, how often Solzhenitsyn hears these words: 'Circumstances could not be less favorable to publication than they are at present. It would probably be impossible, and it would certainly be dangerous, to try bringing it out this year.' Years go by, with little of his work appearing in Russian. His relationship with Tvardovsky forms the bulk of the first half, it is a sad, unequal affair. Tvardovsky is a man of talent, but not talent on the level of Solzhenitsyn. He is more timid, less skilled, and nowhere near as bold. And yet, thanks to Solzhenitsyn's loyalty, they remain together for ten years, up to and including the time when Solzhenitsyn win the Nobel.The second half of the novel focuses on the struggle Solzhenitsyn undertook for the publication of The Gulag Archipelago, which the author considers his most powerful and damning book. We learn of the machinations involved in dealings with the KGB, as well as the convoluted, intricate schemes Solzhenitsyn and his allies used to transmit, hide and recover pieces of his work.We are more removed from this half of the novel, perhaps because we cannot rely on the emotional connection that the friendship between Tvardovsky and Solzhenitsyn provided in the first half. This does not weaken the text, it remains a compelling account of struggle in the face of insurmountable odds.One thing that Solzhenitsyn never explicitly states - but which runs through the entire piece - is that he has a strong feeling of patriotism towards Russia. Not the USSR Russia, but the grand fatherland, the vanished grandeur of his home. Many times, he could have fled to the West to publish at his leisure. Many times, he could have published his vast unpublished works in America and elsewhere. But he stayed with Russia for as long as possible, attempting always to publish first in his home country before anywhere else. He was the cancer from the inside. He needed to show Russia that she was sick; foreigners came second.A compelling aspect of Solzhenitsyn's work is that he does not indulge in grandiloquent passages of destiny. Nor does he invoke some triumphant mandate of heaven that requires him to write. No, Solzhenitsyn simply states, many times, that what he needs to do with his life is write what he has seen, what he knows, what he thinks. Does a doctor brag of his ability to diagnose illness? No, and nor does Solzhenitsyn when he identifies Russia's vast sickness. Perhaps his talents were the only ones capable of correctly examining the illness, perhaps his skill was the only one capable of showing Russia - and the world - how to heal, but Solzhenitsyn does not seek to glorify himself. He writes, for he is but a humble author. Would that we all possessed such a pen."},{"Title":"The oak and the calf (Trinity Forum reading)","review":"Don't get me wrong, Gulag Archipelago is one of my favorite all-time works. It's place in world history is secure. But the Oak and the Calf is a personal history of Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn (arguably the greatest living writer in the world).At a time when the punishment for owning a copy of Gulag was DEATH, Solzhenitsyn was not afraid to stand up to the Soviet system ALONE AND UNARMED (He has a lot in common with Mahatma Ghandi).When you are armed with truth and you stand firm, it is Evil itself that must eventually back down.How did Solzhenitsyn gain so much courage? How did he handle the Soviet system without becoming a corpse? How was he able to write his first several books while still a prisoner in the prison camps? What kept him going when things looked the most bleak?We can learn much about commitment, will-power, and dedication to principles of truth by seeing how Solzhenitsyn did it. By reading this book, Solzhenitsyn can be your mentor and teach you through his example.--George Stancliffe"},{"Title":"The oak and the calf (Trinity Forum reading)","review":"I had been reading this book, off and on, for a few months when word came that Alexander Solzhenitsyn had died. What an improbable miracle, that he died outside Moscow at the age of 89, of old age! Surely he would have been glad to know that would be his fate, as a young captain heading west to engage the German invaders, as a new inmate in the belly of the Gulag (like Agent Jones -- or was it Smith? -- being swallowed by the insect at the end of Men in Black), as a cancer patient a few years later -- or during the period covered by this memoir, a knight in the shining armor of truth, facing Leviathan with nothing but the \\"sword of the spirit,\\" as St. Paul put it. (Or even later, in exile in Vermont.)It was a deliberate, considered engagement, as Solzhenitsyn shows, though he did not always follow what he saw as his own best instincts. The world knows him best today for two books: One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich (check Amazon sales), and The Gulag Archipelago. (My own favorite is First Circle, however.) This memoir is more or less framed by the publication of those two works -- the first of which made him famous, the second which forced the dragon to cough him out, and finally brought that dragon to its knees. (I prefer not to compare the Soviet Union to a bear -- I like bears.) Solzhenitsyn describes the contest blow-by-blow, guessing what various aparachniks are thinking (to the extent he gives them credit for so exalted an activity), \\"allies,\\" in particular the poet and publisher Tvardovsky, described with consummate humanity, and his own chess game, played as it was with most the opposing pieces hidden.I'm not sure that this book is meant for \\"foreigners\\" like myself. The writer is dialoguing, if not with himself, or his inner daemon, with the Russian people of his day. This may be why I haven't devoured it, as with one of Solzhenitsyn's novels -- which are written for Russia, too, but also for the ages, for man as man -- but take it in pieces. It's a long book, too -- not light reading, but meaty reading, and with lots of tangents.One of the glories of Solzhenitsyn's writing is the sense that ghosts surround him -- a passion of duty, Hamlet but sane because the Holy Ghost is also there, he is not speaking or living on his own behalf, but on behalf of those who died, and of a nation whose soul was lost. He seems to hear the voice that Socrates heard, as he was waiting to die: \\"The most important thing is not life, but the good life . . . one must not give way or retreat or leave one's post . . . Do not value either your children or your life or anything else more than goodness, in order that when you arrive in Hades you may have all this as your defense before the rulers there.\\"Not in Hades, but in heaven, for whatever his sins may have been, I think he will hear, \\"Well done, good and faithful servant.\\"He was also a great writer, by the way!"},{"Title":"The oak and the calf (Trinity Forum reading)","review":"Solzhenitsyn writes (p 114) that the quote might have been made for him. The odd title, The Oak and the Calf, is referred to (p 190) as follows: \\"At any point I can call the book finished or unfinished. I can abandon it or continue it as long as life goes on, or until the calf breaks its neck butting the oak, or until the oak cracks and comes crashing down.\\" Subtitled \\"Sketches of Literary Life in the Soviet Union\\" Solzhenitsyn details the difficulties involved in getting his writings published, including specifics of conversations with the staff at Novy Mir, a monthly literary journal, especially involving the editor-in-chief. Surprisingly, the government allowed publication of A Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich (a prison camp worker), but others were deemed unsuitable (read - the government didn't want the truth to get out). Although his (p 300) A Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich, Cancer Ward, and the \\"lightened\\" First Circle won him win the Nobel Prize, he'd written much more at that point which he had \\"kept in reserve.\\" Of winning (p 289) \\"And what does a Nobel Prize mean to a writer from a Communist country? Somebody's bungled! Sorry--wrong address! Too hot to handle! Or else, get ready to be tarred and feathered.\\" He describes those who stand in the way of the truth: of a censor reading one of his novels (p 176), \\"But his eyes lit up--well, they weren't his eyes, of course, but replacements installed by the censorship; nor could he call his nostrils his own, since the censorship had equipped them with olfactory hairs...\\" Notably, The First Circle, The Feast of the Victors, The Republic of Labor and his camp verses were confiscated on September 11, 1965 (Pp 105, 106), his first wife helped the KGB build its case against him, a woman was murdered by the KGB (p 345) after telling them where a copy of Gulag (which she was not supposed to have kept) was hidden, and his works were regularly seized and then published without his knowledge or consent, sometimes in other countries. The book ends with him being picked up and taken to Lefortovo Isolation Prison, although with chapter titles like; The Wounded Beast, The Noose Snaps, Asphyxiation and End of the Road, the reader can deduce, without prior knowledge, his likely fate. An appendix follows which contains the text of letters and conversations referred to in the book.Although The Oak and the Calf helps in understanding the goings on at the time Solzhenitsyn was trying to publish, it is probably only necessary reading for those who have read some of his other works and want to know more about him or them. Of his other titles, A Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich, brief and hugely important in gaining a bit of understanding about the plight of Russians under Stalin's rule is a must read. Equally essential, though extremely long and detailed, is The Gulag Archipelago. Both provide insight into a largely overlooked and understudied issue in Russia's history, Stalin's GULAG (Main Camp Administration) system of forced labor camps, which resulted in the death of millions of innocent people.

Herein lies some of the most superb classical poetry produced within the last half century, a testament to the superlative skill, intuition, and brilliance of the author.Seldom will one find such high calibre writing, particularly from the ranks of contemporary writers. Reminiscent of the gothic imagery of Edgar Allen Poe, this poet entwines classical style and mythological references with truly inspirational sentiment and theology. In the epic poem, The Serpent's Left Hand, one is truly horrified by the imagery of Hell, and yet, equally inspired by the sublime grandeur of Heaven. Concurrently, the lasting metaphors presented in The Siege at Caerphilly demonstrate the heights and depths of which the human spirit is capable.Obligatory reading for any individual who might truly understand the nature of man."},{"Title":"Pasquale's Nose: Idle Days in an Italian Town","review":"This book had me laughing out loud. Sparsely written but very much to the point. Rips captures the Italian character precisely."},{"Title":"Pasquale's Nose: Idle Days in an Italian Town","review":"Does Pasquale have a keen sense of smell because his nose is big or because the ratio of his nostrils to his nose is proportionately larger than that of other men. Can you really skin a porcupine by slitting the skin covering one of his footpads and blowing into the resulting hole until the beast inflates? And what about the appearance of Dante's Beatrice in the middle of the central piazza of Sutri? PASQUALE'S NOSE is mystifying, funny, enlightening, existential and religious.Each of the &quot;local&quot; residents in the &quot;Very Ancient City of Sutri&quot; outside Rome has a story. There are plenty of secrets too. Rips is a storyteller who has collected, recorded, and repeats the tales he hears and the events he witnesses in this amusing, horrifying, and rustic little town.In Sutri, horses run in races without riders, local contadini own the palazzo, and old men shift around the piazza with the sun. Sutri may have been built by the Etruscans, nobody knows. Charlemange may have visited, but the details are messy. Pontius Pilot may have been a native, but no one is admitting it. There are plenty of versions about how Sutri got it's start, but they conflict. Truth is relative in Sutri.I don't know if Rips speaks Italian or not. He says the Sutris will not talk to you if you don't speak Italian. So, either he speaks Italian, or someone else did and told him what he heard, or he manufactured the tale. Maybe PASQUALE'S NOSE is take-off on all the stories in print about ex-patriate life in Italy, or France, or Poland. Rips says he is a non-non-person.I read PASQUALE'S NOSE in six hours. Since the paperback is light as a feather, you can take it along on your next flight to Italy. When you arrive, you can check out Sutri yourself and discover the truth."},{"Title":"Pasquale's Nose: Idle Days in an Italian Town","review":"Rips paints a town of amazing, eccentric characters you long to get to know yourself. I found the words of the Philosopher of special interest. This Sutrian old-timer defines the tomato [and its concentrate] as being &quot;the perfect food for the traveler, who is, himself, in an indefinite or ambiguous state--separated from the place of departure but not yet attached to the place of arrival.&quot; When I read the above passage, I did a double-take. I was on a plane drinking tomato juice, which I never order at a restaurant nor drink at home! Rips' are the kinds of stories you only gather by 'going native,' living in a foreign place long enough to really know it. By sharing his stories, Rips takes us with him."},{"Title":"Pasquale's Nose: Idle Days in an Italian Town","review":"Michael Rips described himself as a lost soul who has no useful skills and can find no direction in life. This is the author, lawyer and writer Michael Rips, speaking about a character, \\"Michael Rips,\\" who bears no more relation to the author than the character \\"Woody Allen\\" bears to the famous film actor and director.I was pleased to learn in another review that the town of Sutri actually exists. Although that other reviewer states that this town is perfectly described by Rips, I had my doubts whether there was such a town, or, if there were, it bore about the same relation to Rips \\"Sutri\\" that Rips the author bore to his character. In any event, it would not matter, because despite the local color it lends to the book, the place is not in itself of great importance. Quirky people can be found making a life together everywhere, and that is what this book is ultimately about.The book consists of short chapters composed of shorter vignettes. The first chapter establishes the character \\"Rips\\", the setting \\"Sutri\\", and the situation that brings Rips and his wife to that town: the author's inability to do anything useful. The character then hangs out in cafes and tries without much success to engage the locals and understand them.Unlike the authors of Italian Neighbors (Tim Parks) and A Small Place in Italy (Eric Newby), Rips never succeeds in penetrating the town, and his character descriptions of the locals are mere anecdotes describing their incredible eccentircities. As one friend expresses it, the Sutrini are \\"mad, mad\\".But about halfway through the book, this premise sufficiently established, Rips stretches out. The eccentricities are replaced by genuine paradoxes, and each anecdote becomes something of a zen koan. Reflections on these may be highly amusing, but will not yeild to rational understanding.By the end of the book a convincing world of paradox, a zen world, is established. In creating their town, the Sutrini have relied on collective myths (many not merely mythic but demonstrably false) which over time have affected the being of each of the residents as they strive to fit in and make sense of their lives. In this way the town is more than the sum of its parts, and each resident is less an \\"individual\\" than a living \\"particle\\" in this larger whole. It is impossible to live in this world as a rational autonomous \\"individual\\" or to understand the Sutrini one by one as individuals.Thus the portrait of the town comes to its own sort of wholeness and completeness, not merely despite the absence of penetrating character studies of the locals, but because of it."},{"Title":"Pasquale's Nose: Idle Days in an Italian Town","review":"I picked this book up praying that it would not be about the exploits of some annoying North American couple who buy an old, decaying villa, purportedly of historic renown, and then hurriedly write a book to pay for their folly. I didn't want Bella Tuscany, I wanted Ugly Tuscany. Something with an edge, rough. Broken terra cotta. Dusty. Weathered. Parched. Pasquale's Nose is all that and more.In this case we get Ugly Tuscia, which rests near between Umbria and Tuscany. Michael Rips is not working and on his wife's suggestion they up and leave the United States for the lovely Italian hilltown of Sutria.He gives us just enough information about himself and why he's in Italy to keep you interested. His wife has coaxed him to go the Etruscan village of Sutria so that she can paint. They have brought their infant daughter with them.If you've been to any tiny little hill in the Tuscan area then this book will fill on the pieces you may have wanted to remember when you returned home but forgot.Rips recounts some of the history the town, which is wry and funny like most things in Italy. The local characters that he describes throughout the book are what I remember vividly-coarse, refined, and yet slightly tart. You'll find out who Pasquale really is, who the outcasts of the town are, and more dirt than Bella Tuscany was willing to reveal.Think of this book as \`Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil' in Italy."},{"Title":"Pasquale's Nose: Idle Days in an Italian Town","review":"I enjoyed this book immensely. Michael Rips moves with his wife and daughter to Sutri, a town in Tuscany close to Rome, and discovers one of the oddest cast of characters imaginable. I suspect that Rips has a penchant for the odd and grotesque; still, I don't think he was inventing the aristocrat with a cat's paw for a hand, the old men with fond memories of POW camps in America, the restauranteur who refuses to serve dessert, or any of the other strange figures who populate this memoir of life in an Italian town. ...[The] book is a deeply welcome change from the ecstatic, sun-soaked memoirs typical of the genre. It also has a much more refined sense of history and sociology; Rips makes valient efforts to understand the unconventional mentality of the inhabitants of Sutri, all of whom attribute their marked clannishness to an Etruscan heritage (incorrectly, as it turns out.) This book was at once more realistic, and more fantastic than the average travelogue, almost like a fairy tale in the whimsicality of the stories it spun. My only quibble with the book is that Rips, a first-time author, didn't tell us enough about himself or what he was doing in Italy for me to really care about him or his family. The book has no sense of narrative; it's more a collection of sketches of his neighbors. I actually didn't realize Rips was an attorney until I read about it on Amazon; he portrays himself as a good-for-nothing layabout with no skills. A more honest account of himself, his family, and what they were doing in Sutri would have helped me better situate myself while reading this utterly engaging travel memoir. Still, this is one of the best examples of the genre I've read in a long time."},{"Title":"Pasquale's Nose: Idle Days in an Italian Town","review":"As one of the many who has fallen in lust with Italy over a too-short visit, I found this a fun read.The author displays a whacked-out sense of humor as he deconstructs the citizenry of a small town (large village?) north of Rome. There seems to be an unusually large number of eccentrics inside those ancient walls, and one more - in the person of Rips - just adds to the brew. He seems out of his element in the beginning, but eventually you start to think he's landed exactly where he belongs, in a sort of beign asylum where the inmates are the admissions committee.The dry commentary reminded me of the great Ludwig Bemelmens, one of the 20th century's premier travel essayists, though sadly largely forgotten today. Maybe you've read D.H.Lawrence's accounts of travel in Italia - infuse an offbeat sense of humor and a semi-fictional tone and you'll come away with a copy of Pasquale's Nose.

A town of 5,000 people in Italy where all the old folks (and others) speak English and a foreigner who speaks no Italian gets the whole scoop and makes great friends in a few months?Truly unbelievable. The book started sounding made up with one of the first stories, about the beans--beans noted throughout Italy, by the way, as the only ones never to cause indigestion. By the end, it was total super realism. That said, Rips is an entertaining writer who should stick to fiction that's billed as such."},{"Title":"Pasquale's Nose: Idle Days in an Italian Town","review":"Read the rave reviews and then read the book yourself. Pasquale's Nose is a big disappointment and not tied together well, chapter to chapter. Michael Rips flits from subject to subject, character to character without developing anything enough to make you care and there is a rich seam of stories about the residents and history of Sutri to be told here. The book is unsatisfying and unfinished and attempts to be philisophical at the end with a discussion of Adam and Eve and the question &quot;Where Are You?&quot;. Even so, I am glad I read the book because it opened up the village of Sutri, Italy -- and surrounding area -- for my further investigation. It whetted my appetite. I'll give Paquale's Nose that."},{"Title":"Pasquale's Nose: Idle Days in an Italian Town","review":"Having read and greatly enjoyed this story, I later found myself at Sutri enroute from Rome to Tuscany.

The stories and the history of this place are not only extremely interesting and funny, but they left me pondering the possibilities for hours."},{"Title":"Pasquale's Nose: Idle Days in an Italian Town","review":"People are complex and messy, I think, at least when they're truly being themselves. What I liked about this book was that it seemed to show a town where the locals are very comfortable being themselves, with their full \\"eccentricity\\" on display (though I suspect the true eccentricity is manifest in the desire of so many human beings to present some kind of uniformly \\"sane\\" facade).Some of the reviews that were less happy with this book seem to object to its disjointed feel, its lack of a clear story line. If that's what you're looking for, you may very well be disappointed. BUT, if you're willing to look at it as essays or character sketches, with a little bit of musing about why the Sutrini are the way they are (and really, why *we* are the way we are), you may enjoy it more. The book feels a little uncomfortable at first, probably much the way I'd imagine Rips felt when he arrived and dove into this strange new world.I read the book after arriving back home in the states after 5 weeks in Italy. Were that not my particular circumstance, I think I might have found the book less believable. But then I remember my time there, and also remember my time living in small towns in the USA, and realize Rips is probably telling the truth--mostly (it's just that the Italians have had a longer time to build local lore and a longer history to draw from and feed their quirkiness). In general, in small town Italy (at least a number of them where I've traveled) many people seem to radiate a mostly enviable attitude of not really giving a hoot what anyone thinks of them.I found the inhabitants of Sutri as presented by Rips fascinating, frustrating, lovable, bizarre, and very human. I also enjoyed Rips' reflections as these people held up a mirror to him and he seemed to begin to embrace or at least be pulled into the strangeness of it all, as though this place gives one permission to do just that, to get in touch with one's inner eccentric.This is definitely NOT your typical know-it-all expatriate memoir or the typical romanticized fantasy of Italy (though I've enjoyed some of those, too). It's colorful and interesting, a nice combination of sociology, anthropology, history, philosophy and humor. All that, and it was a quick read, too."},{"Title":"Pasquale's Nose: Idle Days in an Italian Town","review":"I could not get interested in this at all. Maybe 4-5 pages held my interest.

It even covers more private conversations like those between friends and family. But the real juice of this book starts with the self-training chapters, and the many chapters dealing with Delivery, with such helpful advice on matters ranging from enunciation to body posture; this book should be used in all schools today.What is missing from this book on practical rhetoric are things like the Five Canons and the Topics of Invention which, although crucial to understanding the full potential of Rhetoric, can be learned about from Corbett and Connors' Classical Rhetoric For The Modern Student.So, while this book may be a bit dated (some exercises use cultural items from the early 20th century), it mostly deals with a perpetually relevant subject--- Rhetoric."},{"Title":"Legends of the Shawangunk","review":"A nice anthology of stories. The stories sound historical, but how much is based on fact and how much is myth is questionable. The stories are written in a folksy style, like oral histories.

If only those impoverished masses who bear so very many children realized the error of their ways, the reasoning goes, the &quot;population explosion&quot; and its attendant problems could be diffused. Moreover, their own poverty would be alleviated, since they would have fewer mouths to feed.Champions of this Malthusian perspective generally have eschewed any efforts to actually investigate what life is like for the high-fertility poor who fuel the world's rapid population growth. In this slim but incisive book, however, sociologist Mamoud Mamdani demonstrates that by actually investigating and analyzing social reality from the perspective of those who choose to have large families, one can gain an understanding of the rationality behind this lifestyle choice. Indeed, in his study of a village society in northern India, he shows that these rural peasants are not poor because they have many children, they have many children because they are poor. High fertility is, in fact, a reasonable, even necessary choice for people with few resources other than their own labor power and that of their children. Mamdani shows that only when people's basic human needs for material security, health care, and support in old age are met can they begin to consider different life strategies that do not involve having large numbers of offspring.When it first appeared during the 1970's, Mamdani's book was revolutionary in its influence on the population/resources debate among environmentalists. Some hardline neo-Malthusians have refused to budge from their &quot;population control by any means&quot; position, but many others have come to realize that for people to be amenable to family planning measures, social and economic reforms on a large scale must be implemented.The one area where Mamdani's perspective is too narrow involves the role of women in fertility decisions. His study emphasizes the husband and wife as a decision-making unit making successive choices regarding additional births. In reality, however, women often don't have any choice at all as to how large their finished family size might be, and their husbands frequently insist on a larger family than the wife might desire. Indeed, over the past twenty years, it has become clear that empowering women and providing them more choices in their lives is another avenue to lower fertility.Mamdani fails to emphasize this feminist aspect of the population question, but in presenting a concise and thoughtful analysis of how population growth occurs at the local level, he has made a lasting contribution to social and environmental science."},{"Title":"The Myth of Population Control: Family, Caste and Class in an indian Village","review":"This magnum opus shines the light on the evil negative eugenics that has descended on us since Spencer, Galton, Sanger, National Socialism, Marxism, Rockefellers, neo-Maltusian ZPGers, The American Birth Control Society and its bastard child, the kill-for-profit Planned Parenthood. MM's book is a primer for the pre and post application of infanticide on the poor. The same with the term \\"education\\" which translates to \\"kill your baby so we NIMBYs will have less of you poor to worry about drinking our water and eating our food.\\" Even the so-called \\"earth first\\" crowd has estimated this planet could support 30 billion people indefinitely. It's only the Western colonialist/Marxist mind-set that sees this as a problem and they fail to report that a child is more than a life, he or she is an asset to the poor, any poor. This sort of \\"liberal white man's burden\\" constantly tells the poorest of the poor that if they have fewer, or no children, they will be better off. The real question is, \\"who is they?\\" This book is a good colloquial examination that will tell you who they are as well as Gary Allen's None Dare Call It Conspiracy will tell you what they are."},{"Title":"The Myth of Population Control: Family, Caste and Class in an indian Village","review":"This book was certainly important and useful in pointing out that individual motives determine fertility choices so policy should pay attention to structuring individual incentives. Clearly educating women, increasing incomes, urbanization, social security pensions for the elderly, lower infant mortality, liberating women, legalizing birth control and abortion, subsidizing birth control and abortion all tend to reduce the number of children couples prefer. But, the implication that family planning policies were misguided and wrong leaves out \\"the tragedy of the commons\\" (title of Garrett Hardin's famous essay). While it might have been individually rational for each poor Indian couple to have a large family (for old age support, etc.), it was almost certainly collectively irrational. I can't quite recall the number, but I believe it is 150,000 poor farmers who have committed suicide in India in recent years, because their wells ran dry and they ran out of hope. The \\"Green Revolution\\" that allowed India to feed itself better as population doubled and doubled again during the 20th century was based on genetics (high yielding wheat, rice, etc.), nitrogen fertilizer and irrigation. The higher yielding varieties of grains, however, require more inputs of nitrogen and water, both of which are being mined out. Nitrogen is currently made from natural gas, India relies heavily on fossil groundwater that is being mined out and water from Himalayan glaciers that are disappearing due to global warming. Undoubtedly many soils are being damaged as well, reducing future productivity. So, in the long run, it is likely that India will need to impose family planning, as China did, because its peasants are getting poorer not richer. The European demographic transition pattern is not an option. It is clear that low fertility is strongly associated with improved outcomes. I checked statistics for three classes of countries (over 200 countries in total): Low fertility (TFR&lt;2.1, about 2.9 billion people, middle fertility countries (TFR 2.1-4.1, about 2.7 billion people, and high fertility countries (TFR>4.1, about 1.1 billion people). People in low fertility countries had incomes five times higher, 21 year longer life expectancy, infant mortality about 1/7th as people in high fertility countries. And most wars and genocides occur in high fertility places."},{"Title":"Insider's Guide to Getting Published, The : Why They Always Reject Your Manuscript and What You Can Do about It","review":"Originally published in 1986 as \\"The Awful Truth About Publishing: Why They Always Reject Your Manuscript and What You Can Do About It\\" (a title that may have been too hard for aspiring writers to take, despite the softer subtitle), Boswell's book is a concise, accessible guide taking the neophyte writer through the various stages of writing and pitching their book, always with a realistic view of the publishing environment writers will operate in.

Russell\\"The Care to be Taken for the Dead\\", introduced and translated by John A. Lacy\\"In Answer to the Jews\\", introduced and translated by Marie Liguori\\"The Divination of Demons\\", introduced and translated by Ruth Wentworth Brown\\"The Good of Marriage\\" was one of Augustine's most influential works. He wrote it to define the purpose of marriage and to defend it as a good - not as good as holy virginity but a good nevertheless. To this end, he defined the purpose of marriage (what goods it brings to those in the married state), and from this what the duties of marriage must therefore be. It is a work at once strange and familiar. It is strange in the pains it takes to defend the idea that marriage is not actually sinful (a charge that few would even think to make today). It is familiar in that many of the most criticized aspects of the Catholic view of marriage, such as the denial of divorce and the sinfulness of non-procreative sex, are presented and defended in this work. It is a powerful presentation of these embattled points of doctrine and well worth reading.\\"Adulterous Marriages\\" is a treatment of a variety of possible issues and complications surrounding adultery, particularly with regard to separation and remarriage. It was built on the same theological foundations as \\"The Good of Marriage\\", but was aimed less at expounding doctrine than answering possible objections to it and clarifying the finer points. It almost serves as a set of appendices to that prior and more foundational work.\\"Holy Virginity\\" is a work that necessarily followed Augustine's works on marriage. Having defended the goodness of marriage, a defense of the superior goodness of virginity was required. The argument is rhetorical in form and scriptural in content. The main purpose is completed fairly quickly - Augustine draws on the lives of Mary, Jesus, the Apostles, and the teachings of Paul to establish that holy virginity is a good thing. Surprisingly, he then devotes considerable space to warning those practicing virginity not to be over-proud of their state and its superiority over marriage and to caution those practicing virginity to humility.\\"Faith and Works\\" concerns what the title suggests it concerns. The launching point, however, is the narrower question of whether pagan converts should be educated in the requirements of a Christian life before or after baptism. This question leads Augustine into the question of how important the Christian life is to salvation: do works matter? Augustine's answer and the scripture used in addressing this point is the Catholic position. It relies on Peter, John, James, and Jude as counterweights to the \\"faith alone\\" reading of Paul, and in fascinating in showing how the question did not arise suddenly in the sixteenth century but in fact had very old roots (Augustine in fact regards it as old even in his own time, and as having been settled in the time of the Apostles).\\"The Creed\\" is a short work, originally given as a sermon, explaining the meaning of the Creed to a lay audience. Augustine went slowly through the Creed, explaining each line's meaning in clear terms, and avoiding theological heavy lifting.\\"Faith and the Creed\\" is a slightly longer work than its predecessor, and was aimed at a more sophisticated audience. It also works slowly through the Creed, but its main occupation is using it as a means of differentiating Catholic from Manichaean belief, naturally to the credit of the former.\\"The Care to be Taken for the Dead\\" is a sensitive work for those dealing with the problem of the proper care for the dead and what - if any - consequences it has for the life to come. Augustine finds that the reason for respectful care for the dead lies not out of concern for the next life (where it has no effect), but out of concern for those still alive, that care of the dead is an opportunity for a final show of respect for the deceased. In doing so, Augustine gives comfort to those who cannot care for loved ones who have died, without making it seem as though those who can are foolish in doing so.\\"In Answer to the Jews\\" aims to defend the Christian interpretations of messianic prophecy in the Old Testament against Jewish objections. There was a substantial Jewish population in North Africa where Augustine was bishop, and he sought to fortify local Christians with a defense of Christian belief about the Old Testament.\\"The Divination of Demons\\" is a short piece intended to explain a question that seldom troubles Christians today: how could demons prophecy the future and if they could didn't it make them worthy of worship? Without claiming to have every heard a demon prophecy anything, Augustine argues that they could do so by merely natural means, and that this would not even necessarily make them better than men, much less worthy of worship."},{"Title":"Women, Poverty, and Demographic Change (International Studies in Demography)","review":"Over a billion people in the world still live in absolute and near-absolute poverty, where the former is defined as a daily income of less than $US1. Of these, the book notes that women bear more than their share. If we wish to remedy the poverty, the authors suggest analysing how and why the women in it have experiences different from men.Several articles describe how girls often get less education than boys, which then constrains their future employment prospects. Related to this are results of how poorer women have less knowledge of contraception and less means to purchase them. One such article studied lower and upper class girls in Argentina. But the results certainly apply elsewhere. One consequence is higher fertility by the poor, who have less resources to cope. So the wheel turns on another cycle.The book is scholarly and dispassionate in reporting what must really seem at times to be ineradicable suffering. I leave it to you to decide if the remedies suggested in the book will have much impact. In part, it is the sheer scale of numbers that is so daunting. Maybe we can only hope for the best with these measures."},{"Title":"Mind Over Medicine: Can the Mind Kill or Cure?","review":"In this interesting work, the author discusses what the expression It's All In The Mind really means. He investigates the full complexity of the mind's power over the body whilst criticising the mechanistic approach of modern allopathic medicine and demonstrating that our emotions are closely involved in the homeostatic processes that sustain life.Blake also deals with issues like pain thresholds, the intelligence of the immune system, various aspects of infection, what happens at the cellular level in the case of cancer and auto-immune diseases plus many other phenomena that cannot easily be explained by science. He proposes that the body is much more than just a biological machine and that a holistic approach to health is far more sensible. The book concludes with a postscript on AIDS.Blake's main point is that the important factors in healing are those that define us as integrated and whole individuals. Our uniqueness is expressed in the mental and spiritual aspects of our nature. Since spirit and mind permeate our physical lives in all respects, we must cultivate a new awareness of the role of the mind in understanding and healing organic illness.He provides some alternatives in a sympathetic look at homeopathy, hypnosis, imagery, meditation and oriental medicine. There are 5 pages of references, an extensive bibliography and a thorough index. I also recommend the important book Vibrational Medicine by Richard Gerber."},{"Title":"Sea Power","review":"My son loves browsing this gigantic hardcover.

How he can always put iout a winer is incredible.Everyone of his books is great. He is very dynamic. He is a easy read, and fun also."},{"Title":"Sea Power","review":"Seapower is visually stunning, with page after page of pictures that show both the physical might of the Navy, as well as the hard work that its ships' crews undertake to make it all work.Much like previous coffee table books on submarines and aircraft carriers, the book has little text, but relies instead on imagery to be worthwile. In doing so, they succeeded. Most modern classes of U.S. Naval warships are displayed, from the carriers, to the AEGIS cruisers, Arleigh Burke and Spruance destroyers, the Perry class frigates, battleships of the past, and support vessels. The pictures range from action shots to tranquil silhouettes against the setting sun, and the selected pictures leave a reader with a strong sense of the worldwide commitment and flexibility that makes the U.S. Navy the envy of the world.This is not a history of the Navy, and doesn't encompass much in the way of naval aviation, training, and so forth.

There is a humanoid species called Autlach, in a solar system previous colonized by humans with whom they have interbred. They have a religious and patriarchal society where females are taught subservience from birth. According to their religion sins were evidenced by the birth of an albino child. The interbreeding with humans resulted in the appearance of 'pale, blue-eyed, sterile and telepathic' daughters, Taelachs, which in the past have been persecuted as witches. However, Taelachs rediscovered human technology and are now more powerful than the Autlach which are regarded by them as inferior. This, in spite of Taelach being children that are removed at birth from their Autlach parents. An invasion by the Iralians, a reptile Autlach/Taelach eating species, has made the Taelach and Autlach uncomfortable allies.My first issue with the book started with a phrase on page 2 of the prologue: 'In that generation, a recessive human gene made itself known, producing a mutation when present in both parents'. I detest when people don't make the effort to write the science right. Unfortunately, this small issue was just a prelude for what would come afterwards. Regarding both the Autlach and Taelach societies, they are shown in a very superficial way which makes for the reader a difficult task in visualizing it. I found a lot of things incongruent. For instance, using scrolls in a society that is technologically advanced and has spaceships. The excuse used by the author regarding this use does not ring as plausible. Then, more important things. An initial description of both societies is given in the prologue and in the beginning of the story. However, the Autlach characters in the book are quite nice and certainly not what should be expected in a misogynist society. On the contrary, the Taelach, which we expect from the original description to be a more developed society, are a female/female copy of the male/female gender roles of the Autlach society originally described and they resort to violence against each other, including rape. G'Fellers seems to be advocating that a female only society will behave as a male/female society at its worse.The plot is very simple, full of clich&eacute;s and thus completely predictable. The story starts when a LaRenna, a young Taelach, following her graduation accepts a post as third Kimshee. Kimshees are the Taelachs which have as mission to interact with Autlach and discover when a new Taelach is being born. We have LaRenna's commanding officer, Krell who almost immediately discovers that LaRenna is \\"The One\\". She has telepathic powers as never seen before. But, most importantly, LaRenna, unlike all those sterile Taelachs, is a \\"true female\\" (It can be easily guessed where this will take the plot...). Also, Krell and LaRenna fall in love at first telepathic interaction. Of course, predictably, Krell has commitment issues, so the book does not end there. Then, we have the two rogue evil Taelach, who have escaped from prison and are making a deal with an Iralian. They have been localized and Krell sends LaRenna undercover as an Autlach to confirm they are at the place where they already know they are. LaRenna gets caught by the evil ones on the next day, but her special telepathy is not useful at this point because it is still too soon to finish the book. Actually, until the end of the book, her telepathy only functions as needed to prolong the plot. Of course there is even some deus ex-machina situation where \\"The One\\" discovers she has extra powers when everything seemed lost for her. Also worth mentioning are the two-dimensional characters and the terrible dialogues: an accumulation of clich&eacute;d phrases. A book to avoid."},{"Title":"No Sister Of Mine","review":"G'Feller's first book, \\"No Sister of Mine\\", shines as a well-constructed SF book with a lesbian protagonist. The author does not let the romance aspect overshadow the thrill and adventure of an SF story, yet the romance is integral to the story. G'Fellers manages to create an intense love story beneath a thrilling tale of culture clash, terror, and revenge. Even the villian is fascinating and terrifying.This is not a tale for the squeemish. Bad things happen in this tale, but it is by far one of the best in its genre and well-deserving of the 2006 Goldie award (SF category), finalist status for the Lambda Literary Foundation SF award, and nominated for a Gaylactic Spectrum Award."},{"Title":"No Sister Of Mine","review":"Lesbian Science Fiction doesn't come around often, but Jeanne G'Fellers' first novel is well worth the wait.

It is a magic, gooey carnival ride splattered in sex and viscera, with a hangman's sense of humor and enough human oddities to make even the most jaded Palahniuk fan cringe. The narrator , Olympia, is an alopecia-ridden, albino dwarf, who works at her parents' deranged, traveling sideshow and dutifully serves her older brother Arturo the Fish boy's every whim, even as his unadulterated megalomania threatens to destroy them all. This is a squirming, over-the-top book. A violent, take-no-prisoners romp through a gleeful, gilded madman's paradise. Forgot everything you thought you knew about carnival-life, this book will blast away your expectations and leave you whimpering for another go-around.Dunn's language is rife with memorable descriptions and expertly conceived characters and scenarios. The way each of the family's stories culminates is masterful. Arturo, once he gets into the spotlight, holds sway over all. He is repugnant and intriguing and his cult following is surely deserved. The Twins (conjoined and singing) are hilarious, and who can forget the unborn kids in the jars? Part of the book is told in flashbacks so exquisite, the modern day component has a hard time keeping up, but manages to remain interesting. Also, watch out for the BAG MAN, possibly the most disgusting and simultaneously enthralling character ever put to pen. Ugly, hulking and monstrously strange, like the book itself, the Bag Man makes you squirm and laugh every time he comes around. This is a beautiful book of bizarre goings-on. It will satisfy any sick puppy's appetite for grueling human depravity, and make you tear up at the end too! Swear to God, it's got it all. Don't wait, buy it right now, if you like Palahniuk and that sort of thing. This is better."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"Numerous other reviews and the editorial summary already tell you, on the surface, what this book is about: a family of intentionally bred circus geeks. And \\"The Odyssey\\" is about a guy sight-seeing the Aegean... So, what's it REALLY about? Say you, unlike just about anyone else in America, came from a highly dysfunctional family. Say you wanted to write about what it's like to feel different from the rest of the world, to feel that each of your family members has quirks that are not only hard for outsiders to understand, but a bit much for you too, to feel, alternately, hatred, horror and unconditional adoration for this strange collection of - What was that? Were you about to say....freaks? Or, maybe... geeks? (Which once was a circus term before the propeller heads hijacked it.) Well then, how about this? You write a novel about a family of real, literal geeks, each with their own distinct ability/dysfunction, each with different distinct roles in the family (the sweet, sensitive one, the monstrously egotistical one, the caretaker, etc.), bound despite themselves in intense love and often intense conflict, but at the same time defiantly confronting the \\"normal\\" world, more than proud of their difference, absolutely convinced of its necessity. Then you add in a few \\"normal\\" people, one, like St. Paul, a persecutor who ultimately becomes a convert, another a fanatic condemner, a Savanarola, who wants to hunt down and eradicate these aberrations. And you tell this whole, emotionally true, if objectively impossible, experience in the voice of a member of the family, of someone who loves every one of them in the most total, giving way, so that you can understand from the inside why, at key moments, they make decisions incomprehensible to anyone else, why, within their closed system, these are the ONLY decisions possible, and you make all this fun, filled with color and incident and a Dickensian clarity of characterization, and you end up with a novel that its readers simply adore, that they pass on to friends and acknowledge between them like some shared, glittering treasure known to few, and that makes an experienced reader of modern and classical, foreign and English-language, literary and popular fiction simply shake their heads and wonder, \\"How does one writer manage to get one work so uniquely RIGHT?\\""},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"This book was so entertaining, I just couldn't put it down.

It has been a good conversation piece between the two of us and is currently in circulation with another friend."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"Geek Love is a dark, forceful novel that delves into places most writers are too fearful to even glance towards, challenging commonly-held societal conventions. It makes you squirm, but it changes you too, lingering in the back of your mind like a bad odor long after its conclusion.The alluring, mysterious nature of the traveling carnival is an excellent backdrop to this incredible story of infatuation. The Binewski children, mutated genetically by their parents in order to work in the family traveling carnival, are assigned worth individually according to their abilities to draw a crowd, i.e. how atypical they are. While protagonist Olympia, an albino dwarf, would appear unconventional in \\"the outside world\\", in the carnival she is terribly normal, made to feel insignificant for her normalcy. This juxtaposition was a very gripping aspect of the story.Olympia's deep obsession with her older brother Arty was captivatingly multi-faceted. The incestuous nature of the relationship was not an issue; it was instead the feminist undertones of Olympia's submissive servitude of her brother, her \\"ugly duckling\\" status in comparison to their sister Iphy (whom Arty prefers) that opens debate and seduces a reader. Her obsession is heartbreaking and poignant, her equivalent of an adolescent affair but combined with the deep love for a family member, one who manipulates her and uses her weakness to his advantage. We can all relate to rejection, to a one-sided teenage love; on the other hand, while Olympia's humanized by her emotional struggle, she opens up a new world to us, with new standards of normalcy.The universe inhabited by Geek Love will challenge your notions of the ordinary, emotionally investing you in the characters and allowing you to watch their lives play out voyeuristically like a car crash- grim, tragic and inescapable."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"This is the sixth book we will read for a college seminar I'm taking.

After two decades I can say without hesitation that this is a book that will stick with you, and that you will remember long after you read it. For something to have that effect on you as a reader is a beautiful thing, and very rare. It is a fantastic story told incredibly well, and deals with subject matter that pleasant society probably won't be comfortable with.The book chronicles the lives of the Binewski family and their carnival, focusing mostly on the relationships between Arturo (Aqua Man), his sister Olympia, and Olympia's daughter Miranda. It is not a book for the faint of heart or those with a gentle stomach. Geek Love is about carnival freaks, bred that way by their mother and father who believe that the more twisted they are by deformity the more precious and beautiful their very being. The book makes some poignant statements about being different and the unique outlook it can give you on life. It also points out the subjectivity of beauty and its downfalls.Every character in the book is well defined and brought to the forefront, and each character has a story to tell that is uniquely their own. From Horst the cat man to Doctor P and Mary Lick, there isn't a single character that doesn't shine in this novel. It is hard to review this book without revealing some of the plot, which shouldn't be done as it could spoil Geek Love for those who haven't read it. The story involves the carnival heavily, familial love, sacrifice, cults, incest, and views of so called \\"norms\\" toward the geeks.It is at every moment inspiring and heartbreaking, with so much to take away from the book that you think back on it frequently to reassess your opinion. Is Arturo merely a pompous self-absorbed jerk or is he terrified of being left alone and unloved? Do Al and Lil really not understand how hard they have made the lives of their children, are they blind to the dynamics of their family or is it too hard for them to look at as parents? was the Chick simple for all his brilliance or just too young to understand the ramifications of his actions and inaction? How can a person like Mrs. Lick not understand that she is acting out of her own pain while she \\"liberates\\" the beautiful?This is not to say that Geek Love doesn't end well, the conclusion of the book is as beautiful and simple as its beginning. It is perhaps the greatest testament to this novel that you are left with these moral questions, it isn't often that a piece of fiction will make you think so deeply on its subject matter and on the morality of the concepts it lays out.I wouldn't suggest this book to many of my friends for the simple fact that I don't believe they could get through Geek Love without hurling it across the room. It is offensive, but not purposefully so, it's the kind of book that shoves the world of freaks in your face and makes you feel like one. If for that reason alone it should be read by as many people as possible, it's a timeless piece of literature and worthy of being on the shelves of any reader who can take a moment to open their mind to a reality different from their own."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"You DON'T want to read this book if: you are sensitive, you avoid horror movies, you don't like to get depressed, you find the idea of a couple breeding babies to be freaks for their carnival by loading the mom up with drugs to be the least bit repulsive.

I even had it recommended to me by a girlfriend. A crazy one. Like bi-polar, put my dog to sleep crazy. She was a sad mistake, but this book was not. I'm a big David Lynch fan, and this book is kind of the novelization form of a movie I could see him putting out. Strange characters, some malevolent, some vacuous, all marching to the beat of their own eccentric drum. Things go from strange, to even stranger, with mixes of everything from mutations to lobotomies thrown in, yet it all makes sense, in a sort of bizarre and twisted fashion. It eventually concludes as a weird, off the beaten path, but completely original tale. In my book, those are the best ones."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"Now this was a great read!

I had deep feelings for the characters, love and hate.I truly hated Arturo and his cult of amputees.

I was expecting humor, and received pathos. I anticipated an entertaining plot, and got a chaotic subculture that strained any logic or believability.

No."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"This is a book that one has to read with an open mind. If one looks at the grossness in the book, one will not appreciate it. This book has to be read with an open mind to see all Ms. Dunn has included.

There is also a good commentary on war. This is one of the few books that I think has a great ending. I would recommend it, but one must read it with an open mind."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"Other reviews use words like \\"disturbing\\" and \\"grotesque\\" to describe this novel.

To know Geek Love, you have to read Geek Love, because explaining it's about a family of mutants created by their parents to work the circus has very little impact on the story. This book is about relationships, being different than other people, looking for love, and finding people's faults, egos, evilness and problems along the way; only in Geek Love, it's to the extreme. But a believable extreme, that works.There isn't as inventive, creative and unique of a novel out there. This book defies genre, going beyond horror, science fiction and romance. If you're a highly intelligent person, fascinated by human interactions, why people join and follow and stay with cults and evil personalities, interested in how the forces of good and bad play out in people's manipulation's and enjoy an almost completely believable fantasy account of human interaction's Geek Love is for you.Why this woman hasn't written very much since, is a travesty and beyond me."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"\\"Geek Love\\" is one of the most unique novels I have ever read. The world of life on the road surrounded by the misfits and rejects of society is something most of us don't have firsthand knowledge of, but Ms. Dunn creates an atmosphere so rich that even the most unrealistic aspects of this novel seem breathtakingly alive.The major strength of the novel is the Binewski family at its core. Dunn lovingly crafts these characters and although each and every one of them has huge faults and disgusting traits, they are unfaltering in their realism. The basic human desire to be loved and needed takes on many forms, and many of them are not pleasant. Some readers may find themselves repulsed by actions of the Binewski characters, not realizing due to the characters distracting physical deformities, that they may in fact do the same things. Dunn did this on purpose, and the punch in the gut for the reader is a hard one.Yet another strength of the text is Dunn's prose. The voices of the characters are established early and each is artfully developed as the novel progresses. Dunn's use of figurative language is inventive and she has the power of the imaginative phrase in a vein that reminds me of Tom Robbins.The weakness of this novel is the ending and the ultimately disappointing sub plot (told in the present tense) that weakens the novel and leaves the reader wishing to return to the main plotline involving the Binewski family and their topsy turvey world.In a novel that seems so far removed from our everyday reality, it is a powerful quality to feel that pang of recognition. A brave and serious book. Read it for the simple fact that you won't come across many like it."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"Years after reading this book, Geek Love remains in my mind. How freakish is her tale of freaks. The work is a remarkably dreamt world--interesting, bizarre, and gut-turning at every turn. A dozen years later I still remember the book.

A writer of her talents will hopefully return her pen to page."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"This was such a captivating book. Such characters! And the plot line is very original and shocking.Yet, I agree with other reviewers in saying the ending (as in the last few chapters) came to an abrupt stop.The first 9/10th of the book was filled with details and amazing descriptions, subtle emotions, character developments, but then... It is almost like she realized her deadline was coming up, and hastily finished up what took all 9/10s of the book to build up to.So the ending was a bit disapointing in the quickness of wrapping everything up,but overall, a great read.Not for the faint of heart or closeminded."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"This is the first book by Katherine Dunn I have read and I can't imagine the brain that could churn out a story quite so demented. The flashback portions of this book were well written and heavy with plot. They had a very \\"storytelling\\" quality about them and the imagery was amazing. Her use of dialogue is stellar and she has a way of evoking emotion without ever going purple.The current portions of the story were good as well, but not great, the plot was a bit thin and there were some convenient plot points added. The ending was unsatisfying in that it all seemed a bit contrived. It seemed as if she just got sick of the book and pulled it all together as quick as she could just to get it off to her editor. There was a scene (on the anthill) where there was foreshadowing, but it was terribly obvious - it lacked any sort of subtlety that would have required the reader to look further and really think about the story."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"This is a consistently imaginative book. It's a blast to read. It almost slips too far from reality in the final third, but it was certainly one of the funnest books I ever read."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"Geek Love is one of the most bizarre books you are likely to read. A story of a circus family who create their own side show freaks by fetal interference, the story moves briskly through the lives of the offspring. Along the way, the author, Katherine Dunn, explores the jealousies and competitiveness that are common to all families. It vividly shows the costs of interfering with natural processes. The transformation of one of these children to a modern day messianic caricature leads to a shocking ending that will both satisfy and appal the reader. This is not a book for the weak hearted nor for a person who cannot separate strangeness of the events from the message between the lines, but it is well worth the time of literate readers looking for a really unique concept"},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"And, well, maybe you can't. But she shares her world, her black love heart, bitter-honor pride with you so completely, and with such sheer, rageful dignity, that once you read Geek Love, it becomes a part of you forever. I just wish they'd hurry up and make the film before Linda Hunt retires, because, damn it, she's the only one who could pull this off."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"Geek Love is a book which affirms the idea that everybody is both imperfect and special. The insights of astonishing vulnerability displayed by both Miss Lick (possibly the best chapter title ever &quot;Miss Lick's home flicks&quot;!) and Arturo display that the mask which we present to other people is a thin veneer covering our insecurities. By this standard we are all emotional freaks, something which is much more important and scary than any physical &quot;deformity&quot;. Although the narrative style can appear artificial at times this is more than made up for by the sheer pathos of the perfectly constructed characters and the use of simile and metaphor- &quot;inchy little lines like the hesitation cuts on a suicide's wrists.&quot; If you have a spare couple of quid BUY THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"What imagination!

From the very first page when the circus master refers to his creations/children as his &quot;dreamlets&quot; you are sucked in, and almost inexplicably you find yourself caring for the welfare of this deranged family of circus freaks.

But it's really a great book, extremely well-written. I've recommended it to a lot of my friends, but I think they're unwilling to read it for fear of admitting to their own freakish natures beneath their innocent visage. It's an amazing book, emotionally touching to the core. Unlike most of the books I've read, I believe Geek Love to be a must-read. For a person to get in touch with that weird side of their personality, embrace it, and understand it, I mean, WOW. It's an indescribable feeling."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"I thought that this book was compelling. It is the most creative, clever, twisted, pot-boiler I've ever read. It's one delicious campfire ghost story that lasts the entire weekend. I have read it over and over and over and over again. Do yourself a favor and BUY THIS BOOK! It changed me. :)"},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"Geek Love begins with one man's twisted realization of the American dream. Al Binewski, self-made man and owner of a fading second-rate circus, hits upon an ingenious idea: rather than hire freaks and pay them, he will create his own by dosing his pregnant wife with various combinations of drugs, chemicals and even radioactive materials. When these offspring are born, flawed in both body and mind, their parents praise them for their abnormalities and teach them to perform. Seen mostly in flashback through the eyes of Olympia, the bald, albino dwarf whose fairly routine deformities pale next to the more spectacular mutations of her siblings, the novel explores family dynamic in a family where the competition to be the most freakish and thus the most prized is constant and intense. Olympia is torn between her slavish devotion to her brother and lover Arturo (the &quot;Aqua Boy&quot; with fins for limbs) and her other family members, who are constantly endangered by the megalomaniacal Artie's need for fame. This novel is definitely not beach reading - it challenges just about every one of our assumptions about family, love, and beauty. In one early scene, the family is attacked by a gun-wielding madman who takes one look at them and snaps; as he is being arrested a woman comments that he did the right thing, that such a collection of monsters is better off dead - and one is uncertain whether or not to agree with the stranger. Such crises of conscience confront the reader on nearly every page. The plotting and psychological studies are brilliant right up to the Armageddon-like climax. The novel is wrenching, and hideous, and agonizing to read - yet it achieves a beauty that transcends normal perception. It is truly a masterpiece"},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"Okay, if you are on Amazon to look for a new book to read, and decide to read the reviews first, than listen up. Read the \\"synopsis\\", see what it's about? Yeah, it's not a novel about Nerds who fall in love; it's a fantastical novel about a family that is designed to be full of horror, wonderment, shock and awe, literally. If you cannot stomach reading descriptions of deformities, or people who are cult followers to the nth degree, or talk of injuries to both body and soul and mind, than do not buy this. If you do, than soon you will be on here reviewing this and saying \\"it was disgusting, and horrific, and I didn't get it\\" This book isn't for the faint of heart, or the simpleton who just wants quick read before settling into beddy-bye for the night. You must be able to wrap your head around profound, well written, scarring literature. If you choose this for a readers circle, or book club, make sure that everyone has an open mind, you don't want to choose this and than have a bunch of people look at you like you grew fins and a hunchback.We all have handicaps, physical or mental. I know that I can personally blame my parents for the struggle and afflictions I have had in my life, they might not have designed me that way, but they sure as heck didn't think before they acted. I fell in love with this book because I fell in love with the sublime mystery of It all, I couldn't wait to see how it unfolded, and how it came to be that Oly was on her own looking after both her daughter and her mother, and neither knew who she was. I will forever treasure this book."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"I never thought that a book featuring an albino humpback as the main character could be written so beautifully.

If you fall into that category, you won't like it. Period.I do object to the reviewer who claims that nothing more significant happens in this novel that something you would see on \\"8 is Enough\\" (Note to author: your example is dated, most people under 25 don't remember shows from the early 80s). First of all, it is a stellar example of Magical Realism, a genre popularized in Latin America and relatively new in American Literature. Fans of the genre will find Dunn's take interesting. Second, I found this book to be, at heart, a very sensitive meditation on the way human beings treat each other based on physical appearance. I don't want to spoil the plot for hearty readers out there, but pay attention to the sub-plot involving Olympia and Miss Lick.It seems to me that the people who react negatively to this book are not willing to probe much deeper than \\"Ew, circus freaks.\\" I'd like to remind those people that beauty in novels as in people is more than skin deep."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"Geek Love is one of those rare books that paints a terrifying landscape with the colors of the dark side from each of us. The characters stalk and swagger larger than life, but not above or removed from it. They are life in ways we're not accustomed to viewing it. Katherine Dunn is from Portland, so I'm partial to her, but she constructs a novel here that is so real the characters and events become burned in your mind. It is passion and love and death and revenge and all the elements that not only make good fiction, but reflect on the human condition in all its forms."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"Hands down one of THE most extraordinary tales of the quirks of humanity ever written...it is sad, and beautiful, and horrifying and real and fantastical and pathetic and awakening....this book grabbed me in the first few pages and stayed with me for a long time after reading it!!"},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"My book club read this book and what an interesting discussion it caused! Everyone liked it (or loved it!).

Terrific story."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"When I received a copy of Geek Love as a gift, I held no high hopes for it. As I began reading, I was absolutely entranced. By the time I was a hundred pages into it, I knew I would never forget it. The style and language with which it is written made my heart sing and my jaw drop. The world that Dunn creates is unlike any I have encountered, and I found myself wishing it were real. I feel as if I lived with these characters: Oly, Artie, Iphy, Elly, the Chick...they are all indelibly etched into my brain. It is uncommon to see the full scope of human behavior in a work. Geek Love has it, from intensely lovely to unspeakably hideous. Dunn has a hold on every nuance of her wonderful characters, and they in turn have a hold on my imagination that will not fade anytime soon."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"There are geeks of body and geeks of mind. The central point of the tale is to throw in your face the visible (read physical) aspects of geekdom. Other than the use of chemical cocktails to mutate their children which they cherished, I didn't see too much different (context considered) from the hideious side of reality. Consider this, perhaps it's just a tale of abuse (embryonic) and it's aftermath."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"In an image-laden narrative in diary style, Katherine Dunn presents us a world that is shocking in its grotesque warping of mores and similarity to our own psyches. She drives right into the heart as she swells it with compassion for her characters. Fantastic, horrifying, and home-grown."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"Fabulous story. Great characters. At times found myself skimming to get to more descriptions of freaks or freakish things. Dunn often seemed to know what kinds of questions I'd have about freaks (how do they have sex?) and answered them. As a voyeur, I give the book a big thumbs up. I was not led to reevaluate what it means to be normal or anything like that. Instead, I decided this book was actually about freaks rather than a lesson in why it is ok for me to be less than normal. Give the freaks a room of their own!"},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"At first, the reader is disgusted with the experimentation of the Binewski family. Reading further, however, we begin to see the bigger picture. What could be better than subverting our own ideologies... taking our disgust with abnormalcy and gradually turning it into normalcy? Arturo snears at &quot;the ... norms.&quot; That's great! For Arturo and Miss Lick both desire an inner concentration."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"I took this book out of the library because the last sentence on the front flap of the dust jacket stated, &quot;It would make you redefine 'normal'.&quot; That piqued my curiosity. What a superbly, well-written book on a rather &quot;macabre&quot; subject.I read this book years ago before it actually got critical acclaim. Although I do not remember the details, I will never forget the unselfish love Oly had for her brother Aqua Boy. Her love surpassed what we would expect of any &quot;human being.&quot; Katherine Dunn's skillful handling made the story less horrifying and her &quot;circus weirdos&quot; quite &quot;human.&quot; This book has certainly made me &quot;redefine 'normal'&quot;! Very readable and thought-provoking."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"I just finished reading Geek Love, and like many others who have read this book, I gave it a ten. Profound characters and a plot which tied all together at the end made this book a must read. For the first time in my life, I found every single aspect of the book to be necessary and crucial to the plot. I am usually skeptical about books with such outlandish titles and storylines, but this was the &quot;Big Lebowski&quot;. I kept reading, looking forward to every insight and detail of each and every character in this novel. Dunn has outdone herself with this magnum opus. I cannot say how much this I enjoyed this book. I feel that the only way I can pay attribute to Dunn is by writing an English paper focusing on why this book should be taught in school. Sure it has its vulgar and raunchy moments, but the worldy lessons explained in it override them ten-fold.I can only say thank you to Miss Dunn for writing such an excellent novel, and I truly, revere your work."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"So many people said this book was great. I did not like it at all. None of the characters were likable, and I felt the author went through a Rolodex of oddities to throw them into the novel. It was tedious to read; there were many superfluous characters, and there was a constant change of time and narrator. I am really sorry I paid for it and read it. The only reason I stuck it out was because I read it for a book club. Otherwise, I would have quit after about two chapters."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"LOVED this book! Cannot say enough good things about it. Fascinating, crazy, funny, and tragic. Beautifully written story - just great all-around."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"Breathtakingly original in plot and in character creation, Geek Love is a unique work of contemporary fiction unlike any other. Initially, I wanted to dislike the story of the complex Binewski clan, not because they were a corporate money making carny family whose yearnings for cash was the golden rule and how to get it the all consuming pastime, but it was because of what the senior Binewski did to his offspring in order to make them more profitable in the carny lifestyle, particularly the Binewski's Carnival Fabulon; he genetically engineered his children to be carny freaks, children with outlandish and horrific birth defects, all aided with the help of amphetamines, radioisotopes and arsenic. While traditional moralists might consider the Binewskis repellent in every conceivable way and cringe with disgust at the senior's deplorable actions, love is still love-I guess-and Mr. Binewski does love his genetically manipulated offspring, even if it was the almighty $$$ that propelled him to go outside the boundary of moral ethics.The children-Arturo, Iphy and Elly, Olympia and Chick-are all endowed with a unique and freakish talent and or ability. Arturo is known as Aquaboy, a fish-like creation who spends a good bulk of his time performing in a water tank. Then there is Iphy and Elly, two Siamese twins who always take center stage when the tents are up. Then there is Olympia, a short, baldheaded albino dwarf whose voiceover abilities make her pitch-perfect for the ringmaster with the microphone. Unfortunately, she is not freakish enough and is thus regulated to being the voice artist, the least profitable position within the family. Lastly, there is Chick, the baby of the family. By all outward appearances, he is the least odd looking of them all. He looks like a \\"norm\\" and because of that, Mr. Binewski wants to give him up, for he will contribute nothing financially worthwhile to the carnival business at hand. Crystal Lal, the mother of the odd brood, is reluctant to let any of her \\"kids\\" go. On the cusp of abandoning Chick, they soon discover that he has a freakish power that if not kept in check could destroy them all. However, with the new found power, he is kept within the clan, and his ability manifests itself starkly and violently towards the latter end of the novel.With all the children's bizarre oddities in place and working for a common goal, the Binewski clan lead to all appearances a normal family life. As the novel progresses, however, cracks begin to show through, and Arturo the Aquaboy gradually begins to take the helm as the business's overseer. Yet, he also develops a cult of personality as well as a following by down-and-out groupies who can relate-in some capacity-to the freakish outsiderness that the Binewskis represent, for they are like the leaders of the unpopular people, and Arturo takes them all in under extenuating circumstances. The followers must show their devotion in a radical way, and only by that radical way will they supposedly garner acceptance into the family circle. While Arturo is dealing with the business at hand as well as with his followers, feelings of lustful curiosity arise amongst the children. Iphy and Elly begin to prostitute themselves and Olympia develops incestuous feelings for Arturo, though he never makes good on any of it. Olympia is another story, and she uses Chick's power to get what she wants. Things come to a head and destruction is the only solvent to making everything better, a true finality for something that should never have been. The father and mother were sick in their thinking from the very get-go, and the offspring suffered for it. But true badness always destroys itself in the end, and with the exception for Miranda, Olympia's and Arturo's unsuspecting daughter (who has a tail), she becomes the carrier of the warped Binewski legacy.Geek Love is a complex and dark novel, not a simple love story as some people suggest, because it begs to ask the reader, What is familial love? Can it go to the extreme as depicted by the Binewski Family? It encompasses suicide, murder (read about Miss Lick), incest and all the horrific attributes of human nature. Yet, the foundation was love, but horror was built on top of it. Geek Love was disturbing and compelling yet utterly different and insightful in the annals of American fiction. It certainly earned its National Book Award nomination and Bram Stoker Prize nomination! If director Todd Browning were still alive, he'd probably love this book."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"I picked up this book thinking it was going to be about a torrid nerdy love affair. Boy was I wrong! When I found out it had carnival themes I almost wet my pants.Geek Love is the story of the Binewski family narrated by Oly Binewki, an albino dwarf and according to the rest of the family the least interesting of the lot. She flips back and forth between present time and her childhood at the circus. She recounts her horrific childhood with the notion that it was completely normal. Oly along with her brothers and sisters were specifically bred by their parents to be freaks. Her older brother Arturo is the gem of the family and he never lets them forget it. Oly feels inferior to the rest of her family but revels in any form of attention that Arturo throws at her, good or bad. She is insanely loyal Arturo, who is beastly and cruel at best. Her younger brother Chick is adept at telekinesis and is used throughout the story by her father and Arturo. Her sisters, which are Siamese twins suffer abuses from Artie as well. The story unfolds intermittently between peeks at present day life where Oly rooms in a house with both her mother and daughter. Neither are aware of who she really is. If you want to find out what happens READ THE BOOK!(ha! I just wanted to throw in a Reading Rainbow quote in there)Really this is an excellent book. I have read a lot of the negative reviews about it, half of them rated it low because they couldn't stomach the graphic descriptions of people or events, the other half said it was predictable and failed because it was trying to hard to be grotesque and shocking. I disagree! Some people even dogged the writing, which I can't even fathom, because the writing was excellent. I admit, some parts were gut wrenching to read and I was grossed out more than once, but the meat(ha!) of the story was intriguing and even though I speculated a lot of things I was surprised right up until the end.That being said, this isn't one of those books that is an open and shut case. It doesn't have a neatly packaged ending that leaves you satisfied, but it is a great character study. I recommend it if you can stomach the hard stuff."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"I agree with the reviewers who describe Geek Love as Fellini in prose. It reads like a lyrical cryptography of a secret world parallel to our own but that we dare not broach if we want to emerge still whole and sane (if ever we truly were), every description steeped in the perspective not of a deranged mind, but of a sane one locked in a deranged existence.As playful as it is disturbing, Geek Love is the story of the Binewski family, proprietors and main attractions of a traveling carnival, as recounted by one of the last-surviving Binewski brood (don't worry I'm not giving anything away you don't get told on page 1), a brood of true-born freaks, mutants conspired into being, gestated in a womb purposely poisoned in order to effect their individuality.The story switches between past and present, establishing from the outset that the characters are fated for certain doom, which makes the predominant questions of this tale not whether it will all come crashing down, but how and why.In Geek Love, Katherine Dunn exposes the monstrosity of human nature with such deliberate and macabre wit you can't help but give in to the temptation to look, like passing a ghastly traffic accident and privately hoping to see something memorably shocking. If only to jolt you from the banal mediocrity of daily existence. If only to remind us why we strive so ardently to remain mediocre. And in doing so, she shows us how our collective fascination with freakishness is really a self obsession.By taking us into the lives of those we pay to shock and appall us out of our safe and ordered reality, albeit from a safe distance and in an orderly format, she shocks us with how akin we are to those who wear our deepest fears on their skin with unflinching acceptance and even admiration. How they are us. Deathly vulnerable to the parts of us we're most afraid to love and so directed by that love to do and be our worst.Geek Love is one of the most beautiful portrayals of ugliness and ugliest portrayals of beauty I've had the pleasure, and at the same time revulsion, of reading."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"Well, this was indeed a strange book. One should find themselves despising parents who purposely take drugs to breed their own freak show. For that matter, saving lost pregnancies and corpses in jars that are polished regularly SHOULD be a despicable act. And yet, I took a lesson from this book; love comes in many many forms. Sometimes it's not pretty and we don't have to agree with it but it is a driving force.(By the way, check out my book on Kindle!The View From the Dashboard)"},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"\\"Wow.\\"That was my first thought upon finishing this bizarre, disturbing, beautifully-written novel.Jeez. (The second thought.)I consider myself to be quite jaded where fiction is concerned. And, despite recommendations from people I respect, I had resisted reading this book since the time of its original publication. For some reason I decided to include in my bag of beach-bound books this summer. Trust me - this book is not light beach reading.I work with the seriously mentally-ill and this book hits a bit too close to home for me to feel comfortable reading it - I almost gave it four stars for that reason, but it is so well-written I had to go for five. I have also studied anthropology, so the juxtaposition of cultures was nothing new for me. Still, I feel this book will be one of the rare volumes that changes the way I see and experience the world. Ms. Dunn is a remarkable writer and I wish her unbounded success.Am I brave enough to read anything else she may write? Time will tell."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"I'll admit, I had to read this for school. Now, just so you know, this book is NOT about a nerdy kid in love with a preppy cheerleader or highschool athlete as the name implies. It is about Circus freaks. Before you say that isn't nice to say, they are proud. In this story, a Geek is someone who kills animals and drinks the blood in front of a crowd. I know, creepy. The plot is fairly hard to follow, but several twists abound. Knowing what it is about, I wouldn't pick it up again, but you can decide for yourself. It is a different twist on the American family/dream, but only you can decide if it is a good or bad different"},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"What's with everyone hating the editing? I thought the book had great editing.I didn't find the characters too absurd or abstract to be unrealistic, but too absurd and abstract to be fictional. The transgressive themes of this book are all well and great and are attended to in other people's reviews, so I wont bother with one more attempt to praise it, but what I found most entertaining and refreshing are the characters in and of themselves. If you find them off-putting it's because you're one of them.This is emotional porn; exploitative to the point where the federal government would need to regulate it if it were imitated."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"Beautifully well-written and a very original story. You will forget that these characters are 'different' and begin to love them for their insights, heartache, and loneliness. They are deeply flawed, as we all are, and the only thing that makes them dreadful are their physical descriptions. I like to think that we should all read this novel and see people as they are-- from the inside out. Yet, some of the characters are nasty inside AND out (possibly Archie, but we could probably argue otherwise), so it makes for a very entertaining read!Not an easy read; I picked this up and put it down for over a year before I finished it in one gulp. It's very odd and complex and takes the right mood/mind-set to yank you into its carnival universe. Some may never get there. Give it a few chances before you toss it."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"Through this exotic and breathtaking novel about a carnie family, Dunne reveals a world that is unbelievable. Not only are the characters physically challenged by societal norms, they are also challenged by the everyday emotions and feelings typical of being human. By submerging the reader into the &quot;sub-human&quot; characters, the reader is better able to safely examine his/her ideals about relationships concerning family, love, and friendships. It is through the vehicle of the weird and unusual that Dunne enables the reader to escape one's reality in pursuit of one's truth. Geek Love is a deep novel and definitely not for the weary."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"How is it that a book such as _Geek Love_ can end up raking in the readership? By masquerading as a tour de force of supposedly unexplored themes. I detest the way Katherine Dunn self-indulgently explained her &quot;unusual&quot; life in her little autobiographical narrative, as if this adds justification to her decision to write such a shallow book. Furthermore, this book has been aided by the reputation which has grown from the ignorance of those who haven't first acquainted themselves with a few more original writers who explored these very themes (manufactured disfigurement as a social metaphor) in much more interesting, not to mention more literary manners. The first such writer who comes to mind is Angela Carter, whose prose may be ponderous, yet it yields the kind of depth that _Geek Love_ is sadly lacking. I am sorry that Katherine Dunn has experienced the kind of success she has. This book has been recommended to me many times, and when I finally ended up (shamefully) purchasing a copy, I found it only good enough to rid myself of (with a disclaimer) to a person who lamented having never finished the book, but who wanted to. This person was travelling to Mexico and wanted something to read. Along with _Geek Love_, (which I was happy to part with), I gave her a copy of _Nights at the Circus_ by Angela Carter and advised her to use her discriminating faculties. Don't further the idea that wholesale rip-offs should magically become bestsellers just because a few self-professed iconoclasts say so."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"It's obvious why this is one of those books to talk about. It's literature for people who've recently outgrown their Bukowski phase but still need a little grit. It's generally interesting, and sometimes quite fun. Though it tends to lose its threads when trying to be literary. Still, I enjoyed it right up until the very end.But it's the ending itself that nearly ruined the book for me. It fails because the narrator could not actually describe the final events and I was left thinking, \\"Wow, Katherine Dunn got herself into trouble here and didn't know how to get out, so she faked it.\\" This might be too picky, but it truly did yank me out of the world she'd created. I felt tricked and manipulated.So... fun book... seriously flawed ending that kills all the build-up.Everyone's recommending this if you like Palahniuk. But this is several steps down and will be a disappointment once you've gotten yourself to Palahniuk's standards. Go with George Saunders or early Barry Hannah (before he became an alcoholic prick). Even better, just keep rereading JESUS' SON."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"The title was enough to sell me on the book at first. I have always been interested in what people call freaks or the transmundane as i often like referring to them. The idea of a family breeding their own batch of abnormal children to profit the family carnival was my cup of tea. I should have known it was too good to be true. I really did not find one character likeable throughout the novel. Not even the spineless little &quot;heroine&quot;, Miss Oly. The Aurturo character was even worse. I could not buy that this spiteful, mean spirited creature was the focus of affection for many of the other characters. If i am reading about circus freaks and their lives i want to do just that. i want to be entertained by these abnormals. my major problem was with the Aqua boy and how he obviously needed something, someone but was unwilling to sacrifice any thing of himself, including just a bit of his enormous ego. And his sisters and family just put up with it. Unbelievable. I just couldn't suspend my belief long enough to be captivated by outlandish scene after another. I know we're dealing with an outlandish scenario but the plot and character's actions need to be believable as well. the book promises a lot from the jacket but just doesn't deliver, especially those who are long time fans of the carnival midway acts themselves. don't get me wrong, dunn had her poetic, literary moments throughout but without too much else, including just awful characters, to save the novel in and of itself."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"My daughter needed this book for her college English course and the bookstore there wanted almost double what I paid for it here!

Experimentation of this type on people has been condemned by most thoughtful societies. To try to imply that parental affection has any role in the abusive treatment of the children is a travesty."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"This book isn't as good as I expected it to be. Why the expectations? Well, a friend whose opinion I generally trust recommended it to me about 10 years ago. Yeah, a lot changes in 10 years. And it bears to reason that the kinds of books we were reading then aren't exactly the books we're reading now. At least for me this is true. For about 8 years this book sat in my bookcase, waiting patiently to be read. By chance, I picked it up after all this time. In the end, I guess that was the turning point. The story had been so promising until I started to actually read it.Mired in a mundane story of a generic nuclear family, the only thing unique about this book is that the family is a family of freaks - literally. Each family member has some kind of genetic mutation which allows them to be an element in a traveling circus. These mutations were brought about due to experimentations by the parents. I'll leave the gory details to the book, if you so choose to pick it up, which I don't recommend.When I initially finished the book I thought it was good enough, if not spectacular. In the grand scheme of things that's what you're going to get when you read random books - some good, some bad, but the vast majority in between. After some time to think about it, this lies more to the bad side that in between, a sentiment that an old coworker once remarked about when he said, \\"What happened to good literature? All the kids these days are reading crap like Geek Love.\\" This was 8 years ago, which sparked a reply of, \\"I wonder what's wrong with Geek Love,\\" to myself. Now I know.If only I had known before. The book is short enough that it doesn't waste away too much of your time. So it's got that going for it, which is nice. And the pages turn fast enough, I suppose. But at best, it can be labeled as, \\"You could waste your time in worse ways.\\" In the end, this book was ultimately a waste of time for me.To get slightly more into the book, the story deals with a series of family squabbles that you might have seen at some point growing up watching 8 is Enough, or The Partridge Family or The Brady Bunch. The story doesn't end happily in 30 minutes, like those shows did. But the issues aren't really any different. Just more adult and, well, freakish in nature. You give a teenager with an insecurity complex webbed feet, and we're still talking about a teenager with an insecurity complex. I probably thought many of the people I went to high school with probably had webbed feet at the time anyway.The ending of the story is, in my opinion, awful. What was a mildly entertaining and unremarkable book turned towards the dumb and unbelievable at the end. Such is the errant narrative of the text, I suppose, having been crafted by someone trying to take a generic story of family strife and sell more books by giving the people physical deformities and putting them in a carnival. As a literary element, the book as a whole leaves a lot to be desired in so, so many ways.In any event, not much to see here."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"This book is guilty of many things - but by far the most heinous of its crimes is an all-pervasive dullness.

The story of this family is one I will never forget."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"I bought this book used when a friend I was with said it's supposed to be good. I thought the description on the back sounded interesting, so I bought it. When i finally got to reading it, I was instantly hooked. For much of the book, I simply couldn't put it down. I liked that just about anything goes in this book, and Dunn didn't seem to hold anything back. I liked that it disturbed me, and I had to pause occasionally to grasp what I had just read. Dunn writes well, and created some great images (loved the gold-plated pumpkin analogy). But at some point, it just got boring, like others said. I think it's perhaps that the shock value runs out when it's on just about every page. It gets to the point that Dunn can't shock the reader anymore. Maybe that was part of her plan, to show how easily we can be numbed. Who knows.I was interested in Oly's and Miranda's story, but it dragged on too long in the end. Miss Lick is a fascinating character, but I got tired of Oly's obsession with her. I couldn't understand how the same person who did nothing to stop Arty's horrific actions, would finally take charge with Miss Lick, who was not nearly as evil (why not talk to her first??).I also got thrown off in the last few chapters, where Dunn talks about Oly in third-person for a few paragraphs, seemingly random, and then back to the familiar first-person. To me it seemed like simply bad (lazy) editing, and it was very distracting to suddenly be reading of Oly from third-person, when the whole novel was told from her point of view. The last few chapters were really hard for me to get through. I can't understand how the same book that kept me enthralled for most of it, could force me to skim parts in the end just to get it over with. Very inconsistent. I mean, I've read great books or seen great movies that didn't end perfectly satisfyingly. But I can't recall any other book/movie that kept me glued for so long, and then tortured me so in the end. It was almost like two different people wrote this novel.I'm sad that this book didn't end as well as it began. It really had so much potential.

As odd as they are within the context of the story, the freaks tend to be the norm. \\"Normal\\" people flock to see the show and some even begin to amputate body parts in order to be more like Arty, the charismatic flipper-limbed star of the show.Here is a most amazing book that will be either loved or hated by its readers. The writing is wonderful. The topic is difficult. If the reader is not offended by the material and stops halfway through in disgust, the story itself turns out to be imaginative and thought-provoking.

Nor is this book about anything even approaching a normal family. Art and Lil set about to create a freak show of a family, and they succeed mightily, only they lose control when Arty, the boy with flippers for limbs, takes over in his Machevelian manner. Arty manipulates his audience, and his family, and starts something of a cult that can best be described as bizarre and macabre. What is even more macabre is the devotion he instills in Oly, the narrator and albino dwarf, and in Chick, the seemingly normal boy with mysterious telekinetic powers that he uses in service to Arty's cult. Only one of the Siamese twins seems immune to Arty's control, and she pays for it. Boy, does she pay for it.The story doesn't end with Arty, though, but with Miss Lick, who engages in her own cult of fleshly sacrifice. Only she goes after Oly's daughter, whose disfigurement becomes something of a sexual turn-on, and Oly doesn't want Miranda to lose it.

I will say one good thing about it aside from not liking the story very much or the characters it was written very well and had a lot of imagination."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"Although I came to this novel late,I can't say enough good things about it. This book is not like anything you have ever read. There is never a dull moment. You think you cannot be suprised again; then the author takes you to yet another outrageous situation. I'm thinking now of the followers of the boy with fins who decide to have their fingers and toes removed over a period of time in order to be more like him. Ms. Dunn is clearly an original. Certainly she hears a different drummer, or in this case a circus barker. I had almost decided that the book perhaps is just too grotesque. Then I turned on Larry King; he was doing a recapitulation of interviews with Jim and Tammy Fay Baker. Suddenly the characters in this novel didn't seem so strange after all. So art does mirror life. In this case it's the crazy circus mirror from the fun house."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"I am not so sure whether to like this book or to hate it, and I am leaning towards the latter. What troubles me the most was that the main character, Oly, does nothing to prevent her brother Arty from obliterating the family she so \\"loves\\". This is unfortunately central to the theme that she has undying love for her daughter (to the point of doing anything for her) and yet she claims to love the -skis so much that she allows her brother to do terrible things to them (like rape, murder, emotional abuse)? Doesn't make sense. Her enduring love for Arty is not quite explained, it could be incestuous lust for all I know (the lengthy descriptions of Arty's physique was telling), so I didn't quite buy into her blind loyalty to him and not for her other siblings, for instance turning a blind eye when she knows Arty is harming her family. It is never explained why she loves him, only a few sentences here and there that she loves him. Period. No explanation.Secondly, the author does a good job bringing light to grotesque themes, like voluntary physical mutilation, but as another reviewer noted, the descriptions of these mutilations are like slowing down to stare at a horrific car crash - you don't want to but you can't help not to. There are far too many pornographic and mutilating circumstances in this book that would make me want to re-read it (which I don't plan on doing).Also, none of the characters were like-able in any way. Arty's deliberate planning to destroy anyone and everyone was drawn out and tiring. The last few chapters felt like a whirl compared to the vivid and disturbing descriptions of surgical procedures and how Arty gets away with extreme physical/emotional sadism, even upon his family. I felt like the author got too carried away with this portion of the book and perhaps thought up of this section first then after tacked together other parts of the book.Lastly, I find this book somewhat misogynist in a few ways. First, the mother (Lil) is so blindly devoted to her husband (Al) that she willingly deforms her children and in the end, herself, for the sake of his profession (if you can call it that). Second, Oly is the meek, subservient, girl who would do anything for Arty, despite how disgusting and ugly he is to her and to everyone else. Third, almost all the women depicted in this book are prostitutes who have no self-esteem or knowledge that there is more to them than their bodies (the twins, Miranda, the \\"saved\\" women all fall into this depiction). The third point I made is somewhat mitigated by the present day plot line of that jealous woman, who then again doesn't depict a positive portrayal of women who should be comfortable with themselves and other people).All in all, this book despite the extreme shock and grimace factor does not deserve quite the amount of praise I've been reading. It is no different than watching the Saw films for its shock factor. I don't believe this book offers much \\"depth\\" of discussion that would warrant what you can find in current news today, history, or in plain horror films/novels. It offers the same \\"oh gross ugh\\" grimace-y feeling you would have watching Saw."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"After the first chapter of \\"Geek Love,\\" I almost put it down because it was too weird. From the beginning it makes you wrap your mind around the fact that parents were willing to make their children freaks for their own economic gain and those children love being freaks. This book continually to demands you come to terms with a different set of emotional guidelines, to empathesize with horrors. However, I could not put it down. It is an exceptionally well-written melodrama where no event is too out of the ordinary to occur. It holds your attention to the last page, but if I did have one critique it would be that the climax is too easy after the complex tale Dunn weaves. I recommend it highly to anyone looking for something different."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"i loved this book. as a writer i often found myself jealous of the way in which ms. dunn turns a phrase. as a reader i was completely consumed by this other world. the children of the binewski fabulon live in an enclosed world where the \\"norms\\" as they refer to the general public don't have much influence over their moral compass or ideals. this can be good for some but in the case of this family, all of thier inbread strangness and poison riddled genetics has terrible effects on the psyche of all involved.however i often found myself wondering about the characters who entered the situation and played along in the insanity. my only conclusion was that arty -- and really the whole carnie life -- was so powerful it sucked others into its reality. arty's meglomania completly consumes the will of all those around him and you find yourself hating him for being this way and angry with the family for enabling him. you have no choice but to get emotionally invested in these characters and they will live in your mind long after the book is done."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"Katherine Dunn has chosen her narrator well. Oly, the hunchbacked albino dwarf daughter of a carnival huckster, has inherited her father's gift for gab and delivers the story with a swaggering, teasing style that draws you ever deeper into the darkness of her tale. There are really two stories being told here. The most important story is the tale of the Binewski's, the carnival family comprised of freaks, and the way the tightly knit family is slowly torn apart my the meglomania of one of the siblings, Arturo the Aqua Boy. Sibling rivalry is never more ugly as Arturo competes with his siamese twin sister Elly and Iphy to be the star attraction of the carnival. Not content with achieving superstar status and being worshipped by his fans, Arturo subjects Elly and Iphy to horrors I won't describe here, but which are about as vile as any villiany I've ever seen in any book. It's gripping in its awfulness, but there are times when I had difficulty believing anyone would go along with his terrible plans. The mother and father of the freaks, who start off as strong characters, become weak puppets in Arturo's scheme, and I'm never exactly sure why.There is a secondary, framing story regarding the dwarf in the present day trying to save her daughter from the schemes of a rich woman who gets her kicks by mutilating women. It's okay, but not as compelling as the carnival story arc. When Arturo and the Twin's story ended, I lost interest in the three chapters that follow to wrap up the present day framing story. The ending was deeply unsatisfying to me. I thought for a moment the story would have a twist ending, but it ends very predictably, and, I thought, pointlessly.Still, the power of the writing, the energy and daring, make this book well worth investing time in."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"Geek Love is one of the few books that has simultaneously satisfied my taste for intelligent writing and all things twisted.

Enough said."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"Truly one of the best, I recommend it to anyone and everyone."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"Everyone here and at rec.arts.books seems to love this book. I feel it had no redeeming value at all. It is without doubt the most worthless piece of crap that I have read in years. And you people who liked it worry me a little! 8) I know this is not the type of review wanted here, but it is more than this book merits."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"I almost never stop reading a book, but I had to with this one. There was no redeeming value, just one horrible character and situation after another. When the body parts starting coming off to appease one repellant character, I decided there was no reason to continue reading. If it hadn't been the book group choice of the month, I would have quit it sooner. It is now famous as the only book (in the over ten years of books) that I couldn't stand enough to finish."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"This is the worst book I have ever read. I didn't even want it my house after reading it; a friend and I actually had a burning party to celebrate it's demise. I see no reason for the content. Ugly and horrifying."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"I had to read this book for a class. So I read the book from beginning to end and I am surprised at the amount of critical acclaim it has received. The author relies heavily on shock tactics to gather your attention, which is not only insulting to the reader but the tactic is also completely disgusting (think maggot farms and lots of references to bowel movements). This makes entire chapters of the book completely unnecessary, making the reader wonder...why is this even important; why should I care? \\"Geek Love\\" is completely predictable and the characters, particularly Arty, are irritating at best. A redeeming factor to the book is that there are moments when the descriptions of the terrain or the family interactions are quite poetic. Dunn, at times, has a unique style of describing events and landscapes. But this is usually disrupted by a yet another shock tactic, which just ruined the novel for me. I understand why some people like it so much, but why on earth is this book a National Book Award Finalist? The author's style of writing reminds me heavily of Chuck Palahniuk or Irvine Welsh. So if you like these two authors, then \\"Geek Love\\" is the book for you. If not, then avoid this book if possible."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"This is the single worst book I have ever read in my life. It tries sooooo hard to be hip and cutting-edge but the writing is atrocious, the 'story' is duller than dishwater. One of those books people pretend to like because they think it's cool."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"I am a college student who had to read this book for an contemporary American literature class. Geek Love is a very likeable book; Dunn features fascinating characters, intriguing dialogue, and events that will make you stop and think. The problem is this: the book is just not fun to read. This book is written for psuedo-intellectuals who have lots of time on their hands. Since I don't belong to this group, I found the book as exhiliarating as throwing myself at a wall of concrete. No, I never finished the book (I think I was at page 150 when the quiz hit), but it wasn't a disappointment to hear all the characters die at the end. Oh well. Bring on the next book."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"Geek Love is disturbing, sickening and repulsive. It is the only book I recall making me feel ill and I read voraciously.

I regret purchasing the book and would give it away but don't think that I should inflict it on others."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"I picked this book up hoping it would be clever and unusual...but it ended up being a superficial cesspool masquerading as &quot;art&quot;."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"And most of all INTERESTING. Following a moderately slow buildup, this book is a freight train as the rising action ends. Gorgeous writing, vivid and original. It trumps it's premise, which is fantastic. How many books live up to their promise? K. Dunn's on par with Rushdie and Gabriel Marquez. An important American Writer."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"How far would you go to pursue a dream and how fair is it to drag your children with you? That is the basic, bottom line of this book. Parents deal with this all the time without even thinking about it.Weird, yes. Disturbing, yes. But can you see beyond that? If you can, you will remember this book for the rest of your life."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"This story is so sad, and so well-written. It's not the freakish nature of the characters that breaks your heart, it's the way they are just like you & me. What kid hasn't grown up to the harsh facts of reality, watching their parents go from godlike perfect beings to vulnerable, diminished human beings? Who hasn't felt the humiliation of watching a parent be defeated by a run-in with some petty authority?The relationships between the siblings (aside from the incest, maybe) are just the same as those of any bunch of kids; there are jealousies, there are fistfights, there is a fierce love that rings so true for me. You may beat the stuffing out of your sibling, say you hate them, try to kill them, but heaven help the outsider who tries to do the same.Finally, we come to the mother love--the generations of Lil, Oly, and Miranda. Each mother & daughter relationship is so different, but has some threads in common.I have read & re-read this book several times. Each time I identify with a different character, depending on where I am in my own life. This book talks about the human condition. Well written, gorgeous words."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"but I didn't. I got the point, and I think the premise was ingenious, but it was such a wierd and twisted story about dull, self-indulgent, and mean-spirited characters (Oly excepted, mostly) that I just couldn't make myself care about it. I'm no stranger to either the wierd or twisted, but there just wasn't much to like in &quot;Geek Love&quot;.Unlike my book group, which hated this book so much that not only didn't read it, they didn't even show up to complain about it (most unlike them), I found it compelling enough to finish. I kept hoping for a flash of wisdom or true beauty, but Dunn didn't deliver.Maybe my expectations were too high. I was sort of hoping that this would be another &quot;Ballad of the Sad Cafe&quot; and it so wasn't."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"This book disoriented me while I was reading it, because it's one of those novels that gets under your skin. You know, you look up from reading and almost expect to see the characters standing in front of you. You have dreams which feature the characters or landscapes of the story. You think about reading it when you're doing something else.That feeling in Dunn's novel is due largely to her matter-of-fact treatment of her fantastical circus family. There is a solidity to these genetic abnormanlities (to say the least!) that is manifested through their behavior and their interactions with others. In the topsy-turvy, insulated world of this family circus, Arturo, a fish-boy, can become a power player, and it is no big deal.The solid, even treatment of the characters is just one of the strengths of this novel. Interesting in every way, it chronicles the life of a freaskish protagonist who laments her lack of &quot;specialness&quot; -- she just isn't weird enough, and feels a whole different kind of body image angst. The books moves at a nice pace through her childhood and into her questioning teen years, and she struggles with the normal things -- only she is very different herself.The book can be a bit graphic to the particularly imaginative, but in a really weird, poignant way, and you have already become so invested in the personalities that it seems necessary. It can be harsh and make you uncomfortable, but in a way which is absolutely enchanting.As you read, you will find yourself surprised...by the funny, warm narrative, as well as by the fact that you will accept the utter strangeness as normal by the time you're 30 pages into it.This book is excellent...it's a fairy tale with character development, and it's sad and funny at the same time. A must-read for misfits and wanna-be rebels of all kinds."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"This book was right up my alley.... freaks, geeks, carnies, and twisted people. I was enthralled with it from the beginning, shocked at the audacity of the writer to play the story out like she had, then somewhere about 2/3 into the book it seemed like she grew bored and just tied up the loose ends. I love the characters and will cherish the first half but it seems like Katherine did like Arturo's followers and just &#34;cut off&#34; too much."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"I somehow managed to finish this book after about 2 months of making myself pick it up. It wasn't very interesting, it moved very slow, I could see the \\"twists and turns\\" coming from a mile away, and I almost threw the book across the room at the end. Stupid ending. I'm not a professional book reviewer so I don't have fancy words to describe it...so my average reader comments are \\"bla, boring, would not suggest\\"."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"I have been recommended this book for the past several years and finally got around to reading it. Like others have stated, I did not really feel connected to the characters either because they were truly evil or because they had no spines, both had no real redeeming qualities. It was a very interesting concept but I thought the execution was flawed. I think this is a love it or hate book, plain and simple."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"This book was so disturbing! When I initially heard about this book, I was intrigued. A woman who takes drugs during her pregnancies in order to have \\"freak\\" children for their traveling carnival act. I did not know to what degree the author would go to show how twisted their family was. I wish that I could undo the reading of this book so that I didn't have the memories in my head!"},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"Sooo weird. A couple that owns and runs a traveling circus/carnival decide that if you are your own attraction you will always be marketable. With this in mind they go about creating their own \\"attractions\\" though the use of various drug cocktails. The living results are aqua boy, conjoined twins, an albino dwarf and a disappointingly normal looking son with unique powers. Surprisingly this is probably the most normal part of the story which includes one of the strangest cults ever."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"&quot;Geek Love&quot; by Katherine Dunn is one of those books that exists in a world of its own. It invites you in with the turn of the first page and kicks you out with the turn of the last leaving you depressed and betrayed and wanting more. But in a good way. The smells and sounds and sights and sensations of Dunn's mythical world are captivating and scintillating and peculiarly grotesque and obscene and above all shocking!!! Just when you think it's gone as far as it can go, it literally drags further!!!!! The main character and narrator of the tale, Olympia Binewski, is an albino hunchback dwarf who in the company of her siblings is considered TOO NORMAL. Her fish-finned torso brother and Siamese twin sisters are the money making acts of the Binewski family's traveling Carnival Fabulon. The freaky geeks are products of their parent's experimental drug influenced pregnancies, the mother ingesting ridiculously toxic concoctions in hopes of mutating her children so they can become contributing members of the circus family. Didn't I say shocking?!!? But it's not the warped weirdness of this book that leaves you yearning to escape your normal life and live within its pages; it's Dunn's potent words of wisdom and chilling commentary on life's miseries spoken through Olympia Binewski who you grow to love and miss once you've inhaled the book in two sittings."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"One of those books that you keep telling yourself &quot;one more chapter and i'll go to bed&quot;, but stay up half the night reading from cover to cover. Seriously disturbing, enlightening, humorous, perverse and moving....an overall creatively alluring experience. One of the most amazing reading experiences of my life."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"I wanted to like this book a lot more than I did. It seemingly has many of the elements I look for in fiction: strong plot, absorbing characters, shocking horror and vivid descriptions of evil and debautchery. I love that sort of thing. I find many reviews here criticizing books for their darkness, for their lack of a neat, tidy, packaged, tacked on happy ending so the reader can go away feeling all is right in the world. This form of insipidness is frustrating because it narrows the scope of so many people, forcing them to shun something most likely better and more lasting than whatever cheery nonesense they snuggle up with an hour before bedtime, sucking all veracity from their dreams and trapping them in a schizophenic, skipping record of the same unrealistic thing over and over and over again. Of course Geek Love isn't especially realistic. But, within the context of the story, with a fully heightened suspension of disbelief we settle into taking for granted that someone has telekinetic powers, that someone has developed mental domination abilities, that everyone is schemeing and out to get everyone else and the weak or the kind-hearted are destined for misery. Stripping away the actions, the motivations are very real and the pain suffered by everyone should strike chords with anyone who's ever lived in a family. The main problem, however, is that Ms. Dunn just isn't a very good writer. Oh, she can tell a story pretty well and make it original and unique, but she has a self-indulgent inclination to go off on these philosophical passages, superficially in the narrator's voice, and muddle them up on top of that. These passages, usually taking up the first few paragraphs of a new chapter, are just horrible. Nonesensical gibberish, flowing like a rusty old garden hose with so many holes poked in it hardly anything trickles out the proper end. Perhaps Ms. Dunn felt she was being lyrical, felt there needed to be some superfluous explaination of the narrator's feelings after relating a particularly awful event, but these brief passages make no sense in the long run, with feux-beutific lines and rambling mish-mosh prose. I liked the book, but at times I got so annoyed with this presumption, I considered setting it aside, possibly to wrap up and give to one of my more pretentious friends who looks for deep meaning in every petty thing."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"Be prepared for the most bizarre read..but anyone who likes the unusual, the weird or strange will love it. I personally have always been fascinated with carnies and the freaks....Have read it twice and will do so again.A great read, you'll love or hate it....no middle ground."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"_Geek Love_ is a must-read for anyone who loves daring 20th century fiction. Although the subject matter, a family of carnival-freak children, is an odd one at best, the book covers themes that will strike a resonant chord in virtually all readers. Be prepared to get food for thought on diverse questions such as &quot;Just what is 'normal' anyway?&quot; and &quot;How do those weird religions get started?&quot; Katherine Dunn's _Geek Love_ is original, entertaining, and powerful, a book that will be enjoyed by new readers for decades to come."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"Geek Love is the only book I've started all over again the moment I was done.

Now!"},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"I really liked the freaks in this book. There was something that made talking about it ok, where usually we do not talk about people's deformities, physical or mental. These people are very normal. So are we when we are done. Really a good read. Comforting."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"All I have to say is W-O-W. I saw the title of this book in Freak Like Me by Jim Rose, and picked up a copy of it to read on vacation. The first thing you must understand if you choose to read this book- it will be nothing like you have ever read. Filled with very interesting characters and subplots, this book just screams unique and is one of the bare essentials for a good collection of books."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"Uniquely special and wonderful. Horrific, grotesque and yet weirdly warm and touching. The shock value pulled me in, as my mother's medical books did when I was a kid. (Turn the page, scream! Turn the page, scream!) But it was the complex characters that kept me reading and challenged my opinion of societal &quot;norms.&quot; I read this book a number of years ago, and have since bought it 10 times for various friends. It is the only book that I have read more than once. I heard that Gus Van Saint was considering directing a movie version on the book. That would be fabulous."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"I read this book four years ago and it still creeps up on me at random moments. I loved it, I normally read classics and while this was nothing like anything I have ever read, I recommend it to the world. Great buy!"},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"Katherine Dunn's the reason why I'm not a writer. Don't get me wrong, I wanted to be a writer. I was in a 'writer's group', and had this great idea about a short story involving a circus geek/midget, married to the fat-lady...oh, it had possibilities.Until, during my research i read 'Geek love'. And I realized my story had been done. By someone much more talented than me. By someone with a voice and imagination that left me stunned and depressed for weeks, and enamored of her talent for a lifetime.I now collect her work, and will pay top dollar for any original copies. On subject: this book is amazing off subject: katherine, please answer my calls, i only want to ask you one question."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"This book is truly and spectactularly engrossing. I was unable to put it down, and was forced to guzzle multiple cups of dark and overwarmed coffee at work from lack of sleep over the three days it took me to finish this book (yes, I did manage to get a few quality hours of sleep in the middle). Dark and completely unlike anything you have ever written, you will be confounded and shocked and moved in ways you hadn't imagined until picking up this book. Dunn has a truly lyrical style that makes it a pleasure to read.There were a few times when my discomfort level was so high, I nearly stopped reading, so let that be known before you recommend to any friends. This is not for the mainstream Nicholas Sparks crowd. They will wonder why you ever recommended such a book, and you will be dissappointed that your friends aren't able to appreciate such a rare jewel. Keep this one to yourself, and enjoy. Don't say I didn't warn you! You won't be able to put it down."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"I was captivated by this tale of a family of carnival freaks, and pretty soon into it, you are overwhelmed by the world of Aqua Boy, the Siamese twins, the hunchback drawf, a maggot farm, and others. Everyone in this novel is a freak in some way, and it's the \\"norms\\" who are boring and uninteresting. One character comments that they only way you can tell the poor norms apart is by their clothing!This is a dark book. Aqua Boy really would follow throw on his threat to kill any siblings who become more popular than him. People really do maim themselves in the name of a cult following. Yet it wasn't a depressing book, nor did I want to turn away in horror. I wanted to learn more, to watch these people tick, to see the family that was formed by the blood-relative Biniewskis and their fellow performers and followers in the Carnival Fabulon.This book is highly recommended. Read a few pages and you'll be hooked, wanting to learn more about these incredible people."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"I loved this book. It is full of well developed characters and a crazy plot. If you love fiction that is different from the norm you will love it as well. It is definitly not for everyone. But, once you get into it the strangeness of it all, you begin to relate to the characters."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"Katherine Dunn's Geek Love is the strange story of a family of carnival freaks and the outrageous events that shaped their lives. Or at least that is what it seems to be at a glance. But within this incredibly odd package is a notably complex take on a fairly commonplace issue. The slimy innards of Geek Love paint a portrait of the American beauty standard, from its corporate origins to its suburban realization, but flipped completely upside down. The \\"ugly\\" (the freaks) being the picture of beauty, and the \\"beautiful\\" or \\"average\\" looking (the norms) being at least boring and often repulsive. The story is told from the perspective of Olympia Bineswski (or Oly, for short), the second youngest of five children in the carnival family. Mom (\\"Crystal\\" Lil Binewski) and dad (Al Binewski) run the carnival (in the beginning anyway), but they are not freaks, they are \\"norms\\" (the books term for non-freaks). But the pair set out to have unique and beautiful children that will thrive in a carnival atmosphere. Or, in other words, Lil takes various drugs and the like in order to cause deformities in their children, making them freaks. And, needless to say, their unorthodox methods of pre-nandal care do, indeed, cause their children to be freaks, including(in order of birth) a boy with flippers for limbs (Arty), Siamese Twins (Elly and Iphy), an albino, hunchback, dwarf girl (Oly, our narrator) and a boy with seemingly boundless telekinetic powers (Fortunato or The Chick). There are also several miscarriages, which are kept in jars and displayed in one of the carnival trailers.Now, I think it is a good time to mention that this book may not be as enjoyable for those to whom moral flexibility does not come so easily. Much of the dramatization in this novel most certainly goes against traditional, American morals, and its statement about the beauty standard is decidedly non-traditional as well. But for those who can endure the culture shock, I found that this book makes an eloquently moral point about beauty and self worth.I found this message to be one of pride in one's own personal beauty, no matter where it may fall on a beauty standard. But there are definitely some inconsistencies, and the end is puzzling (to say the least) and, I thought, a bit of a letdown. Geek Love has an inherent message about beauty though, and it is communicated throughout, by means subtle and blunt.Overall, I thought that it was an entertaining story, masterfully woven with the threads of symbolism around a compelling theme. It definitely faltered here and there, but the deviations were not major enough to throw me completely out of the book. So, if you are looking for a take on beauty that is miles from Cosmo, check out Geek Love."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"After finally putting this book down, I found myself trying to analyze why it left me cold. It was definitely compelling to read about the alternate reality of the Binewski family, and about the love that held them together. I appreciated the way Katherine Dunn transforms what to the &quot;normal&quot; world would be hideous into something fanciful and beautiful. However, my fascination with her surreal, magical world soon tapered off into boredom as the book dragged on and on with Arturo and his cult. Yes, the characters are unforgettable, but I thought they were one-dimensional, and ultimately I didn't really care about them (even Oly got tiresome with her blind devotion to Arty). A much better book with a somewhat similar theme is Stones From the River--it also has a physically deformed narrator on the fringes of society, but she is a fully fleshed-out character and makes us truly empathize with her. With Dunn's freaks, we find ourselves watching them with morbid fascination and sometimes affection, but we are always on the other side of the glass. In the end, Geek Love was an engrossing read but it did not move me."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"Geek Love is a once in a lifetime book for sure. It is the story of the Binewskis, a carnival family who started from modest means and grew to a dangerous, cult like status. The characters are well developed and give good insight to an &#34;us against them&#34; mentality, only from the &#34;them&#34; point of view.This book is not necessarily for the faint of heart, but, if you enjoy an incredibly interesting and unique story you should get this book."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"I am only 70% into this novel and I feel it necessary to rate it on that 70% as I may not finish. The beginning and some of the middleof story are interesting and somewhat kept my interest up. The more I read though, the more ridiculous and tedious the reading became. I love novels about carnivals and circuses and the good reviews and the subject matter really attracted me to this one. However, it was just too unbelievable and actually cruel, grotesque, sickening, and disturbing. Not to mention that it seems to just go on and on forever. Maybe if it had been shortened by about 100 pages, it would have helped a bit. For me, not only are the characters unbelievable, but not one of them is likeable. I couldn't like or sympathize with any of them, so I lost interest. When I hit the 70% mark on my Kindle, I came back to Amazon to read reviews again as I thought I must be missing something. One of the 1st reviews I read kind of \\"spoiled\\" the remaining 30% of the story for me, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. I can quit reading it now as most of my questions are answered. Pretty much a waste of time."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"One of my favorite novels to promote to fellow circus-lovers of all time. (Yes, there are more than 6 books on this very focused list.) How can you not love a story that has a chick with a tail in the first 25 pages? Also, I've bought it at least 4 times, because you know how it goes when you lend a friend a book."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"This one is very disturbing! Very well written, I can understand the award nominations, but hard to take if things like child abuse and incest gross you out. You definitely have to be prepared for the atrocities you read in this book."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"Geek Love is such an original work. It can't really compare it to anything else I have read. Others have outlined the outrageous story line here, so I don't feel the need to go into that. GL is one of the most challenging books I have ever read as far as just getting through it. I really had to struggle to complete it (and, honestly, I probably wouldn't have but my book club is reading it). The prose is brilliant, horrifying and hysterical. The down side? For me, I grew so accustomed to the gross-out freak factor that ultimately, I was pretty bored. I wanted more about Olympia and her pig-tailed daughter. I grew tired of the endless family drama scenes. Every book has to have its villain, right? But Arturo, the older controlling brother wore me out with his pseudo guru teachings. And Dunn really didn't have a good way of killing her characters off. There are many deaths in this book, but only one moved me (and I don't want to spoil anything for those intending to read it). I suppose that if one is into the most offbeat novel they can find then look no further. My fence-sitting on this book is because I can see how people could argue that this is a masterwork and how others could argue that it's a piece of trash. Both points are valid. But for me, ultimately, I was bored and wanting to get to something easier, more fun to read and more insightful than this offering gave me. And, I would not feel compelled to read any more from this author."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"This book was like nothing I have ever read, although I can appreciate the comparisons to John Irving. This book was darker and gorier than an Irving novel, although the quirky character development is similar. I thoroughly enjoyed how the emotional aspects of these circus freak characters were developed and explored well enough to make one overlook their &quot;mutant-ness,&quot; and read the story as a tale of morality involving average, boring people like those seen on the news each day. However, despite its ability to do that, Geek Love also took pains to emphasize the clearly unnatural (and supernatural) quality of its characters, especially in view of the pride the Binewski family took in its members' uniqueness.What an original idea, too! A family creates freaks for its circus sideshow by exposing its birthmother to carcinogens and teratogens, because it is too poor to obtain them through more conventional means of purchase or paying wages. The subplot (or &quot;coplot&quot;, if you will) involves the main character's attempts to secretly preserve her daughter's uniqueness against a sadist who wishes to disfigure her for pleasure. Wow.This book could easily have lent itself to a commentary on racism, although I feel it resisted the urge, thus not muddying the storyline or coming across as too preachy in the process. The main character and storyteller Oly shared her thoughts about, and fears of, the norms, as well as her satisfaction at possessing features not shared by the norm community. Artie certainly exploited the norms, eliciting them to become as he was, in what became a bizarre and gruesome undercurrent within Geek Love; however, I viewed the description of his Arturism as more an editorial on religion (and blind adherence to all its ugly forms) than on cultural and racial differences.Geek Love's attention to detail was marvelous. By the time the characters reached their ultimate incarnations, you could see how they'd gotten there by reading about their past. Their development was logical, though not quite predictable. In particular, Arty's rise from jealous showboat to evil cult hero was exciting and well-advanced. My only problem with the book was the anger it elicited by never giving the bad guys their comeuppance, and by never rewarding the loyal family members (and saints, really) such as Oly and Chick."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"Much like its subject matter, the side show &quot;freak&quot;, this book can be ugly and disturbing, but it is impossible to turn away. Told from the viewpoint of the bald, Albino, hunchback dwarf daughter of a mother who deliberately took drugs and chemicals to give birth to freaks for the family carnival. They have a son with flippers, and daughters who are Siamese twins, and a seemingly normal son who has telekinesis. Katherine Dunn's imagination is frightening. The story runs the gamut from gratuitous violence to incest to rape and murder. I could not wait to finish the book, but once I did, I never wanted to read it again. I was disturbed, confused, intrigued. There are some gaping holes in the story, you have to suspend disbelief, and the current story about the woman who disfigures women with battery acid is downright chilling. But, it certainly captures your interest. It is unique, and I, personally, had seen nothing of its type before. It's difficult for me to say whether I recommended it. I can only say proceed with caution; it is engrossing and also terribly un-nerving."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"Geek Love is a powerful reading experience. I read this book last year and I still can't stop thinking about it. The images from this book are strong and provocative, something you can't forget. Just by reading the first sentence of the synopsis, parents who create their own freak show, you know that you are in for a wild and insane ride.Ms. Dunn created a unique and disturbing menagerie of characters with the story told from the perspective of the albino dwarf, Oly. She tells of her life before and after her carny life was destroyed. Oly never considers herself a successful member of her family; but she clung to her life in the carny world. Her life revolves around her more powerful siblings. She is their caretaker and follower. She is stuck in the middle of a deadly sibling conflict.Throughout the book, Oly takes us through all the dynamics that surround her disconcerting family. The constant battles of family supremacy continue to put Oly in the middle and she must pick sides, with the sides ever-changing. Her present consists of constantly keeping vigil over her daughter. Oly's raging emotions concerning her daughter, Miranda, are at the same time vicious and somewhat motherly. Oly's character makes you feel many things: horror, revulsion, and sympathy.Arturo, the Aquaboy, is the main attraction at the Binewski carnival. He is totally dependent on his family for his basic needs; but he rules over them with a tyrannical fist. He constantly feels threatened, especially by his sisters, Iphy and Elly. They are in constant battle on who is the main carnival attraction. Their parents, Al and Crystal, let their creations take over, rule and ultimately destroy their family. Furthermore, Arturo has a fanatical following that eventually turns into a cult. He preaches that the only way to \\"Peace, Isolation, Purity\\" was to become like him. He is able convince his followers to have their extremities amputated to feel isolated and helpless, which feeds Arturo's megalomaniacal needs. He is truly a diabolical character.Then there is Chick...the little innocent and dangerous boy who brings destruction to them all. All Chick wants is for his family to be happy. However, h e is the one who brings a brutal finality to this tragic sibling rivalry.I found this book to be an amazing read. It is disturbing but intriguing. You will not be able to put it down. Be careful not to read it before you go to sleep because you will have some serious funky dreams.

But year in and year out since then, when I have tolist my 5 favorite books, this always seems to made the list.The lasting effects of this book,the beauty of the protagonist and the sadness has always permeated my soul.This unconventional family,to say the least, is one of the most well rounded and true forms of how a single family member can be affected forthe rest of their life.I highly recommend this book. It will really put you in a special group of people who really have such a fondness for this tome."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"I found this book to be the most perverse, repulsive and twisted fiction I have ever read. Yet, it was the most compelling and addictive book I have EVER read. Katherine Dunn has a talent for seeking out the more horrid depths of one's mind and with colorful eloquence delivers it on a silver platter. I would highly recommend this entertaining book to anyone yearning for the most absurd characters of the human race. Honestly, as perverse as this book is... I couldn't put it down for a moment....yes, I confess...I absolutely loved it... But, I love the perverse side of human nature (?) anyway..... Read it!"},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"Step right up, ladies and gents, boys and girls! Enter the magical, mystifying, miraculous world of fantastical freaks and gruesome geeks- people, creatures, whose imperfections are not hidden within the caverns of the mind but are displayed in their daily countenance, in the bend of their beastly bodies. Open your eyes and your minds to the Geek Love of the Binewskis.Katherine Dunn presents the members of the Binewski family on the first page as a starling satire of the \\"nuclear family.\\" The mother and father with children sitting at their feet are actually parents who have used radioactive substances to turn their children into \\"freaks:\\" Siamese twins, an armless, legless boy, and an albino midget. Already, Dunn produces a grotesque and vivid scene for the reader. The author winds a path through both present and past. In the present, Olympia Binewski is now Olympia McGurk and lives alone in an apartment, anonymously watching her daughter, Miranda, tolerating her mother and working at a radio station. Oly is drawn into Miranda's life when she is asked to pose for her medical drawings and discovers that Miss Lick, a shady disciple of Arty's, wants her to remove her tail (the only legacy of the Binewskis that Miranda has). The main goal of Oly in the present is to prevent this by killing Miss Lick. In the past sections, the Binewski family is the central focus: the fall of Al and the rise of Arty, Oly's own needs for love and belonging, Iphy and Elly's power plays with Arty, the role of Chick, the seemingly perfect and yet most bizarre Binewski, and their relationships. To me, the themes appeared to center around the roles of power in love and the nature of healthy vs. unhealthy love.In several interviews, Dunn has said that the concept of cults weighed heavily on her mind throughout the writing of this novel, especially in light of the Jonestown Massacre. This theme is readily apparent in the \\"Peace, Isolation, and Purity\\" followers (PIPs) of Arty. Looking at the actions of the followers and the commands of Arty, it is clear that Dunn has produced an intriguing and well thought out case study. However, Arty's cult is in no way the most interesting part of the novel dramatically or thematically. Reading the book, I found myself drawn to other themes centering on power relationships within the familial relationships more than a look at cults in general. Though the idea of power and love are a part of cults and the nature of the PIPs, the majority of this theme seemed centered around the Binewski family relationships. Dunn skillfully spins the relationships of Oly and Arty, Arty and Iphy, Iphy and Elly, and so on, cultivating a solid framework for this theme.Many of her dramatic choices seem to serve merely to shock the reader, rather than evoke a thematic idea. For example, the Chute, which is an exhibit of the Binewski children too freakish to survive, seems to be there for extra characterization of Lily or further evidence that the Binewskis are a perversion of the concept of the nuclear family. Geek Love, a strange and mystical journey, takes the reader into Katherine Dunn's freakshow of power and control. The most frightening parts of this book are not the Chute, with Maple, Fist, and Leona waiting for the next ticket-holder, or the fantabulous Ask Arturo. The scariest aspect is that relationships and power structures function just as in the book as they do daily in the real world. Katherine Dunn recognizes that cult leaders, fanatical religious leaders, community leaders, and anyone else who has been put in a position of power is in a very delicate spot. However, Dunn may have been more successful with themes of power in personal relationships. This novel is certainly a vivid, continuous dream with interesting thematic concerns, which might have been better developed."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"I'm going to admit that I actually had no idea what Geek Love was all about. I had heard the hype, and had a vague idea that it was chick lit for dot-commers. No interest. I was actually irritated when a friend gave the book to me as a gift.Much to my bemusement, I discovered that Dunn was writing about literal geeks-- circus freaks-- live performers who made a living swallowing wild animals and bugs for an audience. That was much more interesting for me. I have had a long and lively interest in the culture of the circus and the role of freaks in the world.Geek Love is very well written, in terms of general prose style. I found myself reading it compulsively. There is a lot of humor and warmth in the way that Dunn confounds our ideas of a loving approach to conception and child bearing. It can get pretty grotesque. It never, for me, crossed the line from grotesque into grotty. That kept it readable.It wasn't a perfect novel. All the character traits and pyrotechnics nearly served to keep me from noticing that Dunn had trouble with the plot. The first half (two thirds?) are set up very well, but the story fizzled a bit in the last third. I had the feeling that she had painted herself into a corner and had to wind things up somehow so that we could get the resolution between Miranda and Olympia. There were several big shortcuts toward the end that I found disappointing-- particularly regarding Arty.In any case, I enjoyed the book. I am likely to look out for more Dunn in the future. I liked what I read in the autobiographical afterward that was included in the 1990 edition. I would recommend Geek Love for someone who is looking for a pretty strange example of a feel-good novel. If you liked Geek Love, then I would actually recommend seeing if you could get a hold of a copy ofFreaks: We Who Are Not As Othersby Daniel P. Mannix. It should make an interesting counterpoint."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"One of the best novels I've ever read. I have purchased about 20 copies over the years to give as gifts. Everyone I've given it too feels the same way. It ends up on our top 10 best novels of all time list. Quirky but emotional, you become deeply attached to the characters and their richly emotional world. Buy it, read it, you will not be sorry."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"Geek Love is nothing less than brilliant. This novel takes the reader on an amazing journey that should leave one feeling complelled to redefine any previous concepts of what \\"normal\\" is. Within these pages, the lines between beautiful and grotesque, dark and light, funny and tragic,and love and hate are utterly blurred. At parts, one must truly question who the REAL \\"freaks\\" are- the perfomers or the spectators? Admittedly, this novel will NOT be to the taste of all readers. If you decide to read it,(and I really hope you do) please enter the world within these pages with an open mind, shedding any preconceived notions of what NORMAL is. Leave your judgement at the door and let your mind be flexible and open. I think that there is much to be learned from this story if you dare to enter its surreal world. Kudos to Katherine Dunn! BRAVA! And also, thank you for this awesome story. Here's hoping you will be writing many more novels!

I must have recommended it to a friend and lent it out, only to never have it returned (surprise?). Although I couldn't remember the title, I've spent considerable time combing bookstore shelves trying to find it again, and part of the reason I couldn't find it was because the original green cover of the paperback version has been updated. Tonight I decided to check the web and I was thrilled to see that it is still in print. I'm ordering a second copy, of which I will NOT loan to anyone.

I have had this book for over 10 years and am not sure why I decided to read it now. I am so disappointed. It is not well-organized, the narrative bounces around too much, ALL of the characters are horrible and completely unlikeable.

I would not recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"I read this book because it was chosen by my book club. After hearing so many great reviews about this book I could hardly wait to get started reading it. Unfortunately, after finishing the book, I was extremely disappointed in its lack of purpose and meaningful statement - what ever point this author was attempting to make totally escaped me. After reading this book I am only left with an empty feeling of what this author could have done with such a highly imaginative story line and creative characterizations. Yes, it's true, Dunn did come up with a great idea for a story and she created some fascinating characters - my problem is - I just don't see that she used her creative imagination well enough to develop a true sense of story that communicated a message to me as a reader. I'm still pondering what the heck, if anything, was she trying to say? I was even hoping to get a clue from some of the customer reviews posted on this site. Unfortunately, all I hear are great recommendations due to the horrifying scenes and grotesqueness of the book. I'm still waiting to hear someone tell me what purpose it all served.I have no problem reading disturbing subjects and characters - but, I do expect there to be a reason and message behind the disturbance. I found no message to Dunn's story, other than the fact that she has attempted to do the same thing as her characters - capitalize on creating &quot;freaky&quot; and disgusting characters who serve no purpose other than fascinating readers simply because of their abnormalities.As I'm writing this review, it just occurred to me that perhaps the message is that if you like this book, then perhaps you are like one of the &quot;Norms&quot; in her book who would pay a pretty penny just to gawk and point at (or read about) carnival freaks."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"Once the reader gets past the initial shock value BEHIND the story, the novel is predictable and drags... if you cast Cheng and Eng, JoJo the Dog-Faced Boy, and \\"The Enigma\\" in a VC Andrews novel, you'd end up with this drivel."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"Turnaround and the quality (and price!) of this offering on a used book was perfect in every way.

Was there really a story to this book? Apart from following the Binewski's life, there was really only the Miranda plot, and it was quite sidelined, I thought. I must say, the characters were very interesting, and the absurdity and strangeness of it all kept me reading. I think that what makes this book worthwhile is the relationships between the family members. It was very complex that way, but on the whole, I have to say I have read better books, but certainly this one stands apart from the rest -- it is definately unlike anything I'm likely ever to read again. Not a waste of time, but it didn't amaze me, either."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"I would just like to thank Katherine Dunne for writing this book. This was one of the most touching, riveting, humorous, but sometimes sad books I've ever read. Dunne brought these characters to life with such delicacy that I almost felt like I was at the circus with them. This book really made me think about how narrow minded our society's idea of normal is. Normal isn't how you look. It is much more than that. This book made me realize that it is okay not to conform.

(We AIN'T talkin' tea cups!) The characters are so colorful, and dialogue so intrensic to their bizzar surroundings, one wonders if Geek Love was based on real-life-stories. Put your seats in the upright position, light the fireplace, grab your favorite blankie (you'll need it) and a hot toddy (you'll need that, too), and get prepared for the ride of your life with an unexpected twist at the end.

Through fiction, Dunn gives a reality to the Benewski family's strange circus life. The readers curioustiy can't refuse to take a peak into the side show tent.

If you've ever wanted to eat fire or hammer a nail in your nose, this is the book for you. I have seen Jim Rose's side show freaks, and while I am not old enough to have seen the last of the traveling carnivals (alas!), this book by Katherine Dunn captures the spirit of those days. The family is led by two parents, born and raised in the circus, who do amazing and horrifying things to their bodies in order to birth a family of side-show freaks. A tragedy of a &quot;norm&quot; results in them leaving the baby on a church doorstep. The writing by Katherine Dunn allows you to feel the disgust for norms, and almost makes you with you were a freak as well. Ms. Dunn is a very fine author"},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"If you're looking for writing that will stick to your ribs, this is the book. It's an engrossing and imaginative tale and if you can push your imagination to the demands of the text, it will stay with you forever. Some of the happenings are just that side of impossible, but if you can accept them as the truth of the text you'll find something haunting and beautiful in its own way. I've read this book several times, even more than that if you count all the times I thought it over, turning the topics around and around in my head. I do not, and would never, recommend this book for everyone. It is a very special tale for specific tastes. If you're a fan of real-world fantasy, horror, or carnival freak shows, I encourage this book strongly.Ollie, an albino hunchback dwarf, narrates the text as she tells the colorful tale of her family history, along with the present circumstances as she tries to preserve the only physical link her daughter holds to that history.Her sisters were Siamese twins joined throughout the torso, her brother had flippers for all four limbs, her younger brother, a telepath. They traveled the country in a circus, growing from children to young adults and watched their world come to an encouraging peak, only to crash to the ground with a ferocity they couldn't have imagined.If that piques your interest, then I recommend this book to you."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"I really wanted to like this more. The settings, the characters, the disturbing family life passed off as normalcy... I liked it all, but it all seemed to lead up to... well, not as much as it could have.

I picked it up because I've been reading a lot about apotemnophilia (individuals with this condition seek out voluntary amputation of limbs that they don't feel belong to their body) and I'd heard mention that this fictional work touched upon it. Indeed it does, peripherally, and the characters are brilliantly written, to the point where I found I missed them when the book was done.

Oly recalls life with her flipper-finned brother Arturo, her Siamese twin sisters, her telekinetic brother Chick, and a revolving cast of bizarre characters who travel along with the circus. It was a great premise, I adored Chick, I felt sympathy for Oly and her motives, and I felt egomaniacal Arty made a great villain. The one thing that didn't work for me was Oly's present-day side plot. I didn't feel the writing was as engaging during the few chapters that were interspersed with the Binewski family narrative and the ending didn't deliver any satisfaction. Overall, though, the book contained great language and imagery and it provided an interesting commentary on what it is to be normal."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"Hey, if Chuck Palahniuk recommends this book, then it has to be good...right?

I devoured this book and recommended to everyone I know. 19 years later, I still fondly recall this book and plan to memorialize my love for it in a rather large tattoo.

A sub-genre of these literary branches is the grotesque, which often combines comic and tragic circumstances in a juxtaposed fashion, each to highlight the other, for example, an amusing passage being used as a segue into one that is particularly violent.However, grotesquerie can also describe fiction showcasing characters plagued by deformity and mutation (think of two daughters of the South who perfected this type of fiction: Carson McCullers and Flannery O'Connor). Ms. Dunn provides a truly archetypal grotesque novel in GEEK LOVE. With the exception of the parents, the five Binewski offpsring are truly malformed. Their story, however, details how they use their physical oddities to their advantage, and how, in the end, their outward appearances have little to do with each character's development. Ironically, the two most horrifying persons in the novel aren't even among the Binewski Fabulon (the name of the family's roadshow) -- Dr. Phyllis, the surgeon who delights in mauling and deforming her [willing] patients, and Mary Lick, whose bizarre obsession with \\"uglifying\\" young women leads to her ultimate downfall.I have read this novel twice and enjoyed it even more in the second reading. My only regret is that this isn't a series of novels rather than a stand-alone book, as the tale of the Binewski clan is marvelously, grotesquely, and eternally compelling."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"This is definitely one of my all-time favorite books.

This book, Geek love, isn't for everyone. It's not a quick read on the beach, or even a quick listen in your car. You need to devote yourself, project yourself into it, and listen to its marvelous deviant family saga, with an open mind of course. This is a family with obvious deliberate outer mutations, but it's their twisted and topsy turvy insides that are the real sideshow attraction. I tried to summarize this book to someone, and I came off sounding like I was reading the equivalent of \\"Ripley's believe it or not meets Dean Koontz meets Judith Krantz meets a Physicians book of pediatric birth defects\\" I was recoiling with disgust, then curious, then joyous and understanding. I felt such love for Chick, and hatred for Arty, and knew exactly how Oly was feeling all at once. It's a book about self awareness, and family ties, and loyalty, but it's also a book about dangerous ambition and the fear of death. If you like to read or listen to books, that will consume you heart and soul until you finish them, than this is for you.The reader of this audio book is Christina Moore (who also read another fav of mine: Riding in Cars with Boys) Christina as Oly, the albino dwarf hunchback, is nothing short of brilliant. Having to put a voice to Siamese twins, circus folks, a fly wrangler, a boy with flippers, a telekinetic kid, and many many other voices she gives them all uniqueness and devotion. Her voice kind of reminds me of the actress Linda Hunt (year of living dangerously, kindergarten cop, dune).

There's nothing expected about the story, and that happens too rarely for me not to be grateful. Finally, I'd argue that the book is good literature. I personally don't agree that Dunn's writing is haphazard or needs editing -- her prose whined through my nerves, her images moving constantly before my eyes.All in all, I think this book meets the fate of anything that's not one hundred percent inoffensive: Some will always love it, and some will hate it.

It is not a coincidence that it's my wife who turned me on to the book -- both she and Katherine Dunn aren't from Kansas any more -- which tells you all you need to know about the desperate need some people have to break away from what they perceive as their stifling mid-America home and break through the looking glass. (Am I mixing metaphors -- Kansas/Oz and Alice in Wonderland?). But unlike my beautiful wife, Dunn freely admits in the afterword that she was a blue collar &quot;New World Mongrel&quot;, an ugly duckling nicknamed &quot;Froggie&quot; or &quot;Toad&quot;, as well as an odd duck from a family of misfits in a small Kansas town. She spent time behind bars for passing bad checks, and was the invisible &quot;story lady&quot; of the air on a Portland radio station, reading bizarre tales by Lewis Carroll, Harlan Ellison and Franz Kafka. She clearly paid big-time dues.This book is not for the faint of heart, or for the queasy. It's hard to stomach, and intentionally so. If Kafka's demons were of the mind, Dunn's are of the body. She pushes definitions of physical normalcy and weirdness to absolute extemes, daring you to come along for the uncomfortable yet fascinating ride. It's also a book written in 1983 by a graduate of the counterculture-ish Reed College in Oregon, so some think it embraces the 60s drug culture. But not so. Dunn disliked the hippies because they were conformists in their own way.Her topsy-turvy world has the ring of loneliness and truth, probably because she's not ashamed to admit that there's a lot of her in it. It's a Ripley's Believe it or Not that actually becomes believable because Dunn overcomes you with humor, empathy and horror all at once. Quite a journey, and very worth it if you can bear it. I rate it 5 stars not because it's flawless -- it isn't -- but because Dunn takes such a huge risk and pulls it off.

Why reinvent the wheel? The Amazon book description says:\\"Geek Love is the story of the Binewskis, a carny family whose mater- and paterfamilias set out-with the help of amphetamine, arsenic, and radioisotopes-to breed their own exhibit of human oddities. There's Arturo the Aquaboy, who has flippers for limbs and a megalomaniac ambition worthy of Genghis Khan . . . Iphy and Elly, the lissome Siamese twins . . . albino hunchback Oly, and the outwardly normal Chick, whose mysterious gifts make him the family's most precious-and dangerous-asset.As the Binewskis take their act across the backwaters of the U.S., inspiring fanatical devotion and murderous revulsion; as its members conduct their own Machiavellian version of sibling rivalry, Geek Love throws its sulfurous light on our notions of the freakish and the normal, the beautiful and the ugly, the holy and the obscene. Family values will never be the same.\\"My Review: Little Katie D,'s report card:Idea: A+Execution: C+Nutritional Value: D-While I, unlike some, adored [The Night Circus] in all its flawed glory, I thought this book was a bag of generic cheez puffs versus Morgenstern's home-made real-butter cheese straws.I must be hungry....But seriously, the reason I've given it so many stars is the sheer audacity of Katherine Dunn's imagination. I was gobsmacked by Oly's impregnation. I was stunned by the hubris of the horrible, horrible parents of these deformed and bizarre siblings. I saw in this book a spiritual ancestor to [Swamplandia!], and I felt some of the same things about that book as I do about this one: Oooh, so close! It's sooo close to being extraordinary in a good, satisfying way. Unlike Swamplandia!, though, I think this book really does deserve the time and attention of serious fiction readers.Yes, it does fail on some levels, but it's ambitious enough to make even that really interesting. Yes, it lacks some hard-to-define something, that one thing that makes an unbelievable premise feel right and inevitable, but instead it leaves the reader with a weird, uneasy new set of images imprinted on the brain.But most of all, despite the ways it's not perfect, one thing it is, is fun. A fun-to-read failure is better for summer than a successful sob-fest, no?"},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"Katherine Dunn is amazing.

I found myself reading a little at a time so that I wouldn't finish it too soon.This book calls into question of \\"normality\\" The characters in this book are not people you would find yourself liking in a normal situation, but Dunn's writing make them lovable in a empathic way. I am so proud that this book was written by a woman who dared to break into that male dominated world of transgressional fiction. She does this with ease and a gentle touch only a woman can have. She has no problem pushing the envelop in this book. Just when you think things are going along smoothly, Dunn punches again and harder.If you are a fan of transgressional fiction, do yourself a favore and read this book - slowly - and enjoy every word."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"This book is unlike anything I've read before. Katherine Dunn writes with a force and bravado I haven't seen anywhere else. Her descriptive style is somewhat unsettling and dark but ALWAYS paints a picture so vivid that you can almost see, smell or taste whatever it is she's writing about. It's amazing how real she can make the world she's invented seem. From page one she has you riveted to her story and refuses to let go until the very last page. And what a thrill to be so captivated by a book! To be that caught up in a story is a rare feat, and yet Dunn does it so effortlessly that it belies the incredible talent that goes behind it. 'Geek Love' is the story of a family that is completely unlike yours and yet so familiar that it is almost creepy. Through a family of 'freaks' Dunn eloquently explores a wide array of themes and leaves the reader with much to consider. It is a celebration of the unique and a parable of family. It is about the follies of self-righteousness and the pains of dependency. It is a story of acceptance, of love and devotion, of how far we will go and how terrified we can be to take a single step. Quite simply, 'Geek Love' is brilliant. Everyone should read this book -- it's appeal is universal as is its message. Each person can find something to take from it that may forever alter the way you see the world (and isn't that the hallmark of quality literature in a nutshell?)."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"GEEK LOVE is one of the most bizarre and satisfying reading experiences I've had. I don't know what else to say that hasn't already been said. This book is twisted, bizarre, empathetic, and ethereal. Katherine Dunn possesses quite the original mind. GEEK LOVE is a difficult read but if you give yourself up completely to Dunn's disturbing creation, you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"\\"Geek Love\\" is a novel that deals with the psychological vacuum found in cults and certain closed-set families. \\"Geek Love\\" tells the story of the Binewskis, a traveling carnival clan comprised of \\"norm\\" parents Lil and Al and their genetically-\\"encouraged\\" sideshow children. There's Arty, a.k.a. the Amazing Aquaboy, born with flippers for arms and a terrible case of the Napoleon complex; Elly & Iphy, the beautiful Siamese twin piano players joined at the waist (two hearts and one sex); Chick, the outwardly normal, overly-exploited telepath; and Olympia, the albino dwarf who narrates the story for the benefit of her daughter, Miranda, a \\"norm\\" fortunate enough to have been born free of the insular Binewski madness.The Binewskis are societal outcasts, always on the road, so the only constant they have to take root in is one another. Since their soil bed is so incestuously self-contained, it's not long before strange things start to grow. Arty, an angry, flippered ball of spite and jealousy, soon elbows his weak-minded parents out of the picture to become the new leader of the carnival family. Before long, he calls all the shots, and has everyone quivering in his tiny, mewling shadow. A little power isn't enough for the insatiable Arty, though, and he goes on to found his own quasi-religious cult, Arturism. The legions of Arturists willingly sacrifice their limbs to surgical amputation as a means of becoming more like their leader. Dunn cleverly implies that this insanity has as much to do with the cultists' burning need to follow as it does with Arty's fierce and oily charisma as a leader.The albino dwarf Olympia's unconditional love for her brother Arty is one of the most disturbing elements of the novel-especially since, as narrator, she's the character in which the reader is most closely enmeshed. In the Binewski universe, the bitter and nasty Arty not only assumes the role of god, but also becomes the object of romantic love for his younger sister. Olympia's need to love proves stronger than her need to see things clearly. The worse Arty's behavior progressively becomes, the more eager she is to excuse it. It's terribly frustrating as a reader to find yourself slowly pulled deeper and deeper into the claustrophobic heart of codependency. Olympia's narration comes to feel like a hypnotic meditation on the cruelty of attachment.But what makes \\"Geek Love\\" ultimately so compelling and terrifying is the familiarity of it all. There's something a little too universal about the vacuums and the emptiness that Dunn describes in this novel. I challenge any reader not to see some objectionable aspect of their own life reflected in this book. The ugly human behavior and emotion on display in \\"Geek Love\\" are the sort we'd rather publicly disown. So why is it we all end up lining up outside the tent with our money in hand, ready to take a good, long gawk?"},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"I came across this book by chance, a strange find my mother made at the local used shop which she mailed to me at home. I admit it, I was pulled in by the slightly malevolent and yet strangely enticing cover. But, once I started, I couldn't put this book down until I had read it straight through over the course of an entire day.Our story takes us to the rather seamy side of the Binewski Carnival Fabulon, where side-show exhibits are bred lovingly, the stranger the outcome, the more special the child - Papa Binewski's own rose garden, bred intentionally for beauty and exoticness. The major players are Siamese-twins, a midget albino hunchback (the narrator and purportedly least special of all the children), a flipper boy (Arturo the Aqua-boy), and the youngest child whose special trait lies unseen but always seething under the surface. Minor players include a dancer with a pig tail, the World's Fattest Baby, and a motley assortment of circus geeks, red heads, and fire-eater types. As the story unfolds it becomes progressively darker, the ambitions and neuroses of each of the family members leading them to become pitted against one another. As many reviewers before me have pointed out, this is not a happy story, but it is one hell of a wild ride and I would suggest it to a friend in a heart-beat. Provided, of course, that you are not afraid of clowns and circuses do not scare you.The writing style itself is for the most part eerily beautiful, but I found the ending to be extremely weak, feeling as though it had been thrown together at the last moment as if to meet an editor's deadline. It did not sound or flow the same way the rest of the book had - while it logically fit in with the rest of the story, the writing itself sounded very different and out of place, rushed, where everything else had been treated carefully and with time. I have not yet gotten around to reading any of Dunn's other works, but I look forward to having the chance one of these days."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"This book is a beautiful piece of art.

Its inspired lunacy shines from the moment we meet the parents who decide to breed their own freak show, starring children conceived to be \\"defective\\" by design.Author Dunn was ahead of her time with this spin on a genetically engineered master race--it is only recently that all couples could avail themselves of genetic technology in the pursuit of perfect babies.Then, paradoxically (as was the case in Tod Browning's film \\"Freaks,\\") we see how decency abides in the deformed while so many of the \\"normal\\" characters are invisibly stunted or warped.I generally avoid fiction like the plague (altho I enjoy Francine Prose, Ayn Rand, E.L. Doctorow and Judith Rossner). If you read and loved Jerzy Kosinski's \\"The Painted Bird,\\" (YOU MUST READ IT) or Nabokov's \\"Lolita,\\" you will pick up on Dunn's sensibility.GEEK LOVE the best novel I have read in the past 20 years."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"This book is so full of life! Dunn creates this entire world, complete with idioms, that envelopes you immediately. I love, love, love this book! I've made everyone I know read it. If you can read one book for a time, make it this one."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"Katherine Dunn's Geek Love has several thematic concerns, among them power in relationships, genetic manipulation, the concept of human self-image and body image, love, sex, and arguably a few more. Her principle thematic intention lies with a phenomenon that was receiving particularly widespread attention during the late 1970's and early 1980's when Geek Love was conceived and written. As Dunn herself states, when asked what inspired the novel in an interview I found in an online magazine, &quot;I must say, the primary thrust of the book, for me, is the examination of cults.&quot; Following the novel's epilogue, Dunn includes a self-examination piece simply entitled &quot;Katherine Dunn.&quot; In it she describes her reaction to the now infamous Jonestown Massacre, the mass cult suicide of the late 1970's. She states that the news of the incident &quot;hit [her] like a bullet in the chest and [she] still wake[s] up shaking and sweating occasionally.&quot; Within the next year she conceived and began writing Geek Love, which follows the exploits of the Binewskis, a traveling carnival family that boasts several freak children, all of which were dreamed up and created through various prenatal poisoning methods by the Binewski parents, Crystal Lil and Al. The children are Olympia, an albino dwarf hunchback who is also the book's narrator, Arty, dubbed &quot;Aqua Boy,&quot; born with flippers instead of limbs, Iphy and Elly, a set of Siamese twins who share a single set of legs, and Fortuanto, also known as Chick, who appears normal but has an extremely powerful telekinetic ability. The novel is split into two periods of time, the &quot;present&quot; chapters follow the exploits of Olympia as she tries to defend her daughter Miranda from the sick and twisted &quot;hobby&quot; of Miss Lick, a deranged woman who has created a kind of cult of women she intentionally deforms in order to make them sexually unappealing so they can better themselves through education and hard work. Miss Lick is after Miranda's tail (yes, an actual tail, she is a Binewski, after all...), which she believes men find sexually attractive. As part of her plan of attack, Olympia befriends Miss Lick, and during the course of this friendship admits to Olympia (whose true identity she knows nothing of) that the inception of her pastime was strongly influenced by a certain cult that existed years before, the Arturans. The Arturans are a cult that was created by Olympia's brother Arty, and it is the birth and life of this cult that is the principle focus of the &quot;past&quot; chapters of the book. Dunn creates one of contemporary fiction's most charismatic villains in Arty, who manipulates with great skill most of the characters and events that occur in the book, even some that he has no direct hand in, such as those of the present time. His cult preaches a grisly method of self-improvement, one of surgical removal of one's own limbs in order to achieve the so-called enlightenment that Arty has acquired through a life sans appendages. Dunn skillfully weaves a web of relationships driven by one party having power over another, be it through the cult mentality, or love, or even simple lust. The results are sometimes funny, often ironic, frequently sad, and ultimately...well, read the book to answer that one specifically, but for now let's just say exciting. I have read reviews that describe this book as a difficult read, but I did not find this to be the case. Dunn uses a clear, relatively simple prose style that is fast-paced despite the novel's length, and is never dull or tedious. For readers who are not easily offended or put off by somewhat shocking subject matter, there is something in this book to please all of them."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"I picked up this book not knowing anything about it, and I feel that's the best way to go about reading it. Dunn puts her craft to good use and seductively pulls her reader into the lives of a carnival freakshow family. Once your reality is suspended, Dunn presents you with unbelievable circumstances and disturbing images that hardly phase because you have become so wrapped up in her story-- it's too unreal not to be real. However, the book is not merely a trick of fancy-- her tale is compelling and speaks of the abnormalities of the world beyond the circus tent."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"I was SO disappointed when I finished reading this book. I wanted it to go on and on. The first 2 chapters were a little harder to get through, mainly because the writing is almost poetic, but once you get familiar with the tone of the book, you'll find it impossible to put down. Also, the transition from third person to first in the last chapters were a bit strained, but nothing that can't be overlooked providing the staggering beauty of the rest of the book. Get this book. You will not be sorry."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"Lemme just try to give you the basic story for this book: A couple working at a circus fall in love and decide to raise a family while devoting their lives and love to the family circus. What better way to maintain this setting than to birth freaks? As the father makes new and more insane concoctions for the mother to drink/snort/eat during her pregnancies... the children are born as hoped for - as freaks. Not all survived, of course, hence the show trailer of preserved babies - the ones that didn't make it (yet they are also profitable for the circus). Believe it or not, the book is written smartly and realistically, and the characters actually become understandable to you. This is a loving family who all care about each other and respect their surroundings. Eventually, politics kick in, the children develop ideas of their own, the parents get weak... it's yet another amazing epic, but with characters you can't forget - even if you want to. I could have done without all of the recent narrative and the repetitive amount of corruption and deception by Arturo - hence the 4 stars instead of 5."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"The story is ceaselessly engaging, the characters all spin on axes between sainthood and demonia and the prose style embellishes these qualities. The structure is beautiful in its pacing - it keeps you expecting more and it ultimately delivers everything it promises. Arturo, Olympia, Chick and the rest of the Binewski's seem like ugly distant cousins - a frightening branch of your own family and their story is hideously beautiful and eerily personal."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"I was very engrossed in this novel, was fascinated by the characters, was simultaneously appalled and intrigued by the excesses of Dunne's style, but when i reached the end, i was left wondering what it had all been building to. There was no satisfactory climax and the way the characters are dealt with at the end is very insufficient. A good climax or ending should build logically from the rest of the narrative, and the wrapping up of either half of the plot (either the flashback or the &quot;now&quot; sections) felt tacked on. Especially what ultimately becomes of Oly at the end seemed to me a cop-out. This is definitly not a book for everyone, but if you are merely looking for a fast paced read with no real depth (though Dunne and many of these reviewers seem to think it makes a profound statement on the human condition-- gag gag) i could reccomend this one."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"Of the many factors involved in my forming opinions about books, what separates the &quot;9's&quot; from the &quot;10's&quot; is whether or not I wanted it to continue beyond the given ending. In the case of Geek Love, I could have read another 350 pages. Dunn manages to give us a cast of characters that is both pathetic yet intoxicatingly self-assured in their own moral ascendancy over the outside world of &quot;norms.&quot; It is an engaging book which demands that the reader a reevaluate his/her own self-image, and makes you really think about the times you've caught yourself staring at a &quot;Freak.&quot; In a sense, Dunn gives us a free show, at which we can conjure our own images, and sate that morbid fascination we all seem to have with everything, and everyone, who stands out as &quot;Different.&quot; If you've never read it, stop everything, get a copy, and start reading. I guarantee that anyone who does so with an eye on themselves as well as Arty, Oly, the Twins and Chick will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"I read somewhere that critics called this &quot;a collaboration between John Irving and David Lynch,&quot; but frankly, it doesn't have the depth of neither one of them. Transgressiveness is not bad if it provides some insight in to human nature but I had difficulty seeing what that was in this book."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"Before making any false assumptions about the content of this book on the basis of its title, understand that this is not a story about holding hands with a fellow outcast by the fluorescent light of a library desk lamp. The geeks in this novel are of the traditional type: carnival performers who bite the heads off of live animals - chickens in particular. With that as an introduction, you are nearly prepared for type of material you will encounter in this book, but not quite.Nothing could quite prepare you for the grotesque nature of this book (although I will try), where that which is desirable is that which is unconventional. The unrelenting freakishness of every episode, from the characters' appearance to their attitudes to their confrontations, maintains the reader's fascination throughout. As a novel in which all the main characters (and most of the peripheral characters) have some sort of physical abnormality or disfigurement, the book looks as if it is presenting itself as a parody of mainstream culture's focus on physical self-image. Certainly, Dunn draws some of the power to engage readers in her book from universally shared self-conscious feelings (good or bad) of normality in the presence of those who apparently are not. But there are other issues being represented in Dunn's work as well. The theme of an individual's internal identity conflict, between the desire to be recognized for one's individuality while simultaneously receiving a sense of acceptance or belonging, is dominant. Issues dealing with power relationships, child-parent relationships, and love relationships are also present.Dunn sustains the grotesque sense of her book with the language she uses. The main character, Olympia, is often described in amphibious terms, and her emotions are compared to almost morbid personifications of her biology. Far more happens metaphorically in and to her body than lumps in the throat or butterflies in the stomach. The children frequently speak to each other in crass, derogatory terms, which is not an altogether unexpected occurrence, but portraying children who interact in this way rather than as sympathetic siblings adds to the book's detachment from traditional values. Plus, the Binewski father is casually, but shockingly (and it must be said, creatively) disrespectful of Biblical icons in his most emphatic speech. This works in support of the often indifferent, self-contained attitude that is prevalent among the characters, and also serves in support of an interesting commentary the book consistently seems to be making about organized religion. Dunn maintains the atmosphere of her book well by inserting these kinds of character commentaries and bizarre metaphors. By mixing them with valid emotions and concerns, warped in their evocation in the characters as they may be, she almost makes the reader believe that the concept of the novel is natural and that the situations existing therein could easily exist in our world. Least of all, she prepares the reader to be ready to accept the extraordinary.Once you read about the Binewski family, you will not find it easy to forget them."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"So many told me to keep reading, that I would end up LOVING Geek Love. But I didn't. After a month of literally trudging through this book, I had to toss it aside. And I HATE not finishing a book."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"This book was really an eye opener. Graphic and grisley, it portrays a family of carnival performers who are not &quot;normal&quot; physically, but their heated emotions and horrifying actions will put the reader beyond appearences.Created by chemicals and drugs, the children of the Binewskis' are physically deformed, from siamese twins to hunchbacked albino; from Aqua Boy, to Chick, the &quot;normal&quot; in appearance. This family is all about the rivalries that societal families experience, and the love that all children crave and need.This book is definately one that any reader should pick up. It is definately not for the squeamish, with very graphic and explicit content, but the reader will not be disappointed. A tale of intrigue, hate, jealousy, and contorted love, this story is sure to get people thinking. It really made me change my views on how people look, and to derive more from people by how they think and feel.

Don't get me wrong, I appreciate creativity and novelty, but I like it within a story that makes sense, with characters I can relate to.Geek Love definitely offers novelty, but do we really need 355 pages of it? I didn't like any of the characters, except for one (who was not the narrator), and there is no sense of connection or intimacy between the characters. There's also endless violence and disturbing imagery, and the book seems to sprawl out with story within story of weirdness without direction.It was also hard to believe the viewpoint of the narrator who continually described herself as though someone else were viewing her: \\"my shiny skull,\\" or \\"through my red eyes.\\" If you have red eyes, you wouldn't continually describe yourself that way.I continually had the feeling that we were watching gratuitous violence without intention. After about 50 pages, I was like, \\"Okay, I get it! I understand you're trying to question what we perceive as normal in our society, and why we behave as we do,\\" but do I need 355 pages of it? I think not.This is a very depressing view of society, a slanted view, and because the characters are so hard to relate to, it almost feels like we're witnessing rather than participating in the book. I don't know about you, but I like a book I can relate to and learn from. I appreciate Dunn's incredibly creative mind, but there is no heart in this book.Here's the other weird thing, folks: so many people on Amazon say that they don't like the book, and yet they give it 2 and 3 stars. Is this peer pressure? Is it the feeling that you have to rate something higher than you truly like (almost like people blindly following Arturo, in the book), because others say it's great?

I've tried some of her other books and can't get past the first few pages."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"Katherine Dunn's third novel &quot;Geek Love&quot; succeeds in bringing our culture's gross obsession with beauty to light, through the story of the Binewski Carnival Fabulon. Although not every single dramatic choice in the novel furthers this thematic concern, I highly recommend it because the quality of the story makes the few thematic sacrifices worthwhile. The tale of the family of freaks is related through the main character, Oly, who Dunn follows through two realms of life - her past traveling with the carnival, and her relationship in the present with a daughter who, for most of the book, is unaware Oly is her mother. Oly is an albino hunchback dwarf, which according to her parents, doean't quite make her freakish enough for the big show. This honor is left to her brother Arty, who has flippers instead of limbs, and her siamese twin sisters Elly and Iphy. Dunn reveals early on that the children were created through specific combinations of drugs and radioisotopes during their mother's pregnancy. This helps lead one to Dunn's major thematic concern. The world of the Binewski Carnival Fabulon she's created is really an inverse portrait of the world we live in, in which anorexia, diet pills, cosmetic surgery, and heroin shiek are so omnipresent. In the carnival world, freakishness brings one power, not beauty. This is expressed dramatically through the Binewski parent's creation of their family, who purposefully genetically alter their kids, and come close to dumping an apparently normal child by the highway. It's expressed clearly through a scene in which a 'norm' shoots Arty after being disgusted by the mere sight of the family. It's also expressed through the cult headed by Arty, the numerous followers of which have all their limbs amputated in a slow, careful process. Arty's wild and captivating persona, much like the advertisements that flood our world, convincing us to look as beautiful as possible, is able to draw lost souls out of the audience looking for a something, settling on unneccesary surgery. As I mentioned, Dunn juggles two settings in the novel, the history of the carnival and Oly's new life. In a way, both build to their own climax point, but generally, the history sections serve the present-day sections, supplying the reader with some answers concerning Oly's actions. Oly loves her daughter Miranda, and although she's having difficulty being honest, wants nothing more in life than her daughter's well being. Miranda is approached by a lonely, wealthy older woman, Miss Lick, who indulges in the odd hobby of disfiguring beautiful women. In Miss Lick's opinion, she is helping the girls overcome the handicap of beauty, helping them to be more like her, saving them from the animal lust of men. Miranda happens to have a tail, a leftover from the glowing Binewski gene pool, and Miss Lick wants to have it removed. Oly, in order to stop the removal, befriends Miss Lick, who reveals all her secrets about changing women's lives through surgery. Oly's actions are a great aid to interpreting Dunn's major theme. Oly, raised in a world where freakishness rather than beauty brings power, will not stand to see her daughter's only connection to the Binewski family severed. Oly's love and protection of Miranda lead to an exciting finish. It's no chore to read through the few dramtic scenes which don't directly support the central theme, since all are lively and entertaining. I recommend &quot;Geek Love&quot; because it succeeds on both dramatic and thematic levels, raising the legitimate question of our society's focus on physical attractiveness, while telling the captivating tale of the lives of carnival freaks."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"Wonderfully morbid and unique! Sideshow freaks, drugs, sex, revenge, romance and amputation fetishes are a combination you can't resist. Not for the squeamish."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"This is an engrossing and absolutely original book. It is very unsettling, though and I can't say I finished it feeling happy or, even, very good. But it's an experience worth having. Katharine Dunn creates a world that is like nothing else. A strange and haunting story."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"Well, this is certainly a read that will stay with you long after you've finished the book. But I have mixed feelings as to whether that's a good or bad thing. This isn't a run of the mill coming of age story, that's for sure. It's well written and you'll never forget that you read it."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"this was one of the most fascinating of novels..I do not know where the author came up with this imaginative story line...but it was hard to put down.."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"Oly Binewski is a geek and a freak, by any one's definition. (No, I'm not being politically incorrect. Well, only as politically incorrect as the Binewski's are.) Oly's parents engineered their children by partaking of a drug cocktail, all in order to keep the family carnival full of attractions and bringing in ticket money. As part of the family tree, there's Arty, the flipper boy (born with flippers instead of limbs); Elly and Iphy, the Siamese twins; Chick, who can move things with his mind but who looks embarrassingly normal; and Oly, an albino, hunchbacked dwarf.Oly's biggest concern is that she isn't quite freak enough for her family and she spends most of her time ingratiating herself to everyone around her. Her other time-consuming task is her dangerous hero worship of her brother, Arty. While much of the book is a flashback, the other adult version of Oly is fixated on her daughter, whom she gave up for adoption and now stalks.If you think this description is horrific, that's nothing compared to what actually happens in the story. I enjoyed it but feel that isn't the right word. Many parts are awkward and uncomfortable; much is hilarious and much is just tragic. Don't get me wrong--I never feel sorry for any character as they never bemoan their own circumstances. All boiled down, it is a tragedy as old as story-telling: just a family drama with people we can't help being related to and whom we love both too much, and too little.A weird, clever and creative read."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"My order arrived on time and was in mint condition. This is a weird carnie folk book. I found it disturbing yet could not put it down. I recommend this book."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"i was infatuated with the entire concept of this book and thoroughly enjoyed it and have recommended it to many of my friends!"},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"This book is a fun, sometime disturbing read. It walks a weird tightrope between suspending belief for the sake of sensation, and real, powerful feelings and actions that could not be ignored. I did not like the Arty evil route - it was so disturbing that it was hard to believe and while I see why it was one route for the story, it made it a challenge to continue reading. Overall, definitely read it and discuss, but it won't stay on my shelf."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"Seven weeks and the reading of a play between the start and finish of this book! But I stuck with it. \\"Geek Love\\" certainty makes my list of truly bizarre reads. The story is of a maladjusted carnival family, the Binewski's. The children - medically induced deformities - are the sideshows, the farther is the ring master; the mother is a star in her own right, made famous by her ability to decapitate chickens without a blade. Each of the children is special in their own manmade way. The limbless, stunted, conjoined and telepathic survive their births and are able to actively contribute to the family business while the aborted and still born support the business in silence from the confines of formaldehyde filled jars on display for patrons' viewing.A freakishly wretched group indeed the Binewskis' are, not because of how they look but because of how they behave. \\"Ugly is as ugly does\\" my Granny always said. They are certainly as human as any of us with all the characteristic emotions that make us so - envy, jealously, love, and hate. It's the Binewski's inability to exercise any emotional restraint that ultimately leads to their implosion. I'm not clear why the text seemed so dense to me. The story was interesting but not necessarily gripping. In fact, I don't think I liked any of the characters in particular although a little insight into the carnival life of yore was informative. By the end of the novel I was more excited that I was done with it than I was by the experience of it. Good Luck!"},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"First of all, do not buy this book if you are looking for a love story involving two tech savvy computer nerds. For purposes of this novel, a \\"geek\\" is a carnival attraction which bites the heads off of live chickens. If that turns you off, look elsewhere because it gets progressively worse from there.Actually, as far as \\"over the top\\" disgusting passages are concerned, they were few and far between. I found the novel to be very well written and captivating from start to finish. Our narrator is a hump backed, albino dwarf, the product of genetic engineering with the goal of producing carnival sideshow freaks. Her siblings consist of Siamese twins, a brother with flippers for arms and legs (think thalidomide) and one with telekinetic powers.There are two threads in the book, one in present day and the primary thread which looks back to the carnival days and the lives of the traveling carnival family and employees. If you are not overly squeamish, you should enjoy the story and the writing contained in this novel."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"This novel is one of the most interesting I've read in quite a while. The mere basis of the story was enough to throw me out of my comfort zone and demand that I pay close attention to the intricacies of the plot. That may suggest that this novel may not be attractive as a pleasure read, however, it flows beautifully and maintains a sense of suspense that won't allow you to put it down. This book amazed me with its humor and emotion and its in-depth look at the dichotomy between uniqueness and normalcy. I was told, when I asked what the premise of the novel was, that it was about \\"circus freaks.\\" I was not misled. This novel follows the Binewski family of the Carnival Fabulon-a traveling family of genetically engineered freaks. You'll feel as if you're walking through a house of mirrors at a carnival, which may be exactly what Katherine Dunn intended upon writing Geek Love. The eccentricities of this family have no end, and this makes their escapades intriguing to follow, though, I should mention, some with weaker stomachs may want to steer clear. The main character, Olympia Binewski McGurk, begins the novel as a middle-aged woman watching her supposedly orphaned daughter from afar, not willing to reveal her parenthood. As the novel progresses, Olympia reveals in her memories her past of being the 2nd youngest of the Binewski family in their traveling freak show and the reader begins to understand why Olympia is so secretive. The Binewski family exploits their novelties just as supermodels of today exploit their beauty-however, the parallel is of almost startling opposites. This hunger for uniqueness is seen in sibling rivalry and cult-like followings. When do they become unique enough? This concept continues in Olympia's present day life and the parallels between the carnival atmosphere and the atmosphere of the normal, everyday city that Olympia lives in are almost haunting. This novel is very complex, battling between both the present and past of Olympia's life. I fully enjoyed every moment of reading this novel; not only were the themes chillingly intense and realistic, but it was humorous and interesting-how often do you get to read a novel that thrusts you right into the heart of a circus side-show? I think this is a novel that will allow itself to be read as a reader chooses to read it: taken for face value as an attention-grabbing piece of fiction, or as a novel which has underlying themes that can be seen in everyday life. Whether you read this for fun or to learn how humans' strife for originality leads to destruction, I would definitely recommend it. It keeps you on your seat and is completely entertaining with its obscurity. If nothing else, read it to be fully impressed with the characters that Katherine Dunn has created and their absurd complexities. The world of the Carnival Fabulon and the captivating characters-a hunchback midget narrator, a limb-less glorified cult-leader, and Siamese twins who play duets on the piano to gather crowds-is a great achievement on Dunn's behalf."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"I ran across this novel on a shelf when it was first released and ended up sitting in the corner reading it for hours...too engrossed to pause for a trip to the register. This book is an odd one, but a sentimental favorite for me, and the story while ostensibly about carnival freaks is really about the human consequences of a culture organized around the spectacle."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"This book restored my faith in modern fiction. If you're sick of writers with their heads up their own posteriors writing about how difficult is is to be a rich, succesful writer READ THIS. If this book had been written in the 1930s-50s it would be a Classic read alongside Orwell, Aldous Huxley, Greene etc. If Russell Hoban, James Thurber, Joe Orton and William S Burroughs had got together to write a book it might have been something like this - but probably not as good. Just one warning: if you read it you will want to buy 10 more copies for your best friends - so it could end up being expensive. Katherine Dunn is truly a genius."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"Far from being disturbing, I found this book quite comforting, and have felt like a 'hybrid rose' instead of an oddity ever since reading it (years ago).

This book is one of the 5 books I recommend everyone read."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"I picked up a copy of &quot;Geek Love&quot; in Paris and kept it close at hand while I bummed around Egypt, the Greek Islands and Italy for a few months. To say that I read this book is not sufficient--I savored it, letting the grotesqueries of every paragraph slide into my psyche like so many venom-packed vipers. Dunn has concocted a startling stew of psychosis, twisted values, sexual urgency and destruction, every line spiced with some of the most incisive writing and imaginative character development I have ever seen. This book is a direct slap-in-the-face for all humanity and after reading &quot;Geek Love&quot; you will understand why most of us deserve such a slap. Stunning! This book kicked my rear the same way &quot;A Confederacy of Dunces&quot; did. I laughed until cried until I laughed until I almost barfed. The scene where the Binewski children scamper down from the farmer's apple tree has to be one of the most hilarious in the annals of recent literature. A knockout writer, A knockout piece of fiction, and a sickenly-sweet Judas kiss on the butt of humanity! Wow!"},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"Geek Love is at its core, a story about love and power. It's family love that keeps the Binewski family together so long. It's love, albeit misguided, that brings the various members of the family (Arty, Ophy, Electra, Oly, and Chick) together. And it's love that blinds nearly the entire family of the craving for power, the need to control and dominate, that would eventually lead to the drama and struggle that makes the story so compelling.Told from the voice of Oly - the family's albino, hunchback dwarf - Geek Love chronicles the adventures of a carnival family, a family whose entire life is dependent upon the bottom-line created from the sideshow profits. Eventually, a child from the family has to take over from the parents, Crystal Lil and Art, and Arturo the Aquaboy, a child born with flippers instead of hands and feet, is more than up for the task. Arty dominates the story line as he slowly but surely takes over, thriving on the power and control, wanting more and more of each.The conjoined twins, Ophy and Electra, serve as either half an antagonist, or possibly a full antagonist; I'm not sure which. Chick serves as the family \\"norm\\", whose telekinetic abilities are powerful but not outwardly apparent. Oly, who loves Arty and is willing to devote her entire life to him, is the perfect narrator, reliving the moments from beginning to end, ensuring that every detail gets its due.There are the Arturians, The Bag Man, The Psycho Doctor, the mystical powers, the lobotomies, the bodies in formaldehyde, the mysteriously floating sperm, a baby named Mumpo, the redheads, willing castration, maggots and murder. The book is packed full of unexpected twists and turns, interesting characters, and incredible story-telling.I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants a story that doesn't follow the cookie-cutter mold. It's interesting from the first page, and it's impossible to put down."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"I'm a horror reader and heard so much about this book via a horror discussion list I belong to. This will have to be one of the best books I've ever read. I recommend it to people who want to be introduced into the genre. It's haunting, tragic, horrific, beautiful. I couldn't put it down. I cried at the end - I couldn't help myself.

I finally picked it up, got past the first few pages (she must have had writer's block during these pages) and was thoroughly hooked after that. The novel reminds me a lot of Flannery O'Connor's work, particularly &quot;Wise Blood.&quot; The story is at once believable and fantastic, yet it is, in parts, quite touching."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"I have read GEEK LOVE 4 times and it is almost time for another reading. Every time I read this book I find something new that blows me away.

Absolutely brilliant. I've wondered for years if there was any way to put into writing my feeling concerning &quot;Norms&quot; and the attitudes they inflict on those who don't fit into their reality. This book is well written, repulsive, addictive, and holds the one message I've always wanted to share with the world. I'm different, I'm proud of it, and I wouldn't change it for the world. This author demonstrates the gifts gained by difference--and the horror that sometimes ensues. Bravo! Marvelous! Please read this book --don't be like the reader that put it down after 25 pages.

I can honestly say that Geek Love can be considered a contemporary classic. If ever you want a little intrigue and pulse...read this book."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"Tolstoy's classic is famous for its opening sentence about all unhappy families being different, and all happy ones being alike. Had Tolstoy still been around to read Geek Love, I'm not sure he would have felt that way. At its heart this is a simple story of a totally dysfunctional family -- our narrator, Olympia (a hunchbacked albino dwarf) spends much of the book musing on how relatively uninteresting she is, compared with her much more impressively carnivalistic family. Along the way Dunn deals with sibling rivalry, sexual violence, animal rights (including about the creepiest nurse/doctor character in all of literature), and -- best of all -- religious cultism. It's not a book for everyone; there are a handful of terribly ghastly moments in it. But overall, it's strongly written, incredibly poignant, and often hilarious. If I could take ten books onto a desert island, this would be one of them."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"This book was good but very very long. I became bored with it.

It wasn't at all what I expected and that made it that much more of a fun surprise. It is definitely a twisted version of a family but it has an interesting and deep moral lesson, and surprisingly a great sense of family values and the complications that go along with a family who dares to be different. I would recommend this to anyone who likes the twisted and who can take quite a bit of strange to get to the deeper message."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"Become a member of the darkest, seediest sideshow family of all times.The couple in this story breed freaks like others might breed dogs.Truly facinating, gritty and dark.

Geek Love is populated by a dark and wild bunch of characters, written with a wry style that explores our culture's standard of beauty and what's okay."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"I picked up this book on a whim and couldn't put it down until I was finished. The book, in it's manipulation of the revolting as spectacle, creates its own brand of beauty and logic. What strikes me most is how we as readers have an opportunity to see life after the carnival, not just during it. A most unexpected and unique take on the theme, &quot;people make mistakes.&quot; I would highly reccommend this book."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"This book is totally different than any other book that I have ever read. It gives you a glimpse inside a very dysfunctional family that owns ad works with a travelling carnival. The character development is great. If you think your family is weird... you should read about this one!"},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"I'll never get it. I wish I had a dollar for every time I've seen someone unwrap this book as a birthday gift. Each time my hand covers my face incredulously as the giver exclaims \\"You'll absolutely LOVE this book! It's so great!\\" And each time I fight the urge to stand up and scream, \\"Nooooo!\\" Well, unless I really don't like the birthday girl/boy in which case I sit back & nod my head in agreement.I read Geek Love a few years ago. I'd heard so many recommendations that I decided it was a safe reading choice to take on a 2 week trip to France. I didn't take a back up book. This was my mistake. Yes, it's well written. Yes, it's unique. Yes, it has developed, original characters (the strongest of which are mostly unlikeable to say the least) with unusual relationships & a non-simplistic plot. The problem was that due to this book I spent most of my time in France fighting the urge to vomit along with every chapter. Once I realized I hated it, I thought of putting it aside but I had no back up book and was sitting by the beach a lot with nothing to do. So in the end I decided it would be good to finish what I started before making a final opinion, so I waded through the whole thing. Normally I keep books forever. When I finished the last word of Geek Love, I threw it into the garbage. Then I literally worried that some innocent maid might take it out of the trash to read it & I didn't want to inflict it upon them. We have enough problems with the French not liking us.If you have no empathy for characters in books, Geek Love might not bother you. If you think Apotemnophiles (people who want to be amputees) are cool, well hey man, this is the book for you. Personally, I simply don't get all of the people who seem to love it. Reading these reviews, I'm amazed to find that I'm in the minority of readers that hated it... but baybee, I'm here to represent. Frankly, I'm proud to say I hated such an evil book... and I don't think I've ever called a book evil before in my life.That said, while I hated the book I think Katherine Dunn is a great writer. If she wasn't, I probably wouldn't have passionate feelings about what I read. I would actually like to read other stories of hers. About something ELSE, please."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"I just didn't get the point of this book and don't understand all these high ratings. I was ready to toss it aside after the first chapter when the author tells us that Lil and Al deliberately set about trying to create freaks. Then I thought I'd keep going because maybe there was some lesson about humanity about to be imparted. Then I was ready to toss it aside again when we're introduced to the jars in the Chute. What kept me reading? A morbid fascination, I guess, similar to what makes people want to slow down and stare at grisly car wrecks. By the end of the book, though, I couldn't figure out what I was supposed to take away from this book. There was not one redeeming character in it. Was there a plot? It seemed to me like the reader was just taken on an aimless journey through the years with the Binewski clan, for no good reason. Then we're brought back to the present time, where Olympia is stalking the woman who wants to alter her daughter. That was the most emotionally believable part of the book. I guess this book went over my head."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"This book came highly suggested by a friend. I read several reviews before I read it. Some were good, some were bad, but they all made the book seem interesting. After reading it I'm a little confused. I just didnt seem interesting at all. I didn't like nor care about any of the characters. It was boring and the writing style didn't really make sense."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"When I read some of the negative reviews of Geek Love, I was hesitant to read it. However, I am glad that I did. I could not put it down and am lucky that my son was with grandparents during the week that I read it, because my eyes were glued to the pages.I can understand SOME of the detractor's complaints about this book. Katherine Dunn clearly has a deep fondness for certain adjectives (\\"hideous\\" being one that comes to mind) and I definitely noticed some repetition of some descriptors. A little annoying, but not enough to hurt my enjoyment of the book.I agreed with the truth of one person's complaint -- that none of the characters are really all that redeemable. We have the selfish characters, the downright sociopathic, domineering, power-greedy character, and the eager victims who seem unwilling to leave their emotionally abusive family member/s, who love and even worship them. That said, a book is meant to evoke FEELINGS. In my opinion, the fact that none of the characters were all that redeemable made this story BETTER for me. I felt pain that the characters behaved the way they did. It gave this story a lot more depth IMO, and frankly, well, I think it's realistic.If you want to read a warm, fuzzy piece of fluff then you probably won't enjoy this book. It's pretty damn dark all the way through. No, Katherine Dunn is not the world's best writer, and her writing wasn't perfect, but I still loved walking through this story and did so with enjoyment and awe. I was drawn into this story as if it was my own, so for me, the book was mindblowing.(And those who recommend Angela Carter's Nights at the Circus are right -- it's another great book.)"},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"Katherine Dunn's novel about a traveling family Freak Show is somewhat disturbing, strange, disgusting, heartbreaking, and should not be passed over. Geek Love, the tale of the Binewski Family [Large, Small, & Preserved] is just about as weird as it gets. When genetic experimentation goes wrong [or right?] you get some interesting results. Siamese Twins, Albinos, Aqua Boys, Telekinesis. In the world of the Binewskis there is nothing worse than being a \\"norm.\\" So much so that they will give up any child who is born without a special \\"ability.\\" When Arty the Aqua Boy decides to establish his own religion things go from strange to bizarre. Enlightenment through amputation? Yes. Finger, toes, arms, & legs all for the opportunity to be more like Arty. Arty, the ego maniacal son who has risen to take over the traveling circus turning it into a cult of sorts with him as the ultimate leader. After reading this book you will be haunted by the image of an Aqua Boy continuously being rubbed down by an albino. Maybe that's the ultimate message. Moisturizer is important. Okay. Maybe not. This is a tale of freaks, geeks, norms, redheads, cults, amputees, and a mothers love. It's a great novel. If you are a fan of Chuck Palahniuk you will definitely enjoy this book. You can definitely tell Katherine Dunn is one of his favorites."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"Katherine Dunn has great and unflinching courage, and her imagination is vast.

A sniper who doesn't know why he does what he does, but is congratulated by a woman pushing a perambulator (\\"She's pregnant again,\\" the woman said, referring to the mother of the freaks in this novel)?

Whether she does more than point out that morbid fascination on the parts of the voyeurs is up to the reader, but what she fully succeeds at is showing with sympathy, humanity, and good humor the feelings, desires, ambitions, and humanity of the freaks. Geek Love shows us a most important truth, which is that humanity comes in many forms, and monsters sometimes are the most human appearing of creatures."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"This book missed the five star rating due to a slow, plodding writting style, but it is still a great read. None of it shocked me or disgusted me like many other readers have stated, instead I found myself engrossed in the oddness of the characters, especially some of the periferral ones (the Bag Man is great.) I think I would have enjoyed this book a lot more if I hadn't taken a month long break in the middle of reading.

I have now read the book twice, and she was correct but the book was so different it was refreshing. It's not everyday that you hear the life story of circus &quot;freaks&quot; but as you read Geek Love, you find their lives are relatively normal and the Norms are the ones who are a little off their rockers. If you can't handle a little gore don't bother, but for everyone else you'll love it and the wierdness of it will never leave your mind.."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"It's pretty easy to see what Katherine Dunn is trying to do here, but unfortunately she doesn't make it. Any one of the themes &quot;explored&quot; in this wannabe shocker can be better appreciated in other sources -- for example, John Irving's _The World According to Garp_ , or any of the early John Waters films. Both Irving and Waters treat their subject matter with a sensitivity and compassion than seems greatly lacking in _Geek Love_, with the result that this novel ends up affecting your stomach more than your heart. The only thing that kept me from giving it just one star is the occasional witticism from Arturo, who uses scatalogical and anatomical epithets in a clever way. Otherwise, it's just pornography, which I guess is okay if that's what you're looking for -- though I prefer my porn straight, without the pseudo-philosophical trappings."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"That sounds melodramatic, but I've never been so moved by a story, or placed so much emotional investment into fictional characters. I first encountered this novel in college Freshman English. This is one of those books where you either get it or you don't get it. Most of the other students, cheerleader types fresh off the high school boat, didn't get it. They found it unneccessarily &quot;gross and crude&quot;, as well as &quot;just weird&quot;. Our instructor was generally chastised by his class for being into stupid, bizarre literature. I, on the other hand, spent the whole semester obsessing over &quot;Geek Love&quot;, reading it at least three times and underlining favorite phrases, like &quot;inchy little marks like the hesitation cuts on a suicide's wrist.&quot; I found Dunn's writing courageous, ingenious, delicious. So poetic in it's monstrosity, so lovely in it's ugliness. I loved her humane monsters, hated hermonstrous humans, and discovered that the more I read, the less I could tell the difference between them. My concern and involvement in Oly's life almost scared me. I obsessed over the importance of color in the novel. My crumpled paperback copy is filled with pencil marks noting each time &quot;red&quot; or &quot;green&quot; is mentioned. In the end I felt drained, but inspired. Katherine Dunn altered my ideas about how far to go with an image. She showed me beauty can be created from ugliness, profound thoughts can spring from crude words. All I can say to her is &quot;Thank you.&quot;"},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"A \\"friend\\" reviewed this novel and as something of a freak myself I couldn't resist reading a novel about freaks. But I found I didn't like this nearly as much as I thought I would.The best way to think about this story is that it's like a darker version of \\"The Addams Family.\\" Ma and Pa work for a traveling circus and decide that it's too expensive to recruit freaks, so they'll breed them! Ma takes all sorts of drugs and such in order to create deformed babies. Some of them die, but four (or five) survive. They are Arturo, a boy with flippers instead of limbs; Ely and Iphy the conjoined twins; Chick the boy with strange psychic powers; and Olympia the hunchbacked albino dwarf who is our narrator. As in most family sagas the narrator is the most boring character with the least personality. Arturo the Aqua Boy is the big star of the family. Ely and Iphy are second with their singing and dancing. Even Chick finds a niche when Arturo starts a cult devoted to making people into deformed freaks. Olympia's only real role is to be Arturo's valet and main worshiper.I guess despite being something of a freak myself I'm not so deluded to think that being a freak makes someone special or better than \\"normal\\" people. As the story goes on I really found it increasingly grotesque and disturbing instead of funny or interesting. Adding to this is the portion that takes place in the present where Olympia is dealing with her daughter and a mysterious woman who thinks like Arturo that deformity is the key to enlightenment.Anyway, other people obviously thought this was better than I did. I was just a victim of overly high expectations the book couldn't deliver upon.That is all."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"There's no question that Dunn is an extraordinary writer, with undeniable creativity, but this one is NOT for everyone. Page after page appears to be written solely for shock value, or voyeuristic exploration, of perversity, at its worst. After the final page, I actually was worried about this book falling into the hands of those who may be of a sensitive nature, or mentally unstable---particularly those with body dysmoprhic syndrome.I could accept the premise of Al and Lil breeding their own for their carnival freak show, by exposing themselves to various toxic agents. The result was: Olympia, an albino hunchback dwarf, Electra and Iphigenia, Siamese twins, and Arturo, also known as Aqua Boy, because he was born with flippers for extremities. You would think that this alone would be enough---the moral implications, the day to day lifestyle of those considered 'freaks,' their interpersonal relationships, and the exploitation, but it wasn't.The final straw for me, was when a clearly mentally ill individual appeals to Arturo that she wants to be like him---that his uniqueness is inspiring. This is where we move from altering the genes with toxins, to produce 'freaks,' to surgical alterations, to create them. In a word, horrifying!We then meet another sinister individual who has some type of bizarre fetish that involves mutilation, which she justifies as helping the individuals. She's willing to pay the price, to see them go under-the-knife. So, if you want to read about a lovely young woman, who has her breasts lopped off, to satisfy this woman's mental perversity, this may be the read for you. It wasn't for me.This book takes the mad scientist concept, experimenting with human alterations, to the extreme. It makes Frankenstein look like a saint, by comparison. It is too potentially realistic for comfort, and, I never would have read it, if I knew it involved surgical mutilations.Perhaps it is because I have worked in Psychiatry for many years, that I found this work so repulsive. I've worked with body dysmorphic individuals, self mutilators, and, those trying to exist in our often unkind environment, with deformities. In real life, there is nothing more heartbreaking. I certainly did not enjoy reading about it, taken to this extreme, particularly when there were no redeeming events taking place---no positive lessons learned. I feel this book's content could be profoundly disturbing for some. It was for me, and I've seen just about everything.All said, I can't deny Dunn's ability to communicate vividly, and, at times beautifully, considering the subject matter. It is a work that will linger in the reader's mind, forever, whether they find it distasteful, or not. And, I can see how it has reached somewhat of a, cult -classic-status, simply by virtue of its bizarre nature. For this reason, alone, I must give it, at least three stars, but I would never recommend this work to anyone without very clear warnings."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"This is my second copy of Geek Love as I was loaning out my original and it never made it back to me.

It is worth reading, and it might make you think. Don't expect too much."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"As numerous reviewers before me have summarized, this is a unique story with an interesting premise.I had a few nights when I stayed up way too late to read this book, curious about how on earth it would end.What bothered me the most, however, were not the characters (who were indeed irritating, but I liked them), but the author's jumpy prose. She thoroughly described many minor points, but I could not understand what she was getting at during what I eventually realized were the more important components of the story. (If anyone can tell me what happened to Chick and the Fabulon at the end of the \\"Notes for Then\\" sections, please drop me a line. I don't get it.)Three stars: an interesting, engrossing read which kept me up late with my nose in the book, kooky characters, but often difficult storyline."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"The relationship between the protagonist and her family and society was so intruigingly sweet and sad that I was so detatched from the horrors of the later half of book. It is a vert dysfunctional story, but isn't every book that keeps you unable to set it down till you have read it cover to cover dysfunctional?"},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"Read all the other reviews to learn about the bizarre premise in this exercise of twisted imagination. Then, forget them, because this book is oh-so-much more than its fanciful plot. When reading this book you well may laugh, and cry, and cringe, but you will never forget this book or its incredible characters. A literary tour-de-force that has layer upon layer of subtlety."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"I couldn't put this book down, and carried it around for about a week, deeply and happily immersed. But, just for comparison, when I showed it to my boyfriend and he read the back cover, he physically recoiled and hastily handed it back to me. Funnily enough, he enjoys true-crime books/programs, and I can't stand the things. I think it's the same impulse though: we feel that these things, though repulsive to many, have things to teach us about human nature. With that in mind, I have to commend Katherine Dunn for a very well written, memorable, and thought-provoking book -- with the disclaimer it is absolutely not for everyone.Basically, if you are armed with the knowledge that the book is about a family of circus freaks (including a fish-boy with no real limbs, siamese twins, and an albino dwarf, all purposely bred for birth defects with the use of drugs and radiation), and you are assured that ***it only gets worse from there***, and you still find yourself curious, then for goodness sake go out and get the book right now, because it delivers everything you would want except perhaps for a happy ending.While I find writers like Chuck Palanuik and Bret Easton Ellis to be smug and shallow (there goes my reviewer rating!) I find them to be the only comparison to this book for actual shock value. I can't remember the last time I was actually shocked, not disturbed but shocked, at a book, and without being inclined to throw it out the window. The amount of humanity and vibrancy in these characters despite their ugly and often cruel natures kept me riveted. Highly recommended, for those with strong stomachs."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"It was Douglas E. Winter who said, \\"Horror is not a genre, it is an emotion.\\" With that bold and all-too-true statement ringing in your ears, I will tell you that \\"Geek Love\\" is a horror story. The protagonists are not simply trapped by their physical deformities, but also by their own familial love and the malevolent manipulation from one who is of them.The majority of the story is told by Olympia Binewski, born into a carnival family of intentional freaks. Al and \\"Crystal Lil\\" Binewski set about starting their family with one intention; additions to the carnival's attractions. Lily takes illegal drugs, insecticides, and even radioisotopes in order to purposefully \\"give their children the gift of making money just by being themselves.\\" In other words, they create a family of horribly deformed children, their own freak show.Arturo, known as Aqua Boy, is the first of their children to survive. He is a torso with flippers for arms and legs. Second born are the Siamese twins Electra and Iphigenia, two perfect torsos rising up from one set of hips and legs, stunningly beautiful despite their deformity. Olympia herself is the third living child, a hunchback albino dwarf, she is considered to be too commonplace to be useful but is kept anyway. The youngest child, Fortunato, called Chick, was almost left on a doorstep for being normal when his telekinetic powers were discovered. Kept in what was called \\"The Chute\\", in glass display jars, were the children of Al and Lily that did not live, yet kept as attractions in the Binewski Fabulon Carnival.Dunn's tale of quiet, creeping horror takes place in two separate time frames, Olympia's childhood with the carnival and a present day encounter with the daughter who doesn't know her. The \\"present-day\\" storyline is a bit weak, stilted and practically unfeeling in its telling, but Olympia's childhood with the Fabulon is wrought with deeply impacting emotions of fear, hate, bitterness, happiness...and love.From the quietly acquiescing Olympia to the independence of the twins to the narcissistic brutality of Arturo, and the gentle genius of Chick, you love and hate the Binewski's as you find yourself completely engulfed in their strange world. Arturo performs in a fish tank, and the twins take piano and singing lessons to entertain the crowds, while Olympia basically becomes a slave to her brother Arturo.But Arturo is not satisfied simply swimming in a tank, and with the help of an underwater sound device and his very own gift of speech, begins to mesmerize the crowds and forms a cult around himself. A deadly cult of self-mutilation and butchery that called themselves Arturans rises up to follow the Aqua Boy, including a questionable physician called Dr. Phyllis, who joined the carnival after performing abdominal surgery on herself in her dorm room.You will meet Horst, the cat man and his tigers; Zephir McGurk, who tries to sell Arturo a strange device and winds out joining the Arturans; Norval Sanderson, a reporter who exposes Arturo's cult and then joins the carnival to sell maggots; Vern Bogner, a madman who eventually becomes \\"The Bag Man\\"; and the numerous Redheads who tends the carnival's food and game stands.From languid childhood afternoons to horrifying parking lot murderers, from close-knit family story times to vicious sibling rivalry, Geek Love is anything but dull or boring. Innocence at the beginning, trepidation in the middle, heartbreak at the end, all stirred in with the tendrils of horror that creep from the pages and bite unexpectedly, Dunn has managed to puncture my mind and my flesh with this expertly crafted story.Powerful, heartbreaking, maddening, frustrating, sickening, fascinating, repugnant and yet alluring, Geek Love is a tightly written masterpiece of finding beauty in sewers, and putrescence in that which glitters. Any book that stirs my love/hate passions as deeply as Geek Love deserves to receive my highest recommendation. Do yourself a favor and pick up a copy. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"Much like its subject matter, the side show &quot;freak&quot;, this book can be ugly and disturbing, but it is impossible to turn away. Told from the viewpoint of the bald, Albino, hunchback dwarf daughter of a mother who deliberately took drugs and chemicals to give birth to freaks for the family carnival, the narration can be incredibly calm in the midst of the storm. The parents, who run a freak show and have freak children for fun and profit, have a son with flippers, and daughters who are Siamese twins, and a seemingly normal son who has telekinesis. Katherine Dunn's imagination is frightening. The story runs the gamut from gratuitous violence to incest to rape and murder. I could not wait to finish the book, but once I did, I never wanted to read it again. I was disturbed, confused, intrigued. There are some gaping holes in the story, you have to suspend disbelief, and the concurrent story about the woman who disfigures beautiful women with battery acid is downright chilling. But, it certainly captures your interest. It is unique, and I, personally, had seen nothing of its type before. It's difficult for me to say whether I recommended it. I can only say proceed with caution; it is engrossing and also terribly un-nerving."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"...and that's sad because the plot is contrived and falls flat. But lord almighty, this book picks you up by the throat and shakes you around a bit before it wanders off in search of dramatic endings.(Warning! Plot spoilers ahead!) The best reason to read this book is for the question it raises--just who is normal, and who is a monster? We are treated to several characters with varying degrees of physical and/or mental grotesqueness, but who is more of a freak--the siamese twins who draw crowds with their piano duets, or the unremarkable looking business woman who disfigures sexy girls so they can reach their full mental potential? It is also a pleasure to be privy to the kind of twisted sibling relationships that I used to think only John Irving could give us. Oly's narrative of her relationship with her adult daughter, Miranda's searching for her own ideas of normalcy--those scenes are incredibly poignant.But honestly, it was as if Katherine Dunn suddenly couldn't handle all these folks and literally decided to kill them off so she could finish up the book--it wasn't quite a deus ex machina finish of the carnival, more like a Chicky (the telekinetic youngest child) ex machina who was darn close to a deus figure I guess.What I am really mulling over though, is the subject of the title. The yearning for love that everybody has--all of these characters grapple with it, some successfully, some disasterously. That love is twisted into as many shapes as it possibly can be in this book, and we are left to puzzle it out.I think this would be a great book for a book group--the fact that the reviews are so split is testimony to that (aren't the best groups when there's heated disagreement?). I'm not sure how valuable it would be in a classroom unless it's a class that deals with issues of disablility or maybe an English comp class. I would highly suggest it to all whose eyes skim across folks with deformaties and handicaps--the girl with splayed legs, the bank teller with two fingers--and isn't that most of us? Geek Love will, if nothing else, open your eyes to different ways of considering the body beautiful."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"How surprised was I to hear some book called Geek Love(?) come so highly recommended, and who'd of ever thought I'd read it?... Then find me thinking, &quot;I'm not finding this as disturbing or shocking as it seems set up to be,&quot; enthralled though I am... Apart from it's subject matter GL seemed familiar, similar to other works in several ways: writing style, theme, writer's trickery. Comparisons come easy and are valid. Yet this work stands, for me, very much on it's own, and the reading experience suggests it's greater than the sum of it's parts. Maybe it was a philosophy that hooked me (and then came Fight Club... ), or just some magic that I'm not sharp enough to identify. Eventually I discovered my jaw extended, telling me I could be surprised, that I wasn't immune. Oftentimes it was the complete, complex psychologies that impressed me most, and the work suffered when such details were half-baked. In Geek Love's world we may need to suspend much disbelief, but overall I found Dunn's logic surprisingly intricate. Her storytelling I found very effective, ever captivating, pulling me forward, forward, forward, while her &quot;lyric&quot; prose was there entertaining me throughout. Though I wanted at times to take a break (just to breathe, shake off the obsession,and assess: do I really like this book so incredibly much? do I LOVE this book??), I honestly felt rather powerless to slow down. I was also feeling uncharacteristically co-dependent: wanting everybody to read this book, at least talk to me about it, or ask questions, just please be interested too! please? I'll keep my criticisms from contaminating others' experience, but even halfway through, when I was able too pull myself away and relax, I found myself thinking about the book often and eager to spend time reading. Closing the book I may have lost some of my earlier enthusiasm, yet... find me turning back to that most marvelous of beginnings... I am satisfied, and for a time, however brief, I've awakened a bit more love, certainly compassion, for all you individual strangers that I pass out there on the streets of the real (flesh and blood) world. somethings persist: I hope everybody reads this book."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"I am still wrestling with my feelings about this book. I loved the first half. Obviously the premise is disturbing and twisted but Dunn somehow managed to make it feel realistic and natural in context. She is an exceptional writer when she wants to be. The description of the Fabulon and the Binewski silbings' childhood is the highlight because it was wonderfully imaginative and it had heart.I cannot pinpoint exactly where in the story my feelings about the book changed although it was somewhere after the halfway mark. I know when I realized it though. My boyfriend asked me a question while I was reading and I nearly bit his head off. I apologized and said, \\"This book is just such so toxic it is putting me in an awful mood.\\"Bascially the book lost its heart. The author kept piling on one cruel and disgusting event on top of another. It did not feel natural, it did not feel like it had a greater purpose it just felt very pushed. I couldn't shake the feeling that the author was more interested in demonstrating her daring and how far she was willing to go rather than writing a good story. Pushing the envelope can be great if it is done in a thought-provoking and carefully crafted manner. However, it is a fine line and if you go too far too often the shock value is gone, the goodwill is gone and you are just left with a huge pile of garbage. I think the book reached this point and it made me angry because after the first half of the book I had high expectations. Pain is a major theme through the book but any higher point Dunn was trying to make about the nature of pain the second half (if there was one) got lost in the muck.Towards the end my bad feelings began to soften a bit. I don't know if it is because the author managed to bring back some of what made the first half of the book great or because the second half of the book desensitized me so much that I didn't care what happened to any of the characters any more.I suppose I would recommend this book to people with strong stomachs only because very few books have caused such a strong reaction and internal struggle in me and that has got to be worth something. Plus I have never read anything like it before and there is definitely value in originality."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"I read this book way back when it was brand new and in hardback. My (now ex)wife spotted it at a bookstore (thanks to a neon cover), and the title was enough for us. She read it first, and knowing my tastes (or lack thereof), handed it to me when she was finshed. I'm forever grateful. I couldn't remember having more fun reading a book. This is one for the same crowd that digs &quot;Eraserhead&quot; (or its milder David Lynch sibling, &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;) or any of the John Waters exercises in depravity. If you thought that &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; was stupid, you'll quite possibly read this book and wonder how ANYBODY could have enjoyed it (that is, if you make it past the first twenty pages).Part of the fun I had, though, was diving into the book with no real knowledge of what to expect. Heck, the original jacket didn't even have an illustration (as I recall, all I knew up front was that it had SOMETHING to do with a family that bred its own circus freaks). To that end, I think that the reviews do something of a disservice to the potential customer. Part of the joy of this work is seeing what kind of crazy thing will happen next. My advice is as follows. If, after reading this review (and getting a vague idea of what level of good taste NOT to expect), you're thinking about reading Geek Love, do yourself a favor. Don't read any more reviews. Just buy the darn book!"},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"To say that there's a lot going on in this book would be a vast understatement. Although I haven't decided whether or not to say, \\"I love this book!\\" when recommending it to people certainly doesn't stop me from recommending it.I suppose the most enjoyable part of reading Geek Love, for me, was that it seems the most successful articulation of the completeness of one worldview. Confused? Well, I merely think that the novel is probably closer to the way Katherine Dunn actually thinks about the world, than most writers would ever be able to properly explicate. However, as most of us know, each of our respective world views is filled with contradictions, antithetical statements and idiosyncratic stances that don't seem to quite fit in anywhere.Now, Katherine Dunn has certainly not been sabotaged by indecision anywhere near as much as the bible. Certain themes shine, uncompromising, throughout the brunt of the book. Subverted ideas of beauty, normality and relative freakishness, overlie traditional notions of the nuclear family, courtship, love and tradition.Dunn depicts an eccentric circus family wherein parents, Aloysius and Lil Binewski, repeatedly spike Lil's pregnancies \\"with illicit and prescription drugs, insecticides, and eventually radioisotopes.\\" Each child is a veritable \\"rose\\" in the happily cultivated garden of Al's creative dreaming. Although the setup may seem unnecessarily esoteric, its use as a functional metaphor and fictional tool is perfectly appropriate for Dunn's game plan.The book begins with a quaint view of the nuclear family followed by its quick subversion by physical descriptions of each child: Artie, endowed with flippers in place of limbs; Elly and Iphy, Siamese twins; hunch-backed albino, Oly (the narrator); and Chick, the telekinetic \\"norm.\\" From here, the book goes on to playfully subvert ideas on social hierarchies, beauty, \\"normality\\" and religion, leaving the reader to focus on the unifying commonality of all pieces of the novel. That is, the completely subjective design of all things social. Dunn forces the reader, over and over again, to question that which is most always taken for granted. She questions \\"natural beauty,\\" \\"natural normality,\\" human nature.However, one would be mistaken to think that all current social benchmarks are thrown out in Geek Love. Rather, beneath all of Dunn's playful subversion and conscientious objection to the idea of human \\"nature,\\" lies an in-depth look at the sociology of leaders and their followers. In addition, she looks at which leaders are more honorable, which have better reasons for doing what they do, and, in the end, who is rewarded for their respective values. Using the narrator, Oly, as a barometer for character strength, value and virtue, Katherine Dunn pits the merciless and manipulative Arty against the reclusive but virtuous Miss Lick.In the end, who is left, and who has been rewarded, does not offer the reader any solace as to Dunn's feelings toward either character. However, the ending does allow Dunn's flexible, sometimes antithetical worldview to live on in Oly's only daughter, Miranda. It is up to her, and up to the reader, both of whom the novel has been written for, to decipher Dunn's intentions. We must reconcile what is true and what is virtuous from Dunn's subtle themes and immodest plotlines. And, despite Dunn's meandering values and thematic statements, she has given us all the tools to accomplish that in Geek Love."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"The first chapter or so blew me away.. I was hooked, and I had to finish it, but I got madder as I did so. This book promises a great deal, without following through.Yes, it examines the question of who is normal and who isn't. But it fails to really face reality about this issue. The disabilities that produce disfigurements, like Siamese twinhood and having flippers instead of limbs, aren't a pain merely because society treats you as different: they can't be wished away just by growing up in a society that values them.I got tired of the nastiness, trashiness and sadism of many of the main characters in this novel. I liked Oly and Miranda and that was about it. But it was just too easy to be repulsed by many of the other people, disfigured and not, in the book. For example, from practically the start of it, I was waiting eagerly for Arty to die. By the time he did, I was downright impatient.Really good books leave me feeling transformed. This book, while it was technically very good and very gripping, just left me feeling kind of yucky. I can see where you might have your attitudes altered if you had never had to really deal with disability in your life. But I have, and I don't think this book helps matters."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"If you have a weak stomach, love Disney, or are completely repulsed by the idea of freaks, then you may want to consider passing on this book. But if you enjoy the different, the provocative or the metaphoric, then this one's for you. Not only does Dunn's prose pop and sizzle in your ears but it's also infused with the stuff of great literature--characters that come alive, ideas that spark mental-meltdown and the mirror that reflects all that we ignore, fear and wish to hide.

It was a book, that through reviews, promised a dark shadowing prespective upon life, a certain lusted after grity quality that was enduring and of constant interest to the reader. It was a book however that I could not force myself to read past the fifth chapter due to it's undeniably terrible plot, story and general writing style. It's not because I found it disturbing, most usually the more contaversial the better for me, but it was boring, it dragged along like a pitiful tin can tied to the back of a rusty car 10 years after the wedding was through and the divorce had come through. I get the idea of the story, that even though they're freaks they all love each other in their own little twisted way, but I'm sorry that theme is overrated and overused in modern literature. I got the feeling the author was attempting to be witty, and literary, knowing not that her attempts failed miserably. Oh well though, all is well that ends well I assume, which refers to the fact that I traded Geek Love in at a second hand book store for a much better book (doesn't almost anything surpass this stinker?) and even managed to get some money from it too as when you don't get past chapter 5 in a book it keeps it condition pretty damn crisp and clean."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"I've only read ten pages of this book, & I won't read anymore.I understand that it is fiction & humor.

Also, there is not a SINGLE LIKEABLE CHARACTER in this entire tale, not even the adorable and inscrutable telekinetic kid, who by the way turns nasty toward the end and begins lopping off the limbs of unwilling victims. WHY did he turn nasty, due to Arturo's evil influence (huh)? The closest to a likeable character is Miranda, but she's kinda bland. With whom am I meant to sympathize? The albino main character? I don't sympathize and I don't really get her. She's a cold blooded murderer who sort of likes her victim OK and understands her motivations in life? I merely fail to see the point; I suppose when an author fills a book with individuals with whom one could not possibly identify, you lose interest. I quite agree with the reader to argues that this book has no end. However, it doesn't have much of a beginning or a middle, either. I'll admit I finished the book, but very halfheartedly. I don't like to leave books half-read. I give the book two stars for spinning an OK plot and using some very interesting turns of phrase, but in the end I don't see the appeal here."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"The book is a slow read only because it is full of so much detail mainly about the characters. I am about half way through and it is reminiscent of Water for Elephants so far. Well I have now finished and let me just say this is the weirdest book I have ever read. It is so unbelievable in parts it makes the story difficult to read. Its saving grace is that it is totally unlike anything else out there. It took some type of imagination to conjure this up. I would not read it again and cannot see how it was a National Book Award finalist."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"Read it in a day. Could not put it down. Yes, the ending was trite, but the ending was not this book. I did hate the closing but what can you possibly do as a writer to end this sort of horrificness? That is SO not the point.I defy anyone who has read \\"Geek Love\\" (& I have only once & only need to once, so embedded in my brain is every word) to say they won't remember it forever.I was horrified & comforted. Never horrified by Arturo nor the twins nor Olivia nor their stories. What wrecked me was the truth of it. And that was the comfort.The horrible truth of \\"If I was not attractive\\" (burned with acid) what would I be?Considering I had been a lesbian gigolo up to the point of reading this, K.D. made me examine my life without mercy.I have no problem, never have, with being intense friends of the socially unacceptable. Don't care what you look like, don't care.Yes, it meanders at the end & it was not wholly satisfying but if I can remember a book I read 15 years ago? And I sell books on-line for a living & read at least 5 a week? This is the same gauge I give movies.This book Changed Me. It was horrific & I can never read it again but I will always own it.

It's different, interesting, and downright just plain wrong. *I* loved it."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"I was very disappointed in Geek Love. I read it based on a recommendation in an article from Time magazine. It was very hard for me to even finish-halfway through it I almost put it down. If I had gotten it from the library, rather than purchasing it, I would have tossed it aside quickly. The author went way overboard trying to shock the reader. It was not even realistic. The reviews for this work definitely misled me."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"After reading all of the rave reviews of this book, I was excited to finally get my hands on it. What little of it I was able to read was boring. The writing was disjointed, the story confusing, and the characters thoroughly unlikeable."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"If you like the bizarre, you'll love Geek Love.Love in/within the freakshow world provides the foundation for Dunn's work. She draws you into the &quot;abnormal&quot; world of the freakshow, and relates it out to the real world. People have feelings and Katherine Dunn shows how genetic mutants have feelings too."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"Wildly entertaining, soulfully funny and often-times difficult to swallow.Our hero is lovable and gruesome; born to a freak show family, intoa disfigured body. His cold, calculating plans bring him a following ofthe zaniest, most disturbing characters you have ever met between thecovers of a book.Be prepared for a read that will make you look inside yourself, and yoursickest, craziest fantasies and say, &quot;I'm okay!&quot; :)p.s. try to stay away from sharp objects while reading it."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"In the spirit of lower-caste Indians who cripple their children, guaranteeing them carreers in begging, the Binewski family engineers their children for unique birth-defects, providing them a life as carnival freaks.The history (and eventual downfall) of the family is interwoven with a woman's quest to protect the daughter who she had to give up as a child.The characters are complex, flawed and deeply human.This story is at once frightening, heart-breaking, funny and inspiring."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"Once I started reading this book, I simply couldn't put it down.Katherine Dunn is truly gifted, and I have encountered few other American authors who have the ability to completely captivate from the first word of a novel. This novel is at the top of my favorites list along with The Sound and the Fury, The Great Gatsby, Their Eyes Were Watching God, and One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, which alone demonstrates the caliber of the novel. I could explore the plot, but other reviewers have done so - instead, I will rather shower the book and the author with praise. I feel the need to do so because since I have finished reading this masterpiece, I have yearned to express the grandest praise I can fashion.The first few chapters may be a bit confusing because Dunn chooses to arrange them not chronologically but in a way that is best conducive to her storytelling. However, I beg all readers to look past this and delve deeper into the novel. I guarantee that it will be an exhilirating and mildly horrifying ride. The beauty of this novel lies in the fact that it will be something dramatically different to every reader. To a former English teacher of mine, it was an intensely humorous journey. To me, however, it was a tragic, aching story about love, alienation, discrimination and heartbreak. Whatever the novel will mean to you, I know that reading it will be a profound experience. Please take a chance on this book - you will be shocked at what you have discovered."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"I couldn't figure out the point. It grossed me out. It's morbid. I slogged through it because it came highly recommended. I had to force myself to finish this book. If you are interested in freaks, read Angela Carter. I could at least see the point in her books. I hated Geek Love. I kept asking myself Why?"},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"The premise of this book was really original and I thought a story so interesting would be hard to screw up. Boy, was I wrong. The only reason this book gets two stars from me is for the originality of the setting and parts of the plot. My main problems with this book were that the reader can see the events coming from a mile away. There really were no twists or surprises or suspense. This made the book a dull read. My even bigger complaint is that all of the characters were either really terrible creatures that the author may have intended to create empathy for but failed (like Arturo) or characters who are such doormats and throw their hands in the air helpless (like the main character) that I found myself hating them. The only character with any personality at all who I cared about was Elly and when she disappears from the story there was no one to root for. I also thought all the characters acted in really unrealistic ways, especially Oly. She continues to be a doormat to her brother (and more) despite some really horrible things that he does to her siblings. None of the characters felt real or acted in ways that I believed they would have. I also got annoyed because some of the events and scenes didn't flow and instead felt forced, like Dunn was trying too hard to shock me."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"Al and Lil Binewski own a failing carnival, which they revive by creating a family of freaks though chemical abuse during pregnancy. Not just standard drugs, but pesticides, radioisotopes, and more. The story is narrated by their daughter Olympia, a bald albino hunchback dwarf, who often bemoans her relative normalcy (you should see her siblings). It's a fascinating look at not only carnival life, but how we view physical beauty in general. Do we really envy those who are completely normal, or those who proudly display their differences? The description is raw, shocking, and painfully vivid, but like a carnival freak show, you just can't look away. You have to keep reading, to get a better look, to see what they'll do next. This is not the sort of book that will appeal to everyone, or even most people, but I really enjoyed it. If nothing else, it was very different from most other things I've read."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"GEEK LOVE is the story of Binewski's Fabulon, a traveling carnival owned and operated by Al and Lily Binewski. In the early days of the carnival, there isn't a lot of money to pay carnival performers; so Al and Lily decide to breed their own freak show. Lily intentionally uses illegal drugs, insecticides, and even radioisotopes during her pregnancies, and after several failed attempts (which are on display in the carnival's museum, floating in formaldehyde, their deformities revealed in all their grotesque glory), she has four successes: Arturo (aka \\"The Aqua Boy\\"), a head and torso with flippers instead of arms and legs; Iphigenia and Electra, beautiful twins who share a common set of legs; Olympia, a bald, hunch-backed albino dwarf; and the youngest, Chick, who looks like a \\"norm\\" on the outside but has telekinetic powers that are both opportune and catastrophic for the Binewski family.Olympia is our narrator, guiding us through the freaky and fantastical world of GEEK LOVE. But it's Oly's brother, Arty, who's really at the center of the story. Arty is power-hungry, malicious, bitter, calculating, jaggedly jealous. He thinks only of self-preservation, and, as a result, he can be undeniably charismatic. He's so magnetic, in fact, that he establishes his own cult. He calls his followers \\"The Arturans,\\" and he preaches salvation through the sacrifice of body parts. Olympia, for her part, is desperately in love with Arty, and she's content to be his slave, to fulfill his every wish. With Chick's help, she becomes pregnant with Arty's child--a daughter, Miranda, who is completely normal but for a curling little tail. The novel follows two storylines: the one during Oly's childhood and adolescence with the carnival; and a present-day storyline in which Oly lives in the same building as her beautiful daughter, an artist who has no idea that the grotesque hunchback she's so desperate to draw is her mother.In the pages of GEEK LOVE, nothing is off-limits: You'll meet geeks and freaks, a surgeon who joined the Fabulon after performing abdominal surgery on herself, a 26-pound newborn, hundreds of redheads, \\"The Bag Man,\\" a reporter-turned-maggot-salesman, an heir to a travel-dinner fortune who has a very interesting way of helping people, and more. GEEK LOVE is at once disgusting and morbidly fascinating, bizarre and relentlessly real, repugnant and engrossing. It'll repel you and entice you, keep you riveted and make you squeamish, break your heart and give you hope, incite within you sympathy and sorrow. There's beauty in the ugliness of it, and ugliness in the beauty of it. There are no happy endings here: just a visceral, relentless look at life on the fringe for those \\"freaks\\" we objectify and slink away from in disgust and horror.The narrative itself is imaginative and seamless; the prose is brutally raw. Dunn's novel asks us to do some soul-searching and face the little freak that lives in all of us, whether or not we're \\"norms\\" on the outside. I finished reading GEEK LOVE this morning, and several hours later (at work, no less), I just can't stop thinking about this fascinating book. It shocked me; it hit me like a punch in the gut, and I'm still trying to catch my breath. It's definitely not for everyone, but for me, this book was utterly affecting. Any book that can keep me thinking about it long after I've turned the last page, any novel that can inspire such strong emotions in me and make me think about issues so much bigger than myself, has definitely done its job. I can't give GEEK LOVE a higher recommendation than that."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"My god. I just finished this book yesterday and am still thinking about it. This (second to maybe John Irving's A Prayer for Owen Meany) might be the best work of fiction I've ever read. It was recommended for me because of my fascination with teratology and freakshows, and I was expecting some trite little biography about a geek or a pair of Siamese twins. Geek Love is NOT that. It's all my dreams and nightmares put into someone else's words.My only criticism is, I wish it were longer."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"I really loved this book! It tells the story of a carnival family headed by physically normal parents who hope to save their failing carnival by breeding their own sideshow. Their children are all the products of amature bio-engineering experiments. Even their failures are successes: the children who don't survive are displayed suspended in formaldahyde and the ones who do are circus performers. The renewed carnival is spectacularly successful. A dove-tailing storyline about a mystery millionaire heiress with an apparent fetish for body mutilation (others, not hers) adds titillation value. The characters and their actions are grotesque - but not because they're carnival freaks and geeks, rather because they are human. Lots to think about here: family dynamics, money, loyalty, greed, power, beauty and body image, religion, mental illness, medical ethics, and justice are all examined and often exposed in a different light."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"\\"And I'd figured I'd come to the end of being amazed. Run out of it, like you'd run out of sugar. But when I saw you lovely girls I thought to myself, maybe there's more to life yet.\\"An astonishing, grotesque, sharp-tongued, and lovingly written family memoir and the most entertaining work of fiction I've read in years. Reduced to archetypes, it's the story of a family struggling with its own hubris (a la the Magnificent Ambersons or Royal Tenenbaums) and a meandering reflection on small-town America -- an unsentimental road-trip comedy dotted with soft drawls, murder, prostitution, tigers, telekinesis, a cult of amputees, and lots of security guards. Think Willie Nelson and the Quay brothers collaborating in the milieu of HBO's Carnivale, and you have a rough idea of the premise and aesthetic of the novel.Though it's thoroughly entertaining, the flaws are stark: at about the two-thirds mark, Dunn steers the storytelling away from a first-person recollection to 'journalist's notes,' a decision which, depending on how you frame it, drags down the pace considerably or is a judicious bit of editing that compresses the formidable challenge of exposition and actually speeds the action. I'm not sure how I feel about it, but it's there and it gives Dunn the opportunity to drop in a few smart epigraphs that would otherwise have been non sequiturs. Some characters are painstakingly and hilariously dressed but given few lines; while I hoped that some of them would have more presence in the story arc, I know that if my obituary is to be published, I want Dunn to write it.Something else to keep in mind as you read this book: a majority of the action happens between characters who are children, at most adolescents, in the 20th century. While in the 21st century, I might no longer look upon carnivals or freaks or even acts of extreme sadism in awe, Geek Love reminded me of the thrill of audacity, and that achievement on its own is amazing to me."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"This is a tough book to review because it is definitely weird - but not so twisted that you should pass it up. I don't go out of my way looking for books this strange, but I did enjoy it. You would have to know a person pretty well to know whether they would like it or not. It kept me on the edge of my seat trying to figure out where it could possibly go after starting with such a bizarre premise."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"I was warned that this book would be very disturbing, and it is, but the shock and disgust were part of the journey. This book will take you on a very rewarding trip, to places that are unimaginable, and your guide is an albino hunchbacked dwarf named Oly. It's an unforgettable book."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"I haven't actually finished this book, but this is my second attempt. My first, when I was 16, was shadowed by a sense of wrongness, as I'm sure many people have experienced. I still pale at some of the things that happen. But my cringe is the result, now, of the feelings of disgust that swim around this novel, not for the characters or what happens. To explain why, I took a class last semester about the history of carnival and sideshow and more importantly the people considered freakish enough to be a part of them. Instead of being turned off by the characters, bizarre as they may be, it is the reaction of the &quot;norms&quot; that make me want to cry. Hate is obvious in this book, and it is the hate which we should see in the words and learn from Dunn's writing that we do not want to be the ones to hate &quot;others&quot;. Its a difficult book with a bold lesson for those ready to face it."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"So many people have weighed in on this book, there's not much I can add, except that the writing is great -- fresh, sharp, with not a cliche in sight, and the story is totally original. That counts for a lot, especially because I had just finished Empire Falls, which has a boring, predictable plot and totally mundane writing. Geek Love has a lot of over-the-top grossness and sometimes I couldn't stand to even look at it. But, unlike so many books where you know what's going to happen, I kept reading because I wanted to find out the next plot turn. Also, I think it's an interesting commentary on a couple of aspects of family: the Binewski parents do things to their children that are wrong and evil (isolate them from the world, manipulate them, teach them that family comes before anything else) -- things that happen in families in the real world; the resulting evil is the family's comeuppance. Not for everyone, but still an excellent book."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"In the highly saturated realm of fiction, this book is a refreshing and welcome change from cliche storylines. With her satirically presented view of \\"family values\\" and the deeper resentments of sibling and parent/child relations, Ms. Dunn has singlehandedly addressed the taboo of dysfunction from the perspective of those already looked upon as freaks. Even in the occasional slower parts of the book, the anticipation of \\"what could possibly happen next?\\" holds you to turning the pages. Try it!"},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"Wow. This has to be one of the best books I have ever read. Never have I been so shocked and riveted as when I read Geek Love. Katherine Dunn has explored the dark, the dirty, the freakish, and the obscene in such a way that makes these qualities seem almost beautiful. Centered around a family of circusfolk who breed children with genetic defects in order to draw crowds, Geek Love will draw you into those parts of this world that you are used to pretending don't exist. This is truly fearless writing; Dunn took a chance and she succeeded. Dunn exemplifies key aspects of human nature in her characters. Most interesting is Arturo, a young boy who is raised as a sideshow oddity like his siblings. Arturo functions as an eye that watches and observes how us humans work. He is in a perfect position to do this, as he is not really a member of &quot;normal&quot; society. His reflections and, ultimately,his actions, shed light on those parts of life that we usually shove out of our minds. This is truly a beautiful novel."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"I saw this book in a store, thought the title looked funny and flipped it over to see what it was about. I had never heard of the author. Well, I thought it sounded like a fascinating story, so I bought it. The beginning is a little slow and confusing, but I will say this: persevere and you will be rewarded! The middle section of this book is the best! Reading about all these \\"freaks\\", who still have human thoughts and feelings, it is both unsettling and nice at the same time. The ending was too abrupt, but all in all, a very different, interesting read. I dare somebody to make it into a movie!"},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"This book was definitely a very interesting read. I ripped through it in only a few days, which is rare for me.Dunn's tale of the carnival (Perhaps the same one portrayed in Bradbury's _Something Wicked This Way Comes_?) is engrossing and a subject which can be totally fictionalized in my mind (and I assume most readers) due to lack of firsthand knowledge. The fantasy world that Dunn creates is thoroughly entertaining if not chilling.The writing is excellent; Dunn's style is highly descriptive, visually, and flows quite well. Aside from a few dull spots, the book has a very quick and witty pace.This book would have received five stars were it not for the end... Dunn seems to have forgotten that there are three parts to a book, each equally important: Beginning, middle, and end.The beginning is captivating and shocking. The middle I've already discussed. The end, unfortunately, is totally abrupt and undeveloped. My only guess is that Dunn ran out of steam and just wanted to finish the project as quickly as possible.Still, this is a great read and I recommend it. Just don't expect complete satisfaction."},{"Title":"GEEK LOVE.","review":"This book amazed me in that it simultaneously disgusted and amused me. It is such a freakish setting and subject, yet Dunn manages to create real charcaters that I really cared about. It is unforgettable, whether you like it or not, and the perfect book for those who need a little of the dark side in their literature every once in a while."},{"Title":"The Chaos Clock (Contemporary Kelpie)","review":"This fantasy story has it all! The dream parts where the children had to make a decision between good and bad was exciting as was when the museum came to life. My children and I cannot wait to read the sequel! This was an awesome book!"},{"Title":"The Chaos Clock (Contemporary Kelpie)","review":"A perfect summer-holiday page-turner for the under 12's. The Chaos Clock has insider value for readers who know Edinburgh, but whether they do or not Gill Arbuthnott is guaranteed to engage them with a classic good vs evil adventure. Owing a lot to writers like Susan Cooper, the story is an addition to the canon of tales of great powers holding our lives in the balance. Kate and David, the children at the centre of the story are believable contemporary kids (where this firmly differs from Susan Cooper's 1960s creations). David's personal history, with his mother's death haunting him, adds a bit of grit to the narrative. Kate's family is nicely drawn - particularly the slightly harassed mother and toddler Ben.Over all The Chaos Clock is short sweet and lively. The perfect recipe for quiet children on a not-too-long flight or car journey with the added pleasure that I enjoyed it a whole lot myself too. I look forward to its sequel."},{"Title":"Boat Trailers and Tow Vehicles: a User's Guide","review":"This is the only book I could find covering boat trailers. It is very well written and informative.

It's the sort of book that's easy to carry and worth carrying because when you sit down to read it you're happy you have it. There are six essays by seven authors. Two essays are outstanding. The first is by Billy Collins, not really my type of poet in the large picture, but he's accessible, which I think is the goal of the book. He pursues the question of what happens to us when we read a poem and he approaches the possible answers from a variety of points touching on the someplace else-ness of a poem or the way it asks readers to slow down. For me the most memorable essay was by Yusef Komunyakaa and I marked quite a few passages that I will reconsider as I continue writing and planning future classes. I suggest getting a copy, for these two essays alone. However, if you take my recommendation, don't get mad if you find a pedantic essay about meter (that I felt was better presented in other books)or other less than compelling pieces. That said, I think what Citino has done is admirable because we can never have too many books where poets speak to their processes and passions."},{"Title":"Principles of Molecular Mechanics","review":"This book is perfect if you are looking for a purely theoretical treatment of the subject.

The sense of identity that language lessons and lunches in Chinatown never accomplish, happens dramatically when she witnesses a news broadcast of the Tiananmen Square massacre, and results in her return to China at the age of twenty to try to track down her birth parents. The circumstances of her birth and abandoment comes out gradually, from several points of view.Despite being nominated for the American Library Association's Best Books for Young Adults, this reads like adult fiction to me, especially with the complexity of the narrative (multiple points of view and timeshifts--but it's not as confusing as it sounds). Adjectives include lyrical, bittersweet and Canadian."},{"Title":"Throwaway Daughter","review":"This book must be read as a fictional story. Unfortunately, many readers will come away thinking that they are now more informed on how international adoption in China results. An analogy would be thinking that \\"true love\\" was illustrated through a Harlequin romance novel.As an adoptive mother of two girls from China, I read this book initially with anticipation that this might be a book that I would introduce to them. Unfortunately, it is the author's romanticized, sanitized version of how female infants come to be abandoned by their birth parents and subsequently adopted by foreigners. This book should be read after one reads \\"A Bitter Leaf in the Wind\\", the author's autobiography which details how she came to her decision to leave her own 9-year-old daughter to pursue a relationship with a married American man, William Bell (who also had children). Then perhaps one could appreciate that this novel (i.e. Throwaway Daughter) is possibly the author's way of assuaging her own guilt for abandoning her own daughter \\"for better opportunities.\\" Unfortunately, the opportunity was for the author herself, not her own child. This is quite unlike the situation whereby these foundlings are left so that better opportunities could be had for these children.This book is entertaining in following the path of one searching for oneself through looking for one's roots, but is definitely not meant to be educational about the complex issue of adoption. Read it with this in mind.For more factual account of Chinese adoption, I would recommend \\"Wanting a Daughter, Needing a Son\\" by Kay Ann Johnson."},{"Title":"Throwaway Daughter","review":"Dong-Mei also known as Grace Parker, was left on the steps of an orphanage in China. Luckily, a kind family in Canada was looking for another child to add in their family and decided to look for one but it wasn't easy. Lots of orphanages didn't accept the Parkers offer as supposedly, a family couldn't adopt a child if they already have one. When the Parkers finally located the orphanage in China, after lots of paperwork and tons of time, a picture of the baby girl they were adopting was sent to Canada. As Grace adapted to her family in Canada, she always hated the thought of her birth mother. How she had abandoned her, but as she thought of it more and more, she wanted to meet her mother to figure out why.Thus Grace begins her long journey in her teen years across the world to locate her mother. A quest that takes her to China but what she discovers will change her life forever."},{"Title":"Throwaway Daughter","review":"If you want to tell the truth, it's best to tell it in a story. Facts are static and just get in the way. And the novel The Throwaway Daughter tells many truths about the nature of chinese adoption on both a micro and macro level. Still, it is important to remember that this is fiction, and uses all of the creative licenses as such.If you have an investment or connection to adoption from China, I would say this is a 5 star novel. The description of the novel does not do it justice and is inaccurate. Only about 40% of the novel is told from the point of view of the girl, (and then young woman) adopted from China. The rest of the novel is told from the first person point of view of the rest of the players-- the adoptive mother, the birth mother, the birth mothers family, the birth fathers family, and the woman who took in the abandoned child and worked to get her adopted. I saw none of them being made villians, but some are made saints.The writing is clever, nifty, and most importantly doesn't get in the way of an incredible story. And the writer took some chances with this novel for sure. Taking the incredible dynamic of Chinese adoption, which I find both tragic and miraculous, and making an ending that is a near fairy-tale despite the cultural and societal horrors. And the words and perspectives of Dong-mei's view towards her birth mother are sure to raise discussion. The novel did bring me to tears at times. To me, it did what a novel is supposed to do... it made me look forward to reading it, captured me, and made me think about it and reflect long after it was over."},{"Title":"Throwaway Daughter","review":"Baby Dong-Mei is abandoned, left in front of an orphanage in China. Like many other baby girls born soon after the one-child policy, she is unwanted by her own family before they even get to know her.

Her adoptive parents do their best to help her find her roots. She doesn't want anything to do with that and is rather bitter about her biological parents. (I mean, they left her!)OK So, she grows up, learns Chinese, travels to see the world (well, China), and discovers things about her past, and people, and life, basically.The story is told from Grace and many others' perspectives. It gets the most intense when Chun-mei relates her story and what happened when Grace was born. She tells about the the stress, the expectation of a boy, and the reactions of the family when they are confronted with what they fear most--a baby girl. This is almost like Not-YA. The topics that it touches on are heavy: boy-preferences, one-child policy, murder of baby girls, arranged marriage, adoption. Whew!It is a good read. Leave you much to think about. Well written.

Which is why I turn to books like this, or Greene's _The Elegant Universe_. Let me try to explain what this book is trying to do, and how, for one proverbial intelligent layman, it stacks up.Susskind is a man with a mission. What he's describing here is not settled science, but his own view of the direction fundamental physics should be trying to go. In order to describe that properly, of course, he has to explain a good deal of settled physics along the way. He does this engagingly and fairly clearly, though he doesn't have the truly remarkable expository gifts of Brian Greene, and I strongly recommend that anyone who wants to tackle this book should read _Elegant Universe_ first.The book has two tightly intertwined main theses. The first has to do with the Anthropic Principle: the observation that a large number of physical constants are required to fall within a surprisingly narrow range of values, in order for the apparatus of biology ever to appear. Slight tweaks to any of them would make galaxies, stars, atoms, chemical elements heavier than helium, to say nothing of carbon based life forms, impossible. Susskind's thesis here is that the AP is neither, as many theists would like to claim, evidence for a Designer who tailored the universe to make us possible; nor, as secular physicists would like to claim, an uninteresting tautology requiring no explanation. Rather, its explanation is to be found in the last decades' developments in string theory.His second thesis is that these developments - especially the way in which string theory, which was originally hoped could prove mathematically that the various physical constants could have only one uniquely determined set of values, turned out to be a family of five, then many, then mind bogglingly many, distinct theories - are not the intellectual catastrophe some have felt them to be. Rather they are an argument in favor of the truth of string theory, because the innumerable variations in the laws of physics permitted by the various string theories provides a naturalistic explanation for the Anthropic Principle. To wit: cosmic inflation creates innumerable new universes all the time, each with its own set of physical constants, and it is not surprising that some of them should have laws (and in particular a value for Einstein's cosmological constant, which is more extremely constrained than any of the others) which permit life to arise. The collection of all these possible universes, by analogy with the \\"fitness landscapes\\" of evolutionary theory in biology, is what Susskind designates as \\"the cosmic landscape\\" of the title.There are a lot of problems with this point of view. Susskind considers them, and argues enthusiastically, subtly and fairly that none of them is a show stopper. In the end, I felt he failed to close the sale. Until someone solves what he calls the \\"measure problem\\", the whole scheme is dead in the water. Further, we are never given a positive reason to believe in the truth of string theory, other than the fact that no other consistent theory unifying gravity and quantum mechanics has surfaced yet.In his final chapter, Susskind tries to summarize the disparate attitudes of a dozen major living theorists toward this emerging Landscape picture. The two most telling criticisms come from physicist David Gross. The book gives them a pretty fair hearing , and doesn't claim to dispose of them.First, if we adopt the idea that the physical constants have randomly created values, the enterprise of trying to explain why they have the particular values they do comes to a dead halt - perhaps prematurely. \\"Quantum fluctuations did it\\" puts the kibosh on further inquiry as surely as \\"God did it\\" would. Second, we don't really know how wide a range of physical constants could produce life and intelligence in *some* form.Those who are looking for a primer on string theory, or on the latest truths that scientists have learned and agreed on, won't find it here. But if you are interested in the Anthropic Principle, or in the ferment of controversies at the edge of the presently knowable, you won't have to agree with Susskind to take delight, as I did, in colorfully articulated, intriguing, and frequently illuminating read."},{"Title":"COSMIC LANDSCAPE: String Theory & The Illusion Of Intelligent Design (H)","review":"Is this book just what I wanted? Well, what I think I really wanted was for Einstein to return to us today and write a book on the philosophy of modern physics based on today's understanding of things. Yes, that would have been just great! But Einstein is dead. Luckily, of course, there are some excellent physicists around, such as the author of this book.This book, written by an eminent String Theorist, has some fine explanations for the layman of some topics in modern physics, including String Theory. But the most interesting part is advertised in the title, namely the nature of the cosmic landscape.The cosmic landscape refers to the mathematical space which has as its elements the values of the \\"fields\\" that constitute the physical laws and constants which apply to a particular \\"universe\\" (with a small u) or \\"pocket universe\\" if one prefers that term. The idea is that there may be many possible sets of physical laws and constants. The more we discover about physics, the more it seems that there are plenty of possible universes. But do they really exist? That is, is the landscape populated by more than our known universe? Is it heavily populated? The author argues that it is. And that certainly makes sense to me.We're told about the anthropic principle. At its simplest, this principle merely states that we have to live in a universe that permits intelligent life. That's not very profound. But this principle also suggests that there is indeed a landscape of possible universes, and it encourages us to verify that only a very small fraction of them would permit the kind of complexity required for intelligent life. And in fact, Susskind gives us a good example of this. It turns out that the Cosmological Constant (which causes a universal repulsive force, sort of the opposite of gravity) we observe is about 120 orders of magnitude less than an unsophisticated theory might predict. That leaves us with a very tiny number to explain, a number which is fundamental to the laws of our universe. Well, sure enough, there appears to be an anthropic reason. Susskind tells us that Steven Weinberg calculated that a constant even ten times bigger would result in enough repulsion so that the clumpiness of the early universe would have been reduced so much that no galaxies, stars, or planets would have formed. Similarly, a large cosmological constant with the opposite sign would have caused our early universe to collapse.Given that there may be a large multiplicity of actual universes, how do they originate? Since we appear to be in a rather unusual universe, it is tempting to hypothesize that there's some sort of selection principle at work. But what? We get into questions about a possible evolution of universes. But this could be quite different than evolution in biology. Are there incremental changes between generations of universes, and if so, how? Susskind doubts that changes are incremental. Are there universes that produce large numbers of other universes, given that there are no obvious selection benefits to having fewer offspring? As Susskind says, we see no mechanism to cause competition for resources. Are we in a produced universe, a producing universe, or both? If our universe is a producer, do miscellaneous black holes each produce new universes? Well, according to Susskind, they don't: the production mechanism he suspects is dominant is the cloning of space due to the metastability of the vacuum.I think it helps to remind ourselves that if there is a large system of pretty much random entitites, that system will be dominated by the biggest ones. If time exists, that system will soon be dominated by not just the biggest, but the most stable and longest-lived ones. And those objects that produce, get produced, or are reproducing (or even better, reproducing in a manner than permits improvements) have a huge advantage. That applies to the Earth's biosphere, and presumably it applies to Reality as a whole.Susskind discusses the \\"many-worlds\\" interpretation of quantum mechanics. In this version, when there is a random choice of polarizations for a particle (or a random choice of which slit a photon traveled through), both possibilities actually occur, but in different aspects of reality! That works mathematically, although it does produce a truly huge number of alternate realities. Susskind does say that this is a little like the huge number of alternate realities of the cosmic landscape. But there is a difference which he admits. The many-worlds alternatives all have the same physical laws, while the cosmic landscape does not.The book includes a very good discussion of the question about possible information loss in a black hole. Stephen Hawking used to argue that such an information loss actually occurs. Susskind and \`t Hooft argued that information has to be conserved, and that it must somehow be stored outside the black hole, and Hawking now has conceded this point. And we also learn about black hole complimentarity, which helps explain all this by making it clear that information has no definite location in space.I truly enjoyed this book, and I strongly recommend it."},{"Title":"COSMIC LANDSCAPE: String Theory & The Illusion Of Intelligent Design (H)","review":"I a bit mystified as to why so many book reviews center around God. This is a book about physics, about using the scientific method to find out how our universe works. Indeed, it even discusses our latest tentative views about many possible universes (an infinite number of them?) might work.This book does touch on religion at one major point. Most traditional theists, including Jews, Christians and Muslims, assume that this is the only possible universe, created by God. Modern day science - which physicists fully admit is incomplete - shows that our particular universe has a number of constants, a change of which would likely make life as we know it impossible. This has been seized upon by theists as proof of God's existence and creation of the universe. Unfortunately, this is both bad science and bad theology. I don't have time to fully explain why, but I can summarize the problem: It is a \\"God of the Gaps\\" argument, which makes God smaller and more inconsequential with every subsequent discovery.As for the actual physics content of the book, it is great. It is not meant to focus on string theory alone (for that see \\"The Elegant Universe\\" by Brian Greene), but it does discuss string theory in some detail, with useful diagrams. Susskind also discusses cosmology, branes, M-theory and other related ideas."},{"Title":"COSMIC LANDSCAPE: String Theory & The Illusion Of Intelligent Design (H)","review":"The first thing to note is Professor Susskind's insistence on using 14 billion years as the time since the Big Bang whereas most authorities today give 13.7 billion years. That of course is a minor point. More troubling is Susskind's unconvincing and quixotic support of the anthropic principle in cosmology. He characterizes the principle as \\"really shorthand for a much richer set of concepts that I will make clear in the chapters that follow.\\" (p. 7)Unfortunately--perhaps revealing the poverty of my discernment--after reading nearly four hundred pages of rather dense text I was not able to appreciate his \\"richer set of concepts.\\" What I do know is that \\"The Anthropic Cosmological Principle\\" (title of John D. Barrow and Frank J. Tipler's book from 1986), which I like to call the \\"anthropic cosmological fallacy,\\" is really a kind of mystical expression that declares we are here only because of a miraculous series of events or conditions, when in fact we are here precisely because we are the sort of creatures that those events and conditions allow.A better way to state the cosmological anthropic principle is simply this: if things in the universe were not as they are we would not be here. This avoids the unfortunate suggestion that somehow we cause the universe to be the way it is. We cause nothing. We are a result--an example--of what is possible considering the way the universe is. Notice \\"a\\" result, \\"an\\" example. Other beings might be here if the laws were different.On page 363 Susskind writes that the anthropic principle \\"provides marvelous explanatory power for questions like, why is the cosmological constant small?\\" But this is not so. It happens that a small cosmological constant is compatible with a universe that allows life as we know it to exist. Again there is no causation, and life itself provides no explanation for a small cosmological constant. If aphids appear in your garden we can say that they would not appear in your garden if you grew cacti instead of vegetables. This does not mean that the growing of vegetables caused the existence of aphids. It merely says that of all the places that aphids could exist, your vegetable garden is one of them.In the glossary Susskind defines the anthropic principle as \\"The principle that requires the laws of nature to be consistent with the existence of intelligent life.\\" If we turn this around and say that \\"the physical characteristics of intelligent life must be consistent with the laws of nature,\\" we can better see the direction of causality and why most physicists consider the anthropic principle to be vacuous.It would help a lot if Susskind and others when they use phrases such as \\"for life to develop\\" to include the left-out qualification \\"for life to develop AS WE KNOW IT.\\" That way they will be reminded that all this \\"fine-tuning\\"(a phrase that implies a fine-tuner, by the way) they are raving about is just an after-the-fact projection of an anthropomorphic perspective.Another problem I had with this book is Susskind's unrelenting endorsement of string theory as something proven and true, as something \\"discovered.\\" Also annoying is his answer to the fact that string theory has no--zero--experimental support: namely that experimental support isn't really necessary. See especially Chapter Nine \\"On Our Own?\\" in which he speculates on whether the Standard Model in particle physics (and of course string theory) could have been discovered without experimental verification. It might be better if Susskind said that he and the others \\"designed\\" or \\"created\\" string theory instead of saying they \\"discovered\\" it, which suggests that string theory is somehow true. A mathematical representation of the world is what they \\"discovered.\\"I also don't think that Susskind did a very good job of explaining why we should believe that string theory is an accurate description of our universe. I had the sense of a man trying to support his prodigal son by saying \\"Trust me he's going to turn out right\\" despite the fact that he hasn't done anything yet to prove it. \\"Just see how good-looking he is!\\" Well string theory may be a beautiful mathematical edifice, but until some beautiful experimental support comes along, it will remain as it objectively is, just one way of describing reality.Curiously, after all the confident expressions about the truth of string theory, Susskind describes string theory as \\"our best guess for a theory of nature.\\" (p. 302) A guess!By the by, Susskind explains that after many years famed physicist Stephen Hawking gave up his heretical idea that information is lost in black holes and came around to agree with Susskind and most physicists that information cannot be lost. What is not mentioned in this book is Hawking's addendum. I suspect it is not mentioned since it amounts to a satire on Susskind's position. What Hawking said was that the information lost in black holes in this part of the \\"megaverse\\" would be preserved in other parts in which there are no black holes. In other words, Hawking came up with an argument, like that of Susskind's Landscape, which relied on information from parts of the universe which can never be reached! The salient point is that his statement, like the reality of Susskind's \\"Landscape,\\" cannot be proven one way or the otherSometimes we reveal ourselves and our ideas without meaning to. In reference to the idea of supersymmetry, Susskind writes, \\"...the whole exercise was only a mathematical game, a pure theoretical exploration of a new kind of symmetry that a world--some world not our own--might possess.\\" (p. 241)Could this be an unconscious but accurate expression of the true nature of string theory?"},{"Title":"COSMIC LANDSCAPE: String Theory & The Illusion Of Intelligent Design (H)","review":"This is an excellent book, by a clear writer, who has big ideas, and expresses them well. I recommend reading this book, then reading a critic of String theory, Lee Smolin's The Trouble With Physics.Leonard Susskind is the original inventor of String Theory over 25 years ago, and has now merged its latest permutations with Inflationary cosmology to produce a theory of everything. Susskind throughout the book talks about how he spends much of his time trying to figure out how to explain esoteric ideas in physics to laymen. I have an undergraduate degree in physics, and have read perhaps a dozen books on cosmology, and was able to follow this book fairly well. I am a \\"layman\\" compared to Susskind, but have a much stronger astrophysics background than most \\"laymen\\", so take warning. Understanding this book is not as easy as falling off a log.His starting point is that Fine Tuning is a legitimate argument - that our universe is fine tuned to create life to a bizarre degree. I will not present his rationale for Fine Tuning. He for many years rejected the Fine Tuning claims, but became convinced himself when the Cosmological Constant was shown to be very small but positive. Since the possible range of the CC is huge, and anything but zero or very close to zero values will lead to very short-lived universes, or ones with no matter concentrations, many physicists assumed that the CC was somehow forced to be zero, by unknown physics laws. That it is not was startling to astrophysicists, and for Susskind this was the last straw to support a Fine Tuning argument.There are two ways we know of to get Fine Tuning, design or evolutionary selection. Selection requires multiple random options to select between, and because he rejects Design, this is where Susskind goes. He proposes the Anthropic Principle, in which virtually infinite universes are created, and only the very, very, very few which are habitable are ever observed by sentient life.To take you through his reasoning requires a peculiar journey through speculative physics. Inflation is what happens when the vacuum fluctuations of virtual particles in empty space sum up to a positive value. This positive term ends up producing a repulsion force against anything which has mass, meanwhile the virtual particles themselves DO have a mass, and the repulsion exceeds their gravitational attraction - which causes space to grow. The Cosmological Constant is the bulk term which describes the speed at which growth occurs. Since this new space is also filled with the same virtual particle field, mass is basically being created from nothing. The current Big Bang model is based on an initial high value of the CC, and then a drop down to our current very, very, very small but positive CC.String theory has an explanation for the CC, as well as for everything else. String theory started with an attempt to describe the behavior of quarks and other similar elementary particles. Some behave like elastic strings with masses at each end, and others like three strings linked like a Y, each with a mass at the end. This part of the theory is very solid. It was then extended to all the rest of physics. When one tries to explain the behavior of all the other elementary particles and forces using a similar model, a model CAN describe approximately our suite of particles and forces, but it requires 11 dimensions plus time (8 of these dimensions are rolled up rather than extended, which is why our universe looks 3-dimentionsla rather than 11-dimensional). Currently none of the models produced quite work out, so String Theorists have kept coming up with variations on the equations which can add features which might let them actually match our universe. As a minimum, they add things like shape, twist, flux, branes (string localizers) of various dimensions, shape for the branes, and singularities to the equations for each dimension. This produces a near infinite number of possible \\"String Theories\\", and a near infinite number of variables to dial to fit our world. Within the theory, the CC, fundamental forces, and elementary particles all could be different with a different set of dimensions, shapes, fluxes, branes, etc.One way to bring order to this is that not all possible combinations are stable. Basically, if there is an adjacent state which has a lower energy level (translates to a lower CC), frictional effects will lead a possible universe to drop to the lower state. What this means is that only local energy minima (valleys in a rough surface) are stable, and any universe that exists for any length of time must be in one of these en43ergy minima valleys.Susskind adopts the Eternal Inflation hypothesis of Alan Guth and Andrei Linde, and assumes that there is some initial stable high CC state. Quantum effects cause fluctuations in these String Theory properties, and if they lead to a lower energy state than the locally stable one, this fluxuation acts as a crystal seed for the spreading transition of the high CC region to the lower one. BUT, since the high CC region is inflating faster than the new lower one, the transition to the new lower one is slower than the growth of the old higher CC space, and the high CC universe never goes away, it just has infinite bubbles of lower CC inside it. Each of these likewise can spontaneously create new lower CC regions within them, each of which will continue creating infinite space a well.This view of the world - a inflating field of extremely high energy and high CC, with an infinite number of mini universes inside it that have bubbled out, is what Susskind calls his Cosmic Landscape. He proposes that our universe is one of these bubbles. To match the history of our universe, our bubble would have had to initially form near a trough leading to our valley, because inflation was initially high for a while (moving down a fairly level trough), then quickly dropped to our current rate.String Theory, and this Infinite Multiverse have been criticized as non-scientific. A recently published critical book on string theory is titled Not Even Wrong which is the ultimate dismissal in science. A claim which is untestable in principle is worse than wrong, it is not science, and useless. Susskind is defensive about this, and challenges what the definition of science is. He asserts that science is whatever scientists are doing - and in his world scientists engage in extensive speculative mathematics, with virtually no possibility of experimental tests. When people try to redefine science because what they are doing does not fit the definition is generally considered a fairly definitive failing, and was cited in the Intelligent Design court case as definitive proof that Intelligent Design is not science. It is not good news for Susskind that he is sharing the tactics of the ID movement.Scientific ideas to go through three steps: speculation, hypothesis, and theory. I don't think String Theory has quite mastered the hypothesis category yet, and the Landscape and Multiverse are still only speculations. A very legitimate critique is that the concepts just bring in too many free variables. Each one is another assumption, and anyone who has ever tried to fit a curve to data knows that once your free variables equal or exceed your data, then you have ZERO confidence in the predictive ability of the curve-fit.[Unfortunately only physical scientists and engineers ever fit anything other than straight lines to data. If anyone is interested, try putting three points not in a line on a piece of paper. A straight line will at best approximate them. But one can hit all the points with a wavy curve of almost any shape. But since a curve which comes in and goes off the top of the paper, and hits all the points fits the data as well as one that comes in off the bottom or either edge, there is no confidence in the predictive power of these curves. With the straight line, you have some confidence, and it is related to the number of data points minus the constants used to create the curve (2 for a line), divided by the number of data points. So the near infinite variables of string theory vs. only 100 or so fundamental constants and properties of our universe that the theory deals with gives zero confidence in the predictive power of that theory.]For my own interest, I have tried to spell out the major assumptions of Susskind in his Landscape fusion of String Theory and Inflation.1-8 There are 8 additional dimensions to space.9 The properties of everything are dependent on features of these 11 dimensions,10 The features include whether a dimension unrolls11 Also the shape of the dimension (number of holes)12 Also number of twists13 Also the flux value (integer) in each hole14 Also number of 1-D branes (termination surfaces for strings)15 Also number of 2-D branes16 Also number of 3-D branes17 Also number of 4-D branes18 Also number of 5-D branes (I don't think any go higher than 5 now, not sure)19 Whether any branes are negative (mentioned but not explained by Susskind)20 Shape of the branes21 Twist properties of the branes22 Number of singularities (different from black holes)23 TBD other mathematical structures24 Specific string properties which create the elementary particles and fundamental forces (not sure if these are set by all of the above or not)25 All of the above define the vacuum energy, and thus the cosmological constant (CC)26 A high CC creates an inflating universe27 Inflating universes can create mass and energy out of nothing, but it is all in balance, since gravitational energy is negative and exactly balances all the positive energy.28 Fluxuations in the vacuum energy create transitions to lower CC regions within the inflating space29 The \\"friction\\" transitioning from a higher to lower CC is released in the form of an elementary particle plasma (read hot Big Bang)30 There is a texture to the Landscape of vacuum energy states, and new bubbles of a CC will transition down the slope of this landscape until they reach a local minima, or valley.31 Only lower CC states can appear, not higher (not sure why)32 There is a continuing cascade to a zero CC level (string theory models can easily create negative CC, so not sure why things stop at zero, negative CC would be lower energy than zero, so I think the model should not stop. This is a problem for the Landscape, because if high negative CCs are the innate end point of the Landscape, all the universes will eventually just puff out)33 Lot and lots of local minima exist (close to infinite, I think it depend on when you give up speculation on new arbitrary structures in the String Theory model)34 All these local minima are actually reachable from the particular high CC local minima of the Eternal Inflation field. (this assumption is one where the non-science accusation may be valid. Most of the minima will be vary far in properties from the starting condition, and the probability of a quantum fluxuation or tunneling effect reaching a distant state rather than the closest alternate state is vanishingly small. But by postulating an infinite multiverse of Eternal Inflation, it would not matter if one state had 200 orders of magnitude greater probability of being reached - all possible states will be populated with infinite numbers of bubble universes.)35 Anthropic Principle - life is rare and will only arise in an exotic very, very, few local minima which can support complex chemistry, and have long term stability. That is why our universe is exotic and unusually stable.36 Our universe had a CC that started in a nearly flat-bottomed trough that lead to our steep-sided valleyAs you can see, at just the major assumption level, this speculation/hypothesis is quite a doozy.It is science however, and there are a number of predictions made by these theories. The confirmed ones include:* Flatness of the universe* Homogeneity of the universe* Size of galactic and galactic cluster mass concentrationsThe unconfirmed ones include:* At the very largest mass structure level, we will see the effect of a higher CC as the universe settled into the bottom of the trough* A string theory model corresponds to our universe* A series of string theory models correspond to the trough leading to our current valley* Our universe has an edge with different properties, since it is continually transitioning high CC space around us into our low CC space (and we may be able to see a property variation, depending on how close we are to that edge. Note this is my own conclusion, not Susskind's)* Portions of our universe may or have already spontaneously dropped to a lower CC level. These regions would grow within our universe, and be observable.* Gravitons have zero mass, and behave like closed loop strings rather than strings with ends.There are also two predictions which currently are falsified:* Our CC is calculable and small based on string theory (the math sums up to infinity - in order to get a finite CC they throw out all numbers larger than a certain arbitrary value)* All the particles for which no rotational inertia has been observed to date (electrons, neutrinos, photons), actually have rotational inertiaSince the confirmations to date all are just part of the Big Bang with Inflation model, and really have nothing to do with either Eternal Inflation, String Theory, or the Landscape, all of these ideas are currently unsupported by any observations. Having two contradicting observations is also a problem - but a common one for hypotheses as they work out their bugs.I consider this hypothesis, however, to be the most coherent and complete materialist hypothesis I have ever seen for the formation of the universe. But please note what it includes:* by my count 36 major assumptions - most of which are not confirmable in any way* Another substrate to the universe other than the material, which is more fundamental, and from which the material emerged.* Assumptions with infinite properties* No explanation for where the original high CC Eternal Inflating space came fromCompare these features with the critiques of religious theories of the origin of the universe. The ill-defined infinite properties of God are criticized, as is the inability to explain God's origin, the complexity of assuming another substrate to the universe, and lots and lots of unconfirmable assumptions.I really liked Susskind's book. He is a clear writer, and both a clear thinker and a very big thinker. I suspect Susskind has gone wrong early in String Theory, and strings are not really applicable to electrons, neutrinos, and photons, based on their not having rotational inertia. The reason he thinks they must be strings is that otherwise the interactions between these particles and the string-based particles run into a summing-to-infinity problem. Since he is just ignoring a similar problem in calculating the CC, I didn't see why one was a convincing argument to him that that everything was strings, and the other summing to infinity problem is dismissible. Once this summing problem is readdressed, and an answer to it found, I suspect a simpler partial string and partial particle theory will replace String Theory, and I don't know if this Landscape concept would survive.Lee Smolin's The Trouble With Physics The Rise of String Theory, the Fall of a Science, and What Comes Next, provides a useful set of objections to counter Susskind's optimism over his Landscape theory. Smolin points out three important facts that Susskind left out. The first is that before String Theory, there were about a dozen attempts to unify quantum gravity and general relativity -- all of them were mathematically consistent, but every one made predictions that were tested and falsified. Susskind is advocating that Physics be judged by mathematical consistency rather than experiment, but if we had not tested previosly, we would now be using one of those falsified theories rather than String Theory.The second point is that the hidden dimensions of String Theory are unstable. Quantum fluxuations cause them to spontaneously collapse, or inflate to infinity like our three conventional dimensions. The ONLY way String Theory can lock them down so they are stable AND hidden is if they have a more complex shape than just being rolled into a tube. String Theory has a prediction -- hidden dimensions will unroll -- that is disproven by observation. What Susskind did not describe was the special case for these extra dimensions, which is the only way they could be stable, is that each must have at least two holes in it, and that each hole must have one or several charged Branes wrapped around the surface (basically a pretzel shape is the least complex stable shape). Only then will they stay stable and hidden. This is a bizarre kluge to the theory that makes it effectively absurd.The third point is that String Theory for most of its history predicted a negative or zero cosmological constant. Theorists worked with the zero CC versions until a small positive CC was discovered. Then they found a way to further kluge the theory. That is what the negative branes were invented for. Branes are an imagined surface or shape (can be from 1 to 5 D) that the ends of strings must stay connected to. They were first imagined in 2-D as membranes, then expanded into more Ds, and called D-branes, or just Branes. A negative brane was never explained by Susskind, and I suspect it is just a mathematical artifact to somehow bring the vacuum energy to a positive value. The addition of them to String theory is another patch to deal with a contrary observation.Smolin points out that good theories are usually quickly confirmed by observations, and they suggest all sorts of new and surprising things which then advance physics in other areas. The theories that have been discarded in physics are the ones which try to be kluged up with special cases to deal with one embarrassing observation after another. This looks to me to be the case with String Theory. Smolin started his book with 5 big questions that faced physics 30 years ago, when String Theory first became the dominant idea in theoretical physics, and that NONE of these have been solved in the last 30 years. He thinks it is due to physics departing from testability, and embracing a theory which is infinitely klugable and non-falsifiable -- and as a result the experimentalists have been starved of viable theories to test to advance our understanding of these issues.Smolin is as good and clear a writer as Susskind, and he has a better case, since he does not try to hide embarrassing facts, nor attack the principle of experimental confirmability at the core of science. Reading the two together, Smolin blows Susskind out of the water -- String Theory is a dead end. Despite this judgement, I still reccommend the book as very enjoyable and thought provoking."},{"Title":"COSMIC LANDSCAPE: String Theory & The Illusion Of Intelligent Design (H)","review":"Very illuminative book in understanding the present state of the relevant physics and cosmology.Really, we have no need of intelligent design theory if progress in science goes on.Although the book is full of analogies and slogans instead of formulas, it provides a good overview of physics and cosmology.The book is written in a lively way and thought provoking with challenging concepts."},{"Title":"COSMIC LANDSCAPE: String Theory & The Illusion Of Intelligent Design (H)","review":"I am a lay reader with an enduring interest in particle physics and cosmology, so have read many accounts of the history of physics and quantum mechanics and more recent developments in string theory and cosmology. Susskind's book is among the better works of this genre for two particular reasons.The first is related to the way he exposits the material, which holds to a less descriptive but more analytical style. By this I mean that he walks the reader through thoughts and experiments by placing the reader in the context of the idea or discovery and has the reader think along with him as he uncovers or reveals what comes next. This makes the book engaging, and yet, more challenging, because it's easier to absorb descriptive detail, even complex description, then to have to think through each sentence and paragraph. Susskind's style is unusually clear, yet The Cosmic Landscape is a somewhat difficult, yet ultimately satisfying, read because he takes his reader seriously, and the reader finds that the author delivers the goods.The second reason I commend this work is that Susskind considerately employs many simple diagrams, some of which are modified Feynman diagrams, but others of which are unique to his book, and which helped me envision concepts I've always had trouble with before, like the difficulty in imagining why multiple universes don't collide. These alone are worth the price of the book in my estimation."},{"Title":"COSMIC LANDSCAPE: String Theory & The Illusion Of Intelligent Design (H)","review":"This book tries to explain the Anthropic Principle in terms of String Theory, and in doing so provides a nice overview of some of the concepts of modern physics. It is the purpose of this review to tell a prospective reader what this book is about, not to take sides in the argument between science and religion, which judging from some of the other reviews is a major consideration in assessing this book.What is the Anthropic Principle? In short - in order for the universe as we know it to exist, it requires that the thirty or more of the basic constants that define physics (and our universe) be fine-tuned to their current values. Even a change of few percent in some of them would result in a universe without atoms, or a universe that would only last for an instant, or one with atoms but no chemistry and no life, etc. Why is the universe so fine-tuned? To many, this is a clear indication of an \\"intelligent designer\\" who created a world that we could live in. Others dismiss the idea of the fine tuning of the universe as being a syllogism, believing that if this were this not the case we would not be here to ask the question; still others dismiss this idea as basically a religious one that is not appropriate for scientific consideration. Professor Susskind does not ascribe to any of these ideas, rather he sees the Anthropic Principle as a manifestation of String Theory. In fact, he goes further in that be believes that the Anthropic Principle actually requires String Theory.The major complaint that many physicists have with String Theory is that there are many possible solutions to the equations that have been developed. Not just a few too many, but 10 to the 500th power too many. Professor Susskind sees this, not as a problem, but is the basis of the explanation of the Anthropic Principle. He views String Theory as describing a large cosmic landscape (hence the title of the book), with each solution defining a possible universe in that landscape, and that these universes may exist in parallel with the one that we inhabit, or exist in our own universe, but beyond our visible horizon. Professor Susskind's point is that String Theory may require that many universes exist, and if this is the case, then we must of necessity live in one that allows life, enabling us to ponder this question.Along the way to explaining his view of the Anthropic Principle, Professor Susskind provides nice overviews of Feynman diagrams (both as applied to Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) and Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD)), nice discussions of the Standard Model of particle physics, String Theory, and some aspects of modern cosmology. These overviews are very simplified and use no mathematics. While his simplifications leave out a lot, by only focusing on the most important aspects they also clarified a lot of ideas for me. I particularly liked his discussions of fermions and bosons, the development of String Theory and the paradox of the information loss (or not) associated with Hawking Radiation from Black Holes. In my view, the science discussed in the book is the best reason why someone should read it.Professor Susskind writes with clarity and does a good job of making complex ideas understandable, but I cannot give this book 5 stars. I liked the physics, but after a while I found the endless repetition of the idea that String Theory and the Anthropic Principle were dependent on each other to be distracting from the interesting physics that was being summarized. I recommend this book to those interested in modern physics. Those who are interested in the argument of science versus religion may also be interested, but only if they are also interested in physics."},{"Title":"COSMIC LANDSCAPE: String Theory & The Illusion Of Intelligent Design (H)","review":"Glory to all prominent cosmologists trying to enlighten general reader about intricacies of physics and Universe!

We have Brian Greene's \\"The Elegant Universe\\" focused on String Theory, Lisa Randall's \\"Warped Passages\\" presenting RS1 and RS2 brane/extra dimension model, Lawrence Krauss \\"Quintessence\\" on search for Dark Matter, Robert Kirshner's \\"The Extravagant Universe\\" describing Supernova Cosmology and purpose of Dark Energy, John Barrow's \\"The Constants of Nature\\" explaining measurements and importance of constants in cosmology - just to mention few examples.\\"The Cosmic Landscape\\" title comes from string theorists Joe Polchinski, Raphael Bousso and author Leonard Susskind. As Lawrence Krauss points out: \\"in attempting to graphically explore the different ground states of a subset of the set of all string vacua, they realized that the diagram looked like complicated landscape...the images were so striking that they capitalized the description and invented what they called The Landscape\\".However only small portion of Susskind's book is devoted to Landscape theory. Essentially it is a general string cosmology book, very much similar to Greene's \\"The Elegant Universe\\". First half of it lectures us about \\"traditional\\" popular topics like Einstein, Hubble and cosmological constant, geometry of space (remember these famous three pictures depicting flat, spherical and saddle space-time configuration?) particles, Planck scale, etc. After page 200 we get into strings and other related to it theories including landscape and multiverses. It is not about what and how we observe our Universe, but mostly how about math-derived ideas that are \\"elegant\\" but non-testable. What bothers me mostly though is, why author admixed Intelligent Design into his book. There is no need for it. Anthropic Principle, no matter how and on what grounds presented, can always be interpreted both ways: pro, or contra Intelligent Design.

It is one of the finest pieces of popular science writing that I have ever read. Somewhere in this book Susskind alludes to another book he hopes to write one day. Here's very much hoping he directs that (and other) future efforts to a non-specialist readership.

If the Creationists claim the exquisitely complex workings of nature cannot be explained without the existence of a divine \\"designer\\", the book answers: Yes it can, because the workings we see are only one set of laws and a virtually infinite number of other sets of laws exist elsewhere, making our exquisite complexity just a happy coincidence.The problem is that this \\"answer\\" is no better logically than Creationism. They are both arbitrary nonsense. What is the evidence that the Laws of Physics are different in other \\"pocket universes\\"? None is offered. If the laws of nature are delicately balanced to support life as we know it, this does not imply that the laws are \\"designed\\" to support life. The evidence is the other way around, meaning that life is organized to obey the laws. If the \\"cosmological constant\\" is incredibly small, then so be it.Susskind dismisses this showstopping philosophical objection as \\"a kind of willful missing of the point\\". Why? Because \\"the landscape of biological designs includes a small number of very special designs that have what we call life\\". Isn't that begging the question?As a prelude to this gem of reasoning, the author ridicules philosophers as being \\"naive\\". Yet physics does not come before epistemology.

The theme of the book is that String Theory implys there are a very large number of possible vacuum states ( sets of physical laws ). Our world is just one of these vacuum states. Each different vacuum state would have different sets of elementary ( sub-atomic ) particles and forces. However, String Theory is still a long way from being strongly supported by experimental evidence. This evidence may or may not be discovered over the next century.However, I do not think it really has much to say about the existance or non-existance of an intelligent, purposeful god. In my my opinion, human knowledge is, and always will be, too limited to make final statements about the nature of god and the universe. Large unprovable statements about the nature of the world are more likely to be a reflection of the character of the the individual making them. You see what you choose to see.

For many years, most people have accepted a definition of science put forward by the philosopher, Karl Popper, that requires verification of a scientific model or hypothesis by experimentation in a manner that permits \\"falsification\\" of the model or hypothesis. If there is no data that can be put into the model, or if the \\"data\\" has no meaning relative to the model, its not science. Susskind attacks Popper with anecdotes, not philosophy. He then proceeds to interpret the many solutions to string theory equations as an indicator of parallel universes with a simultaneous attack on some version of the anthropic principle. All of this is done to apply the mathematics of string theory to physical reality, a step that does not seem necessary in the same sense that it is not necessary for a geometry to correspond to physical reality. To me, parallel universes are purely speculation and science fiction, simply because there is no data to support this. If a choice were necessary between the Susskind's hypothesis of parallel universes and an anthropic principle as put forth by Barrow and Tipler in \\"The Anthropic Cosmological Principle\\", the latter seems a lot more satisfying because it is based on physics, with some speculation, but having data with models that are subject to falsification."},{"Title":"COSMIC LANDSCAPE: String Theory & The Illusion Of Intelligent Design (H)","review":"The objectives of this book are to: (1) refute the intelligent designers who see the hand of \\"God\\" in the formation of the universe, and (2) defend string theory in which the author has a paternalistic interest, being one of the inventors. The author explains the universe, or rather megaverse, to us -- and complex it is with gluons, quarks, photons, p-branes, hardons, and hadrons flying around and difficult concepts such as the cosmological constant and vacuum energy. The author uses the analogy of a \\"Rube Goldberg machine\\" to describe the chaotic workings of the universe. I can't pretend to understand most of what he says, but what I do get is interesting and mind-expanding.The enemies are the people who pull God out of the hat to allege \\"intelligent design\\" in the universe. I frankly don't get the importance of the \\"anthropic principle\\" which is apparently the straw at which the intelligent designers grasp and misuse, in the opinion of the author. But Susskind protests too much. And he devotes far too much time to discussing the anthropic principle -- it pops up again every several pages. His answer to it is a megaverse: a landscape with 10^500 universes each with different properties and laws of physics. Thus, amidst a near infinite number of universes ours, suitable for our kind of life, resulted by mere chance and the laws of probabability. The data for the existence of more than one universe is scant so his speculations in this regard, though interesting and appealing (in my opinion) are pretty far-fetched -- perhaps on a scientific par with the belief in \\"God\\" as the intelligent designer. String and megaverse theory, while fascinating, seem to rest on little more than flights of fancy. Could it be that Susskind shares some of the traits of the (ooh! shriek! eek!)intelligent designers? He tells us repeatedly that he does not.All in all, a good book with some very erudite speculation on the universe and megaverse we live in. The author's concept of \\"landscapes\\" to explain a world of multiple universes was illuminating as was his chapter on the \\"Bubble Bath Universe.\\" He totally lost me in the chapter about his argument with Stephen Hawking about black holes.A similar book that I thought was even better is \\"Parallel Worlds\\" by Michiki Kaku who is much more upfront with the fact that modern physics seems as much theology as cosmology.Smallchief"},{"Title":"COSMIC LANDSCAPE: String Theory & The Illusion Of Intelligent Design (H)","review":"Susskind, like his predecessor, Isaac Asimov, excels in presenting complex scientific questions in language that makes it accessible to laymen as well to scientists working in disciplines outside of his own.

Said that, the ideas are beautiful and the book reads as a novel"},{"Title":"COSMIC LANDSCAPE: String Theory & The Illusion Of Intelligent Design (H)","review":"In order to show how life, at least as it is currently understood, arose in the universe requires that one have an understanding of how carbon atoms evolved from their elementary constituents, i.e. from protons, neutrons, and electrons. Having done that, one needs to explicitly show how DNA molecules can assemble from the amino acids that they are constructed from. Then one faces the formidable problem of how the proteins arising from RNA transcription fold into the observed configurations. These processes are extremely difficult to analyze given the current knowledge and tools from physics. To show even the first process requires an understanding of how electrons and protons can coalesce to form bound states.Unfortunately, and contrary to the beliefs of many physicists, it is not possible at the present time to show how carbon atoms can form using the language of quantum field theory, which is the theory governing the interactions of elementary particles. Quantum field theory was invented to describe scattering events that occur in particle accelerator experiments. This it has done with incredible accuracy, an accuracy which has been unmatched by any other physical theory. The calculation and prediction of bound states has not been possible however from quantum field theory, although several proposals and attempts have been made over the last five decades. This inability has caused some physicists to view the theory with a large amount of skepticism. This skepticism is justified, since a successful theory of elementary particle interactions should be able to describe in detail how matter emerges from its elementary constituents.Quantum field theory is regularly used in cosmology to study the evolution of the universe and is used to calculate various quantities of interest in the \`Standard Model' of elementary particles. And again, it has been able to do these calculations with an incredible accuracy, as long as the interactions, or \\"couplings\\" between the particles are weak. A weak coupling between the particles enables one to calculate \`cross-sections' for the interactions, which are essentially a measure of the probabilities of finding the particles in a certain final configuration after they have interacted and scattered. This involves the calculation of a series in successively higher powers of the coupling constant (being itself much less than one), with the higher-order terms becoming smaller and smaller. This is called \`perturbative quantum field theory', and has generated an enormous amount of literature.Given the inability to perform bound state calculations in quantum field theory, and given it is assumed to be the fundamental theory of particle interactions (excluding gravity), one cannot use it to meaningfully discuss the probability of life arising in the universe. Beginning with the Big Bang one cannot, using quantum field theory, follow the evolution of the universe to show how carbon atoms were formed or even the probabilities that such atoms, or any others for that matter, were formed.For this reason, any discussion of the fine-tuning of the universe, i.e. of life being very sensitive to the values of the elementary parameters of the Standard Model, is not meaningful. Before one can say that life would not be \\"possible\\" one needs to know the probabilities that are involved in forming a carbon atom from electrons, neutrons, and protons. If one believes that quantum field theory is indeed the theory that governs the interactions between electrons, neutrons, and protons, one is forced to calculate the \`transition amplitude' between a free state of these particles and their bound state in the carbon atom. This has not been done in the physics literature to this date, at least from the standpoint of purists who insist upon detailed calculations with a minimal number of assumptions. String theory, the generalization of quantum field theory that was invented to incorporate gravity into its theoretical language, is of no help either in the bound state problem.If the content of this book is viewed in this context then it becomes rather uninteresting. That is not to say that it could not be read by someone interested in the current heated debate on the Anthropic Principle and what has been named \`intelligent design.' In addition, a reader interested in string theory will find many interesting insights from a person who has been actively involved in its development. It is difficult to find these insights if the usual literature on string theory is consulted.From the standpoint of calculations in quantum field theory that go beyond the perturbative regime, the Anthropic Principle and fine-tuning are very much open questions. Life (arising from bound states of electrons, protons, and neutrons) may depend very sensitively on certain parameters or it may in fact be very flexible with respect to these parameters. If one is sincerely interested in these questions one will have to delve into the morass of non-perturbative quantum field theory, an area that many physicists have shied away from, due to its extreme difficulty. Computing power will no doubt play a role, as it has, in attempting to understand the full spectrum of quantum field theory. There are many groups around the world who have been involved in this research, and progress has been slow but steady. Hopefully the \\"world according to Feynman\\", i.e. the world as described by perturbative quantum field theory, will eventually be replaced by the \\"world according to Wilczek\\", the latter being one where considerations of bound states of protons and neutrons are of main interest."},{"Title":"COSMIC LANDSCAPE: String Theory & The Illusion Of Intelligent Design (H)","review":"If you are not a physicist or cosomologist but are curious or fascinated by these subjects and wonder about the past and future of the cosmos, black holes, the big bang etc. then in my opinion you will like this book.Professor Susskind's deep knowledge of the field and exceptional expository skill permits him to unravel and present complex ideas in a form understandable by the lay reader.

Along with other string theorists, they assume that if the math they use to build their models contains some number of additional dimensions, then the real world must contain those dimensions. I see this in much of the literature, including, for example WoitNot Even Wrong: The Failure of String Theory And the Search for Unity in Physical Lawwho debunks string theory, but nevertheless seems to accept the idea that if the math contains extra dimensions, reality must also contain those extra dimensions. Susskind really goes off the deep end with this.A mathematical model is just that - a model. It is the best math we can construct at this point in time to describe the reality we are trying to model. It is not the reality itself. If the string theorists are successful in constructing a model that includes six or seven tiny dimensions, that does not mean that those dimensions actually exist. All it means is that the best model we can currently construct has to include those dimensions in the math. We must remember that much more math will come along. Someday, we may have a math that describes the same reality without the additional dimensions.That said, if the string theorists can make a prediction that absolutely, positively depends upon those extra dimensions and if that prediction is confirmed by experimental results, then they may have a case.

Occasionally I would glance at its title as I scanned the shelf it was on and say to myself, Why exactly did I buy that book? I guessed it was just another astronomy book covering the usual suspects: planets, asteroids, stars, galaxies, going back all the way to the Big Bang. Ho Hum. I'd seen enough of the usual suspects. I left the book on its bookshelf, gathering dust.In July I listened to a teepee (TP, theoretical physicist) expand in a PowerPoint presentation on the latest in cosmology and where the science stood, and found the lecture terrifically stimulating. I thought to myself, If only I had a book that covered these topics in more depth. For some reason that I can't exactly explain, I picked up The Cosmic Landscape again and then glanced at the subtitle, String Theory and the Illusion of Intelligent Design. Now I was intrigued. Then I bothered to read the author's minimicrobio on the back of the dustcover. This guy, Susskind, wasn't an astronomer, he was a teepee and one of the founding fathers of String Theory (ST), a theory I knew at least something about from reading Smolin's The Trouble with Physics. Smolin made some telling criticisms of ST, among others the almost infinite multitude of solutions various versions of ST lead to. I'm not a teepee, and have some notion, but admittedly not much, how they line up vis-a-vis ST. By now I was wondering almost out loud, If, possibly if, this guy Susskind was using the term 'landscape' in a way that was at variance with the one I had in mind three years ago. Bingo! By golly he was.This book has amply fulfilled my highest expectations of a book explaining much more in depth those cosmological questions that had aroused my keen interest in July. Susskind is able to summarize in clear prose with a minimum of jargon the cosmological and theoretical advances that are rapidly creating a new paradigm in elementary particle and cosmological physics. To explain how our universe came to be, the last twenty-ten years has required the hypothesis that early in its history our universe underwent a very rapid period of inflation. Without that inflation, galaxies wouldn't have formed. No galaxies, no stars. No stars, no planets. No planets, no us. Oops! A Show Stopper if there ever was one.And then there's the dark energy. Susskind explains very clearly dark energy is the flashy name bestowed on the energy of the vacuum, which is the same as the cosmological constant-aka Einstein's biggest blunder, or so he thought at the time. Oh, if only Albert could see how his brainchild has prospered. Now it's called the mysterious dark energy. After all, 'dark energy' sounds a lot more sexy than the vacuum energy, doesn't it? And anyway, a vacuum's a vacuum, totally empty. What energy? But Susskind explains the vacuum does indeed have energy. How? The vacuum, like all things, is subject to Quantum Theory, which predicts the vacuum is flashing all the time with the continual creation and destruction of virtual particles. The colloquial phrase is it has 'the quantum jitters'. But this energy has a very strange property; it is gravitationally repulsive. And it's related to another very strange concept: space cloning itself. But too much vacuum energy isn't healthy for a baby universe. Too much and it flies apart before galaxies can form. Bummer! But too little isn't healthy either. Too little and gravity causes the nascent galaxies and matter to crash together in a Big Crunch long before stars and planets form. Another bummer! If the cosmological constant were zero, the nascent universe would probably crash into itself within a Planck time (10^42 seconds). So for a universe to evolve enough to form galaxies, stars, planets, and ultimately, us, there must be just a tiny bit of vacuum energy (to be exact a decimal point followed by 119 zeros and a 2-now seriously, folks, seriously, is that not a really teensy-tiny number?). Just the right amount it turns out. In short we live in a Goldilocks universe. Just right for our existence. This startling insight has led some physicists to utter the A word, A meaning Anthropic. Such a word causes almost mass hysteria and foaming at the mouth among the IDers. See see, they shout with glee, that proves Intelligent Design.But Susskind quickly and with great adroitness punctures their balloon. Now all those almost infinite multitude of solutions (10^500 or so) that ST predicts are still around, but they're not an embarrassment any more, something to be swept under the rug. They acquire a much different interpretation. Each solution provides a possibility of a universe in what Susskind calls the Landscape. The Landscape then is the possibility space of all possible universes predicted by ST. Once a possible universe has actualized, it takes its place within what Susskind calls the Megaverse. Another term bandied about is the Multiverse although Susskind prefers Megaverse. Our universe, the one we know and love so dearly, is simply one universe within the Megaverse. One amongst an almost infinite number. Because our universe is a Goldilocks universe, it's highly likely it's a statistical outlier. We know for certain this very unique universe supports life, at least in one of its about 10^11 galaxies. Do other Goldilocks universes exist in the Megaverse? This paradigm is so new that teepees are just beginning to explore its nooks and crannies. Of course the exploration is done using a broad knowledge of advanced physics and the mathematical techniques of ST, not exactly the easiest math around. For starters it includes GRT and QFT. Oh, and yes, advanced topologies and compactifications of Calabi-Yau manifolds and other stuff like that because ST works in multiple dimensions, 10 or 11 (M-Theory) depending on the exact ST you're working in. What? You want those reliable three spatial dimensions like you had in Classical Physics? The dimensions you know and love because we all live in a 3-D space or at least that's what we experience every waking moment. Forget it already. You'll love eleven. Trust me on this. Susskind explains all this as clearly as it can be explained without the math.As a conclusion not all teepees are ecstatic about the new paradigm. The teepee whom I heard in July seemed very ambivalent. Some think there doesn't seem to be any way to test the theory experimentally, and if so, they fear physics will cease to be an experimental science. This doesn't make a lot of people happy. Even Susskind admits that to probe matter-energy at the Planck scale, which could lead to experimental verification (or the possibility of falsification if you prefer your Popper), would require a really really superlarge particle accelerator. The LHC probably isn't going to cut it in this regard. One the size of our galaxy and which would require to power it a trillion gallons of oil a second. Don't think that's going to happen any time soon, folks. This state of affairs doesn't seem to perturb Susskind particularly. He states that much of the time experimental physics and theoretical physics are out of sinc, and comments on the cleverness and ingenuity of experimentalists to find a way to test what needs to be tested. Will this do the trick? If it doesn't, physics will have to evolve into a very different kind of science if this paradigm takes hold of the profession. Will it? Stay tuned to the buzz.Epilogue: Naturally this review can't adequately cover all the fascinating and well expressed points that Susskind makes. If you have even a passing interest in modern physics and where it's possibly heading, then this book is a great read. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"COSMIC LANDSCAPE: String Theory & The Illusion Of Intelligent Design (H)","review":"Susskind's CL is a few things. It is scientific, a bit biographical, and quite a bit historical. He also throws in a bit of philosophy with just a dash of theology. This is basically a book on how 2 things have progressed through scientific history: Recent cosmological and physicist beliefs about our universe (or megaverse as her terms it) and how his own views have either contrasted or compared with others similar in discipline.His history of cosmology and physics is very nice. Susskind is a good writer and entertaining to read. He has a nice capacity to turn very complicated issues of physics and cosmology and make them as accessible as he can.Eventually, Susskind gives his own opinion on the matter (he is a theoretical physicist). He has spent much of his career working on the nature of String Theory and believes it ultimately explains (or rather, explains away) the anthropic principle that have plagued physicists and cosmologists for the past 50-60 years. These things comprise several later chapters.His answer (which he shares in common with many other cosmologists or physicists) is - the cosmic landscape. Essentially String Theory and its 10 or 11 dimensions provide a landscape over our megaverse that allows for every possible instantiation of physical laws in what he calls 'pocket' universes. Our universe is a pocket universe, and just happens to contain laws of physics that are conducive to human life. These pocket universes are infinite - indeed, they must be infinite, to ensure instantiation of our pocket universe. Otherwise, the anthropic principle could still be provided as an argument. Susskind believes that only if an infinite amount of pocket universes exist can one guarantee our universe without having recourse to some kind of anthropic explanation.Susskind also treats a philosophical notion that plagues String Theory: the theory of falsifiability/unfalsifiability. One of the biggest objections to Susskind's String Theory is that is, prima facie, unobservable. The megaverse and structure of String Theory mean that we cannot view any other pocket universe than our own. Therefore, it is, by principle, unfalsifiable. Susskind's retort, is a good response, however. His point is that unfalsifiability is subjected to scientific technology. And, I think he is right on this point. There's no reason to reject this out of hand a priori, citing unfalsifiability as your only reason. It is a valid point that the theory is at present unfalsifiable, though. The unfalsifiability charge was often leveled at linguistic statements by philosophers who first coined the term. Statements that were unfalsifiable were to be considered meaningless. Hence, by their criteria, much of this book would be meaningless.Concerning any critiques, I would say that while this is a fine book, Susskind seems to miss a couple of relevant points about the anthropic principle. First, it is an existential question. In other words, merely advocating String Theory doesn't get rid of the question, EVEN WITH an infinite number of pocket universes, because no matter what the structure of the universe or megaverse, there will always be those existential questions (not to mention the extremely dubious notion of an actual instantiation of an infinite number of universes). And secondly, to further that point, String Theory, may get rid of one set of fine tuning principles, but it just replaces them for another (of a more geometric type). The broader point that I'm making here is that I\\"m not sure he quite gets is the hold that philosophy has on his science and I'm not sure he's interested. Hence his elementary ideas that if God were some sort of explanation we must ask, 'Who designed the designer?\\". The problem here is that clearly Susskind doesn't understand basic issues of modality.Summing up, I would say The Cosmic Landscape is definitely worth the read. Be prepared to really think, though."},{"Title":"COSMIC LANDSCAPE: String Theory & The Illusion Of Intelligent Design (H)","review":"It suffers greatly (more than others) from the common fault in popular science books. It attempts to explain complicated concepts for the lay reader while omitting the necessary mathematical rigor. The result is predictable - the ideas are clear neither to the lay reader nor to more mathematically inclined one. A lot of long winded explanations that could be made clear by the inclusion of a little of mathematics. Why not include at least some of the math and take the time to explain it? The writing is somewhat tedious and it seems the author likes to boast a bit too much. The attempts at humor are horrible and face palming inducing. Well at least he did not put his face on the cover as some other physicist and writer of popular science books who shall remain nameless."},{"Title":"COSMIC LANDSCAPE: String Theory & The Illusion Of Intelligent Design (H)","review":"The gist is: the underlying principle of the universe (which is yet to discovered) allows an unimaginably large number of possible theoretical worlds, all bearing different physical laws and different parameters, to exist. But the actual universe is also unimaginably huge (viz. very much larger than the observable one) and is potentially divided into vast number of separate regions whereby different laws and parameters may actually exist. These speculations are indirectly supported by theoretical physics and cosmology (e.g. string theories and eternal inflation), and provide an \\"explanation\\" to the Anthropic Principle - i.e. why our local world is so very fortunately hospitable and conducive to intelligent beings.I particularly like a couple of the author's quips. On page 302: \\"If you purchased this book hoping to find the ultimate answer to how the universe began, I am afraid you will be disappointed. Neither I nor anyone else knows.\\"; and page 380: \\"But on the other hand, neither does anything in this book diminish the likelihood that an intelligent agent created the universe for some purpose.\\"Overall an enjoyable read. Four stars."},{"Title":"COSMIC LANDSCAPE: String Theory & The Illusion Of Intelligent Design (H)","review":"A clear, approachable and interesting account of the background to and content of String Theory. Susskind gives one a good feel for the key ideas and problems, without either dawdling or diluting. However, some key points seem to be missing (or insufficiently stressed). The most annoying is that he does not really make it clear whether there is currently ANY version of ST where detailed calculations have shown a perfect match to known physics (standard model + gravity). One is left with the impression that while there are versions that match some features very well, no known version matches them all. If one specific version does indeed work perfectly, surely this would greatly strengthen the case for ST. Or are theorists just hoping that one of the ten to the 500 versions will eventually be shown to turn out right? In that case, one would like have some sense how \\"robust\\" it is: does varying one ingredient drastically change things? One gets the impression that it's extremely difficult, given a set of space-geometry parameters (choices of moduli, fluxes etc) to calculate what the outcome would be, which implies the Landscape is very rugged.I'm also not convinced by his (related) argument that while \\"eternal inflation\\" engenders (via quantum fluctuations) pocket universes bearing no relation to their \\"parents\\", the biological mutation process gives dna sequences that are only slightly different. It all depends how one defines \\"different\\". A sequence that only has one mutation might differ from the wild type immensely: it could be lethal. Susskind does not make it clear whether when a pocket universe is born, all the ST parameters are flipped, or only 1, though he implies the former. Or perhaps this is not the right way to think of the issue.The other piece that is missing is that one wants a universe that is not just life-friendly, but intelligence-friendly. Since we do not understand the neural basis of intelligence, there could be superastronomical numbers of life-friendly universes, but only 1 intelligence-friendly one. We seem to be even more ignorant about what fraction of life-friendly universes are intelligent, than about what fraction of STs yield life-friendly universes! Presumably the emergence of intelligence requires much more fine tuning than the emergence of life.Finally, for any theory to be complete and self-consistent, not only does one need to understand how 11-dimensional space engenders intelligence, but how the latter engenders the former! In other words, in our effort to understand the universe, by high-energy physics experiments, we will reach the limits of our own intelligence, and destroy that universe. This seems, depressingly, to be the only completely self-consistent possibility!"},{"Title":"COSMIC LANDSCAPE: String Theory & The Illusion Of Intelligent Design (H)","review":"This book by one of the founders of String Theory is a must read for anyone interested in Cosmology and state-of-the-art physics.Of course, Susskind, like all other authors of popular scientific books, finds himself compelled to explain very difficult concepts in very simple ways, and he succeeds most of the time. In particular, the concept of a \\"Landscape of vacua\\" and its relation to the \\"ANTHROPIC PRINCIPLE\\" and the Megaverse is not very easy to grasp, but once the reader has got the point, it is really gratifying, especially for those who are not comfortable with the \\"fine tuning\\" dictum of some of the world's most eminent cosmologists. I, for one, have found the explanation very satisfactory, and I think many readers would concur. And the explanations he gives about String Theory are incredibly clear and precise, without any equation or technical term.However, I have some remarks about omissions by Susskind, that could be of interest to the dedicated reader. The first is about \\"George Gamow's Big Bang theory\\"(p.19) .Even though Gamow played a central role in the genesis of the hot Big Bang paradigm, I think it is fair to give proper credit to the two scientists who actually created the theory that became the cornerstone of modern cosmology: these are the Russian Alexander Friedmann and the Belgian Georges Lematre. And whilst Susskind acknowledges the former's contributions(Chapter 5), he is completely silent about the latter. This is most unfortunate, especially since Fred Hoyle coined the term \\"big bang\\" to mock Lematre!In a meeting in Pasadena in 1960, Hoyle, upon seeing Lematre entering the room, exclaimed:\\"Here is the Big Bang man!\\" As a matter of fact, Lematre, apart from having predicted the \\"Hubble expansion\\" one year before its experimental discovery in 1928, was the first to posit that the Universe started with a huge \\"explosion\\" from a primeval atom. He was also the first to recognize the importance of the cosmological constant, at a time when Einstein rejected it in disgust!As you can see, this pioneer of modern cosmology is unjustly neglected, and not only by Susskind...It's a general trend in the anglo-saxon countries: for example, instead of the Friedmann-Lematre-Robertson-Walker metric of space-time, most authors refer to the Robertson-Walker metric.The second remark concerns the equations of General Relativity, that Susskind states at page 115 , albeit in an unusual form: in lieu of the indices m and n, all textbooks use the Greek letters mu and nu. But this is not my point.(The form Susskind gives to the Veneziano amplitude(p.205) is even worse: who would ever write the gamma function like a draughtsman's right angle?)What I want to say is that, while talking about the elegance of the field equations, Susskind fails to acknowledge that Einstein's derivation of these equations is not the most elegant one. About the same time that Einstein published his field equations of gravitation, in November 1915, the great David Hilbert derived them from a variational principle, and all cognoscenti agree that this is much more elegant than Einstein's \\"heuristic\\" method.The third name that Susskind fails to mention is that of the nineteenth century German mathematician without whose work Einstein would not have been able to put his theory of General Relativity together: the great Bernhard Riemann. Einstein might well be what Susskind thinks he is, i.e. the greatest theoretical physicist of the twentieth century, but Stephen Hawking believes that Newton is even greater.Why?Because whereas Einstein found the mathematics he needed(tensor calculus, which was explained to him by his friend Marcel Grossmann) readily available in the work of Riemann, Ricci and Levi-Civita, Newton invented calculus and used it in his Principia.A word also on Susskind's dismissal of Karl Popper's \\"falsifiability\\" criterion.Even though he might be right that \\"we should not put the cart before the horse\\"(p.194), any physical theory should be able to give predictions that could be verified experimentally. To go back to Einstein's GR, Susskind might be right in assuming that the development of this theory needed no guidance from experience, but Einstein himself experienced the greatest elation of his life when he was able to deduce the correct value of the perihelion precession of Mercury from his equations. And Einstein's fame started with the confirmation of the bending of light coming from distant stars during a solar eclipse in 1919! I wonder if it would ever be possible to confirm String Theory by experiment: according to Susskind, with our current knowledge, this would require an accelerator the size of the entire Galaxy!!So the prospects of a direct verification are definitely out of our reach...But who knows?The imagination of theorists seems to know no bounds: String Theory is an astounding example. So maybe they would one day devise a consequence of their theory which could be subject to verification.And finally, maybe I should point out the small mistake I found at page 85: Newton's constant, G, is not measured in square meters per second-kilogram, but in cubic meters per square seconds-kilogram...But who really cares ? This is a wonderful book: go ahead, read it!"},{"Title":"COSMIC LANDSCAPE: String Theory & The Illusion Of Intelligent Design (H)","review":"If you know nothing of String Theory I recommend, e.g., one of Brian Greene's books, \\"The Elegant Universe\\", 1999 with a lot on String Theory and/or \\"The Fabric of the Cosmos\\", 2004 with less on String Theory and more on cosmology, before reading the book at hand.Susskind is a very good writer but I am glad I had more information on String Theory to appreciate the history and especially where the famous 10^500 possible kinds of universes come from.But do read this book whether you read another first or not. Susskind gives a lot of history of physics from the inside and explains a lot of physics very well for the lay-person. But most importantly, he presents a logical explanation for why there is a universe in which we can evolve and live.The only convincing argument creationists have for a creator god is that the universe could so easily have been a little different and life as we know it would be impossible. Susskind admits those facts carry weight but counters them by explaining how it's reasonable, indeed almost certain, that there are a lot of universes where life would be impossible, along with some, like ours, where life is possible. His reasoning is based on the immensely many possible kinds of universes string theory currently allows and on quantum mechanics. And it's fascinating. We now know our universe is unimaginably vast and Susskind introduces us to the likelihood there are very many more. He even describes experiments which could test this hypothesis, though he admits it may not be testable for a long time.I encourage anyone with an interest in the deep questions of why we exist to read this book and in so doing broaden their mind."},{"Title":"COSMIC LANDSCAPE: String Theory & The Illusion Of Intelligent Design (H)","review":"[Reviewer's update: To Amazon's credit, (and my pleasant surprise) they've removed this book from their Kindle e-shelf.

The following refers only to the now withdrawn ebook, not to the bound version.]If you enjoy paying good money for an inferior product, this is the Kindle book for you! Do you like shelling out cash for something that's supposed to be the e-twin of its printed version, only to discover that it's missing all the diagrams the author employed to illustrate abstruse points, many of which he directly refers to? Well then, Amazon's got you covered!There are other flaws, but I'll stick to the missing Feynman diagrams. There's a chapter titled \\"The world according to Feynman\\" in which the author repeatedly refers to Feynman diagrams to graphically illustrate his points about quantum field theory without having to resort to equations ... but they're nowhere to be found! The editors decided to completely ignore them, apparently in hopes the reader will just gloss over this omission ... or not notice it?! Unbelievable.Although this is definitely the worst example I've seen of the inferior quality of Kindle books compared to their bound versions, it's by no means the only one.

On the other hand, their excuses for selling inferior product were polite, yet completely without merit. In general, they blamed this type of problem on technical limitations associated with Kindle formatting as well as on decisions made by publishers. They even tried to convince me that customers need to complain directly to the publishers themselves for selling shoddy product.

I also want to emphasize I'm reviewing here only the poor quality of the Kindle version and NOT the worth of the bound version, Susskind's views, his writing, etc.)"},{"Title":"COSMIC LANDSCAPE: String Theory & The Illusion Of Intelligent Design (H)","review":"It appears that the thesis of this book is that logical organization and structure in the laws of physics only goes so far down, that you reach a certain level where the nature of reality is intrinsically opaque and that even in principle there can be no further explanations, that things just are the way they are. Further, at this level of opacity, the \\"givens\\" are very messy and arbitrary: there is no elegance, simplicity, and beauty, the heretofore goals of scientific theories. Instead, at bottom the universe we live in is a Rube Goldberg concoction of surpassing inelegance.At this point, the author, Leonard Susskind, says there are two possibilities:1. There is only one universe, the one we live in. In that case, these messy, seemingly arbitrary laws and constants of the universe must be deliberately designed to allow the development of intelligent creatures like us human beings. This follows the so-called \\"strong\\" anthropic principle: our very existence proves there is an Intelligence Designer behind all of existence.2. There are unending possibilities in the laws and constants of nature and our universe is just one possibility. There is a \\"megaverse\\" that continuously spawns \\"pocket universes,\\" each of which has a random set of laws and constants, and our universe is just one of these countless numbers.How can we make a purely scientific decision between these two views? Until recently, a lot of physicists hoped that String Theory would be found to support the first scenario: there would be a single solution to the equations that would produce the particular laws and constants we find in our universe. This seemingly arbitrary and messy collection of too many constants and laws would actually flow from a tiny set of first principles that would appear to be inevitable. This would also get around the \\"need\\" for an Intelligent Designer. The universe would be the way it is because it has to be that way.But, alas, the most recent developments of String Theory seem to be pushing in the opposite direction: String Theory seems to allow for an unimaginably large set of possible sets of laws and constants: ten to the five-hundredth power in fact! Among all those possibilities, one or more like our own universe would arise purely by chance, and once again there wouldn't be anything mysterious or supernatural about our existence.Thus, Susskind triumphantly disposes of the need of a supernatural basis for existence no matter what, and if this book has any focus at all this conclusion seems to be it. The attitude that is convinced by this kind of reasoning is called scientific materialism. It is commonly used in popular science books by atheistic authors. Now there is nothing wrong with trying to explain phenomena \\"all the way down,\\" without bringing supernatural causes and \\"miracles\\" into the picture. That's what the business of science is, and we should always be suspect when the miraculous is used to fill in \\"gaps\\" that science is unable (at the moment) to fill (most often these reputed gaps are merely wishful thinking on the part of religious fundamentalists anyhow, especially when it comes to \\"disbelief\\" in evolution). But to conclude that there is no transcendent ground to existence just because we have scientific explanations for something \\"all the way down\\" is overstepping the bounds of science proper into scientific materialism, and that is the fatal flaw of this book and is a major reason for me downgrading it to two stars.Just because a God may not be self-consciously involved in the selection of the most fundamental laws of nature in our pocket universe doesn't mean that it doesn't take the infinite depths of a God behind everything to provide \\"room\\" in the potentialities of existence for life as we know it to arise. The very fact that it is possible for something like the human mind to arise from the apparently \\"dead\\" material of existence speaks to a transcendent nature that is behind it all.This is the point that everyone seems to miss who preaches like Susskind that because at bottom it is only a matter of chance that our universe has the laws that it has, there is no \\"need\\" for God. The very fact that human experience is possible, even with our laws at bottom the result of sheer chance among 10**500 other possibilities, this very fact requires there to be an infinite Presence that some like to call God. It is God's bottomless nature that allows such highly improbable universes as ours to come into existence in the first place. God doesn't need to bring any universes into existence consciously; he does it by his very nature, and most of them pop in an out of existence without God even being consciously aware of them: it's just something God does without having to think about it. But without this infinite nature, none of us would ever appear in any highly improbable, anthropic universe, because the potential would not be there.Maybe a conscious God is not needed to produce bacteria. Maybe a conscious God is not needed to produce 10**500 universes for every one like ours. But God is a prerequisite for universes like ours even to appear. The miracle is that there is \\"room\\" for a universe like ours to exist. God doesn't need to concern himself with the overwhelming preponderance of abortive pocket universes that pop in and out of existence. The spark of his consciousness needs only to spring alive when a universe like ours happens along by sheer chance. Then he can take an interest and start persuading consciousness when it begins to arise to flow in certain directions, towards his own unlimited possibilities in depth and beauty. God then acts like a lure, drawing consciousness into his own explosive depths, and who knows how far evolution can then proceed, once the conscious God takes hold of it.In presenting this \\"theistic\\" view of reality, I'm really doing no more than the same sort of thing that Susskind is doing, and that's the flaw of this book. I'm not presenting science, but Susskind is using the name of science to present an atheistic view contrary to theistic views that irritate him. All I'm saying is that his atheistic views are easily countered by alternative theistic views. In either case, those views are only going to be persuasive to those with corresponding spiritual experiences of the world. As for the science that Susskind does describe in his book, as has been pointed out by other reviewers, it has been far better explained by other authors such as Brian Greene. I was frankly bored silly by the last half of Susskind's book, whereas Brian Greene is fascinating throughout."},{"Title":"COSMIC LANDSCAPE: String Theory & The Illusion Of Intelligent Design (H)","review":"Well written and well researched.

Indeed, I arranged for David to come to Esalen in 1976 as described by Gary Zukav in \\"The Dancing Wu Li Masters.\\" Out of that came Werner Erhard's meetings with Lenny, Feynman, Coleman, Hawking and many others that Lenny has described on John Brockman's website. Finkelstein met Werner at Esalen. Werner, of course, provided the money for the January 1976 Esalen Physics Consciousness Month-Long that I directed. I had previously met with Lenny and David Finkelstein at the Belfer School of Yeshiva University and had stayed at Lenny's Berkeley flat prior to that. Here is an excerpt of Lenny's very first moments at Belfer in 1967 more than 30 years before the discovery that dark energy was most of our universe: \\"I saw David Finkelstein, who had arranged my new job ... I also saw P. A. M. Dirac ... Dave introduced me to Yakir Aharonov ... He was talking to Roger Penrose ... They were talking about vacuum energy. Dave was arguing that the vacuum was full of zero-point energy and that this energy ought to affect the gravitational field.\\"I sat in on Roger's Twistor Course at Birkbeck College in London in 1971 when I was with David Bohm and Basil Hiley. The gravitational effect of the zero point energy density, as distinct from its Casimir electro-mechanical effect, is precisely a point of debate I had with Hal Puthoff who proposed, in analogy with quantum electrodynamics, that only differences in the zero point energy should gravitate rather than the absolute amount. Only the latter is consistent with Einstein's equivalence principle. Lenny had a big head start here in 1967 a year before the Haight-Ashbury Flower Revolution. I only really began to grok the vacuum energy problem in its fullness in 2002 when the real meaning of both dark energy and dark matter hit me square in my Mystical Third Eye like a bigga cosmica pizza pie. That's amore! I had a similar epiphany at Brandeis in 1961 when I basically saw that the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen effect demanded a faster-than-light action at a distance. Sylvan Schweber and Stanley Deser told me not to think about that problem.\\"Dirac didn't like vacuum energy because whenever physicists tried to calculate its magnitude, the answer would come out infinite. He thought that if it came out infinite, the mathematics must be wrong and that the right answer is that there is no vacuum energy. Dave pulled me into the conversation, explaining as he went. For me this conversation was a fateful turning point - my introduction to a problem that would obsess me for almost forty years and that eventually led me to The Cosmic Landscape.\\" p. 65\\"What had especially caught Einstein's attention was that if were ... a positive number, then the new term corresponded to a universal repulsion that increased in proportion to the distance.\\" p. 70\\"But suppose that the contribution of fermions outweighed that of bosons: then the net vacuum energy would be a negative number ... changing the sign of /\\\\ switches the repulsive effects ... to a universal attraction: not the usual gravitational attractive force but a force that increases with distance.\\" p. 83Note that Lenny here assumes a uniform constant . This is like drilling a hole through the center of the Earth and dropping a cannon ball into it. The cannon ball feels a simple harmonic oscillator gravity potential energy per unit test mass. Similarly here in a spherically symmetric case:V = - c^2/\\\\r^2F = - dV/dr = + 2c^2/\\\\rNote that in the large-scale FRW cosmology metric the isotropy of the universe is formally like spherical symmetry. Note also that on a small scale negative is a confinement force that can prevent quarks from escaping a hadron as well as stabilize a spherical shell of charge. Furthermore, combining positive and negative is Bondi's \\"negative matter propellantless propulsion\\" or \\"vacuum propeller\\" considered also by Yakov Terletski and Robert Forward. This was the precursor to the geodesic weightless warp drive of Alcubierre without any time dilation able to travel faster-than-light globally whilst locally slower-than-light and able to time travel to the past under special conditions.\\"Who cares if the vacuum has energy? If that energy is always present, why don't we readjust our definition ... by subtracting it away?\\"This works in quantum electrodynamics in the calculation of the Casimir force for example where the infinity without the plates is subtracted from the infinity with the plates to get a finite answer. Similarly with the Lamb shift of spectral lines in simple atoms like hydrogen. But it does not work for gravity because of the equivalence principle: \\"The reason is that energy gravitates ... all forms of energy affect the gravitational field and, therefore, also influence the motion of nearby masses. The vacuum energy of quantum field theory is no exception. Even empty space will have a gravitational field if the energy density of the vacuum is not zero. ... if the vacuum energy is a positive number, then its effect is a universal repulsion, a kind of antigravity ... Einstein's cosmological constant ... is nothing but the energy content of the fluctuating quantum vacuum ... combining the theory of elementary particles with Einstein's theory of gravity ... seems to lead to an uncompromising universe with a cosmological constant many orders of magnitude too big ... There are so many high-energy virtual particles that the total answer comes out infinite ... as Wolfgang Pauli quipped. \`Just because something is infinite doesn't mean it's zero. ... Ultimately we reach a value of the energy so large that if two particles ... collide they create a black hole ... Even string theory is not up to the task ... just ignore the contributions to the vacuum energy from all virtual particles ... that ... would make a black hole if they were to collide ... We call it ... regulating the theory ... we don't yet understand ... Photons ... contribute positive energy to the vacuum .... Virtual electrons in the vacuum have negative energy .... Virtual bosons in the vacuum have positive energy, but virtual fermions ... have negative energy ... do they cancel? Not even approximately! ... Supersymmetric theories have no vacuum energy because the fermions and bosons exactly cancel. But ... Fermi-bose symmetry is not a feature of the real world.\\" Pp. 73-77, \\"Cosmic Landscape.\\"Spontaneous broken supersymmetry means that the laws of physics are supersymmetric, i.e. the dynamical action is supersymmetric, but the vacuum is not. The order parameter is then proportional to the number of boson fields minus the number of fermion fields. This would seem to allow a small cosmological constant consistent with the fact that life exists. Steven Weinberg in 1987 showed that the initial black body density fluctuations would not allow life if the cosmological constant were more than 10-120 of the Planck energy density by about an order of magnitude either positive or negative. This was years before the modern precision cosmology data post 2004 or so from WMAP that confirmed Weinberg's \\"Weak Anthropic Principle\\" prediction. Fred Hoyle made a similar prediction for the nuclear physics for a resonance needed for carbon formation in stars. However, Lenny's book's thesis is that these facts are not a compelling argument for a super-intelligence consciously fine-tuning our universe for us to exist. Neither, however, do they refute that \\"intelligent design\\" argument. To seem to do that Lenny needs his \\"cosmic landscape.\\" Whether Lenny succeeds or not is the question yet unanswered."},{"Title":"COSMIC LANDSCAPE: String Theory & The Illusion Of Intelligent Design (H)","review":"This book is so poorly written and illustrated that I had difficulty not just giving up.

The strings/branes conjecture, although it has almost cancerously consumed the current world of theoretical physics, certainly as regards TOE interests*, can find no way of bridging the gap between its mathematics and metaphysics on the one hand, and the physical world it proposes to define on the other. If the question now is \`does Susskind manage to mitigate the gap between brane-world and the physical world?', the answer is certainly \`no'. This seems to be the perpetual answer for this expansively uneconomical conjecture, whose \`predictions', if they can be called such, are hopelessly unverifiable and unfalsifiable. *(Susskind rejects the ideas popularized by Hawking--that strings/brane-world is a \\"Theory of Everything\\" and Greene--that our universe should be considered \`elegant', as he prefers to see it as something that \`just is' what it is.)Like many of the other notables that have pitched superstrings/M-theory/brane-worlds, Susskind has the integrity to concede that the entire edifice may fail and crumble. But like these others, he believes that the real world IS brane-world, i.e., \`megaverse' (an ensemble containing an unimaginably large number of branes, i.e., two and higher dimensional \`slices', and an unsearchably large number of vacuum states). He is a believer. It would be fair, and accurate, to say that three areas of motivation underwrite this belief: (1) interest in intriguing topologies [mathematical \`landscapes'], (2) a metaphysical impulsion/demand, and lastly [in a very, very, distant third place], (3) physics. Perhaps the ordering of 1 and 2 above should be reversed--as it is this metaphysical factor that drives the conjectures and the statements of belief that we hear from Susskind and certain other string theorists. It has been said that strings/brane-world is a subject more obviously suited to departments of mathematics and of theology than to departments of physics. After almost three decades of authority-laden, sometimes starry-eyed hyperbole and glossy popularization, with its proponents becoming the ensconced emperors of most major universities' physics departments, the place that strings/branes _should_ warrant in physics departments has only grown murkier and more contentious. But the belief and the sales jobs continue unabated.Susskind says, \\"By now most string theorists have realized that, although their theory may be correct, their aspirations were incorrect. The theory itself is demanding to be seen as a theory of diversity, not uniqueness.\\" (pg 274) Susskind thinks that this is something of \`religious' importance because he thinks that if there exists a mind-bogglingly huge enough number of universes (10 to the 500th power and growing), then inevitably ours, however unique or special it may seem to those of us who contemplate its apparently fine-tuned laws, is just a \`run of the mill' inevitability. He believes that such an ensemble construction can make the world a safer place for non-theists and for philosophical materialism generally: \\"If String Theory itself is wrong, perhaps because it is mathematically inconsistent, it will fall by the wayside and, with it, the String Theory Landscape. But if that does happen, then as things stand now, we would be left with no other rational explanation for the illusion of a designed universe.\\" (pg 355) He suggests that \\"many scientists\\" do not live up to their \\"moral\\" duty and calling, by sufficiently resisting the possibility that our universe is as special as it has come to be seen since the \\"cosmic coincidences\\" began to be catalogued in the 1980s. His persistent metaphysical insistence is that the appearance of design MUST be an \\"illusion.\\" Of course, when one begins with this metaphysical demand, it is virtually inevitable that one concludes with it too. What Susskind seems unable to notice, is that, theologically speaking, he's just mashing his face against a wall. Indeed the \`megaverse' conjecture is of significant interest to theologians (who have never had any reason to doubt God's interest in diversity), but while it may stimulate theological discussions, it hardly puts the theologian out of business! In this regard, the theological conception of a First Cause of causes is (obviously) mathematically scalar, and the big question \\"why is our world special\\" would simply give way to a now bigger question, \\"why a huge ensemble of worlds perhaps infinitely diverse?\\" As Aristotle and Leibniz asked, \\"why is their something . . .\\" Any argument in which design and purpose could be said to have been eliminated by string/brane theory's \\"megaverse\\", seems nave and is easily enough sacked. If Susskind intended to wax theological, he should have taken a couple of minutes to investigate his topic. For reasons cited above, the subtitle that has been affixed to this title is misleading, whether Susskind understands that it is or not.The last chapter, Summing Up, is an admirable attempt to put the entire discussion in order. Here Susskind lays out the options as he sees them, with what he hopes is a skeptical and open mind. But he reaches conclusions that he intended to reach at the outset. If one thing is compelling in Susskind's book, it is his backhanded admission to the troubled state of theoretical physics. As I have said, the book is well written, but while the author's beliefs are well articulated, they are not persuasive. In the past I've given high marks to somewhat similar books by Hawking and Greene, of which the same can be said, but I have grown less inclined to be impressed with such books. The story they tell has worn thin.[My own summing up] Is Susskind's book well written? Yes. Is his position well defined? Yes. Is his position convincing or compelling? Not even close. Read this \`apology' critically, and in conjunction with Peter Woit's \`Not Even Wrong'."},{"Title":"COSMIC LANDSCAPE: String Theory & The Illusion Of Intelligent Design (H)","review":"The unknown can be a fearsome thing. Physicists, in particular, are easily upset by anything that cannot be predicted or mathematically explained. They firmly believe that everything is knowable and quantifiable. The Anthropic Principle does not fit this belief system. Tailor-made universes \\"smell like a Creator\\". The Big Bang does not fit into this belief system. It is a moment of creation, and implies a Creator. Several, lately, have seized upon the idea of rapid inflation of the early universe to explain away the Big Bang and obviate the need for a creator (\\"I have no need of this hypothesis\\").Hawking did it by hypothesizing that the Universe was created by an infusion of energy from \\"somewhere else\\". He doesn't say where. \\"We can consider this a mystery\\" is the only explanation he gives. Note that the \\"infusion\\" explains rapid early expansion and never mentions creation from a singularity.Susskind does it by hypothesizing a Megaverse (some call it a Multiverse) that \\"spontaneously nucleates\\" a virtually infinite number of \\"pocket universes\\" whose expansion is governed by the particular energy topology of the region where the pocket forms. Our Universe, seemingly fine-tuned for life, is just one of any number of universe environments (or vacuums), and just happens to be one amenable to life. Since all conceivable (and some that aren't) environments will eventually be produced, there is nothing special about ours. Susskind does not explain the origin of the Megaverse. He bases it on the String Theory Landscape. Another mystery. Once again, no Big Bang, and expansion is explained by a \\"spontaneously nucleated bubble\\" under the influence of topology.The problem is that they have explained nothing (maybe literally). They have just complicated the story. Susskind, at least, admits the possibility the whole immense mathematical edifice could be wrong.My view is if Hawking can accept a mystery in the form of a \\"somewhere else\\" that he sees no need to explain, then he might as well accept the mystery in the form of (or maybe just use the term) a Creator. If Susskind is going to accept the Megaverse as a given without worrying about how it came into existence (in spite of the fact that nothing about it can be proven), he might as well call it God. What's in a name?If you are wondering, yes, I have thought about Hawking's infusion of energy as one of the nucleating bubbles in Susskind's Megaverse. Which would make Susskind's the much grander view. \\"A Brief History of Time\\" would be a description of one lousy bubble (ours) in an immense expanse of possibilities. However, I am not buying any of this. The \\"real explanation\\" is still out there somewhere.\\"The Cosmic Landscape\\" is an interesting read, even if you don't agree with it. Susskind is an excellent writer. He freely admits he failed at writing science fiction, but his grasp of satire seems firm. His chapter on Fyshicists, Codmologists, and the Ickthropic Principle is hilarious."},{"Title":"COSMIC LANDSCAPE: String Theory & The Illusion Of Intelligent Design (H)","review":"An interesting book.

Two thumbs up"},{"Title":"COSMIC LANDSCAPE: String Theory & The Illusion Of Intelligent Design (H)","review":"This is a very readable presentation of string theory and how the 10**500 possible universes fit into the context of the Anthropic Principle. He basically argues that the many many possibilities of string theory mean that the Anthropic Principle has a chance: with all these possibilities being tried out in quantum parallel, even highly unlikely universes can come into being. We, of course, will wake up in the universe that is compatible with our evolution and existence. He agrees that this approach is not elegant or pretty - but it may be the only way to explain how it is that a very small fiddling of the physical constants would have made it impossible for life as we know it to have come into being in the universe.It's very interesting to read this book as a counter-balance to the books by Smolin and Woit, who both castigate String Theory for having these 10**500 possibilities. They therefore regard the predictive capability of String Theory as zero; whereas Susskind portrays this multitude as being the only conceivable explanation of how life could have developed when so many things could have gone wrong.

Written by the \\"founding father\\" of string theory, it is highly recommendable to those unfamiliar with the history and current concepts of string theory. It is also a useful book since it demolishes the illusion that the universe is itself a product of intelligent design, which, regrettably, a very small group of \\"mathematicians\\" and \\"scientists\\" associated with the Seattle, Washington-based Discovery Institute have insisted for decades. However, while I am impressed with Susskind's clarity of thought and fine prose, I remain skeptical of his assertion that the universe does adhere to some kind of anthropic principle; that the laws of nature are sufficiently favorable to promote the emergence of intelligent life. It's an assertion that is mere wish fulfillment than one that is demonstrable scientifically, at least from the mathematics and logic Susskind employs throughout \\"The Cosmic Landscape\\".

What he is not is a gifted writer. This book is dry and more of an introduction to String Theory and related concepts rather than a defense on why he believes Intelligent Design via the Anthropic Principle fails (which gets minimum air time). Susskind is those type of thinkers who come off much better orally than written. Even more strangely there is no select bibliography for better research into these questions. For an intro into String Theory this is a good start, for an intro into the debates over the Anthropic Principle and an intelligent designer you would do much better looking elsewhere."},{"Title":"COSMIC LANDSCAPE: String Theory & The Illusion Of Intelligent Design (H)","review":"This is one of the best physics books I have read. And I've read a lot. You won't regret buying this one."},{"Title":"COSMIC LANDSCAPE: String Theory & The Illusion Of Intelligent Design (H)","review":"Ever since popularized accounts of modern physics started to become popular in the 80's there have become a plethora of books that present modern ideas in physics with the 'golly gee whiz' factor. This is both good and bad.Works like 'The Cosmic Landscape' have both a positive and negative side. On the one hand they keep the general public interested and informed about advancement in science. This interest may spark a young reader to pursue a career in science or technology. On the other hand they can give the general public a false idea of what science is and what it is not.Unfortunately the majority of the information presented in this work and other popular acccounts of modern physics are simply presentations of established physical theory that are then morphed into wild metaphysical speculation. What the authors always leave out is that it appears theoretical physics seems to be in a state of stagnation lacking any communal identity. When this happens researchers usually start forming into camps. String Theory is one of those camps.The fact is nearly a century after its inception physicists have yet to even aggree on a proper interpretation of Quantum Mechanics yet allone come to a concensus on the valdity of the current Standard Model vs String Theory. When physicists start speculating on the interpretations they throw Ocaam's Razor to the wind and propose 'far out' and unneeded ideas like paralell universes and the like. This is fine if one remembers that such speculations cannot be cooberated by existing observation and physical evidence.For some unknown reason many in the theoretical community seem to be obsessed with various forms of the many-world interpretation. It seems to be the prevailing theme today in the popular accounts on the bookshelf. The public loves it because it has the obvious appeal but it can lead the public to think of science as they would an episode of Star Trek- an other-worldy realm of fantasy. Perhaps a footnote at the beginning - * What follows is only speculation.It is good to ask questions and imagination is key to discovery but one should also remember that speculations about such things is simply that-speculation and imagination.Nobody currently has answers to many of the questions posed by Modern physics and many speculate if it is even possible to physically verify the existence of sructures that are a product of some of the curent theories. Until that evidence exists String Theory and the like are in a state of Limbo. Some in the Popper camp even question whether String Theory is even a theory as it currently cannot be falsified. The Current Standard Model and/or String theory cannot even demonstrate how electrons and protons interact to form a bound state and create atomic structure let allone show how a 'paralell universe' would form.Furthermore when you start venturing into concepts like the anthropic principle, intelligent design etc you are diverging from science and entering the world of currently unverifiable conjecture.From a philosophical perspective it seems as if the author is attempting to force the solution. Being an agnostic I tend to stear clear of the design debate but it appears from the tone that Susskin rejects the idea of design on philosophical grounds. He then proceeds to assume since design is not a property of the universe then the parameters and theory must not include design as a possibility. He then proceeds to construct a framework where this is the case and in so doing forces the theory to fit the ontological assumption that the structure is not produced by design. This is where he ventures away from science and into metaphysical speculation. He then assumes the solution is true and attempts to work the problem in reverse to show how the objectons are invalid. In so doing he is making further assumptions to validate his first assumptions and so on.In a nutshell the author implies that the result of the mathematics in his theory implies an infinite array of universes that are being created as a result of inflation. Each world has it's own set of laws and physical paramters. Therefore it is only probable that at least one of these worlds would have a universe that allows the formation of all structures needed to support life. Therefore the answer to the question of why we are here is reduced to 'we are here because the law of averages dictates so'. This still begs the question, however as if one were a theist or deist one could speculate this overall scheme was the grand design of the designer. So this theory in itself does not rule out the possibiltiy of design. In the end nothing is really answered.As long as man exists he could always conjecture on philosophical grounds that the universe is or is not a product of design regardless of the physical theory used to explain the structures of which the world is composed. It is a topic best left to philosophers. Science is not concerned with such questions. Science only is concerned with phenomenon that are ultimately available to the senses either directly or indirectly. In the realm of scientific inquiry if it cannot be measured it cannot be known.The whole of the argument rests on the validity of String Theory as an accurate model of physical reality. As it stands now, however there is not even observed physical evidence that cooberates 'string theory' so it is actually quite premature to even state it as a 'fact' as one would typically use this term in science. All we can currently surmise is that string theory is not inconsisent with current observations. Then again neither was Ptolemy's theory of epicycles and defferents. What the 'real' picture entails is still open to debate and is waiting further results of future observation and experiment. Most of the speculations and theories held in this work are currently not verifiable by observations. Therefore they still fall into the arena of speculative hypothesis.Theoretical physicists are just like anyone else. They age and ask themselves the same questions everyone else does-what is the meaning of it all? Why is there something rather than nothing? What am I? They then attempt to speculate and conjecture based on their own world views and paradigms. The answers often are vague ontological theories about the nature of reality that appear in books like 'The Cosmic Landscape'.The book is well written and concise but offers nothing new. There are numerous popular accounts of modern physics and unfortunately they are all becoming repetitive, old, and increasingly more like diversions into metaphysics. 'Cosmic Landacape' is no exception. A lot of concepts are presented as factual when in fact they are still relegated to hypothesis.As with other books in this class a very gifted author and scientist is giving his/her speculation on how the universe might be..not how it neccesarily is. I think many lay readers do not view works such as this in this regards and believe what they are reading is scientificaly factual."},{"Title":"Bark, Spike, Bark!","review":"Spike keeps barking when Stu is cleaning the car and he needs to get a part but Tommy and Chuckie think it will keep spike from barking."},{"Title":"Call of Cthulhu: Nocturnum","review":"I just finished running this campaign, and my group did have some fun with it.

Secondly, the artwork is terrible. Not so much in its quality, as in its inaccuracy. It was rare when the pictures of NPCs matched up to thier written descriptions. Several of the seneraios are unimaginative and bland (This is partcularly true towards the end of the campaign.)Some of the positive aspect of the campaign consist of its action elements.

The plot wildly cycles in tone and intensity, and while there is a decent overall flow, it needs to be handled by a good GM, and not just pulled straight off the page.Overall, a good story that actually makes a CoC campaign worthwhile.

These are questions that you must find the answers to, and do in this exciting page-turner.She was the Master for a reason, and in \\"And then there were none\\" (The film was titled \\"Ten Little Indians\\"); you too will see why."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"arguably Agatha Christie's best work. And it is good, and my favorite of hers, but upon rereading I found that the ending was slightly cheapened. There truly was no way to solve this mystery other than being told at the end just how it happened. And I felt the death of one of my favorite characters at the end was just not fitting. But it is a great premise (and I correctly identified the killer, though not the way but somewhat of the reason). And it is one of the finest mystery writers at her finest."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"Although, I consider most of Agatha Christie's mystery books at the top. However, I think that this the most outstanding mystery book. Please give this book a chance! It talks about 10 strangers each lured to an island. And one by one thing die. Who is the murderer? Keep in mind, that Agatha Christie is the master at writing! I just loved this book...READ IT! THis is beyond doubt, one of Christie's best ever written including the Appointment with Death, murder on the Orient Express. I read this book only in 1 day because I didn't want to put this magnificent book down. I guarantee you that you will enjoy reading it!"},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"I think this book is the best book Iv'e ever read and all my friends think the same. well since I cant really make you read this book im just telling why you will be missing out on the best book. Its about 10 strangers that are brought together for what they think is a vacation. But its really a death trap and they dont even have a clue. 1 by one they each find a poem and then the next day poof one of them misteriously dies for some unknown reason. I strongly recomend this book for everyone even if you one of those people like me that dont really like reading. The way Agatha Cristie writes the book is so OUTSTANDING that I cant say enough about it. I love the way it keeps you wondering and the way the poems go right along with the deaths its just so good. please read this book if youll thank me for it."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"Ten Little Indians (And Then There Were None) was a startling and clever mystery about ten interesting people with questionable backgrounds together on a strange island. At first it was hard to keep track of ten characters' personalities and pasts. I liked how the tension grew with each \\"death,\\" but I wish the living characters' guilt would have come out more. The setting of a plain, new, contemporary house on a straightforward island near the mainland that was regularly used for parties made it even more mysterious. It made the story more mysterious because they could easily conclude that they were the only ones on the island, there weren't any hiding places, and it wasn't the classic old mansion and thunderstorm, murder mystery setting. This made for a well-developed and suspenseful novel."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"I thought this book to be an interesting book, and the plot was superb. Agatha Christie kept her readers on the edge. I found this hard put down, and the constant elimantaion of the characters kept you thinking.

I had an idea about who the murderer was, I won't say who though. Her characters are so interesting and each have such an interesting tale that you simply cannot put the book down! I loved it, and I am only a pre-teen! Great for all ages. This book was great all the way through. My only suggestion is that maybe you would want to read a more difficult version.

Then I picked up &quot;And Then There Were None&quot;. I fell in love with it immediately (though I admittedly skipped the first chapter). Now I own (yes, own) almost fifty Agatha Christies and have read all of them. And I'm only fifteen. I don't consider this the best book ever written. However, as a mystery this is an amazing book. It has some emotion and substance to it, unlike many mysteries (and unlike many Agatha Christies, i.e. &quot;Big Four&quot; and other Poirot books). Suspenseful and fun. Read it, I urge you. Perhaps you'll fall in love with mysteries as well."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"I own over thirty Agatha Christie books, and this is my favorite. This was my first adult book (I read it when I was 10), and Agatha wrote the book in a way that was both intriguing and easy for everyone to grasp. The plot itself remained true to the artist's trademark style, gathering a certain amount of people and placing them in a life ending predicament. The ending was of Dame Agatha's best, and this was without the amazing Hercule Poirot to help us come to the conclusion. I reccommend any Agatha book, whether it be a classic such as this, the Mousetrap, Murder on the Orient Express, or even the more understated books... remember that Dame Agatha wrote almost 80 mystery novels, and each have twisting and original plots. Agatha Christie is one of the greatest authors that ever lived... and I don't think that anyone will contradict that after reading this novel."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"This is the best Agatha Christie novel. I even liked it better than Murder on the Orient Express. It's a classic plot: a group of people alone on island with a murderer among them. Although difficult to solve (but I think all of hers are difficult to solve) it makes complete sense at the end. You'll kick yourself because once you find out who did it it's so obvious. It's probably the best mystery novel of all time...seriously."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"Ten people are invited for a weekend getaway on an island, unknowingly that their lifes would end in just a few days. One by one, each person is killed in a way that relates to a poem that is hanging in the hotel entitled \\"Ten Little Indians\\" (which used to be the former title of this book), that hangs next to ten porcelain indians. As each person dies, one indian breaks. This story will keep you guessing who the murderer is until you finish the book. Beware it may not be who you think!

This is that one book that needs to sit by the fireplace with you!"},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"Hey everyone, Let me start off by saying that Agatha Christie is really one of the best authors out there.

There isnt \\"one\\" person after the murderer...there are 10! the whole idea of 10 people trapped in an Island with a murderer is just incredible...to make it even BETTER the murderer is one of them and they have to figure out who it is before its \\"too\\" late!Like I said before the whole idea of the murderer was awesome....You should def. read it!Lattttttttter!"},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"While not having the most ingenious denouement, nevertheless this book is definately the scariest Christie wrote.

That's the idea in Agatha Christie's mistery novel &quot;And Then There Were None.&quot; Not only does it keep you on the edge of your seet, it will keep you coming back for more.

In the beginning of the story, a mysterious person, refered to as U.N. Owen, sends ten peoplenotes saying they should take an opporunity to visit Indian Island. The charactors agree, thinking U.N. Owen is a distant friend. From the point the people arriveat Indian Island everything turns into hell. All ten people die, and it is a musteru to find out who it is.

However, after reading AND THEN THERE WERE NONE, I wish that there actually were none, of her novels that is. The book starts off with ten people receiving invitations from an unknown man to visit and isolated, uninhabited island. The book gives a brief discription of the characters then they arrive at Indian Island. The ten then start hearing voices telling of killings that they were never found guilty of. Then they start being killed off one by one. No one knows who the murderer is, but as the novel wears on it is predictable as to who the murderer is. The book never really caught my attention too much and I found it easy to put the book down and talk bad about Agatha. I did like the underline meaning of the book though, which is how mans guilt can eventually wear him down. I just wish Agatha would have made the content more invigorating."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"This by far is the best Agatha Christie book I've ever read! Once I picked it up I couldn't put it down! Every time I was sure I knew who the killer was, that person would wind up dead. This is an excellent book and is sure to satisfy anyone's craving for a good mystery. Once you read this book, you are sure to find yourself back in the bookstaore looking for more Agatha Christie mysteries. Well, why are you still reading this? Go get the book already!"},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"Unlike most mysteries you will read, this one will always stay with you. Agatha Christie has surmounted the mystery form to provide a fascinating story of morality and immorality, in which justice plays an unusual hand. The title nicely displays the mystery (which has a perfect plot from my point of view). And then there were none -- who did it? Agatha Christie wrote this in a spare and efficient way so that the story starts moving immediately, and speeds up as you go.As you can imagine from the book's age and the author, this is a classic English murder mystery. The murders are there, but the blood does not overwhelm. Violence and social niceties nudge one another for your attention. At the same time, there is hope. Agatha Christie adds her hope for the future in a most unusual way in this novel, that will leave you encouraged for the future of humanity after first causing you to despair.One of the beauties of the plot is that it expands on the famous locked room format to include an island where there is no access or exit, nor any way to communicate. That gives much more room for interesting plot developments without losing any of the intellectual puzzle of a locked room.An unusual factor about this novel is that you will soon find yourself identifying with the guilty victims (even though you are not a murderer). Usually, mystery novels have the reader identifying with the innocents or the detective. That is accomplished by creating a gripping sense of paranoia as the numbers of those on the island rapidly dwindle.Don't miss this book! Once you start you won't be able to put it down.After you are done and have savored all of the book's brilliance, reflect a little about how Agatha Christie explored stalled thinking about what was going on to make the plot so effective. Then think about all of those places in your life and business where things may also not be what they seem. If you can use this insight to locate your misconception stalls, you will be doubly blessed by reading this book. --This text refers to the Hardcover edition."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"Fantastic story.

Period. There is no question in my mind that she is the epitome of what mystery storytelling is about.'And Then There Were None' is, I believe, her all time greatest novel.

There are many reasons why this Agatha Christie novel was so great. Perhaps the most significant reason is the desire to know what is going to happen next. The book is about ten people who are invited to a weekend of fun by an anonymous guest. One by on they are eliminated until there becomes no guests left and a note from the mad host. This novel was actually HARD to stop reading. All the clues intrigued me to read on. For example, when the characters arrived to an unoccupied mansion you had to figure that something was going on. And as the amount of people on the island decreased the suspicion increased. This book was great from the start to finish -- from the invitation letters signed, \\"UNKNOWN\\" to the final intrigue of the last few deaths of the last remaining guests. If you can get your hands on it definitely read this book. It is great for those who like suspense. Agatha Christie is a great author who does a great job with mystery novels and this is perhaps her best work"},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"All I can say is wow. This is such a great book. Ten people who are all complete strangers are invited out to an isolated island for a vacation. When the host doesn't show up and people start dropping like flies, you start to really get into the book. This is one that you won't want to put down. It involves several mysteries, including who is the murderer, who will die next and the mysterious past of the characters. This is definately one of the best Agatha Christie books. Also, (take it from me because I'm a kid) it's great for kids and adults. You gotta read this one!"},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"Set on an isolated island without contact of the outside civilization, Agatha Christie's novel And Then There Were None is the story of ten strangers invited to an island by a mysterious host.The book starts out with an introduction to the ten characters. Although this is effective in telling the characters, it is also boring and does not catch your attention right away. But as soon as the guests arrive on Indian Island, this boredom disperses and an exciting thriller breaks through. What is also exciting about this novel is you have no idea who is committing these strange murders.The first night these people are at the house they are greeted with an eerie voice that accuses them of murders that were committed but were never convicted of in the past. When the guests arrive there is no trace of U.N. Owen, but as the guests start to die this mysterious figure reveals his ugly face.This book shows fear in peoples conciences, the guilt that lies within, and the hate among strangers. Anyone who wants to read a suspenseful murder mystery, and wants to stay on the edge of their seats, should read this wicked novel of horror and fear..."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"Amazing... I was, of course, previously aqcuainted with Agatha Christie books, and therfore, I wasn't particularily excited when I first came across this book. I found other books by her to have a good, solid plot, but the writing, I felt, was boring. I certainly changed my mind after I began reading this book! Not only is the plot absolutely flawless and cunning, the writing also is very clever. Christie makes you feel quite confident that you know who the murderur is, and then she confuses you and you immediately begin to suspect a different character, whilst the one you first suspected turns out to be more guilty than you thought... Truly, her cleverness has no parallel. This is definitely the best mystery I have ever read, and the most frightening one, too. The mere concept of the murders the took place gave me nightmares- but nevertheless the book was well worth my time. I think, though, that anyone blessed with such a clever mind, able to plan such cunning murders and clever, mentally unbalanced murderurs and astonishing plots and such believable yet chilling motives for the murder.... That person, namely Agatha Christie, has to be a little mentally unbalanced herself..."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"I have long loved Agatha Christie's work and I've read \\"And Then There Were None\\" several times (I teach the novel in a high school). My only issue with this particular edition is that, in an attempt to be politically correct, the publishers chose to change the name of the island from Indian Island to Soldier Island. This would be alright except that they left in all of the anti-semitic rhetoric (with regards to Isaac Morris) and racist comments about African natives. If you're going to go PC, then do it completely or not at all. Or better yet, educate people about the changes in attitudes from one time period to another and read it in that context."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"Ten strangers from multiple walks of life are invited to Indian Island, Devon under false pretenses. Each of them harbors a dark secret, for each may have committed murder. And collectively, they become a target for a vengeance-minded killer, patterning their deaths after a counting poem, \\"Ten Little Indians.\\" As they die, one by one, it soon becomes clear that the killer is one of them, but only death can completely acquit them.I love a good mystery, but I have been hesitant to start reading the works of crime's high priestess. I've seen a few films based on Agatha Christie's books, but given how prolific she was (80 novels and stories, many of which were \\"series\\" books), I just felt a slight panic at delving into her work. So I started with her best loved novel, \\"And Then There Were None,\\" a stand-alone work. Now I'm feeling a little stupid for waiting for so long.Christie knew how to set a mood (duh!). She introduces her characters in quick and broad strokes, revealing bits and pieces of all ten before they reach the island, explaining why they THINK they are there, and hinting at their guilty consciences. Not surprisingly, it's hard to get a good grip on these characters in the first couple of chapters, as Christie rushes them along to Indian Island. Granted, since a couple don't make it through the first night, Christie's broad approach is completely understandable. But once the murders start, Christie slows down, taking her time to superbly examine the characters' fear and paranoia, and desperation.Moreover, Christie does a beautiful job of revealing the minds of these characters without giving any hint of whom the ultimate monster is. The reader is in many ways just as susceptible to the fear that the characters are dealing with (except of course that the reader is never in any danger). Even considering that several of them are out and out creeps, the reader can't help but feel empathy for them as they spend the weekend in an absolute panic. It's very easy to understand the isolation and impotency the ten must face as they try to outwit their would-be killer.After this suspenseful romp, I am eager to look into Christie's work more fully. Even if I don't, this one book has already made it into my list of favorite books. The quiet menace of \\"And Then There Were None\\" is an astounding, frightening, and wonderfully ghoulish delight."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"The mysterious U.N. Owen lures ten people, unknown to each other, to the isolated Indian Island. When they arrive, the guests find a nursery rhyme in their room, but no host. All are accused of murder. All proclaim their innocence. And one by one, the guests suffer the deadly fate of the \`Ten Little Indians'.Written in a deceptively concise but clear prose, Agatha Christie shows us the foibles of each character. The plot moves fast, and the mysterious deaths keep you guessing until the end. Considered as one of the best in the genre, And Then There Were None is the classic prefect-murder mystery."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"Agatha Christie's \\"And Then There Were None\\" is a superbly written mystery in the whodunit mode. It is invigorating how she is able to intertwine the ten characters, and suspects, within the novel and tie everything together. I also thought the ending was rather unexpected and made for a fantastic murder mystery.Ten people, all of whom have shady pasts, are all summoned to a private island known as Indian Island. Once they arrive their host, Mr. Owens, is no where to be found. A curious nursery rhyme about 10 little Indians is left behind in some of the rooms, and then an even more curious message is played to the guests by the butler, accusing all 10 people of murder in one form or another. From here, people begin to be plucked off one by one, and as the bodies mount, the secrets become revealed and more and more suspicion arises from the guests. Pay attention to the nursery rhyme at the very beginning of the story, as it is an intricate part of the story's plot. It was ingenious how Christie's develops the ending, especially those final three chapters.If you are a fan of mystery and suspense, and love to play the role of detective as you read, then this will be a unique read. It is also a very easy, quick read, as the pages just seem to fly by. I was quite impressed with this novel, and it certainly makes me want to check out more Agatha Christie novels."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"Wow. This book is definitly worth reading. I read this book in 7th grade and with a little help from Spark Notes, this book made complete sense. The suspense is deadly, and you literally can't put this book down! I read this book in one day, because I couldn't stand to stop reading it. It's not like one of those books where it takes chapters to actually become good- its good from the beginning! In this book, you'll find yourself making accusions of whom the murderer is! And the ending will SHOCK you. The only bad part about it is that it was written with many swear words, especially in the beginning. It also discusses some mature situations, such as drinking, murdering, and some brief violence. And also, there are 10 characters in this book to keep track of. That can be somewhat difficult, but at www.sparknotes.com, they have a complete character list which hill help you tremendously!

I must admit to being impressed. \\"And Then There Were None\\" is a solid whodunit from the old school. We have all experienced the storyline before, most likely because others have \\"borrowed\\" it from Author Christie. The proverbial \\"mysterious stranger\\" invites ten individuals to an island. Each has a definite skeleton is his or her personal closet. One by one they die. The plot thickens as the group realizes that the murderer is one of them! This reviewer won't reveal the ending -as some fellow amazoners have!- but I believe it is plausible. The resolution certainly completes the circle. ATTWN has the added value of being highly readable. No doubt many have consumed it in one sitting, pulled along by the momentum. There are two soft points to ATTWN. 1) The reader must accept the initial premise that the ten accepted a mysterious invitation from a complete stranger and 2)its' brevity precludes the development of any of the characters. A few of these were \\"characters\\" in their own right! Another 30-50 pages would only have bolstered the suspense. Those who like mystery/crime/ murder novels should not be disappointed. With 80 novels and 14 plays to her credit, Ms. Christie is a low risk author, especially at paperback prices. A final word of warning: Do not be fooled, as this reviewer was, by the classic 1945 movie version with Barry Fitzgerald and Walter Huston. Though equally satisfying, the endings are NOT the same."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"Ten people are summoned by letter to Indian Island off the Devon coast.

When they are all in the dining room, there is a recording played that talks about each of the guests. The recording mentions the crime that each person has committed. They are all found guilty.I was in suspence through the whole book. There were clues throughout the story with the nursery rhyme, \\"Ten Little Indians\\" that was posted in each of the guests rooms for them to read and think about.

Happy reading....and good luck!"},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"Ten people arrive at a large house on a private island, and one by one they die, dictated by the lines of a nursery rhyme...this endlessly imitated scenario is the setting of Agatha Christie's classic, AND THEN THERE WERE NONE.More than anything, what distinguishes this novel from Christie's other works is that this is the only mystery that actually generates suspense--and by suspense I mean sheer, genuine terror. This isn't just about a murder mystery; it's about a ruthless killer, and you KNOW that sooner or later, every character is going to die.Even more chilling is the question of just who the murderer is. The killer has to be one of the ten--but is it? The murders are committed so brilliantly (one woman dies from a bee sting) that Christie subtly suggests the possibility of a supernatural murderer, a possibility that never really fades from the reader's mind even though it violates all principles of the detective story.I might say that AND THEN THERE WERE NONE is Christie's most entertaining work. Usually it takes me at least three days to finish a book, but I completed this one in less than one day. Christie demonstrates some of her most stylish, hypnotic prose in this novel--her narrative literally propels the reader forward. Her characters are flawlessly structured, and the suspense is skillfully maintained.As for the plotting--although the central situation is intriguing, to say the least, the plotting itself is not nearly as complex and ingenious as THE MURDER OF ROGER ACKROYD or DEATH ON THE NILE. While the excitement of the ten murders is more than enough to keep this thriller going, the story is really not as layered and intricate as one might expect. But don't let this keep you from reading it--the solution is surprising and satisfying, and you probably won't have a more entertaining reading experience. Not quite the definitive Christie, but excellent nonetheless."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"What can I say? The first Agatha Christie I ever read, and I've read over forty of her books since. None of them, however (nor any other book), has ever replaced it as my unquestioned favorite. Great characters (the dense Mr. Blore was my favorite), a brilliant plot (every character is a suspect, murderer, AND a victim!), and a chilling, suspenseful atmosphere. If you HAVE to see one of the movie versions, see the 1945 film starring Walter Huston, Roland Young, and Richard Haydn.Although it (and all other film versions) stupidly alters the original novel ending (yes, I know Agatha herself changed it for the stage), it still contains plenty of atmosphere and hilarious dark humor."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"if you like mysteries you should deffinately 100% read this book!

It is so tightly plotted it fairly hums. There are no gaps in the logic. What is unusual is that you know after the first fifty pages or so exactly what is going to happen, yet the book cannot be put down. The characters are well developed and Dame Christie put a lot of thought into constructing a tight novel. In the long run that is what sets this book apart. This could be used as a role model ( and probably has been) for the logical construction and plotting of mystery books"},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"This was SUCH a good book! It was the first Agatha Christie book I read, and I was hooked! The plot is so clever, and ingenious.

If you love mysteries, and even if you don't, this is a great book you HAVE to read!"},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"The murder mystery And Then There Were None outdoes any mystery novel of its time. Agatha Christie's supurb novel is the textbook murder mystery in every aspect, from its clever plot and stupifying events should be read by any reader, whether he is an avid mystery lover or someone who just wants to read a magnificent novel with great flow that will keep you reading until midnight. The book takes place on a small island on the Devon coast where 10 guests are mysteriously invited by a U.N. Owen and later are all accused of murder by a phonograph played by the butler. Only these aren't normal murders. These are murders which the law couldn't touch. From car accidents of a reckless driver from a docter under the influence during a surgury. Soon after, a guest myseriously died of cyanide poisining, although there is no reason he should commit suicide. They later find out they are paying for their &quot;murders&quot;, one by one. From the suspensful race to find the murderer before he gets to them to the unbelievable ending where the murderer's secrets are revealed, this book is non-stop excitment!"},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"Unlike most mysteries you will read, this one will always stay with you. Agatha Christie has surmounted the mystery form to provide a fascinating story of morality and immorality, in which justice plays an unusual hand. The title nicely displays the mystery (which has a perfect plot from my point of view). And then there were none -- who did it?Agatha Christie wrote this in a spare and efficient way so that the story starts moving immediately, and speeds up as you go. It will be impossible to put this book down once you start reading it.As you can imagine from the book's age and the author, this is a classic English murder mystery. The murders are there, but the blood does not overwhelm. Violence and social niceties nudge one another for your attention. At the same time, there is hope. Agatha Christie adds her hope for the future in a most unusual way in this novel, that will leave you encouraged for the future of humanity after first causing you to despair.One of the beauties of the plot is that it expands on the famous locked room format to include an island where there is no access or exit, nor any way to communicate. That gives much more room for interesting plot developments without losing any of the intellectual puzzle of a locked room.An unusual factor about this novel is that you will soon find yourself identifying with the guilty victims (even though you are not a murderer). Usually, mystery novels have the reader identifying with the innocents or the detective. That is accomplished by creating a gripping sense of paranoia as the numbers of those on the island rapidly dwindle.Don't miss this book!After you are done and have savored all of the book's brilliance, reflect a little about how Agatha Christie explored stalled thinking about what was going on to make the plot so effective. Then think about all of those places in your life and business where things may also not be what they seem. If you can use this insight to locate your misconception stalls, you will be doubly blessed by reading this book."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"Nine people were summoned to Indian Island by an unknown Mr.Owen, they received letters written with vague details, not really explaining what the purpose of going to Indian Island was. After the guests arrive, terrible things happen, people are murdered and no one knows who could possibly be behind the crimes. As the number of people starts narrowing down, the guests learn that no one else but themselves is in the island, and that one of them must be the person behind the murders. But, who? It doesn't look like any of them will make it out of the island alive...Agatha Christie is not the Queen of Crime for no reason. She really does know who to write a mystery novel. The characters were well developed and complicated, very much like real human beings. I give this book a 5! It was suspenseful and enjoyable, I had fun trying to figure out who did it. At then end of the book, when I finally learned who the murderer was, I was a little bit surprised, I thought that would be the last person to do something like that.

And 'AND THEN THERE WERE NONE' (aka TEN LITTLE INDIANS) is hailed as one of her greatest works, so I decided if I wanted to read something by one of the masters of suspense this was as good a place to start as any!'AND THEN THERE WERE NONE' is a mystery in its barest form. There are no high speed car chases, no violent shoot outs, no glitz, no glamour. Just the story of ten strangers lured to an island by a madman who is killing them off one by one. What is the twist you ask? The madman is most certainly one of the ten and it is up to them all to try to figure out who it is before they all fall victim to his whims.I love to read old books and I am so glad to have chosen Agatha Christie's 'AND THEN THERE WERE NONE' as my first aquatience with this acclaimed author. While I had my theories as to who this madman was the book definitely kept me guessing until the very last passage, where I found out that who I thought was the killer was completely wrong! This is a must read for any lover of mysteries and good books."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"'And Then There Were None' is the harbinger of today's horror. Written in 1939 by Agatha Christie, the novel skyrocketed the Mystery Mistress's career.Ten people are mysteriously summoned to a infamous island retreat. When the launch leaves them on the landing at the isolated house on Indian Island, they are cut off from the world. Their mysterious host is missing when, after a lovely dinner, a harsh announcement from a recording permeates the room, accusing each person of a diabolical crime.Cradled in fear, everyone wants off the island immediately but there is no way off. One by one, people begin to die. With each suspecting the other, they must wait for the launch to show up, or for their own death.'And Then There Were None' still holds a certain charm for me, and remains one of the absolute best 'whodunnits' of the century. The prose is simplistic enough for young adult reading, and for the advanced reader it's a bullet-though-a-gun read that you won't be able to put down. Perfect for reading on an airplane or at the beach.I first read 'And Then There Were None' as a young adult, and while re-reading noticed that though the prose is not very stylistic or grand, the plot alone is enough to keep you turning pages. This short, smart novel is a 'must read' for any mystery or horror lover. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"Imagine being on an island in the nicest house in the world and everything going well until you and the other guest were all accused of murder. Then people start to die in synch to a poem written framed hanging in all the bedrooms and in the mist of all that figuring out that you and everyone else does not know who the host is that invited you all to the house on the island is. And Then There Were None is a non-fiction mystery novel written by Agatha Christie. Christie has written many novels about mystery along with And Then There Were None. The characters in the story are Mr. and Mrs. Rogers, Judge Wargrave, Vera Claythorne, Philip Lombard, Dr.Armstrong, William Blore, Emily Brent, General Macarthur, Anthony Marston, and Isaac Morris. Each character except Isaac had been accused of murder on a voice recorder set up when they were all in the same room. Each character gets more suspicious as the book progresses. The setting of the book is Soldier Island (a fake island) of the coast of Devon in the 1930's. People start dying when a voice recorder accuses them of murder in the home of an unknown host. No one knows who committed an actual murder or just did something by accident. When people start to die the same way the soldiers in the poem do some of the guest start to think something's up.Also as the guest dies the soldier boy statues on the table start to disappear. To make matters worst the people in the house have no idea who their host is though he sent them a invitation that was very vague. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes mysteries and suspenseful books. If you like trying to solve small problems this book may be for you too. Overall I think this is a good book. It is very interesting and leaves you hanging at some points.byMike Callaghan"},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"My sophmore year in high school I didn't read ANY of the books they gave to us...except And Then There Were None.

However, this book was such a joy to read, every single person in my class finished early. I read And Then There Were None in 8th grade and have called it one of my favorite books for many years. It does such a fantastic job of creating suspense for the reader to feel that you will not even want to put it down. Every single chapter ends in a cliff hanger and the ending is just outstanding.

Its suspense is amazing and left me engrossed all the way to the end. It was different from others because it approached getting justice for the victims in an unusual way leaving readers to ponder about it."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"I cannot say that I am Agatha Christie's number one fan in the world simply because I am not the number one fan of the mystery genre. But I must tell you that when I do read a mystery I like the sort of story that features deductive reasoning in solving the mystery rather than the plethora of such novels involving scientific police procedures. I think the term that suits me best as far as such things go is \\"reactionary,\\" at worse and \\"old fashion\\" at best. I am a big Arthur Conan Doyle fan for that very reason so even though \\"mysteries\\" per se are not at the top of my list, I do enjoy reading them from time to time. Over the years I have read a number of Christie's book and have yet to be disappointed in any of them. This, my third reading of \\"And Then There Were None.\\" is no exceptionI will say that this work is a bit different than Christie's other work in that there is no detective to \\"solve the case.\\" The reader is put on the spot to supply their own deductive reasoning to work out \\"who done it.\\" I rather like this approach for a change.Ten people are invited to an isolated house located on Indian Island. No one else is in the house or on the island. One by one the guests, after each has been rather uniquely accused of murder. And then one by one the guests begin dying...murdered. One of the guests is the murderer!The author has done a very nice job, in my opinion, of putting this plot together. While she possibly could have done better is the area of character development, this work, when you consider its length, is really not set up for that. The overriding theme is murder and who did it. I personally was unable to figure out who the killer was, but then I am not the brightest star in the sky and am most certainly not an expert on murder mysteries. Perhaps others will do better.This is an interesting book for a couple of other reasons. Since it was first published in England in 80 some odd years ago it has gone through at least three title changes and has, via various editions been bowdlerized - to the extreme. This all has been done out of political correctness and belated racial sensitivities. While Christie was most certainly a brilliant writer, she was also most certainly a product of her times when it came to racial issues and it shows. The original English edition never made it to this country, as far as I know, and if the original title was kept there is no way on earth that it would be published in this day and age.This is one of Christie's better known novels and there have been a number of plays and movies made from it. Some folks love this novel; others are not so fond of it. It is one of my personal favorites of her work but then I have not read every one of her books so I cannot really say it is the best or worse. I do know I liked it and will quite likely read it again on down the road.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks"},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"This was the first Agatha Christie book that I had ever read and I absolutely loved it. Once I started reading it, I couldn't put it down until the end.The story was written in a smart way, the characters were varied and credible and the suspense became more and more claustrophobic as I was getting closer to the end, a genius, completely unexpected, but very logical end.The plot is based on a song with puerile, funny lyrics on the basis of which more and more shocking crimes are being committed:Ten little Indian boys went out to dine; One choked his little self and then there were nine./Nine little Indian boys sat up very late; One overslept himself and then there were eight./Eight little Indian boys travelling in Devon; One said he'd stay there and then there were seven./Seven little Indian boys chopping up sticks; One chopped himself in halves and then there were six./Six little Indian boys playing with a hive; A bumblebee stung one and then there were five./Five little Indian boys going in for law; One got in Chancery and then there were four./Four little Indian boys going out to sea; A red herring swallowed one and then there were three./Three little Indian boys walking in the Zoo; A big bear hugged one and then there were two./Two little Indian boys sitting in the sun; One got frizzled up and then there was one./One little Indian boy left all alone; He went and hanged himself and then there were none.Ten persons - Philip Lombard (ex-soldier), Vera Claythorne (ex-governess), General Macarthur, Emily Brent (\\"an elderly woman\\"), Doctor Armstrong, Tony Marston (a rich young man), William Blore (a retired police inspector), Thomas Roger and his wife (cooks) and the Judge Wargrave - are tricked into coming onto a deserted island, near Devon, by someone called U.N. Owen who knows each one's past. They don't know each other, the only thing that they have in common being the fact that each of them commited a murder without being punished. As soon as they arrive on the island, the game begins: ten, nine, eight...the characters die one after the other. Will anyone survive? Read and find out!"},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"This book's cover proclaims And Then There Were None to be the world's best-selling mystery and quotes one publication as naming it \\"Agatha Christie's masterpiece.\\" Christie wrote an author's note preceding the story, in which she notes that she was really pleased with this book because only she knew how difficult it was to write.Difficult to write because Christie set out to tell a murder mystery in which ten people were killed without the story becoming ridiculous or the killer becoming obvious. Christie accomplishes that task cleverly as ten men and women are lured to a lonely island off the coast of Devon, England. Once there, each of the ten is immediately accused of past crimes for which they were never committed. For those evils, each must now die. As the ten learn they cannot escape the island, they race to uncover the murderer's true identity, knowing it must be one of their own number.Darkness permeates every page of this tale, as you likely guessed from the plot synopsis. Each character struggles with their sordid past, while outwardly justifying themselves and denying guilt. The ten attempt to socialize and dine with one another, despite the fact that they know one of their number intends to murder them all.I appreciated the book's epilogue, in which Christie explains (from a voice within the story) the entire scheme and how it was pulled off. These 300+ pages flew by as I hurried to uncover the killer's identity, but I didn't guess the solution before Christie wrote it out for me. This is a great, fast-paced mystery, although its dark subject matter and dialogue wouldn't make the best bedtime reading."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"Not many authors can say they CREATED an entire genre, but Christie can. Here, she creates, for the first time, the idea of a group of people trapped together in an imposing, dangerous house where they all start to die, one by one, buidling suspense for the reader to see in anyone will make it out alive. The plot structure/scenario was so ingenious and done so well by Christie that it's been copied many, many times over in films, TV and even games (Clue, anyone?). Still, Christie's original started it all and is the best.Written in short chapters that are further broken up into subsections, it's a fast read that keeps the action moving. Christie is a master at giving you just the right amount of information you need and not getting all caught up in the characters' subtext. She lets you make up your own mind about who's good/bad and keeps the story moving. She does this quite well as she introduces the characters, giving the reader just bits of their \\"sins of the past\\" and brings each of their crimes further into view through memories, flashbacks and dreams as the story moves forward. Everyone has something to hide, crimes that slipped through the loop holes of the law...but now someone has brought them all here to face their reckoning in a house on a deserted island.The genius of this book lies in how Christie manages to create ten characters with full backstories, weave them together and keeps them all straight at the same time...all in LESS than 200 pages! She's an expert at writing with economy that could teach a thing or two to most contemporary writers who blather on in long tangents with non-story related material that their editors are afraid to cut out of their 300+ page doorstops. In a Christie novel, not a single word is wasted.The plot of the book is so expertly put together that everything works off of the previous and leads to the next plot element like the workings of a clock. The suspense is built in. You can feel it each time you're SURE of who the murderer is...and then that person is killed. What then? The reader is constantly having to retrace their steps, start over and look at things from a different perspective...considering things they might not have before. As the clock ticks down along with the number of suspects...the suspense get amped up each time.This is one of Christie's best. Clearly imitation is the best for of flattery and there's clearly been plenty of that concerning And Then There Were None over the last nearly 100 years. That's why Christie will always be the gold standard in murder mystery/suspense. I'd also recommend Toward Zero, Crooked House and Sleeping Murder, three of her very best along with this one."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"I really enjoyed Agatha Christie's And Then There Were None. It was a quick and interesting read. She kept me guessing, even when \\"there were only two.\\" I would highly recommend her as an author."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"The setup is delicious: ten strangers are lured to an island on the promise of various things, employment, fun, etc. only to find that the hosts are not there and that the large, empty house only contains the guests and a couple of servants. After dinner on the first night, a recorded voice on a record player proclaims each one of them a murderer who has escaped their crimes - but no more! And then people start dying, one by one...I've never read an Agatha Christie novel before, thinking that they would be corny or somehow like another popular writer whose work I disliked, Ellis Peters, but I was very, very wrong. This book was published in 1939 and is labelled \\"thriller\\" and yet 80+ years later I can attest to it remaining a thrilling read.The elements of the story: that the guests have no way of leaving the island; that they slowly realise that one of them is the deranged killer with a warped sense of justice; the nursery rhyme which tells them how they're going to die but not the order - it's all so masterfully plotted by Christie, I was barrelling through the book, devouring the chapters eager to see who would survive, who was the killer, and why.What's also surprising is the overarching sense of dread you have when reading. I read it at night, alone, with the rain pounding the windows and I found myself more terrified reading this than I'd been in years. This isn't just an amazing thriller, it's a truly scary horror novel too. As the number of guests dwindle, the claustrophobic atmosphere is palpable and the paranoia ramped up to such an extent that you can't help but keep reading at a ever-increasing pace until the final page.The only real critique I have is the way the final guest snuffs it, before the big reveal. It seemed a bit contrived. But I suppose it was possible for it to happen that way... a long shot, but possible.This is one of the finest mystery thrillers I've ever read which still manages to have an enormous pull on the reader decades after being published, an astonishing feat in itself. I wish I hadn't waited so long to read a Christie novel, this one was so good. I'll definitely read more and highly recommend this to all fans of great fiction."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"The setup is delicious: ten strangers are lured to an island upon which lies a large empty house on the promise of various things, employment, fun, etc. only to find that the hosts are not there and that the house only contains the guests.

It is also creepy. It does not have a detective, which seemed strange at first, because I am used to following Poirot and Miss Marple as they solve the crimes. I did not really like any of the characters but I was still surprised when each one was killed. When one of the murders took place, pretty much any one of the survivors could have been the killer. Also, you get to read what each of the characters are thinking; the story is not just from one character's viewpoint. Is the killer one of the ten guests on the island, or is there a hidden person? The ending really got me. Of course, you finally end up with only two characters and one of them turns out to be the killer, but he doesn't stop there! You'll have to read the story yourself to find out what happens at the very end.

It started out with a curious assortment of ten, all unwilling to tell their history. Their host, Mr. Owen, has arranged for them to come to Indian Island. When they arrive, the sun is up, the birds are singing, and everything seems to be in order, but danger is in the air, and knowing Christie, in the air it will stay until all fates are met. In each of the guest's rooms, is a poem hanging on the wall.

It also may be a little scary for younger children."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"This is a MUST read for any Agatha Christie fan. She weaves a tale of mystery, murder, and betrayal that is full of suspense at every turn and twist of the plot. Just when you think that you have finally solved the mystery you are shocked with the unsuspecting truth. I recommend this book to anyone who loves a good mystery. If you have never read an Agatha Christie mystery this is a good one to start with. This was the very first Agatha Christie book I read, at the age of 12. I have read it atleast 10 times and still continue to be amazed at the end of the book."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"\\"And Then There Were None\\" is an amazing story. I was glued to the book once I got into the full swing of it. The flow of the book keeps you riveted to the very last page. Agatha Christie wrote it in a manner that gets you to try to figure it out along with the people left. As the amount of survivors dwindles, the suspicion arises and overcomes rational thought. Panic takes over and everyone is watching out for themselves no matter the cost to anyone else. This shows the break down of a rational, sane individual into a crazed murderer bent on attaining his own level of justice. It also portrays the actions and thoughts that remain once panic and fear become the forefront of your mind. All in all, its an amazing book that will keep you on the edge of your seat til the very end."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"This is the first Agatha Christie mystery that I have read and I chose to start with what is perhaps her best known novel. Seeing the book corrupted in newer editions to remove all references to Indians seems like covering the privates parts of Michelangelo's David. Changing the title was offensive, but changing the content is just plain wrong.Compared to many modern tales of mystery, this story is somewhat simple. There does not seem to be any twists in the plot just for the sake of including a twist. The suspense builds as to the identity of the murderer as fewer of the ten are among the living. At some point, the reader may begin to suspect that the murderer is not among the final three. The nursery rhyme on which the story is based openly tells of a red herring.More than a mystery, this book makes suggestions about social justice. Not every crime falls in the explicit classifications of the law. However, this does not make the injustice any less of a crime. While becoming a vigilante seems to be a hypocritical response to any injustices, the idea certainly raises ethical and moral questions worthy of discussion."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"One of Agatha Chrisitie's best books has to be the mystery AND THEN THERE WERE NONE. The book is based on the mysterious Soldier Island where a person takes the justice system into their own hands. Ten people were invited to the island,all for different reasons. The people are all murders that did not serve for there crime. All of the island guests wereeliminated carfully in a certian way so that the deaths followed the poem of \\"10 Little Soldier Boys\\". With each murder the book gets more and more suspenseful as you try to figure out,\\"Who is Owen\\"? You will be mystified until the very last page! The book starts out a little slow, but gains speed when you learn the information throughout the book. I would recommend this, but take into to account the words are difficult to read and the plot is hard to follow until you get enough information."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"This is the best mystery book ever! If you love mysteries and suspense you will love this book. It's about ten people who go to an island, and they all get killed by the end of the week. Who kills them? Read the greatest book ever to figure it out. I thought the protagonist was very smart and precautious about the people he was with. The antagonist was very insidious and was trying not to let anyone suspect him but he killed everyone."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"And Then There Were NoneNovember 21, 2006- Reviewer: Allison BossTen strangers are stranded on a deserted Island. All of them were there because of one person, U. N. Owen. Unfortunately they find out there is no U. N. Owen, he is just a mad man out to murder them all. Is it Lombard? Vera? Miss Brent? Or could it be Mr. Rogers? No one has any clue on which the murderer is. One by one they drop like flees. Every time someone is murdered a glass monkey that was displayed on the table disappears. All of the murders follow a strange riddle. Everyone is watching their backs but that still doesn't stop the mad man. This mystery keeps you on the edge of your seat and makes you keep guessing what happens next or who the murderer is. This book is for any one from the age of twelve to any adult. If you are fascinated in mysteries and stories that give you a gut wrenching feeling, then this is the book for you. It is definitely deserves a Five-Star rating."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"Our community theatre group will be performing the play based on this book soon, so I decided to download it to my Kindle and read it ahead of time. Hurricane Irene happened to come through and knocked my power out, so I ended up reading the last 40% of the book or so by candlelight, which was awesome!Great book, great ending -- thoroughly enjoyed it. Should make for an EXCELLENT theatrical production!!"},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"I stayed up, on a weeknight, until 1 to finish this!Ten people are invited to Soldier Island to stay at the home of Mr. Owen. But little do they know, a little justice is about to be served. Who will die next and can they find the killer before the next one dies?Oh. My. God. This book was frakkin' amazing. I have never been so afraid to go to sleep in my life. I have never had as crazy dreams as I've had when reading this book. I have never stayed up so late on a weeknight finishing a book because I knew it would haunt my dreams and dammit, I had to know who was the murderer!If you peruse through many of my book reviews (specifically the ones of thrillers), you will see the complaint: \\"This was a thriller?!\\" In my opinion, a thriller should be pulse-pounding, look over your shoulder, frantically turn the next page, stay up late into the night finishing the damned book. Basically, everything that this book IS.The characters were varied. Sure, they were all sorts of 1930's stereotypes (but the offensive n-word and \\"Indians\\" were dropped from the title/poem), but they were real, from the religious zealot, Miss Brent, to the slimy captain Lombard, to the officious Justice. I was surprised at how attached I grew to each character (much more than in some more serious character novels I've read), and there were people I desperately hoped to avoid dying.And then we have the mystery, the reason you even read this novel. Oh. My. God. (Damn, this novel has elicited TWO slow-mo OMG's from me!) It is slick, it is crafty, it is interesting, and I TOTALLY didn't see it coming. Every word is a puzzle, a puzzle that you twist and turn and when you finally read the end, you go, \\"Ah ha, so that's how it was done!\\" Christie says in the author's note how much work it was and how proud of it she was, and I must say, she should be. I've not read a novel that surprised me like this one ever.I loved the mood of the novel. I was constantly looking around in my bedroom (at night, big mistake, as I had wickedly weird nightmares one night) as if a murderer would pop out of nowhere. And I totally feel that this should be more prevalent in thrillers.This novel blew my mind, even more than my previous favorite Christie novel, \\"Murder on the Orient Express\\".

Christie's spellbinding story-telling is at its finest as she takes the reader to desolate Soldier Island and through the final hours of ten accused murderers whose crimes are of such a nature that the police cannot bring them to justice. The reader is left as helpless and shocked as the characters themselves as they try desperately to solve the mystery of the unknown avenger before they all die. Christie shifts the viewpoint between the condemned characters, revealing the truth of the accusations and keeping the reader guessing the whole time.

We hear about the various deaths, but as the book progresses, it becomes more and more difficult to find out who the murderer is. The first chapters are more or less just something you need to read in order to get to the more interesting chapters, but then I was really concentrating, because Agatha Christie manages to hold the reader's attention and also let the reader try to figure out for himself who the murderer is.The book is concentrated on a single spot -- the island -- which makes the book easier to follow; you don't have to concentrate on the various settings, and therefore it's the question of who the murderer is that gets the reader's attention, and the question that keeps bothering you as the story progresses.I can highly recommend this suspense novel, which I have read before, but which deserves a second reading because of its brilliance."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"quite a story-10 people brought together to receive the \\"wages of sin\\" Agatha keeps the reader guessing.The folks are lured with a promise of aweekend of luxurious weekend.

What if you were isolated with several other people and they started getting murdered? Then what would you do? This is what happens in And Then There Were None, basically a blueprint for many mysteries to come.Agatha Christie is an icon. The name alone conjures up intrigue. Her many works gave birth to television shows, movies and contributed to the murder mystery genre. Christie also wrote a play of the same title which was adapted into a movie that I saw when I was little. This movie never left me. So, I was pretty thrilled when I saw the audio book in the library.The problem for me in this book is the telling. At the start it seems necessary to describe each character and how they are lured to Indian Island, but it is not engaging. Also, the over explanation into certain people's thoughts did not grab me and the epilogue and finally the confession, while beneficial to the story was not appealing.The narration by Hugh Fraser was pretty good. He has a very pronounced British accent and it was kind of amusing to me that such proper sounding speech is used to describe horrific crimes. In other words, a very civilized voice talking about very uncivilized acts. For the most part, the voices are distinguishable and while I didn't feel it the most inspired narration of a book, it did lend itself to the setting, the time period and the characters.Ten people are invited to an island under questionable circumstances and soon they are all accussed of being responsible for the death of someone (or more than one person). Then one by one people begin to die. Because I had seen the movie, I was pretty sure I knew who the killer was unless of course the movie was different than the book which often happens. It is different in a few respects, but the killer ended up being...well, I won't give it away.I love the way each death occured to reflect the nursery rhyme about 10 little Indians and the plot device of having one of the 10 figurines disappear each time someone got killed. All the while there is confusion, suspicion and helplessness at being trapped on an island at the mercy of a deranged murderer.Each character is so different that it wasn't difficult to keep track of all the players. The only ones that I kept interspersing were the Judge and the Admiral. Perhaps because they were both older and the voices seemed similar to me. I really enjoyed Vera's story...that backstory would have made an amazing novel. To me, she is the most interesting character. The way that Christie gave her history pieces at a time had me intriged with her.This audiobook is only 5 cds, so it was a quick \\"listen.\\" Although I may not count this in a list of \\"must reads\\" I would put it in a list of \\"should reads\\" if for nothing else than because it was written by Agatha Christie, one of the most famous mystery writers of our time."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"Ten people mostly unknown to each other are invited to a barren island cut of from the mainland by heavy seas.

Now who is that someone?Agatha Christie never underestimates her readers. She twists and turns the plot, countless times, and leads the peruser to dead ends and dark backroads. Towards the conclusion, one still finds it difficult to guess who the criminal is. It is only at the very end (literally, in the last few pages), that the whole sinister plot is unraveled.

The Dame rewrote some parts of it for theater including adding a different ending.Great characterization, a water-tight plot without holes and incredible atmospheric tension makes this one a readers delight; and a perfect entertainment for a rainy day at home.And remember; whatever you do, DO NOT look at the last page."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"Ten people on an island: each getting picked off one by one.If all are dead, who could possibly be the killer?This is the setup to A. Christie's most popular novel.Christie has always been criticized for breaking the codes of mystery writing; and here, she does.The 2 biggest rules in mystery fiction is that the reader should always be able to solve the crime along with the detective; and that there can be no slight of hand to fool the reader. Here, there is no detective and no foolproof way to pick the killer before he/she is revealed. Sure, one can GUESS who the killer is, but there is no way to know for certain. Why? Because there is definitely slight of hand.Personally, I prefer to have the wool pulled over my eyes. Then I can truly be shocked by the denouement."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"Agatha Christie, one of the great authors of this genre, presents us with a masterful plot and wonderfully descriptive writing which brilliantly portrays each of her characters, their expectations and curiosities, as they head to Indian Island where the story unfolds and ensnares us.

It was the first book that introduced the genre of \\"The Body Count Movie.\\" Also, as a play, it is well-acted and well recieved. Agatha Crhistie was a true pioneer when it came to writing. She ranks right up there with Alfred Hitchcock and H.G. Wells. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"It's funny. After all these years of reading mysteries (among other things) I never read this one. I saw a few of the movie adaptations and thought I knew how it ended. Silly me, to think that Dame Agatha didn't have a few tricks up her sleeves that didn't correspond to what movie makers thought an audience could handle. Her work here is fearless and if you think you know how it turns out because you saw Barry Fitzgerald...watch out.

Ten unsuspecting characters receive invitations to go to a mysterious island, only to discover that someone among them is a killer. The million dollar question is: &quot;Who is the murderer?&quot; I didn't figure this out until I completed the novel. Christie definitely has a great talent for writing mysteries that have kept readers' interested for many years. Test out your detective skills as you attempt to solve the mystery, which is a difficult task. All of the characters are unique in their own way, and they try to maintain their sanity even though they are fully aware that a killer is on the loose, and there is no escape route off the island."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"I'm a junior in highschool.

While these seven men and three women seem like your every-day Englishmen, they're each guilty of a dark crime, untouchable by the law. When the ten visitors of Indian Island begin dying, one-by-one, it's decided that the murderer must be one of the ten visitors themselves!It's hard to put down a book like this. One moment, you'll be thinking &quot;oh, it's him, of course,&quot; and the next page, that person is found dead. A fine Agatha Christie to start with, &quot;And Then There Were None&quot; is among her most famous books.&quot;One little indian boy, left all alone, he hanged himself...And Then There Were None.&quot;"},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"I thought that and then there were none was an overall good book. There were some ideas that were a little far-fetched, such as the identity of the killer and the entire ending of the book. However, i thought that the 10 Little Indians poem added a very mysterious twist to the book; along with the 10 Indian figurines that one by one mysteriously dissapeared as each person was killed off. Even though i was forced to read this book for summer reading, and it wasnt strictly for my enjoyment, i would recommend it to someone who is interested on reading a good mystery book."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"WHAT IT IS ABOUT: It begins with ten people receiving strange letters inviting them to a weekend of fun on a strange island. Once they all get there they become uneasy about the missing host who is unknown. Before they are even aware what is about to happen they are slowly killed off one by one in odd ways. The remaining ones play detective to try to find the killer until they discover how precise the killer is. Little do they know what they have gotten into. Read this book to find out what happens. HOW I FELT: This was my first Agatha Christie book I have read. I had heard many good things about it. When I gave it a try I was very surprised. It was better than I expected. It was one of the best mystery books I have ever read and I read a lot of mystery books. I would definitely recommened this book to people who love to be challenged in solving murder cases or who just love mystery stories. You can try to solve this mystery along with all the other characters in the book. I particularly liked how the author characterizes each person. She shows what each person thinks as well as what he or she thought about the other characters. I feel this book illustrates how some people take the law into their own hands. It also shows how weak the trust between humans can be."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"I found this book to be and Excellent read and the plot was first-rate gripping stuff but it was strange how this was very different to Agatha Christie's other works, because while other books come together like jigsaw puzzles in this anyone could be the killer and there is no logical way to 'guess' the culprit."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"This was a fantastic novel written by Agatha Christie, definitely her best piece of work. She creates outstanding characters and makes it so the ending comes out completely unexpected.

I recommend this book to any Agatha Christie fan and to any person who enjoys a good mystery."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"I was assigned to read this book as for an eigth grade report. To me, the book was a little dull at the start; but twords the middle it became a book that you don't want to put down.

I loved how she blended the great mystery with the excitement of the and terror of the characters. The plot was easy to understand and was very well written. All of the characters were unique. They all had some thing different about them. Whether it was the way they acted or how proper they were. Another thing that I loved about this book is how Christie sort of hinted who was going to get killed and somehow a different person was killed. In some way they always followed the &quot;Ten Little Indians&quot; poem. The best part was trying figure out was killing the &quot;visitors.&quot;"},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"I am an 8th grader and was assigned this book over the summer.

Ten people are invited to a lugsurious island with no one else there. Where they all are accused of commiting murder. Someone on th island is killing them off one by one, and that is what is so weird you dont know it is. It keeps you guessing untill the killer is finaly revealed.

They settle down for the night to wait, and one of them is killed. This is a very suspenseful book, with an ending that's as surprising as Agatha Christie's other endings.

Ten people are invited to Indian Island by an anonymous host. They all come to the island for various reasons: employment, friendship, entertainment. When they arrive, they realize they've all been summoned there to account for crimes of murder they've committed but were never sentenced for. As they begin to die, one by one, they realize the deaths follow the pattern of the nursery rhyme, \\"Ten Little Indians.\\" Fear turns to suspicion as the guests turn on each other, sure that the killer must be one of them. Who will remain when the last little Indian is alone?I've taught this book to my junior high PreAP students with excellent results. Some of the topics we have used this novel to explore include: synonyms, metaphors, idioms, theme, motif, symbolism, SAT vocabulary, and the mystery genre. I found an online book trailer to engage my students in the beginning. Once the murders begin, the action is fast-paced, and students engage in a guessing game trying to see who can figure out the killer's identity. Fortunately, the ending cannot be predicted, and it comes as a great surprise. I loved it, my students loved it, and I'm sure any lover of suspense will love it, too."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"Having never read a book by Agatha Christie before, I had no idea what to expect. It was such a small book, when compared with the several-hundred-page books I typically read. I didn't know what I was getting into!The story starts off quite slowly, as the author introduces us to a group of ten, previously unacquainted people, who have all been invited or hired to spend the weekend on Indian Island off the coast of Devon. Not one of the ten strangers knows who has invited them, and none of them has ever been to the island before, but for various reasons, they all accept the invitation. When they arrive, everything seems in order except for one thing-- their host is not there. Thus begins the mystery, and it only deepens when they each discover the Ten Little Indians nursery rhyme posted on a wall in their bedrooms.One by one, people begin to turn up dead, and with each death, the panic increases among the remaining guests. Which one is the killer? As mystery readers, we try to figure it out before all is revealed at the end.

Next month will be \\"Mystery\\", and I found myself wondering what book to read. When \\"And Then There Were None\\" was suggested to me by a teacher, I was reluctant at the start, but soon grew to love the book.\\"And Then There Were None\\" is about ten guests who have recently arrived on an island home off the coast of Devon, each of them with a past they'd like to keep to themselves. When one by one the guests start to die off, (Coincidentally following the \\"Ten Little Indians\\" nursery rhyme), they all struggle to figure out who's the killer...and only the dead are above suspicion.While reading the book I thought, why should I care so much about people who have commited such crimes? But I did care. A lot. Even when characters that didn't appeal to me died, I found myself feeling bad. Ms. Christie wrote the book so well in each person's perspective, with each of them having their own unique personality, that you couldn't help but feel slightly attatched to all of them. Though I haven't read many mystery books, I believe this one will always be one of my favorites. I constantly guessed who the killer was, and ended up being proved wrong numerous times due to the fact that the suspected killers were killed themselves! The plot was always moving, and I literally could not put the book down, (Honestly, I continued to read while eating dinner until I was told to stop!) The book does give you the chills, and when I went to bed that night I couldn't help but feel a bit scared..The ending is very suprising, and makes you think thoroughly about what happened. I had to re-read the ending many times, and I wasn't satisfied until the next morning!Overall, I loved the book. Five Stars, period. This book is highly suggested!"},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"Timeless, majestic, terrifying, breathtaking. The masterpiece by the British lady. You read it.

Marvellous."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"I read this book because my friend recommended it to me and I'll be honest, I was bored at first. The book started by introducing ten different characters and a bit of their background. The fact that it was all rapid-fire led to me constantly flipping back to the beginning thinking, \\"who's this guy again?\\". But once all the characters were established in my mind and the first murder occurs, things started picking up speed. While you might guess what happens next, you won't guess HOW it happens. You'll have to read till the end before the last piece of the puzzle falls into place and you find out who's the murderer. This book is short and sweet (well, maybe not sweet but you get the point) but don't let the length fool you.Agatha Christie is an amazing writer and will lead you by the nose with her stunning style. It's just too bad that it takes half the book before she does it.Good: fantastic portrayal of the murderer, detailed writing, large cast of charactersBad: Beginning is boring, some murders are a bit unbelievable, spends a lot of time explaining things that end up not all that important"},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"(not a spoiler) I loved this book! I especially love the end. The author gets you guessing who the killer is through out the whole book. EVEN after it ends. Ha, but then she explains the clever scheme of the killer and who the killer is. The ending to this book was NOT predictable like some mysteries. I'm a great reader, but I never expected the right killer. Neither as anyone else whose read it that I know. I really recommend this book to anyone who likes a great, creative end to a mystery. The only thing, I kind of was annoyed with, was that there weren't too many parts with much action. They would just wake up sometimes, and then they would find someone dead. It was really creative though."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"And Then There Were None is a fiction novel that will take a reader to the highest point of intrigue of any mystery book. This book has become one of the best mystery books every written and I cannot disagree.Agatha Christie changed the world of literature by writing this book. She uses an ingenious style of writing which can be easily recognized by any reader. Being a high school student, I did not understand or respect the brilliance and detailed writing of the author. My whole view of literature has changed because of this book and I now understand how clever an author, Agatha Christie, has to be in order to write a book that is at the top of its genre.Christie manipulates the reader's thoughts and opinions by continuously changing the pace of the story. No book will mess with your head more than And Then There Were None. Each character is described with such great detail and each scene is so perfectly planned out. Reading this book gives people the full mystery effect and readers will not be disappointed. Though the book is written beautifully it can be a bit far fetched at times. Ten different guests each agree to attend a random vacation on an unknown island; very unlikely but then again a reader must never put it out of question!This mystery novel overlooked the topic of a serial killer long before the serial killer was even known. Agatha Christie is ahead of her time and you can see the effects of her book on many authors nowadays. And Then There Were None was the platform from which many other great books have taken off."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"Agatha Christie's classic novel, And then there were none had me up late, reading in bed. I developed the habit as a young girl to always keep a book by my bedside. I got grounded a couple of times for reading past my bedtime but it was always worth it. Christie's novel was well worth the late night hours, early mornings and even the tension right before I drifted off to sleep. For those who don't know the premise of this classic, 10 strangers are invited to Indian Island, made famous by previous owners and constant rumors. Once there, the guests become aware of the horrifying fact that they will never get off the island again - one among them is killing them off, one at a time. Once the ball gets rolling the book doesn't slow down and in brief lulls of action the tension is tight with anticipation. Readers who haven't read Christie will be awe-struck at the brilliant way she pulls off the murder mystery. The murder mystery was published in 1939 and authors today are still attempting to master the art as well as Christie did."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"I had never read this classic, so my girlfriend bought me a copy to read for our vacation on a small island. I basically read through it in one sitting and now I understand why Agatha Christie was one of the all-time greats. The story is a real nail-biter, and the ending is stunning; and everything in between is just about perfect. The only thing I'd say, in comparing this to other books I've been reading, is that Christie introduces A LOT of characters in the first few chapters, almost too many to keep track of. I've noticed that more modern books don't do that. I wonder if people had longer attention spans back in Christie's day."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"In And then there were none, ten unaquainted people are lured out to an island under false pretenses.

The question is, who this elusive U N Owens and why have these ten random people been chosen as victims? The ending wasn't as shocking as in Murder on the Orient Express, but I still managed to remain somewhat in the dark until the end. Although, I had my suspicions, which turned out to be accurate!A word of caution, if you haven't read this novel, don't read too many reviews. Some of them, in my opinion, reveal too much information. It's best to read an Agatha Christie novel with as little clues as possible. If you haven't read it yet, read Murder on the Orient Express, but don't scroll all the way down the page to read any reviews on Amazon. Someone thought it would be cute to reveal the identity of the murderer as the subject of their review."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"Agatha Christie's classic tale of murder, intriuge, and the clever mind of a sociopathic killer. Character development is crystal clear. Though I found the identidy of the murderer obvious towards about the last 40 pages of the book, I was drawn in.The idea of being stuck on an island with a murderer whose idea you have no idea of is terrifying, and gives us all chills. I never found a dull moment in any part of the book, and i don't think anyone who reads it will. Christie has once again spun a spider web of terror to make us shiver at night. An excellent read that will leave you thirsty for more."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"This novel is a classic suspense story told by a classic story teller.

The strangers begin to share their darkest secrets. One by one they all die. Each death has to do with each line in a nursery rhyme framed in all of their rooms called \\"Ten Little Indians\\". When there are only a few people left on the island people must try and befriend others hoping that they will survive.Agatha Christie's writing style is very original, considering when it was published. She creates her characters very well and yet not over describes them. All though you feel you know the characters well they often leave some confusion in your mind. The plot is very compelling. It takes many unexpected turns. After you read the book you see that she leaves many clues but hides them well so you don't notice them at first. This is the kind of book that you hesitate to turn the next page from fright yet it is to compelling to put down.Before I had read this book the best mystery I had read was The Westing Game, but this book leaves it in the dust. As long as you don't get scared easily this book is a must read."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"AND THEN THERE WERE NONE (also titled TEN LITTLE INDIANS and originally another title that will not be listed here) is another story that was based on a nursery rhyme (others include A POCKET FULL OF RYE and HICKORY DICKORY DEATH).This 1939 novel opens with a varied group of eight travelers all bound for a weekend party on a fashionable island retreat. Other than their destination they seem to have nothing in common, they don't even seem to have been invited by the same person! When they arrive on the island they are met by two servants but no host. The mystery deepens when a recorded message accuses all, guests and staff, with murder - murders that they had all gotten away with until now. Needless to say this cast a shadow over the party, a shadow that deepened with the first murder and increased with every subsequent one.This is an unusual story in that there is no detective/hero that is investigating the crime throughout the story. Also the varied methods of each murder are predicted by the rhyme about the Indian boys. It is interesting to see how the mishaps of the rhyme are translated into actual methods of execution. Further the murder's identity is definitely kept a secret until the last page.This is one of Christie's most famous works, along with THE MURDER OF ROGER ACKROYD, MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS, and DEATH ON THE NILE. Like these other well known books, this one also has a very unusual ending. Much was made during Christie's career by her contemporaries about the 'rules of mystery writing' - these rules included: no unknown, untracable poisons, or 'death rays'; no keeping the murder out of the story until the last few paragraphs; the butler did NOT do it; all clues must be available to the reader etc. This novel, like the other well known mysteries previously listed, cut close to one or more of these rules but defintely did lay all the clues out fairly for the reader to find. It will be the very rare reader, however, who does manage to solve this puzzle before all is revealed in the final chapter."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"This was the first Agatha Christie book that I ever read and after that I was hooked. There is a reason why they call her Queen of Crime. She is absolutly genius! I loved the plot. I loved Indian Island. The characters were fabulous. This is a book that I've read to my 8th grade class for the past couple of years and every year they all learn about the wonderful world of Agatha Christie. If you are looking for a really good book with a swift and astounding ending then I highly, highly recommend this book, you won't be disapoinnted."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"This book kept me reading till the end, day and night. The suspence just dragged me in and left me thinking, wow I have no idea who is the murderer. I have read many books, but this has got to be the best. If you love Agatha Chirstie's books and havent read this on, you better brace youself. I just couldnt believe the ending, no, i wont say anything here except read this book!"},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"Wow is all I can say about this book. This was the first Christie that I had ever read, and I absolutly LOVED it!! Keep in mind, though, Christie is a master at writing, and you really have to pay attention to what's going on or you could easily get lost...or miss a clue! As soon as I got done reading it , I told my mom that she just had to read it also. She gave it a try, but she gave up after the first few pages because she thought it was confusing. She missed out on one of the best mysteries ever because she gave up. PLEASE DON'T GIVE UP! It will all start to make sense! I read this book in 2 days because I couldn't put it down. I am now going back and reading it again because I didn't get the full effect reading it so fast. This is beyond doubt, Christie's VERY BEST!!!!!!! PLEASE READ IT!!!!!"},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"If you have never read any Agatha Christie or if you have not really ever been interested in mysteries, this book is a must. It will really get you interested in an entirely new genre of literature that you didn't think would spark your interest. I first read this book in 8th grade reading class (so that should tell you that it's not overly difficult to follow or comprehend), and I was hooked. The plot revolves around a group of people who go on an island vacation together...but if I told you anymore, I might have to kill you (joking of course, but it would happen in this book!). This story is extremely captivating. You'll never guess what's going to happen next, and that's one of the best aspects of the book. The title of the book suggests what's to come, but the plot of the novel is cleverly entertwined with an old Indian rhyme...you have got to read this book. You won't be able to put it down, even when your 8th grade reading teacher threatens you NOT to read ahead! Great summer reading, a way to kick yourself in the butt and do the reading you promised yourself you'd do."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"I really enjoy the tension and suspense the book creates especially in the last few chapters (from Ch 13 onward when the few people left were so frightened and alert). That I think is the strongest point of the book.The confession of the murderer(s) in the epilogue is ok, though I did expect something more surprising and ... convincing. There are a few points in the murderer(s)'s plan and in the story development itself that are not very believable. [The butler still prepared breakfast after the second murder, as if there's nothing particularly unusual happen???] That is, the book is a bit too contrived.But over all, if you have 5, 6 hours to spare and like detective stories, why not?"},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"I love Agatha Christie books. This one really had me guessing. It's a great mystery. I highly recommend this to any lovers of good mysteries."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"Agatha Christie's AND THEN THERE WERE NONE should be very close to the top of any mystery fan's &quot;must read list.&quot; The novel concerns a group of ten previously unacquainted people who are lured via various pretexts to Indian Island, a resort home off the coast of Devon--and are promptly accused by their unseen host of having escaped punishment for past crimes. Cut off from the world and fighting rising panic, they scramble to unmask the killer even as their number is reduced in macabre accordance with the &quot;Ten Little Indians&quot; nursey rhyme displayed in rooms throughout the house.Agatha Christie was already famous when AND THEN THERE WERE NONE (also known under the title TEN LITTLE INDIANS) was published--but this book put her career well over the top: nothing like it had seen before, it proved a sensation, and writers and film-makers continue to use Christie's basic idea to this very day. Some critics argue the novel is mechanical rather than organic, but I say if this is mechanical, let's have more of it! It is truly a can't-put-it-down, non-stop read, a spectacular turn by the genre's single most celebrated author.The success of the novel inspired Christie to adapt it for the stage, where it was a tremendous success, and there have been several film versions (most notably the 1940s Rene Clair-directed AND THEN THERE WERE NONE) over the years. If you know the story only from stage and film versions, however, you are in for a surprise. Christie felt the novel's conclusion did not translate well to the stage, so she re-wrote it--and most film versions follow the stage script, not the novel. But whether you've seen the play and films or not, get ready for a shock!"},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"Dame Agatha makes a jarring departure in this grim and intricate tale. There is no sleuth, the pace is fast, frenzied and breathless, and rather than \\"types,\\" she takes pains with characterizations. The body count is high, and the mode of death frequently untidy. \\"And Then There Were None\\" is among the most favored of Christie's books. It has gone through a few title changes; I knew it as \\"Ten Little Indians,\\" and before that it had even a more politically incorrect title. Be forewarned, Ms. Christie is neither enlightened nor tolerant. Some of the passages and references are bigoted and might offend some readers.A group of ten strangers is invited or hired for a long weekend on Indian Island, a mile off the Devon coast. It is somewhat improbable that these ten would all accept such a vague invitation from a host they do not know to a place they have never seen before, but each for his or her own reasons accepts. They include a doctor, a games mistress, a soldier of fortune, a rich playboy, a retired policeman, a judge, a spinster, a retired general and a married couple who are to be the servants. They arrive on a bleak rocky island to a completely modern house with all the amenities. The fires are welcoming, there is an ample supply of food, the servants are impeccable, but their host is absent. In each of the bedrooms, the Ten Little Indians nursery rhyme is posted on a prominent wall. It begins:\\"Ten Little Indian boys went out to dine;One choked his little self, and then there were nine.---Drinks are served, and one guest chokes, turns blue and falls over dead. The tension builds, the fright of the stranded people is palpable as one by one, they are picked off, each in accordance with the nursery rhyme. As the number of victims increase, the survivors' suspicions of each other reach a frantic pitch. In an epilogue, the police arrive and find them all dead. Who is the murderer who has to be among the victims?\\"And Then There Were None\\" is told in short choppy chapters that build suspense and tension. I would call this Christie's one and only thriller. None of the characters are even likable and once again (see \\"ABC Murders\\"), Christie toys with the idea of the serial killer long before such an animal was even heard of. She is a good profiler too! This is an excellent story, and the author is miles ahead of you at all times, If you can figure out \\"who\\" and \\"how\\" before she lays it out for you, you deserve the Sleuth of the Year Award!"},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"Set on an isolated island without contact of the outside civilization, Agatha Christie's novel And Then There Were None is the story of tem strangers invited to an island by a mysterious host.The book starts out with an introduction to the Ten characters. Although this is effective in telling the characters, it is also boring and does not catch your attention right away. But as soon as the guests arrive on Indian Island, this boredom disperses and an exciting thriller breaks through. What is also exciting about this novel is you have no idea who is committing these strange murders.The first night these people are at the house they are greeted with an eerie voice that accuses them of murders that were committed but were never convicted of in the past. When the guests arrive there is no trace of U.N. Owen, but as the guests start to die this mysterious figure reveals his ugly face.This book shows fear in peoples conciences, the guilt that lies within, and the hate among strangers. Anyone who wants to read a suspenseful murder mystery, and wamts to stay on the end of their seats, should read this wicked novel of horror and fear..."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"As I sat down to read this book the afternoon I received it in the mail, many questions passed through my mind. I had never read any of Agatha Christie's mystery novels, and I wondered, would I like this one? Looking down at the first page somehow I knew that I would.The first chapter sets the stage for the wonderful story to come, and every puzzle piece is set there for the finale.The book is brilliantly written, and masterly crafted by Agatha Christie. Now, do not sit down exspecting to solve this one, because that feat seems entirely impossible. I don't believe she gives enough clues for that to be done, however I guess there might be someone who figured it out.This novel was so good I could literally not put it down. I finished it in about 4 hours, and was very pleased at the end of the day.I highly recommend this book, even if you are not a fan of the mystery genre, because the book itself is a literary classic.I am pleased I decided to read this book because now I know I like Agatha Christie and will read more of her books, and I hope you do too."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"Surely everyone in the world has read this book by now! Surely it tops the best-selling list of a best-selling author! Older readers may not recognize it by its current title, its original and a later replacement having been deemed too racist. Nothing racist, I hope, was picked up in my school English classes, where I used it to help develop pupils' appetite for reading.Agatha Christie's achievement is remarkable. She creates ten characters, all suspected of murder, who are lured to an island. She has them meet their deaths one by one as nominated in the nursery rhyme \\"Ten Little Indians\\" which is displayed in their rooms. She has each murder occur in a situation where almost all the other island guests might have had opportunity to commit it. As if devising all this were not enough, she also frequently takes us into the minds of the various characters - something that the whole nature of detective fiction usually prohibits. This construction is not only intricate but also compact; it is one of her shorter novels. Built on this scheme, the book must exclude Mrs Christie's regular sleuths, Poirot and Miss Marple. Instead, the dwindling number of island guests generate their own investigation.So here is a book that offers double the pleasure that murder mysteries provide. As well as challenging you to solve the mystery, it also amazes you that so ingenious a mystery could be contrived."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"AND THEN THERE WERE NONE is Agatha Christie at her plot twisting best. In terms of public awareness of her work, it is right up there with MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS. Over the years I've read this story a number of times & I'm still satisfied at the ending.A group of people, unknown to one another, have been gathered together by a mysterious host to his isolated island mansion. There is a man servant & his wife--and even they're not sure who hired them. Just as the motley assortment of guests get a few drinks in them, a weird, disembodied voice speaks. The voice tells the group (including the servant couple) he has proof positive that each one has gotton away with murder in the past. From there the mystery (and murders) begin.A plot device involves a collection of indian stauettes, each one representing a line in a nursey story. The guests begin to get knocked off in ways described in the rhyme--and after each murder is discovered, one of the figurines strangely disappears. All the guests start suspecting each other, and that's when the fun really begins.Can you guess who's the murderer?Let me tell you, it's...just kidding!NOTE: The comedy CLUE was obviously based on this story. It even includes a Miss Marple character who's slightly incontinent. The disembodied voice? TRUMAN CAPOTE! Who else?"},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"&quot; There are ten of us in this room. One of us must be the murderer.&quot; So says Judge Wargrave, one of the ten main characters in And Then There Were None, a thrilling story by Agatha Christie. I chose this book because my father used to read her books and he mentioned a book about ten people who were all mysteriously killed on an isolated island. The ten strangers are gathered together on an isolated island by a mysterious host. One by one the guests share the dark secrets of their pasts. And one by one they die... How each character is murdered is known from the beginning, by a seemingly innocent poem, but yet the story is chilling and suspenseful; knowing one's fate is more disturbing than uncertainty. I recommend this book to readers who enjoy a great book filled with mystery and suspense."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"Wow. This was a masterpiece. I knew it when I laid the book down after finishing it, and what a refreshing experience it is to be conscious of something like that; it is years since I had a similar feeling after reading something. I have read \\"Five Little Pigs\\" by the same author a couple of years ago and considered that as her most successful novel among the about 15 ones I have read so far. But this is really something else and no wonder it is widely considered to be her best work. I had of course heard about the reputation of this book previously but was still struck by awe after finishing it, the same kind I've experienced after e.g. Poe's \\"Gold-Bug\\" or Bronte's \\"Wuthering Heights\\". Right now, still shaken after the experience, I am inclined to regard this as the Top 3 best books I've ever read. It's also quite an exceptional work in Christie's repertoire - this is a thriller with no detective around; the people just keep dying one after another until... so who the heck can be the murderer? Everything is explained in an epilogue and makes immediate sense. It is almost impossible to figure out the murderer before that. Bravo."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"If you ever wondered why Agatha Christie has gotten such acclaim and praise, read this book and you'll find out why.Ten strangers, completely unknown to each other (except for one couple) are invited to attend a party at the mysterious new mansion built on Indian Island by a Mr. and Mrs. U.N. Owen, who is unknown to all of the guests. When they get there, they discover that the host and hostess are nowhere to be found. They soon realize that they have been tricked into coming to the island, a mistake that will ultimately cost their lives.When I first started reading this, I have to admit I was a little bored with the exposition. In fact, I stopped reading it after Chapter 1 for a few days, uninterested. But, I eventually decided to try reading more, and thankfully, I got hooked. As soon as the first person dies, your eyes become instantly glued to the pages, not wanting to put the book down. I know that's what happened to me. And when the killer is finally revealed, it's one of those moments when you hit your forehead and say, &quot;Oh my God, I can't believe I didn't realize that!&quot; All of the other 270 pages definitely pays off with the last 5 pages.If you love whodunit mysteries, or if you loved the show &quot;Murder in Small Town X&quot;, I highly suggest you read this. It's heart-pounding excitement at its best."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"And Then There Were None, by Agatha Christie is a mind bending, and thought provoking murder mystery. Eight guests are invited by seperate but mysterious invitations to spend their holiday together on Indian Island. While each guest is different in many ways all have one thing in common, which you will find out as you read. An old nursery rhyme of Ten Little Indian Boys leads a scandalous curiosity throughout the book. I've never read a book like this, it's almost like playing the board game Clue. You must play close to every chapter and detail if your ultimate goal is to solve the mystery before you're done with the book. Agatha Christie did an excellent job creating different characters all playing key roles to the mystery of Indian Island. This book his different because it is written with thoughts coming straight from the characters rather then just telling the events. The reactions of the characters help develope a good flow and clear up any confusion you might have while reading. &quot;It is lovely here. The hills and the red earth and everything so green and luscious looking.&quot;-pg18 said by Vera Claythorne You wouldn't have guessed that this novel was going to be any kind of mystery. Agatha Christie leaves no description out, at the beggining of the novel. Although the title may sway your oppinions, her description of a what seems to be vacation island is the last thing Indian Island is. Many of the guest who would be staying on Indian Island first viewed it as a welcoming of oppurtunities, that was also assured in their invitations to the island. What the guest do not know is their beautiful beach resort island is going to be the setting of a huge murder scene. The vocabulary that arises in this novel is not too difficult but does take some time to analyze as you read. This book is for anybody who wants a good suspensful mystery. And Then There Were None has many main characters and is often hard to follow. If you have trouble with this, I do not reccomend this book for your choice."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"This was my first Agatha Christie, and it's an ok mystery novel. I never felt completely drawn into it, and I found Christie's use of dramatic ellipses especially over-the-top annoying. Lack of a complete resolution was also irritating. I'm frankly surprised that it's been so highly reviewed by everyone else here."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"Didn't expect to like it as much as I did. Like most teens, I'm not really a fan of 'old' books. But, I've gotten more of a fan of mystery novels in the past year because of some mystery freebies from the Kindle store, so that helped.For the first twenty pages or so, when they were introducing ALL ten main characters, I have to admit nearly put the book down. But glad I didn't, as as soon as the introductions were through, it sped up pretty quickly.I predicted the ending, but then again, I often do. Overall wonderful book, and I'm glad it was on my summer reading list.

One character certainly deserved to die based on a callous disregard for the lives killed through a car accident while others I was less convinced. But it is brilliantly written; as I've done with many Christies, I question if the reader could have actually solved this. Also SPOILER the killer does not die or receive any punishment for killing these people. I think it's a bit like Dexter in that: latent psychopath kills other killers which is troubling to my morality END SPOILER. One difficulty at the start was sorting out all of the characters as they are introduced one right after the other. But then they start dying and that makes it a bit easier to sort them out.But it is a very quick read and enjoyable. I liked trying to puzzle out how they were committed and how they would be committed although I knew I wouldn't be able to figure out who did it. I flew through it even with my mom's persistent interruptions.Overall: 5/5 Despite my perceived flaws, obviously a standout and definitely recommended!"},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"10 people meet for the first time at a house on a island.

It was a quick read and fast paced, and I never guessed who the killer was in the end. It was also complicated, but not so much that I didn't understand what was going on.

It carries the name of Indian Island because its form resembles an Indian. The silence surrounding the mansion is suddenly disturbed when eight guests arrive. Both Thomas and Ethel Rogers, the butler and the cook, are awaiting the guests. But they already have a problem. Their host hasn't arrived yet. And even stranger: there's a framed copy of the nursery rhyme \\"Ten Little Indians\\" hanging on the wall. They decide to go ahead with dinner in absence of their host. But when suddenly a gramophone record starts to play, it becomes clear that it is dangerous to trust anyone on this forsaken island.And Then There Were None is arguably one of the best works by Agatha Christie. Originally published in 1939, it still hasn't lost a single bit of its attractive power. The basic idea is as simple as it gets, but the denouement is simply a showcase of the inventiveness that is so characteristic of the English author. I have read this novel now for the third time and still I discover new aspects that show the ingenuity of the plot. Never will the reader feel unfairly treated, although it requires a very astute sleuth to predict the outcome at a first reading. The characters are quite stereotypical, but that cannot be avoided if you require that the reader keeps track of ten possible suspects and as such is easily forgiven.And Then There Were None is simply a must read for anyone with a liking for a good detective novel."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"AND THEN THERE WERE NONE by Agatha Christie is the best of the best in the thriller field and she wrote it in 1939.Ten people travel to an island and those ten people are murdered.

Ten strangers trapped on an island, being slowly murdered by one of their own for their past crimes. In true Agatha Christie fashion, when you take a step back and look at how many coincidences had to work out just right for all of the pieces of the killer's plan to work, it's an absurd concept, but internally, it's consistent. Considering that there are only about 200 pages and ten main characters, Christie does an admirable job drawing out the complexities and personalities of her characters, and the tense scenes after the suspect list narrows to four are especially well done. Christie even manages to avoid most of the rampant classism so present in her other works (although there is a fair amount of gratuitous anti-Semitism - the killer's henchman is Jewish, so of course everyone needs to bring that up in a derogatory way when they talk about him). Yes, the whole thing is a little ludicrous, but it's a great quick read, and I highly recommend it to anyone who thinks he doesn't like reading mysteries. This one is a classic that has earned its reputation."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"this is by far the best book on my amazon kindle. once you get to know the characters you are drawn into a masterpiece of words. agatha christie says things that get right to the point. there is no extra fluff. all the words serve a purpose making reading it a treat that will make you pull away from whatever you are doing to read it. the suspense is masterfully established. you will never see the end coming. i ddi a double take when i learned the killers identtiy. this story is worth a hundred dollars"},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"Taken at face value, And Then There Were None may as well have been the basis of the 1985 movie Clue. Of course, as funny that movie was, this novel was anything but.But the premise is very similar. Strangers made to come together in a remote place by an invitation from an anonymous sender. However this is where the two works of fiction diverge. The movie Clue revolves around a plot with characters who have received the same letter/invitation (as in verbatim). In And Then There Were None however, each letter is eerily suited to a particular person. Some were enticed by the prospect of a good time or the promise of meeting old acquaintances (as what they have been wanting to do or have), others were lured by financial opportunities (as was their pressing need); whilst others still had vague motivations for coming.The author is unrelenting in building the suspense - from the first bits in the train/carriage ride bearing the arriving guests - up to the climax. Snatches of thoughts from each character make it helpful for the reader (to a certain extent) to pin down which is which. There's the judge who can lie still as a stone but whose pale eyes are razor sharp, always taking everything in. The self-righteous and religious fanatic middle-aged woman whose demeanor is rarely ruffled. The younger female who looks sensible but whose thoughts are haunted and chaotic. The general whose disdain for the brash, younger generation is hard to miss. The doctor whose seeming contentment with his career is nevertheless shadowed by a past controversy. And then others more whose presence in Indian Island certainly make the group a strange mix of persons.The first solid chilling clue is the presence of the Ten Little Indian Boys rhyme set in each of the guest's bedroom. (I had to write it all down as a guide...No, really. It's a requirement)The guests themselves have barely been reluctant acquaintances upon arrival when a strange, disembodied voice blasts over the whole drawing room where they have all retired after dinner. And then the chills creep in all over again.Each of those present is accused of murder.Well then of course one just has to read on. Because that's the beauty of Agatha Christie novels. It's all up-front murder but the mastery lies in her exposition. Who and how was it all done?I again thought that it might be the same as Clue, in which the presence of deadly weapons is a silent command that all characters finish each other off.But no. In this novel, the characters have no reason to kill each other. And yet all of them, because of those accusations, deserve to die.And if this is not your first Agatha Christie, then I guess my saying that it's useless to make any guesses is understandable.Just sit back and let the narrative do the work for you.And if you still find yourself guessing every so often, I can't blame you. And that's why I'm loving this author."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"What a great book to read, especially if you are looking for something quick and absorbing. In \\"And Then There Were None\\", Agatha Christie delivers the classic whodunit.From the interrogation of the suspects and examination of the crime scenes Christie provides us the clues to start to make our own deductions on who is the murder. Eventually, like most people I am sure, we need to reassemble our thoughts as our main suspect is killed off. I found myself more than once going back to review the evidence and constantly rereading the nursery rhyme that makes available the plot.As stated above, it's a great book. I read that over 100 million copies of \\"And Then There Were None\\" have been sold, making it the seventh highest selling book ever. Also, only the Bible is said to have more books sold than Agatha Christie's collection. In terms of authors, her name is readily accepted with Shakespeare's as among the best selling authors of all time. Impressive.Enjoy the book.Ps. Look up pictures of Burgh Island if you want to see Christie's inspiration for Indian Island."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"This is the grandaddy of all murder mysteries. This is the story that created an entire genre of \\"a group of people locked in an isolated location and one by one, they all start to die? Who is the killer and who will make it out alive?\\"It's an ingenious premise that's been copied and ripped of in other novels, movies and board games in the nearly 80 years since it's been written. Imitation is the best form of flatter and none do is as well as Christie. Movies like Clue, Murder By Death, The Last of Sheila and many others have paid homage to this fantastic book.Christie paints vivid characters, each with a dark secret. The story is a fantastic metaphor for anyone who has a secret and the price that's eventually paid for it. We've all been there. We've all thought, \\"I wonder if anyone else knows about this and what if they do?\\" Christie weaves a terrific dark tale of the prices that are exacted for dark secrets.Just when you think you know who the killer is, that person fall prey to the killer and you find yourself starting all over again in your deductions. It's a mystery that's nearly impossible to figure out but that won't detract for the fun you'll have has you turn pages faster and faster as the suspense amps up as you near the finale."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"Review:In the beginning there were ten- an odd collection of strangers, all sent to the same private island off the coast of Devon on the same weekend as guest, just all for different purposes.

Set on a island where noone can escape they are being killed off one by one. The surprise ending was one of the best twists I have ever read. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and didn't want to put it down. Just when you thought you knew who did it, they too were murdered. I think this would make an excellent suspense movie."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"This book was spellbinding; a good Agatha Christie for those familiar with her writing and a wonderful addition to the newly christened Agatha Christie fan. There was no way of knowing who dun it; The details were carefully written, and the clues carefully laid out. Since it was first published in 1939, and then 1940, under the name Ten Little Indians, I'm not sure how many readers this book has seen. It is the old title that the new title will remember. Agatha Christie is also easy to read, with one chapter flowing easily into the next, making it just as hard to put down because of the plot as with the written story. The ending is surprising, but rereading could identify the suspects better, maybe. There are some grousome details, but Agatha Christie writes neatly and to the point; no scary, put on the night light, look under the bed stuff - unless, ofcourse, you don't like a murder tale."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"Christie really outdid herself when coming up with characters and building the suspense of this book. This isn't one of her mysteries where you get the chance to solve the case before the solution is revealed. The clues necessary for that are just not made available to the reader. The solution does make complete sense within the context of the story, but nothing hints at it at all. But, that's part of the wonderful suspense of the story-- who is going to die next, and who on earth could possibly be the killer? You might have your guesses, but just like the characters, each will be proven incorrect. The suspense builds and builds as there are more bodies and fewer suspects, and seemingly no possible way for everything to be happening the way it is. Like the characters, you wonder whose testimony and actions you can really trust. Truly a masterful work of suspense."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"Agatha Christie hit this one right out of the ball park. Strangers invited to a remote island, only to be picked off one by one. But WHO IS DOING IT??A must read."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"The book was very gripping with opinions and points of view from all 10 of the main characters. I had not been an Agatha reader before but I intend to read more of her novels. I also liked the small size of the book and the glossy cover. It made for a neat package that was easy to carry. I received the item promptly and in very good condition."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"This book is a great mystery for teens and adults alike. The plot is well-paced and surprising at times. This is one of Agatha Christie's best works and definitely worth reading!"},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"When you start a mystery novel, you expect to be intrigued. Christie though does it with panache. Her unfailing ability to keep you guessing is her strongest suit. Even when you think you know, when you think you figured it out, she finds a way to thwart your reasoning. Creative license allows an author to twist plots and slip out of tight corners with unreasonable solutions. Not so with Christie. To the very end, she makes it plausible and fluid.A Mistress of Sleuths, never disappointing.An easy read for a stroll if listening or with a cup of tea before a fire. Whichever way you see fit to read this treasure, it will delight you with its simplicity, twists and turns. Don't try to figure it out. Never mind! Do and pit your mind against Christie and see where it gets you. It is not enough to know who it is. You have to find out why it is that person.Happy reading a wonderful story."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"I recently had the pleasure of re-reading this story, not really by choice. A chapter into the story, I was so happy I had been \\"forced\\" to read it. Agatha Christie is the master of mystery, and this is one of her finest stories. Read it. Then read it again!"},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"And Then There Were None ReviewIn my opinion, I think the book was good. The best part was the suspense.It makes you think about what will happen to everybody; who will die and who is the killer. I also liked the setting: Indian Island, before modern times, island shaped like a head, no technology or transportation, so they have to wait a week before the boat will come, but while they are supposed to wait, each person one by one dies from the ten guests, all according to the poem Ten Little Indian Boys, most of the time in its general sense. But at some times, it was easy to predict who would die though. I like the genre too, mystery, they are the ones with the most excitement. At the same time, it kind of got annoying since it was a typical mystery book. I know this because there were some other mystery books where people died that way. I had also not liked the end. I found out who the killer was, but it did not have that much excitement. But in majority, most people should read this book if they want to be introduced to mystery because it is a very great introduction for it."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"In the book And Then There Were None, the setting is a very important part of the story takes place on Indian Island. When the story takes place on island it also adds to the suspense. On the island there are no telephones or any other way to contact anyone for help, and even if a person wanted to help the killer said not to help them in anyway. A person named Fred Narracot is not coming because the killer has told him not to come. If the guests on the island heliographed for help, people on shore has been told to ignore the signals.The suspense is that the guests that have been invited to the island and there is no way of contacting anyone on shore. There is a killer among the people. Someone named U.N.Owen is the killer. There is also no telephone on the island. No one can help the guests, they are all in danger.The author, Agatha Christie makes it look like anyone could be the killer. A guest named Phillip Lombard brings a revolver to the house, and a person named Emily Brent was gone the morning someone was killer. I also liked the author's style. I think I will read some more of her books.I really liked this book. At the end of each chapter, I was always at the edge of my seat thinking about what would happen next. I would call this book a very exciting page turner. I would suggest people to read this book.When I read this book I thought it was going to be boring, but it turned out to be a very good book, in my opinion. After reading this book I learned to like mystery books. Even though some people didn't like this book I think it was one of the best books I have ever read. I recommed this book to people who would like to read about mysteries."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"And Then There Were None (aka Ten Little Indians), by Agatha ChristieThere is a classic murder mystery story known as \\"the locked room mystery\\". Someone is found murdered in a room locked from the inside. No one could have left the room! How did it happen? In this story the locked room is an island where no one can enter or leave. The ten people on this island are murdered one by one. An old nursery rhyme of \\"ten little Indians\\" provides a blueprint for the mysterious deaths. Logically, the last man standing would be the presumed murderer, by the process of elimination. But what if the murderer died before?This is an example of the classic English murder mystery. The murder exists to provide an intellectual puzzle to entertain the reader. The participants are mostly the middle-class, and not ordinary people. No one works on an assembly line or other manual labor; even if they may be the customers for this product. Children are absent. The scene is a large house owned by a rich man. Raymond Chandler pointed out the differences in his essay \\"The Simple Art of Murder\\". Most murders occur because of sex or money, to get it or to keep it. Chandler commented on the highly artificial murder plots which multiply clues that experienced detectives would see through. You can compare these stories to True Crime.Chapter XI references one locked room mystery in America. An old gentleman and his wife were killed with an axe. The maid couldn't have done it. The respectable middle-aged daughter was acquitted. No other explanation was ever found. Who killed them?"},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"This classic Who-Done-It by Agatha Christie reads as well today as when it was first appeared in 1939. Ten different persons are invited to spend a weekend on remote Indian Island, guests of a mysterious host. At dinner on the first evening a recording is played that accuses each guest of serious wrongdoing. Soon Anthony Marston drops dead from poisoned wine. By morning, another guest lies dead. The boat from the mainland won't be returning for days, so the surviving guests are in a fix and rightly terrified. A search of the island proves that nobody else is on the island - but which guest is the culprit? \\"We must be very careful,\\" warns one guest, but still their numbers decline. The author reveals more about the surviving individuals as their numbers dwindle; their thoughts, desperation, and guilt for which they were accused. Christie gives a couple clues, but only tiny ones. Will the killer be discovered in time? Will anybody survive? Don't peak at the ending - this classic is worth your best effort.Agatha Christie (1890-1976) was a mystery-writing legend, and at this writing she's sold more books worldwide than anybody other than Shakespeare. This gripping mystery is one her best - and some say she was the best."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"This book was absolutely brilliant. I am only 11 years old, and I understood it and thorougly enjoyed it. The whole book was very suspenseful, and had me scared to fall asleep. It begins with ten, unsespecting people heading to an island for different reasons. Once everyone has arrived, they come to realize that their host has not yet made it. Also, no one really knew who their host was or why they were at this island. That night, a man died. The rest of the guests eventually figured out that the murderer was one of them- but which one? One by one the terrified guests died off- until there were none. Let me tell you this- the ending was a schocker, so you MUST read the epilogue. The Queen of mysteries has wowed me once again with this incredible novel."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"This is a great mystery book. There are ten people stuck on an island and there is no way off the island. One by one people are getting murdered. No one knows who the murderer is except for the murderer himself of course.

There are many things that are surprising. The book is about 10 characters stranded on an island. One of the ten people is the murderer. There is a poem in which the killer will use. The characters are all charged with crimes. Edward George Armstrong, that you did upon the 14th day of March, 1925, cause the death of Louisa Mary Clees. Emily Caroline Brent, that upon the 5th day of November, 1931, you were the responsible for the death of Beatrice Taylor.

It keeps you drawn in throughout most of the book. It starts out a little confusing, but it gets a lot better. It is about 10 strangers who share a common background that end up on a mysterious island. One by one they are killed, and coincidently each one of their deaths is foretold by a poem hung in each of their bedrooms. The ending is a complete surprise, and really adds to the story. Overall, this book is definitely worth reading - highly recommended if you like good mysteries."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"The queen of mystery writing deserves her reputation. And this is her best book. I have read and reread it and have yet to find a flaw. Originally published as Ten Little Indians for reasons which will become apparent as you read it, this little gem should be read by all who aspire to write novels. The characters, the landscape, the background, the build up of action, the fantastic action -- all leave me breathless as well as enthrauled with the perfect narrative tone and control exhibited in this masterpiece. If you haven't read it yet, you are in for a treat. It is way better than the movie, the play, or any of her other works including The Seven Dials Mystery, Three Blind Mice, Witness for the Prosecution and Murder on the Orient Express."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"This book will have a grasp on you as soon as you open it. Ten strangers, a curious assortment of men and women from different walk of life, are summoned as weekend guests to a private island off the coast of Devon by a mysterious man U. N. Owen. Each guest identifies common relations with Owen and yet Owen is unknown to them. It is a pre-announced murder spree. One by one, the house guests fall prey to an unknown, myseterious killer in the house, according to the scheme walled up in individual guest room-the rhyme of ten Indian boys. This is a book that fills up with suspense, panic, and thrill. As more house guests fall prey, the remnants escalate vigilance but also distrust. Speculation and doubts roam in of their mind. And only the dead are above suspicion. This is definitely a page turner. I finish the book in a day, with perspiring hands, accelerating pulse and a cloud of speculation in my mind. Good read. 3.3 stars."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"This book is about ten people who were invited to spend the weekend on an isolated island. The only thing they all have in common is that they have each murdered someone. Other than that they all have unique personalities that are well portrayed. One by one they, too, are murdered. The thing that impressed me the most about this book is the logic of it all. The story is very suspenseful and the ending is surprising."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"This has to be my favorite Agatha Christie book of all time.

They are being killed one by one--and the murderer can only be one of them.

Like all of Christie's books, it captures the reader's attention. It makes the reader want to read more and find out what happens in each chapter. The entire book is interesting, and the characters are as well. The plot is well structured and thought out. This book leaves the reader wanting to read more of Christie's mysteries."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"This book was a very good book and the way it was set up was very different because you would never guess the ending.It was about 10 people that got letters from someone who was in their past. The letters said that they wanted them to come to an island far away called Indian Island. When they all got there they relized that they were the only ones in the house except the maid and her husbsand, they took care of the house. So they were going to try and leave the next morning but when they went to see if any boats were coming there were none. So they ended up staying there for a while.And the whole book is based on the poem The 10 Little Indians.The only reason I gave it four stars was because I think that the author jamed alot of information in the second chapter and I kind of got confused. It doesn't sound like a good book but I just don't want to give away the ending!"},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"And Then There Were None was a good book. I liked it because it didn't drag on that much. It kept going. Also, some of the words in it were hard to read and understand, but once you got going on it, it was easier to read.It started out with ten people being invited to Indian Island for a summer vacation by someone that they have never heard of before. Once they get there they go into their rooms and there was the poem &quot;Ten Little Indian Boys&quot;. Each verse is how each murder happens. The first verse says that one indian boy choked himself and the first man that dies had choked himself. Then the next verse says that an Indian boy choked himself and in the story that is what happened in the second murder of the story. And it went that way throughout the book."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"Whenever you think you know it, Christie fools you at the end.The ending...- just when you think you know it and your finished...

Soon, they find to their horror that their host has filled the house with booby-traps that use a trait of each guest to kill him or her. As people die unexpectedly, suspense rises to a screaming level before the author hits you with a breathtaking finish. It may leave you limp at the end, but it's great fun."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"When I read this book, it was the first mystery I'd ever read, but the book was so good that I began to read more mystery. After becoming the mystery connoisseur, I determined that this was by far the best Agatha Christie novel and best mystery novel in general. This book is a real page turner because the reader has no idea who the killer is until the last page (even further then that actually; you don't find out until the epilogue)! This book has even gone down in history crowning the phrase &quot;and then there were none.&quot; So, in conclusion, I believe that this book is a must read for a first time mystery reader or a life-long mystery lover!!!"},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"This book was sooooooooooo AWESOME!!! Agatha Christie seemed to &quot;suck&quot; me into the book. I was so nervous toward the end, I put on the TV while I was reading.

I thought that it was going to be boring, but it's really great! The ending is ironic and as usual, Agatha leaves you wondering who could the killer be this time. Luckily, I was able to finish this book before the whole class did (well, except for one more person who beat me into the reading). This is a great book, and the movie, which we saw during class after reading the book, was not only a lot different from the book, but the movie was terrible, a huge disappointment! You're better off reading the book! Trust me!"},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"This book by far was one of the best Mystery books I've ever read! It will always be one of my favorites. The way Christie brings the characters to life and how she enthralls you in her words keeps you wanting more.

You know it is a good book when you find yourself yelling &quot;IT'S HIM! I KNOW IT IS! DON'T TRUST HIM!&quot; This book becomes real because of the power in Christies writing. I could read this book a million times and still wonder what's going to happen next.

This was by far the best book I read this summer. I think everyone who loves mystery should read it! ACTION PACKED! IT WAS AWESOME! TWO THUMBS UP!"},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"Growing up, I never read Agatha Christie because I had been led to believe that her mysteries were merely popular thrillers without much depth. I was therefore extremely surprised to discover just how intriguing and well-constructed her writing was when I was asked to teach &quot;And Then There Were None&quot; as one of the required novels for my 7th grade classes. I took the book home to prepare lesson plans one night and read it through from cover to cover in a single sitting! There are so many interesting twists and details in the plot that I simply could not put the novel down. My kids loved it, too!!! It was difficult to get them to do anything else in class besides read, especially since they weren't allowed to bring the book home with them. This book has been the catalyst for my new interest in mystery novels; I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a compelling adventure. The best part of any great mystery work is when you can't guess &quot;whodunit! &quot;, and unless you glance through the end of the book, you won't see this one coming! Hope you enjoy it as much as I did . . ."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"LET ME TELL YOU, I do not read much, for I have a short attention span. TV and magazines are my thing.BUT I MUST TELL YOU, THAT THIS IS, WITHOUT ANY DOUBT, THE *BEST* BOOK I've ever read!It's so cleverly written and so scary mentally. I read this book when I was in the seventh grade and I remember having trouble sleeping for the past few nights.

I finally got him to read the book. If he could figure out who the killer I would pay for the book. He read it and said,&quot;That was the best mystery I've ever read!

But the kindle version calls the island Soldier Island when the correct name is Indian Island, which fits the theme of the book much better."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"Without this novel, my life would be a peaceful ocean happens nothing but tedious. This book taught me what the thrill is and what the detective novel is supposed to be. Although I read some detective novels written by Arthur Conan Doyle, I couldn't repress my utter astonishment about Agatha Christie's ingenious tricks and techniques.Starting to read this book, I wondered why many people tout Agatha Christie. There was no difference between other novels, but little more explanation. This large amount of explanation is an obstacle to quick development of story. Finishing the story, however, I realised that all the explanations were under plots.Her skill to depict the mind was another charm of this novel. She made a great device to look through human mind when the crisis comes. As one person dies, they are caught in terror and start to admit their trivial crime which they have not believed it was a crime.Agatha Christie executed artistic tricks in her novel. She quoted one of Mother Goose's Melodies - Ten little nigger boys - and adapted to this novel and she demonstrated how it could happen. It makes reader have curious and attract into her novel.And Then There Were None was my first novel written by Agatha Christie, but it was enough to lure me into her world. This book won't let you loose unless you read the very last line of the book. To those who have not read this novel yet, it will give them thrill never tasteable thorough any movies or amusement rides."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"The book, And then There Were None, is a beautifully written mystery. From the beginning on, Agatha Christie, sets the stage for one of the best mysteries I have ever read. In the beginning ten strangers are invited to Indian Island, all by a mysterious host by whom no one knows. The ten strangers all have one thing in common though; they were all murders at one point in time. Some killed for love, some killed for there own life, but many had no real reason. They also had one other thing in common; none were punished for their murders. The law could not touch all the cases. In other words, none of the cases had enough evidence to prove those people as murders. On the other hand, the mysterious host knew everyone's misdeeds and wanted These ten people, one by one, to face their victims' tragic end. So the host killed them, one by one, based upon the poem Ten Little Indians. Below is this poem: Ten little Indian boys went out to dine; One choked his little self and then there were nine.Nine little Indian boys sat up very late; One overslept himself and then there were eight.Eight little Indian boys traveling to Devon; One said he'd stay there and then there were seven.Seven little Indian boys chopping up sticks; One chopped himself in halves and then there were six.Six little Indian boys playing with a hive; A bumblebee stung one and then there were five.Five little Indian boys going in for law; One got in Chancery and then there were four.Four little Indian boys going out to sea; A red herring swallowed one and then there were three.Three little Indian boys walking in the zoo; A big bear hugged one and then there were two.Two little Indian boys sitting in the sun; One got frizzled up and then there was one.One little Indian boy left all alone; He went and hanged himself and then there were none.From this poem the ten people died by either choking or being \\"chopped up\\". As they died, there was one other object that went along with them. This object was a porcelain figure of an Indian. In the center of the table sat a plate with ten figurines but by the end there were none. Among those ten people someone was the murder, who could it be? This story is one of the best ever written. In the begging it is somewhat boring since the author is only telling you who everyone is. Even though it is boring it is a crucial part of the book And Then There Were None by Agatha Christie, one the only books I can read in one sitting."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"After years of enjoying Hercule Poirot and Miss Marple on PBS, I've finally read my first Agatha Christie novel, which is also her most popular. The novel is set on the private island of Mr. and Mrs. U.N. Owens off of Devon, England where one by one the ten guests are murdered. Their host is mysteriously absent. The guests are the only ones on the island and are unable to leave. Therefore, one of them is the murderer. Possible suspects are winnowed from the innocent chapter by chapter.Are any of the guests really innocent? We meet each in turn. Some are there to work, like Mr. Rogers as a butler and his wife as the cook, while others were invited for a vacation. We learn early on that every guest has either been directly or indirectly the cause of the death, but not necessarilly the murder, of others. Each guest has eluded justice...until now.The nursery rhyme \\"Ten Little Soldiers\\", framed on the wall of every guest's room, figures prominently in the story. The rhyme describes the deaths of ten soldiers and foreshadows those of the guests. For example, \\"Ten little Soldier boys went out to dine; One choked his little self and then there were nine.\\" The poem ends with the titular \\"...and then there were none.\\" Besides the methods of murder, other clues can be found in the rhyme.I don't normally read mysteries. I want to solve the mystery, before the murderer is revealed. A great deal of concentration is required, since every sentence might contain a clue or a red herring, and I'm a little too lazy to keep it all straight in my mind. But, every time I finish a mystery, whether I solve the crime or not, I find that I enjoyed the ride. This is no different with this novel. As with a good magician, there is enjoyment to be had in being deceived.I especially enjoyed the literary device of the rhyme. Through the rhyme, she practically hand delivers clues that a lesser writer would not want to reveal so early in the novel, and then she delivers a whole new layer of mystery. You might expect that as each guest dies, the mystery would simplify, but instead it only becomes more confounding.I didn't figure out who the murderer was. However, a good mystery writer provides enough clues for you to ascertain the murderer, and Christie does. The denouement was admitedly much more complicated than I would have expected, but one can still identify the murderer. In retrospect, there were clues I missed and words I misinterpreted. Hopefully, when you read this novel, you won't."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"This, as much as anything, really made me love the mystery and suspense genre. This is a tremendous book that is as classic today as it was when it was published."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"I did not really like this book. It was too wordy and wasn't suspenseful at all with all of the accusations thrown around by those still among the living. It was further ruined by who I actually figured out was the murderer. There was no climax, no fear, nothing. The poem sounded so suspenseful, but didn't deliver.Everyone is so flat. And it's hard to remember who is who, and I felt like I spent half of the book trying to remember who each one was. Sometimes Christie reminds you, but most times she doesn't. I found myself hopelessly flipping through pages of repetitive dialogue to get to the next murder, only to be disappointed it was no big spectacle. I understand that things were more \\"conservative\\" when she wrote it, but I've read more suspenseful things during that time period than this.Needless to say, I will not be picking up another of her novels."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"My favorite Agatha Christie, this is a thriller with such an ingenious plot, such memorable characters, such pithy dialogue and a setting that is so chilling and fascinating, that it all adds up to first-class murder thriller entertainment. In fact I used the idea of an island setting myself forMerryll Manning: Trapped on Mystery Island, my first book in the \\"Merryll Manning\\" series. I like the cover of this edition too!"},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"Whenever I'm going to be doing something labor intensive, but not very exciting, I enjoy listening to an audio book. Some people like to point out every instance of failure as a novelist they can think of regarding Agatha Christie. I, on the other hand, choose to overlook any defects in her stories and just enjoy them. When you add the narration by Hugh Fraser it makes the experience all that much more satisfying. I did not find any defects or glitches in this recording and Fraser has a warmth and intimacy to his voice which makes it seem that he is right there in the room with you, almost telling you the story personally.Ten people were invited to Indian Island, Sticklehaven, Devon. Ten people who didn't recognize the name of their host (or in some cases, their employer) but who went nevertheless for their own personal reasons. Everything seemed to be going well until the recording was played which accused each of them of the crime of murder. In each bedroom was a large framed piece of parchment, a poem which most of them recognized from their childhood. When the deaths began to happen, they realized that the poem was put there as a warning of what was about to happen. And they were trapped on the island.Even if you have read this story by Agatha Christie you will still enjoy the narration by Hugh Fraser. He is so permanently linked in my memory with the Hercule Poirot stories presented on PBS that I feel as if I am visiting with two old friends, Fraser and Christie. Highly recommended by a Christie fan and a fan of audio recordings."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"I really enjoyed this book and couldn't put it down.

But let me tell you, this book was so suspenseful, and it really WAS a mystery... it's how a real mystery should be written.

Agatha Christie is always great."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"This is the first Agatha Christie novel I have read since I was a child. Although I don't think that many people will consider it \\"great literature,\\" it is nevertheless a compelling read. Christie's best plots - like Murder on the Orient Express - take the mystery genre and turn it on its ear. This one will keep the reader guessing until the end (unless the story has been spoiled for him). Usually, there is only one murder to solve - here, there is quite a big body-count. Usually, to find the guilty party, one must simply look for the least-likely suspect. I don't think that formula will work here. The setup: ten party-guests (the titular \\"Little Indians\\") are invited to an island off the English coast. They are informed by an unseen \\"Mr. Owen\\" that they are about to be punished for their crimes. Saying anything more would be too much."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"It's a mystery who bought Indian Island. The papers were raving on and on about it, each one stating a different person's name. Only ten people believed they knew the real truth. Each of these ten people received a letter or an invitation to come up to Indian Island for a week. These people were all led to believe that these invitations were sent by one of their old friends.In each of the rooms is a framed poem about ten little Indians, all who disappear in different ways. The ten people in the room were about to become those little Indians. In an ingenious way, each and every one of the people in the room was to die. Ten dead people on an island, how were the police ever supposed to find out how that had happened?I really liked the way Agatha Christie wrote this book. It was suspenseful, and written so nobody could have ever guessed what happened at the end. She's really good at doing that. It was an enjoyable read, because she found different ways to surprise you each time you flipped the page. It was a great book, even considering Agatha Christie's knack for mysteries."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"I love this book. The first time reading it I was truly perplexed. It is an amazing mystery that will have you guessing up until the shocking end. It's a classic in the mystery genre and everyone should read it, you won't want to put it down!"},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"A true thriller, this book is the best suspenseful book I've read yet! The way the characters get mysteriously fall to prey one at a time makes you keep turning those pages to find out what's happening next. The book will really make you pay attention to the many clues floating around like jigsaw pieces to a puzzle. Only when you piece together the clues will you begin to notice a suspect. The book will keep you turning the pages until the very end when the whole case is solved. Solved with no evidence left. Nothing."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"I think this book is a very good book because it keeps you reading. It is a murder mystery about 10 people that go to an island. One of the people is the murderer. In every character's room there is a poem that follows how the people are murdered. There are also several movies on this book. Some of the murders are very complicated. Agatha Christie is the author of this book. She also has many different murder mysteries. I think many kids my age should read this book."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"If you like suspenseful books, this is the book for you. It starts out that 10 people are invited to an island by an unknown person. When they arrive on the island they meet a maid and a butler that live at the house they are staying in. They don't even know who lives in the house. One by one the people are dying. Once you think you know who the murderer is, your suspect dies and surprises you. If you want to know who the real murderer is and find more information about this book, check this book out at your nearest library."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"This book was amazing! If you want a mystery with a twist, this is the one. Agatha Christie used foreshadowing frequently throughout the book. Though these clues don't get you anywhere closer to finding out who the murderer is. When 10 pepople that are responsible for a murder are called to an empty island, everyone is a suspect. Who killed them? That's the twist!I've read Agatha Christie books before, but this has been the best. In all her books I've read, there is always a twist when it comes to the murderer. This twist comes at the very end, during the epilouge, and you could have never guessed who it was. To find out, read And Then There Were None."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"If you've read a lot of Whodunit mysteries, it may seem like you've seen this premise before: Several unconnected people end up together in an unusual situation only to have them start dying off mysteriously. How will they stay alive and find the killer?However, this is the original and probably the masterpiece of this type. It sets the standard and is often imitated and rarely duplicated as well.If you haven't read an Agatha Christie novel before, this is a great one to start with. It is a stand alone novel without any of her recurring characters and it also gives you a chance to get used to how she writes (about 200 pages per book with an even balance between character and story development).If you are very familiar with this genre, you may find it cliche but you also might enjoy reading the story that started those cliches.THE BASIC PLOT: Ten people are on an island with no way off and no other people on the island. One by one, they are killed off in a matter similar to a children's poem found in the house where they are staying. What is the reason for these ten random people to come together in this place and why are they being murdered? And can the killer be stopped before they are all dead?"},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"This book is an absolute must read for mystery buffs and anyone interested in a good mystery that will leave you hanging until the last page. The plot revolves around 10 guests mysterously invited to an island mansion. One by one they begin dying off, and those still living frantically search for the killer. Believe me you won't be able to put this book down. Its a good-sized novel and an easy read, with twists and turns with every turn of the page. This book will have you guessing until the end! Agatha Christie has definatly created the perfect murder."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"395 Reviews (as of March 9, 2003)! I must admit to being impressed. \\"And Then There Were None\\" is a solid whodunit from the old school. We have all experienced the storyline before, most likely because others have \\"borrowed\\" it from Author Christie. The proverbial \\"mysterious stranger\\" invites ten individuals to an island. Each has a definite skeleton is his or her personal closet. One by one they die. The plot thickens as the group realizes that the murderer is one of them! This reviewer won't reveal the ending -as some fellow amazoners have!- but I believe it is plausible. The resolution certainly completes the circle. ATTWN has the added value of being highly readable. No doubt many have consumed it in one sitting, pulled along by the momentum. There are two soft points to ATTWN. 1) The reader must accept the initial premise that the ten accepted a mysterious invitation from a complete stranger and 2)its' brevity precludes the development of any of the characters. A few of these were \\"characters\\" in their own right! Another 30-50 pages would only have bolstered the suspense. Those who like mystery/crime/ murder novels should not be disappointed. With 80 novels and 14 plays to her credit, Ms. Christie is a low risk author, especially at paperback prices. A final word of warning: Do not be fooled, as this reviewer was, by the classic 1945 movie version with Barry Fitzgerald and Walter Huston. Though equally satisfying, the endings are NOT the same."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"I was recommended to read Agathat Christie's books by my private school's principal. I am a very avid reader. I was constantly running out of books to read. My mother bought a book with five books in it, this one being one of them (though it goes by it's other title, Ten Little Indians). At first I was confused with the characters, constantly looking back to the character page to see what the character was like. After a couple of chapters I was captivated with the story of these ten strangers in a curious house. I didn't put it down all day. It kept me captivated the whole time, with a twist at the end! A great read for an mystery lover!"},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"I'm sure you've heard of the popular phrase \\"what goes around comes around.'' Well, in this suspenseful mystery, And then there were none, Agathie Christie has taken this old phrase to fatal level. These seemingly normal people, General Macarthur, Mr. Justice Wargrave, Mr. And Mrs. Rogers, Anthony Marston, Vera Claythorne, Emily Brent, Dr. Armstrong, Henry Blore, and Phillip Lombard all had one thing in common. They all had a deep dark secret. They were all criminals. They were murderers that had gotten away with their crimes, that is, until now. They were lured to an island where they were the prisoners of a madman's mind. And this mysterious person was taking the law into his own hands. He was planning to carry out their long avoided sentences, which were death. But in order to find out if they are pardoned or if they perish, you'll have to read the book. So, if you like mystery novels, you'll love this book. In our opinion, we think this book is a great novel that will keep you on the edge of your seat never wanting to put the book down.(...)"},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"This book is so brilliant. This is probably Agatha Christies's greatest novel; and yet there is no trace of Hercule Poirot. The reason for this becomes clear as you read the novel.Ten uncaught murderers are invited to a luxury island by the ethereal U.N. Owen. They are all alone.Then they are murdered, one by one by one by one...until they are all dead. Yes, ALL. How, you ask? That's what's so brilliant.Before reading this book I thought The Murder of Roger Ackroyd was Christie's best mystery. But unlike that novel, and unlike most of her &quot;great&quot; novels (Orient Express, Nile), here there is no trick plot. Everything is precisely what it appears to be. And that's what's brilliant.I can only compare it to a master conjuring trick, which you can puzzle over forever before it is finally revealed.The writing quality is also brilliantly atmospheric; and unusually for Christie, the characters here are unforgettable and realistic. There is nothing lightweight about this novel - you can tell Christie really took this one seriously."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"This has to be one of the best book I've ever read. It was suspensful and scary, without using any stunts to try and frighten the reader. I was barely able to put it down. The ending's plot twist suprised me and left me thinking afterwards. I highly recommend this book to anyone who craves a good mystery novel. The only bad thing about this book is that it kept me awake at night."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"This book will be the most exciting book that you will ever read. You will never be able to figure out who the murder is. Agatha makes you think the killer is one person, then suddenly that person us dead. And Then There Were None is about eight people who are invited to a weekend vacation party at a mansion on a small island, about a mile from a little town called Striclehaven in Devon, England. Whenthe guests arrive, they figure out that the host isn't there, and that each of them recieved a letter from a different person. The guests weren't the only ones there though. There was also a maid and butler (Mr.and Mrs. Rogers), who had just arrived the day before the other gusets arrived there. Mr. Rogers said that he had just received a letter in the mail from the owner of the island. It said that he wouldn't be able to make it, and that they were supposed to stay there and have a good time. Then suddenly people started to die. The first one dies of poisoning and the next one dies from the same thing, but asleep. At first they think that the people comitted suicide, but then they figured out that they are murdered. Somebody poisoned them. They then think that the murder is somewhere on the island, but where? They then searched the island and they didn't fond anyone. The murder is among them. Some insane killer had brought them all together and now was going to kill them. As you can see, it is a very exciting book. It is aslo very clever. Like how the murder kills people. The murder had put a old nursery rhyme in everybody's room. It was called &quot;The Ten Little Indians.&quot; At first nobody noticed the rhyme, but later"},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"This book was average, then again i am not to big on scary books. Agatha Christie is a superb author, though. She really knows how to write. If you do not like books about murder dont get this book but if you do this book would probaly would be a 5 star book. Well dont take my word for it,read it."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"I decided to read this book with the aid of a book club that, in it, had three other girls. While reading this book, I had a very hard time putting the book down, so as to not read farther than I was supposed to in my book club. The story is very suspensiful and always keeps you on your toes. Ten people are invited to Indian Island in some fashion or another. They all have a secret that they have in common, they all have committed murder. Slowly, each guest is killed off, leaving you wondering who is going to be next. I really liked how the murders were tied into the Little Indian poem that was found in each of the guest rooms. It kept me thinking and guessing who was going to be next. The book is full of little details that repeat each time there is a murder, so I was able to predict some of the happenings in the story. The end of the story was a complete surprise and worth the wait of reading the story. I would recommend this book to people who are interested in a light, mystery book. It was a fast read for me and I certainly enjoyed reading the book."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"This is the first Agatha Christie book I've ever read. After reading this one, it definately won't be the last. Her characters that she creates are 3 dimensional.

I read this book in one day, because I had to find out how it ended!"},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"This book was very exciting. It was an on the edge thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat in suspense. The eleven characters were perfect for this format, you had the general which was the natural leader.

Isolation and an awkwardly placed poem, completely finished off this top notch novel."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"The best muder mystery ever! This is the best I have ever read.

As soon as people started explaining the secrets that were told about them, they begin to mysteriously die. It all relates to a cruel rhyme about the 10 little indians. it catches your attention until the very last page. It also has a twist at the end. It is just an awesome book!

Owen. The mystery starts once the guests arrive and find that Mr.Owen himself is nowhere to be found. Although I usually don't read mysteries (I read this one for school.) I really enjoyed this book. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes murder mysteries that leave the blood and gore out and focus mostly on the plot. The characters (all ten of them) were so realistic I couldn't help but hope that certain characters would be U.N. Owen's next victims. The only thing that I didn't like about this book is the fact I had already been able to guess who U.N. Owen was by the end of the book. I would recommend this book to anyone even if you have already seen the movie. ( The plot varies a little between the book and movie.)"},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"I fisrt read this book when i was in 8th grade in my Reading class.

If you are the type that LOVES murder and mystery and wont know the killer till the end of the book then you will love this book."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"The book, And then There Were None, is a beautifully written mystery. From the beginning on, Agatha Christie, sets the stage for one of the best mysteries I have ever read. In the beginning ten strangers are invited to Indian Island, all by a mysterious host by whom no one knows. The ten strangers all have one thing in common though; they were all murders at one point in time. Some killed for love, some killed for there own life, but many had no real reason. They also had one other thing in common; none were punished for their murders. The law could not touch all the cases. In other words, none of the cases had enough evidence to prove those people as murders. On the other hand, the mysterious host knew everyone's misdeeds and wanted These ten people, one by one, to face their victims' tragic end. So the host killed them, one by one, based upon the poem Ten Little Indians. Below is this poem: Ten little Indian boys went out to dine; One choked his little self and then there were nine.Nine little Indian boys sat up very late; One overslept himself and then there were eight.Eight little Indian boys traveling to Devon; One said he'd stay there and then there were seven.Seven little Indian boys chopping up sticks; One chopped himself in halves and then there were six.Six little Indian boys playing with a hive; A bumblebee stung one and then there were five.Five little Indian boys going in for law; One got in Chancery and then there were four.Four little Indian boys going out to sea; A red herring swallowed one and then there were three.Three little Indian boys walking in the zoo; A big bear hugged one and then there were two.Two little Indian boys sitting in the sun; One got frizzled up and then there was one.One little Indian boy left all alone; He went and hanged himself and then there were none.From this poem the ten people died by either choking or being \\"chopped up\\". As they died, there was one other object that went along with them. This object was a porcelain figure of an Indian. In the center of the table sat a plate with ten figurines but by the end there were none. Among those ten people someone was the murder, who could it be? This story is one of the best ever written. In the begging it is somewhat boring since the author is only telling you who everyone is. Even though it is boring it is a crucial part of the book And Then There Were None by Agatha Christie, one the only books I can read in one sitting."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"and then there were none was a novel anbout a group of 10 people who are all invited to a mysterious house on Indian Island.

I'm a sucker for a group of people stranded somewhere (House, island, wherever) when suddenly a murder occurs.Christie gives some brilliant and insightful background information to her shady suspects and unravels the story as carefully as a ball of yarn.A fantastic read that gets better every time I pick it up.

Later, something bad begins to happen that starts to scare the guests.One by one, guests were getting killed in different ways. One of the guests was killing the other ones when no one was around. The guests started to get horrified. They wanted to know who was doing this. Everyone wanted to get out of this island, but there was no one to pick them up. Who was murdering them and why?I like how Agatha Christie wrote this book and how she made it mysterious. She made each character different with out-going personalities. This book will make you keep reading page after page, and you'll be dying to figure out who the murderer is.After reading the Ten Little Indians and finding out who the killer was and how the guests died, I thought this was an awesome book. I would recommend Ten Little Indians to any girl or boy who likes mystery books. Don't pass this book by in the library- or else you'll be missing on something great.GeoDes Plaines, Illinois"},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"One of the best by agatha christie.

This book was my first foray into Christie, and will almost certainly be my last.This book was highly recommended by a friend who, up until now, has been right on the mark in terms of suggested reading. I mentioned to him that I preferred mysteries where there are enough clues throughout that the reader can try to figure out who the murderer is on his or her own. My friend warned me that Christie is decidedly not like that; in fact, I think his wording was \\"she cheats: she'll introduce a crucial clue in the last few pages that the characters should have known all along.\\" However, he said that if I can get past that -- and I can -- the total was greater than the sum of the parts in that all other aspects of her books made up for this subjective stumbling point. With that, he told me her best book was \\"And Then There Were None,\\" so I checked it out. Like I said, this is the first bad call I've seen him make.At no point did this book actually pique my interest, let alone hold it. Characters began dying, and I couldn't care less about them one way or another. The fact that the title tells you the book's pattern didn't help. Less than half way through, I was consciously aware that I was reading on just to finish it and get it over with. That is NOT a good sign.My major complaint, though, is her prose. Very rushed, dry, sparse in description, and completely unengaging. Stylistically, she makes a number of remedial faux pas, which at first were mildly irritating but became more grating as the book trudged on. The most egregious example is exclamation mark overkill: the first chapter alone averaged two or three a page. Just from that I would have guessed that this was one of her first books, as her style struck me as amateurish and unpolished, but to my surprise she wrote this well into her career.Obviously, and for reasons currently beyond me, Christie has a large fan base. I don't doubt they'd say that I'm either missing something or am an unenlightened philistine who \\"doesn't get it.\\" However, a prime sign of a *good* book is if a relative outsider like me can come in on it cold and go with it. That obviously failed here, and I cannot recommend this book, except to Agatha fanboys or someone looking for a sick drinking game -- take a shot every time she uses an exclamation mark. Be warned if you try that, though: you'll have cirrhosis of the liver 10 pages into it.In all candor, the more I thought about this book, the more it annoyed me - I wouldn't have written such a harsh review otherwise."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"The book And Then there Were None was very interesting. This book was about ten people that were invited to go to a mansion on Indian Island. Through the book they all end up dieing one by one in the same way as the indians in the childrens poem Ten Little Indians. The mystery is to find out who is the person that is killing them off. The book gives you hints to who the the killer my be, and just when you think you know who the killer is that person may get killed. To find out who the killer is you have to read it for yourself.I thought that this wood was very interesting and a great mystery. To many people this may be the kind of book that you can't put down,but to me it was the kind of book that i liked to put down. Then when i finished it I thought over all it was a good book. I donbt think i would read it again. I think many people may think different because i am not the kind of person that reads a lot of books, and it talks a lot for me to really to into the book."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"A wonderful mix of emotion , creativity, and imagination, And Then There Were None is a phenomenal murder-mystery book that pulls you into the story, and keeps you always on your toes and guessing. Agatha Christie did a remarkable job in providing vivid details about the characters and their emotions and personalities, specific scenes in the book's plot and important events, and did an over-all fantastic job at providing just enough information to make you think you know the killer, but not enough to make you sure. The use of a poem to represent things to come is a nice touch to the eerie and coincidental sequence of events. One moment the book might lead you to believe that you know the person guilty of the murders, and then evidence is introduced that makes you believe it's someone else. Sometimes you think is the murderer becomes the victim of a murderer. Definitely a book that's hard to put down."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"Another great by Agatha Christie! Now I can understand why she is considered to be one of the literary greats of the 20th century. This book is a perfect mix of sadness, intrigue, and mystery. Once again Christie's wild twists and turns captivates the audience. Never a dull moment in this book!"},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"One of the best books I've ever read. You just can't put the book down. You've got to figure out &quot;who done it&quot; and until you do, it's impossible to put the book down. If you like mysteries, this one's a winner."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"This book is the best mystery novel ever written as well as the best mystery play.

I was thinking about another end"},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"AMAZING yet suspenseful, best of Agatha Christies wonderful books. Great for ages 15+. I have to type 7 more words so ya"},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"If you think you know this story by the Queen of Crime because you saw the movie, think again.There's no Poirot, no Miss Marple, but this is a good read, and not, I think, typical of Dame Agatha. I suspect that she appears in this book disguised as the judge. It's an inside out version of Murder on the Orient Express. The changes to the plot and characters made for the movie version suggest that however &#34;conventional&#34; the English murder mystery may have been, it was never as conventional as Hollywood."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"I have always heard that this was a great book so I went down to my school's library and checked it out. The librarian confirmed the reports I had heard about the book being good. I sat down and read and read and read and it was great! I have always loved mystery novels. I began reading mystery novels with The Cat Who... series by Lillian Jackson Braun (yes even big, tough, male, 17 year old, high-school seniors can love books about mystery solving felines) and I used to only read mysteries. This book reminds me of why I love mysteries so much. I couldn't figure out whodunnit!"},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"I remember when my ninth grade teacher handed out this book for our class to read, after the first few pages of reading it, I was just so bored. In the beginning, she goes through the description of the characters, which is essential but boring. But once the characters arrive on the island and people start to die, it really is terrific. Unlike a few of Christie's books in which the ending was dull, the ending is surprising and you'll never guess who dunnit. This is the best Christie book I have ever read. I would recommend this book to anyone, even if you're not a big Agatha Christie fan."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"I was assigned to read this book over my summer vacation. At first I didn't really want to read because it was vacation time. I started the book with little interest, but wow what a great book, or at least I thought so. It took me a little bit to get into the book, but as the story line quickly progressed after the introduction of the ten main characters, the mystery had me glued to my reading chair. The book is not just one mystery but three mysteries in one, who is the murder, who will die next, and the mysterious past of the main characters. A mysterious person named U.N. Owen invited ten strangers to an island. One by one they were all mysteriously killed. Each murder mysteriously follows the lines of a poem that is introduced in the beginning of the book. The only murder suspects are each of the invited ten guests. Each guest tells the story of their past and one by one they die. Everyone suspects each other and ciaos unfolds as each guest wonders who will die next. Agatha Christie sets up each situation, which probably would never happen in real life, and makes it happen right before your eyes. Excitement, mystery, suspense then fill the storyline right to the end. I recommend this book to anyone who likes a good mystery and likes to solve puzzles."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"This book is chilling for two reasons-first, it is chilling because of how good it is. Second, the plot is also chilling.Ten strangers are brought together on Indian Island. They all wonder why they were brought here. They soon forget their worries and begin to enjoy their vacation. But then all of a sudden they start to get murdered one by one. The people realize there is no one else on the island except for them. That means the murderer has to be one of them! But who? This question sticks in the reader's mind from when the first person gets killed all to the last chapter. I couldn't guess who the killer was until the very end. There is so much suspense in this book! If you need to do a report or love mysteries, but this book!"},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"I picked this book from a list of Books for a 9th grade english assignment. Iam now in the 10th grade and I loved the book. It leaves you guessing and wondering who the killer was! I absolutey HATE to read, and I sat and read this whole book in one day. If this book shows up on a list to rea..it is a must pick. it is even good enough just go out and buy!"},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"Absolutely the best mystery novel I have ever read. The intricacies of the plot were incredible. The way the ten suspects are eliminated one by one, keeps you guessing. Even as I tried to outguess the author, I found myself going down the very path she wanted. I was trapped. I was flabbergasted at the end when the truth was revealed. Ms Christie has a superb reputation for creating such masterpieces and, believe me, it is well-deserved. I have read at least 15 Agatha Christie novels and this is the best so far. Make sure you read the book before reading any potential spoilers in somebody's review!"},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"I thought this book was a wonderful book. It had a very twisted but intelligent plot and it kept me in suspense the whole time I was reading it. I couldn't put the book down. This is a good book if you like mysteries, suspense, or murder stories."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"Let me just start by saying that \\"And Then There Were None\\" could possibly be the best mystery book I have ever read! It starts out with ten entirely different people and explaining them each separately, which is a very boring way to start out a book, and explaining their professions and lives. When they all get invited to \\"Indian Island\\" is where the book starts to get very interesting. In all of there rooms is a hanging of the \\"Ten Little Indians\\" poem and they all think that is cute and dandy since its named Indian Island, until they find out the real meaning of the odd poem. But to find out the meaning you're just going to have to read the book itself!The way Agatha Christie sets up the mystery and action of the book is intense and intelligent. As soon as you guess who is the murderer, that person gets killed and that just makes you want to read it more. It is a read that kept me up late at nights reading it and also during the day. This book shows fear in peoples consciences, the guilt that lies within, and the hate among strangers. It is amazing what Agatha Christie can put into her novels and still have it all fit together. Its like making a puzzle, there is lots of little pieces that you have to put together but in the end it makes a perfect picture that is clear. It is like this with her book, tons of little things going on and you cant quite make sense of what it is until the book is complete and you can see the whole picture instead of just tiny little pieces. Which also makes this book a fairly hard read. I did find trouble with some things but it all worked out.I think you can apply this to life with meeting new people and having to learn to trust them and not be afraid of what they could possibly do. You can also apply this to when times are rough and you face hardships and challenges, you have to learn to trust the people you are with no matter how much you dislike them and don't agree with them, and you have to stick together.In my final statement I would just overall say that this is a very good read, and also I would like to vote Agatha Christie as my favorite author of mystery and murder books. I would be much obliged for anyone that has time to read and likes this genre to read this book, for it is an epic read. Also if you're a reader read some other novels and mysteries by Agatha Christie because they are extremely good also, they are mostly mystery and suspense. I would also like to say don't ever go to an island if someone gives you a letter and you have no idea where it is from for tat is just pure stupidity. (well if you are stupid enough to go how about telling someone, its always a smart idea) :)"},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"Amazing, truly amazing! This is one of the best well-written and exciting novels that I have ever read. Agatha Christie has added the most amazing and well thought out plot twist to this novel. Trust me, when you finally think you know who is the murderer, you are most defiantly wrong! I absolutely loved this book."},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"And Then There Were None, by Agatha ChristieThere is a classic murder mystery story known as \\"the locked room mystery\\". Someone is found murdered in a room locked from the inside. No one could have left the room! How did it happen? In this story the locked room is an island where no one can enter or leave. The ten people on this island are murdered one by one. An old nursery rhyme of \\"ten little Indians\\" provides a blueprint for the mysterious deaths. Logically, the last survivor would be the presumed murderer, by the process of elimination. But what if this assumption was wrong? It may not sound rational but this story makes it appear so.Ten people are invited or hired to visit Indian Island off the coast of Devon. After a good meal there is a recorded voice that accuses them of murder. The visitors begin dying off in the manner of that nursery rhyme. After searching the island they realize the murderer is one of the guests! Knowing this does not prevent more deaths. This story keeps your interest until the very end. Scotland Yard cannot figure out the solution until a message was found in a bottle at sea. The movie version modified and enhanced this story. No plan is ever perfect because of the many things that can happen.This is an example of the classic English murder mystery. The murder exists to provide an intellectual puzzle to entertain the reader. The participants are mostly the middle-class, not average people. The scene is in a large house owned by a rich man. Raymond Chandler pointed out the differences in his essay \\"The Simple Art of Murder\\". Most murders occur because of lust or greed, to get it or to keep it. Chandler commented on the highly artificial murder plots which multiply clues that experienced detectives would see through. I found a clue in Chapter IX (but I had seen the movie decades ago).Chapter XI references one locked room mystery in America. An old gentleman and his wife were killed with an axe. The maid couldn't have done it; the respectable middle-aged daughter was acquitted. No other explanation was ever found. Who killed them? [Arnold Brown's book explains it was done by someone who was kept hidden.]"},{"Title":"And then there were none","review":"THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS THAT I HAVE EVER READ.

When strange occurences start to happen, one by one, they die. I find Agatha Cristie one of the best suspense authors of our time. She is a very descriptive writer that can leave you hanging after every chapter. Personally, I couldn't put the book down. This book would be good for mature readers.
