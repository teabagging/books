If you have ever been in the canyon country this book is a must."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"This slim volume describes Edward Abbey's experiences in and around Arches National Park, mostly before it was developed. The book is a collection of related essays rather thanone single narrative. It includes some very entertaining anecdotes, beautiful descriptions of nature, and Abbey's observations on the commercialization of the remaining American wilderness areas. As it was written in the 1960s, it is somewhat dated but gives a good idea of what Arches was like before the National Parks Service \`improved' it. One of the main points it makes is that it is not possible to make wilderness areas easily accessible and still maintain the feeling of being in the wilderness.This book should be especially appreciated by those who are presently between trips to the Southwest; although it is unfortunately only a rather poor substitute for the real thing."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"This book stinks of Neitzsche. Mr. Abbey was as much a loaner as Fredreiche ever was. While staying at the Lazy Lizard Hostel in Moab, I read this book for the first time and discovered the greatness of this desert land in my two week stay there. The desert of Utah is uncompromising and incompassionate, not to be taken advantage of. The small area of land known as Moab is not for the faint of heart, its for those who love nature at its extreme. Unfortunately, the street (there is really only one) of Moab is now lined with 4x4 rental places, a Wendy's, a McDonald's, and all the other garbage that comes with civilization. Abbey's premontions were correct, this place has sadly turned into a Mecca for tourits and 4 wheelers who have no respect for this land and those who came before them. If you go here, pay close attention to the rock and how time has played its cruel tricks upon it, clockwise as the Arches deteriorate."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"When Edward Abbey writes about the natural scenery of Utah it is splendid and a joy. When he moves on to his philosophy it is a struggle to stick through to the next page. The level of his hypocrisy is only matched by the level of his misanthropy. I could respect his opinions if he had quit work and moved to the desert, but he took a job for a capitalist government to tend the needs of the tourists, so all his rants about the same ring hollow. His ideas are what you would expect for a first year college student angry with society, not the deep thinker he takes himself to be. The number of glowing reviews really surprises me. I suspect many of them maybe didn't get passed the first couple chapters (which are great, great chapters). It's a wonderful topic but there are probably better sources out there."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"This book arrived promptly and is in good condition.

However, it speaks to major issues, namely the proper relationship between human beings and nature. It is true that in general our vision is too anthroprocentric,: We are considering ourselves as much too important. In this process of our exaggerated self-importance, we tend to disturb nature and destroy the planet that is our home. Abbey provides a corrective to that faulty vision and adds much to our appreciation of nature and our ability to see it in terms of its own beauty and not its utility to us. His description of the beauty of the wilderness and the canyonlands is rich. Abbey's tone can be abrasive, but his argument is sound. He is well read in literature and philosophy, and his arguments have a philosophical bent."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"Just finished reading Edward Abbey's Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness. I like to think of them as essays by a curmudgeon who truly celebrated the wild and being out in it. Alone but hardly lonely, here was a man who cared deeply for our wildest places and wrote about them as he lived in them: passionately. A true conservationist, we could all learn from him and his desire to keep the natural places as they are. Keep the motorized vehicles to a minimum in National Parks. Keep the paved roads out. Get out of our refrigerated boxes and breathe the fresh air and have a look around! Walk and actually see the beauty that surrounds you!Whether he was writing about rafting down the Colorado River before it changes forever due to the addition of another dam, or his \\"ownership\\" of the arches at the end of his first summer as a park ranger at Arches National Monument, you feel every bit of his fierce desire to protect the land coming through in every word. You feel his kinship with every tree, rock and tumbleweed that he comes across, every snake he brings into his camper to take care of the mouse population.I am grateful for his words, his many pilgrimages, his anger and his willingness to show it. It is the fierce protectors who are the guardians and stewards of this beautiful land.He is one minute cranky environmentalist and the next touching wordsmith. \\"If no one is looking for you write your will in the sand and let the wind carry your words and signature east to the borders of Colorado and south to the pillars of Monument Valley - someday, never fear, your bare elegant bones will be discovered and wondered and marveled at.\\"This is a great collection of essays which I recommend. I look forward to reading more of his work."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"When Edward Abbey died in 1989 he left behind a body of work--both fiction and essays--tolling his anarchistic, environmentalist social criticism. Yet his 1968 nonfictional \\"Desert Solitaire\\" remains the book for which, appropriately, he is most remembered.Based on his seasonal job as park ranger at Arches National Monument during the 1950s, it is an unforgettable book. It makes the reader want to follow Abbey out into the desert, with a parting raspberry for \\"syphilization,\\" as he calls it.Alone and at times lonely, Abbey lived three summers in a tin trailer 20 miles from Moab, Utah--though sleeping under the stars and avoiding his government-supplied home as much as possible. Occasionally he jawed with a smattering of tourists, at times pursued outdoor adventures with likeminded misfits and cowboys, but generally remained solitaire. Just Abbey, the desert and its array of living things--animal, vegetable, and, for him, mineral. The mountains and sand, the rocks and rivers, became for Abbey a living organism, the desert, that would outlive all others.Taken largely from his desert journals, the book quenches like cool water from an oasis. A first glance, however, would show only scattered essays, polemics, travel adventures, philosophy, science, sarcasm, hearsay, and amateur anthropology (Abbey's ongoing study of \\"rattus urbanus,\\" which summers in the desert). But dig just a bit and you find issuing forth a steady, sustaining and vivifying narrative: The story of a sensual man (admittedly driven somewhat insane by his hermitage) striving, with great verve and courage, to live fully and, with great wit, intelligence, and heart, to comprehend his world.Our protagonist, Abbey, holds these disparate musings and adventures together by the force of his character: his iconoclasm, his thoughtfulness, his raw energy. Like Thoreau he sets out \\"to confront the elemental,\\" non-human world in the desert--a typically American urge, particularly manifest out West, to seek solace in solitude. And like Thoreau what he finds there is himself.An admitted sensualist, he relishes sleeping on hard ground and feeling the fluid motion of his own body as he climbs mountains and swims rivers; he cherishes the hardscrabble life of a cowboy (work he performs on his days off) and the smooth feel of good whiskey or a friendly woman. But most of all he loves freedom. And here in the desert he finds it and wonders how Man can keep it.The question and quest of freedom are never far from his mind, whether waxing poetic or polemical. He muses on the spareness and simplicity of the desert--two qualities he admires in most things--where \\"the living organism [including Abbey] stands out bold and brave and vivid against the lifeless sand and barren rock.\\"But then, typically, he adds to his aesthetic judgment his philosophic: \\"Love flowers best in openness and freedom.\\" This, like most of Abbey's judgments here, has the ring of truth and rightness and leaves the reader nodding in agreement and regret.Despite such occasional philosophic delicacy, Abbey is anything but sweetness and light. His pen pours corrosive acid on modernity, government (namely, the Park Service, dam builders, and Bureau of Indian Affairs), and Industrial Tourism, as he calls it, which works to enrich the auto and hotel industries at nature's expense.Yet his unbridled contempt for contemporary culture, mankind, and mechanistic life is leavened by his wit, as when he refers to himself not as an atheist but an \\"earthiest.\\" And when he cautions an uncomprehending elderly tourist on the dangers of television: a vacuum tube capable of sucking out her brain.Though Abbey rises through these pages rough-edged, misanthropic, vitriolic, or vulgar, we never forget that we are in the company of an intelligent, educated writer, Stanford-trained and invoking Shakespeare, T.S. Eliot, Lawrence (both of them), Balzac, and Hegel. But we enjoy his company nonetheless, for his reverence for nature and wilderness, for his risking his life (which he almost loses on a few occasions) in his worship of it, for his humanity and honesty. And for the lessons he teaches us and the poignant journeys he invites us on--like his raft trip down Glen Canyon, now lost to view thanks to the damming of the Colorado.Along the way he finds God--or some facsimile--in the eternal resiliency of the desert: \\"Let men in their madness blast every city on earth into black rubble and envelope the entire planet in a cloud of lethal gas--the canyons and hills, the springs and rocks will still be here, the sunlight will filter through, water will form and warmth shall be upon the land and after sufficient time, no matter how long, somewhere, living things will emerge and join and stand once again, this time perhaps to take a different and better course.\\"Such is optimism Abbey-style. Yet the reader senses our species' tenacity and combativeness in Abbey's informed fierceness, and leaves his desert reassured and reverent."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"This book is ok, but not great!

Several of the stories are startling and heartbreaking--the moon-eyed horse, the deadman in grand gulch come to mind.

This is a lot more than just an argument that we should protect our wilderness, although it is easily that. Rather, I found it to be a profound guide on how to think and act in general, about pretty much everything, everywhere.This is one of the greatest books of the American twentieth century, a true classic, and everyone pondering how to think about and evaluate everything these days could surely benefit by reading it carefully."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"An early environmentalist even before the term came into use.

His humor and wit contrast nicely with his love of the desert. DESERT SOLITAIRE allows the reader to drift into a much simpler, slower life for a short time.

I loved his description of the desert and how it used to be. Being from Utah, I have visited the sites many times and it's cool to compare the differences.

However, there were those gopher snakes . . ."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"For anyone who has enjoyed or hopes to enjoy the desert it is a must read. Before and after your visits to the desert.

I bought this hardcover edition for my library after I gave away my paperback to a friend who will be vacationing this summer in some of the parks mentioned in the book."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"Edward Abbey has become an icon of the American environmentalist movement. He left the green rolling hills of Western Pennsylvania, graduated from the University of New Mexico, and felt most at home in the American Southwest. Hum! Desert Solitaire, published in 1968, is his most famous work. It is an espousal of an anti-\\"developmental\\" creed; the setting is his one year's employment at Arches National Monument in Utah as a park ranger. He later went on to writeThe Monkey Wrench Gang (P.S.)no doubt this book is one of the main reasons you have to go through a metal detector and have your bags searched if you visit Glen Canyon Dam. The main character in the MWG is George Washington Hayduke, who is modeled on the very real life, Doug Peacock, a long-time friend and associate of Abbey, and if you want Peacock's side of the story, I highly recommend \\"Walking It Off.\\"When Abbey is \\"on\\", he is definitely on, and few could write so evocatively of the desert areas of the Southwest, with the implicit plea to: \\"let's just let things be.\\" Try: \\"The fire. The odor of burning juniper is the sweetest fragrance on the face of the earth, in my honest judgment; I doubt if all the smoking censers of Dante's paradise could equal it. One breath of juniper smoke, like the perfume of sagebrush after rain, evokes in magical catalysis, like certain music, the space and light and clarity and piercing strangeness of the American West. Long may it burn.\\" Abbey is erudite, and has read of the deserts of the world. How many others have read the works of a fellow curmudgeon, C. M. Doughty, Travels in Arabia Deserta? (p 239). How many others would reference the atonal work of Schoenberg?: \\"...although both Schoenberg and Krenek lived part of their lives in the Southwest, their music comes closer than any other I know to representing the apartness, the otherness, the strangeness of the desert\\" (p 255).But it is his social commentary, and yes, conscious, that is the real cornerstone of his fame. Consider: \\"They cannot see that growth for the sake of growth is a cancerous madness, that Phoenix and Albuquerque will not be better cities to live in when their populations are doubled again and again. They would never understand that an economic system which can only expand or expire must be false to all that is human.\\" And he goes to make the harsh prediction that these latter-day seven cities of Cibola will likewise be abandoned and buried, as were their predecessors. Succinct expressions of the fate of the American Indians are tied to the dispossessed and lumen-proletariat of the world: \\"...or the tarpaper villages of Gallup, Flagstaff and Shiprock, it's the same the world over--one big wretched gamily sequestered in sullen desperation, pawed over by social workers, kicked around by the cops and prayed over by the missionaries.\\"Others have compared Abbey, or at least his vision, to Thoreau, Muir, Leopold, and other environmentalist pioneers. I can't. Both Peacock and the solid biography of Abbey by James Bishop,Epitaph For A Desert Anarchist: The Life And Legacy Of Edward Abbey,\\" describe his numerous flaws; a strong strain of misanthropy being one of them. You don't love nature more but heaping abuse on the humans who have, all too many times, abused it in turn. But I didn't have to rely on the opinions of others to reach this conclusion, it is right there in this book: picking up the stone, and killing the rabbit, not for food, but just to see what it is like. Why, oh why? And could one imagine any of the other three at the beginning of this paragraph doing same.It is a fundamental problem for readers, and those who want to consider espousing the ideas of an individual, be that person Jean Paul Sartre, William Faulkner, Graham Greene, Robert Graves or so many others. When the person has \\"feet of clay,\\" and the flaws are even evident in his/her writings, should not a person dock at least one star for the flaws, despite the fame?"},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"If you want to read a truly incredible book about the nature of nature, this is the book. Abbey's writing is superb and his observations on our interactions with wilderness are as profound as anything ever written."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"I found this book very enjoyable. Mr. Abbey was a master of words, painting word pictures of the beautiful desert, and his experiences in the Utah red land desert both as a park ranger in the Arches monuments park before the area was flooded for a man-made lake...and as a \\"cowboy\\" working rounding up cattle in the Utah canyons. I found Abbey's words and stories reminded me very much of John Graves book \\"Goodbye to a River\\" about the Brazos River in Texas, and somewhat of H.D. Thoreau's work. Abbey looks a both human life, death, and the eternity and stability of the natural world and how insigificant we all are in the big picture. His writing is at times funny, or sad, or thoughtful and melancholy. I highly recommend this book to people who love thoughtful books about the natural world."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"I purchased this book because David Quammen referenced it in one of his books, and I really enjoy Quammen's books. It is listed on various websites and in some magazines as a \\"Nature Classic\\".I have visited and hiked the deserts and canyon in Utah and northern Arizona. That allowed me to feel a lot of what Abbey writes about. It is a special place. I wish I could go back and see Arches National Park when Abbey was there. (It was Arches National Monument at the time of his stay there.)While there are some controversial things in this book, and while I don't agree with everything Abbey writes, I have to say that I really hated to come to the end of this book. Besides the stories about nature, Abbey also writes about some of the human activities in this area.I think I understand why people call this a landmark book. The environmental movement was just starting in the sixties. (Does anyone else remember the green Ecology symbol?)"},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"This is my favorite book. I consider Abbey to be a hippie environmentalist--a sort of modern day Thoreau. The book will suck you in and you'll be wishing you could run off to Moab and have a beer with Abbey."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"In this book Abbey said: \\"... most of what I write about in this book is already gone or going under fast. This is not a travel guide but an elegy. A memorial. You're holding a tombstone in your hands. A bloody rock.\\" Abbey is not demon-possessed to behave so well as Thoreau, he is more opinionated and his opinions can be pretty pungent and prickly (for example, see \\"Polemic: Industrial Tourism and The National Parks\\").However, being opinionated does not make a good book. Abbey's writing is surprisingly polished. The slick rocks, the canyon lands, the sagebrush and cacti all have a authentic texture in them. You can smell the desert dust in this book. Abbey is not called \\"Thoreau of the American West\\" for nothing. I think under Abbey's rough shell, he actually had a sensitive heart; he just enjoyed the natural world more than the human one. It is a good thing that he turned some of his attentions to writing, and we are left with some of the best nature writings since Thoreau.I actually read this book before I read Walden. In fact for me this is the book that started my interest in reading nature and conservation, after I took a trip to Grand Canyon, Bryce, Zion, Canyonlands and, of course, Arches National Park. I have read a few more of Abbey's books since but none have had the impact of this one. I also read in one of those that in his later years he wasn't very satisfied with Desert Solitaire because he was still too \\"well-behaved\\". Yet, for me, this is the book that defines him and it achieves the perfect balance between narratives of nature and discourse of opinions. Now I keep a copy by my bedside and if I ever get strangled on an island, I will carry this book and Walden with me."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"Air? Abbey thinks it is so fresh it makes you hungry for breakfast.Night? Abbey likes to walk without a flashlight at night. That way his senses reach out in all directions instead of fixing upon the glow of light in front of him.Mice? Abbey shares his housetrailer with a number of mice. They don't disturb him and are welcome to the crumbs he drops on the floor. His only reservation is that they attract rattlesnakes.Rattlesnakes? One morning Abbey is sitting on his doorstep sipping coffee. Looking down between his feet, he spots a rattler. It's only a couple of inches from his heels. It's not the diamondback known by its Latin name crotalus atrox. Abbey won't blast it with his .45. Arches National Monument is meant to be a haven for animals and he believes in that idea. In a deft move Abbey swings his feet up and inside the doorway of his trailer. The rattler hisses. Abbey decides to get his boots on and drives the snake away from the trailer with a spade. You better stay away, cousin, Abbey warns.A week later the rattler is back. Abbey decides that he needs to trap the mice so that the rattler won't be attracted to them. But just before he does that, he comes upon a gopher snake or bull snake, a snake with a reputation of being an enemy of rattlesnakes. Abbey traps the gopher snake and brings it back to the housetrailer.Abbey and the gopher snake get along well. During the day, the snake stays curled up near the heater. At night, the snake goes out and takes care of business. The snake lets Abbey handle him. The snake wraps himself around Abbey's waist and pokes his head out of Abbey's shirt from time to time... much to the amusement of the tourists.After a time, the snake disappears. Then a month later the snake reappears along with what Abbey thinks is a female snake. The two are involved in a ritualistic dance. Abbey thinks of himself as a shameless voyeur as he watches. Like many voyeurs, Abbey is \\"noticed\\" by the lovers and they leave.All men are brothers, observes Abbey. Is the \\"evolutionary line from protozoan to Spinoza any less certain?\\" All living creatures on the Earth are kindred whether predator or prey. This is just one of the meditations of Edward Abbey in _Desert Solitaire_."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"I just finished my 6th reading of this book (having purchased it several times since people never return it). This book gets better with age and is amazingly relevant for being 30+ years old.

It made me feel like I was there in the desert with him."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"This is one of only four or five books that I can say truly impacted my life. Many years ago my boss saw me reading \\"The Monkey Wrench Gang\\" (which did not significantly impress me). He suggested \\"Desert Solitaire\\" as a much better example of Edward Abbey's work. I took his recommendation seriously, and have been thankful to him ever since.Having grown up in Idaho I had done a fair amount of backpacking in the mountains and forests, and I was somewhat of an outdoor enthusiast at the time. But the thought of recreating in the desert never held much allure to me--until I read this book. Now I make at least a couple of backpacking/camping trips per year into the desert. I still love the mountains, lakes, rivers, and forests, but I now know that the deserts are also full of wonder.My favorite chapter told about Abbey's trip to Havasu Creek and Falls. While reading about it I remember saying to myself, \\"There can't possibly really be a place like this\\". I determined that I would find out if such a place actually existed and if it was as wonderful as Abbey described it. A few years ago I made the trip to Havasu Falls, and I found that the author's description of the place was perfect.Not only did this book help me to appreciate the desert for what it is, it taught me to appreciate non-fiction writing in general and nature writing in particular--things I thought I did not care for previously. I highly recommend this book to anyone who has an appreciation for the outdoors."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"I first read this book while spending a solitary winter in the Sawtooth Mountains of Idaho. I cannot imagine a better companion.Abbey had a spiritual connection to landscape that is both intoxicating and addictive, and his plainspoken narrative connects the reader to the depth of his desert experience in an uncommon way. But perhaps the most moving aspect of Desert Solitaire (indeed, all of Abbey's writing) is that the reader, by associating himself with the book, is called to action. This is not a book, nor is this an author, for the passive observer. Someone who wants a nice tale of living in the desert ought to look elsewhere. For anyone who's restless and ready to confront his or her spirit in a purposeful way, inspiration awaits!"},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"This book is the one that got me started going out West over a quarter century ago. I've never regretted it and read the book about every other year along with \\"Slickrock\\", (another Abbey masterpiece), for old times' sake.Ed Abbey always maintained he wrote to eat. He would have scoffed at allegations that his first book was a brilliant, evocative, militant, sentimental, enormously literate, invitation to help preserve what was left, (even though it is). Lake Foul, behind Glen Canyon Damn, broke his heart, but he remained a vibrant influence for free thinking until his death. This book, though it was his first, is still his best memorial. If you don't read it, it is your loss.There may be people who won't like it because it presents a viewpoint too easily eschewed in today's Enron-ethic climate. They are the ones who should read it most."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"Written by Abbey when he was a park ranger at Arches Monument before it became a National Park, &quot;Dessert Solitaire&quot; is extraordinary. Only a handful of wilderness writers can create multiple visions of natural beauty without becoming maudlin or repetitive. Muir and Leopold come to mine as two who succeed but Abbey speaks in a more familiar voice. His task of bringing life and wonder to a dessert is even more challenging but the book strikes a chord not easily ignored. &quot;A weird, lovely, fantastic object out of nature like Delicate Arch has the curious ability to remind us - like rock and sunlight and wind and wilderness - that out there is a different world, older and greater and deeper by far than ours... For a little while we are again able to see, as the children see, a world of marvels. For a few moments we discover that nothing can be taken for granted, for if this ring of stone is marvelous then all which shaped it is marvelous, and our journey here on earth, able to see and touch and hear in the midst of tangible and mysterious things-in-themselves, is the most strange and daring of all adventures.&quot; Reading that, I had to see it for myself. The stone and sand of Arches is as wondrous, as ancient and as powerful as Abbey promised."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"This book should be required reading for everyone. By far, this is one of my favorite books. There's alot to learn from this book. Abbey's insights into Industrial Tourism are great. His descriptions of locales stir the imagination. His radical propositon of new park rules make perfect sense. This is a book the folks in charge of our National Parks should be forced to read."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"When reading DESERT SOLITAIRE, it's easy (and judging from many of the reviews on this page, rather common) to wander off into the side canyon of one's personal perception of Ed Abbey's personality, and before long, find yourself keeled over from the heat. Not a very pretty way to go, especially if it means you've ultimately missed the point and real beauty of this eloquant love letter to Utah's Canyonlands.Abbey captures the true splendor of the desert here, while at the same time speaking with both frankness and conviction of what he saw as the coming flash flood of the land's misuse. His chapter 'Down the River' illustrates this dual purpose of the book perhaps better than any other. Not only does it disarmingly woo the reader, bringing out one's deepest, most romantic feelings of wanderlust, but at the same time slaps the reader awake with the fact that the story's perfect setting is now lost to all men for all times.I was lucky enough to have (sort of) know Ed Abbey nearly 20 years ago. He taught a class in short-story writing I took at the University of Arizona. And while I didn't see eye to eye with him on all his political views or agree with him on his assesment of my papers, I can tell you the man got a lot of pleasure from just living his life and a big chuckle from getting at people's goat. Judging from the varied opinions below, DESERT SOLITAIRE seems to have pulled them both off."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"If you ever wanted to know why some of us love the desert, you may get an impression if you can step into this book. Bring plenty of water."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"This is my third reading of this book and because I visited Arches National Park in October 2012 it especially relevant and excellent reading. I have always been a fan of Edward Abbey and his irreverence and support of our beautiful country.I"},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"Bitter, subversive, and entertaining, Edward Abbey creates a masterpiece. Abbey's focus on the slip-rock country of Utah assigns a new valuation to this seemingly useless desert. Delving into the depths of canyons and gorges, Abbey unveils a beautiful landscape, encroached on by the likes of tourists and engineers building dams."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"Edward Abbey's DESERT SOLITAIRE belongs on the shortest of several short lists of 20th century classics, whether we are talking of classic literature of the American West, nature writing, or environmentalism.Why is this such a brilliant book? It isn't the originality of ideas. Other writers-Aldo Leopold, Wallace Stegner, Bernard DeVoto, Mary Austin-had already articulated many of Abbey's central ideas either about nature or about Western policy. Bernard DeVoto was an innovator; Abbey is not. Nor is Abbey's anger and fury at exploiters and defilers unique: DeVoto was just as irate and just as incapable of pulling his punches. Nor is it Abbey's overall vision that makes his book so compelling. Again, both DeVoto and Stegner-and especially DeVoto-evidenced a broader and more systematic understanding of the broader issues confronting the West. None of this is accidental. DeVoto exerted a major influence on Stegner, and Stegner taught Abbey in the Stanford University Creative Writing Program.What makes DESERT SOLITAIRE so marvelous is the almost tactile love and passion Abbey displays for the Desert Southwest. Over and over Abbey summons up specific places, particular mountains, individual landscapes. Although he can write about the desert in general, he more frequently writes about particular spots in Arches National Park and the surrounding environs that help explain his attachment to the West. He is the literary equivalent, in his more somber, reflective moments, of Eliot Porter and Ansel Adams. As a result, what one recalls upon remembering DESERT SOLITAIRE is not words so much as a collection of images.Structurally, the book only resembles a memoir of his time working as a park ranger in the Arches National Park. The book makes it seems as if he worked there only one year, when in fact he worked there two. Furthermore, even what appears as a single year fails to account for all the content of the book. He uses, rather, the fiction of a single season as a framework upon which to hang tales, reflections, and rants. This intermixing of narrative with asides gives the book a richness of texture it might not otherwise possess. The narrative of his time as a ranger gives the book much of it structure, but the rants and sidetracking provides it with much of its content.I hate to write something as trite as this being an absolutely essential book for anyone remotely interested in the subjects it touches upon, but such is the case. Abbey wrote many other nonfiction works and novels. All are interesting, several of them quite good, but DESERT SOLITAIRE is easily his greatest. It truly is a classic."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"&quot;I would rather kill a man than a snake,&quot; wrote Edward Abbey, and I suspect he even meant it. That sentence summed up, for me, this book: it is filled with Abbey's love of the wild desert and its inhabitants and his contempt for modernity and its inhabitants. I think Abbey was one of the early voices in modern environmentalism, and this is a classic book in that field. I appreciate his desert and his writing; even if you are not an environmentalist nor a lover of the desert, you may see why people are if you read this. At any rate, his deep naturalist reflections deserve consideration in our fast-food, internet, climate-controlled, sanitized and artificial age."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"Edward Abbey didn't like to be known as a nature writer (he was far too proud of his fiction), but after reading this book I would have to say he is among the best. Before I read this book, I had never even considered traveling to the Southwest, this book changed that, and the way I look at nature forever. Abbey has rightfully been called the Thoreau of the American West, this book more than any other shows us why. In Desert Solitaire Abbey is at his best, doing for the Southwest what Thoreau did for Concord and Walden.One of the great strenghts of this book is the way Abbey weaves together such a wide array of subject matter, which illustrates the seemingly endless variety of experience, in what is thought by many to be an inhospitable wasteland. In a collection of breif chapters Abbey touches on everthing from the incredible beauty of forgotton canyons, the Southwest's past inhabitants, a feral horse, the Colorado river, the perils of industrial tourism, and the story of a man who may have came to die at the edge of a cliff.In this book you get a great sampling of everything Abbey has to offer, from his stinging wit and dark humor, rage and sadness concerning the destruction of nature, and finally to hope. Edward Abbey has accomplished on the printed page, what Ansel Adams' photography has done for the Southwest. And yes, both immortalize a time and a place that are being destroyed forever, little by little, day by day, but leaving for us a sad and yet wonderful record of what used to be, and why what is left is worth saving. Desert Solitaire is both a celebration and a lamentation for the disappearing landscapes, and hidden canyons that Abbey chose as his own paradise, and if you read this book it may become yours too. Like Abbey's says get out of your cars and crawl in the sand, and EXPERIENCE what nature has to offer, you might just be surprised at what you find."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"Edward Abbey is a contradiction. A poet when describing the wonders of the desert and the joys of solitude; then he becomes a strident critic of his fellow man if they have the audacity to disagree with him. There is a definite will and intelligence driving the prose, but it is partially spoiled by the rants that Abbey goes on. The book has a split personality; celebrating the wilderness, but using a voice that often becomes so disagreeable that you might want to take asphalt to the park yourself. Finally though the poet wins out and you go along for the ride. I try to think of this book as rafting down the river, enjoying the wonders and trying to avoid the jagged rocks. A little white water is fine; just don't hold me underwater for hours at a time."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"While in the main I loved this book, Abbey's hypocritical nature had me fuming at times. He makes fun of tourists for scratching their names in sandstone (rightfully), but then goes ahead and carves his name in trees. He makes fun of tourists for littering (rightfully), and a few chapters later describes rolling a tire into the Grand Canyon (nearly missing a mule train!). The book is riddled with other such examples. The thing is: I'm not sure he even recognized these glaring contridictions. But aside from not really liking HIM, I loved the BOOK... the last chapter left me weeping..."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"To begin, I loved parts of _Desert Solataire_. Abbey seemed to be warbling between humility, confusion, and utter, unabashed egotism. This is charming, because it is honest, and one can't fault someone for being honest. Also, the man actually did something about his frustration, which is more than can be said for the lot of us.Moreover, there were sections of the book that shocked me with their incredible, heartbreaking beauty and insight. For example, the chapter \\"The Moon-Eyed Horse\\": the writing in that chapter is utterly original and amazing in the complexity it demonstrates regarding both the narrator and the nature of the horse's character - and what it reveals and changes about Abbey.Abbey is at his best when he gets out of the way and describes how he sees nature, rather than his own mind. Abbey says at one point that when a person goes into the wilderness he or she is at risk of either seeing merely his or her self in it, or just the opposite, seeing nothing but an opposite image of oneself.This made me wonder about Abbey's exact philosophical position on his own place in nature; furthermore, the passage - in the chapter entitled \\"Episodes and Visions\\" - in which Abbey attempts to wax philosophical about civilization and culture was completely lost on me. Maybe it's because I've read too much Heidegger to think that Abbey really understands Heidegger, or maybe it's because I am confused.I am confused because it seems as if Abbey upholds civilization as superior to culture, and yet does he not admire the American Indian tribal culture that he encounters in the park? How does he even define \\"culture\\"? If the U.K. and the United States are merely examples of cultures, then is civilization merely the mark of individuals that Abbey likes? I don't think I'm suffering from a lapse in intelligence; apparently, not a few people have agreed with my bafflement, including the \\"New York literary establishment,\\" according to Susan Zakin in _Coyotes and Town Dogs_.But - and it's a big but - there were certainly moments in which I felt his writing shone. And _Desert Solitaire_ was certainly the book that earned him well-deserved accolades. It made me want to drive to Utah and camp out under the stars, with nothing but the ground beneath me and the night around me, as Abbey would say. I felt a place in my bones when Abbey wrote about what he loved. The thing I can't take is diatribe and clich&eacute; - or, as writers politely put it, \\"received text.\\"Received text unfortunately found its way into _Desert Solitaire_ when Abbey decided to wax egotistical about industrial tourism and his facetious suggestions for a blazing, light bulb ridden sign over the entrance to the park. In those places, the writing's not just irritating, it's not original. Anyone can go off about how stupid mass culture is and how people should change their couch potato, gas guzzling ways, but if you're going to include it in a book, it should fit seamlessly into the design. And those parts, for me, stuck out like a sore thumb.In spite of all his shortcomings as a \\"literary\\" writer, Abbey is endearingly human, and that seems to have been a crucial and necessary part of his character. In the end, I remain torn, and I feel sympathy for those who want to change the world and put themselves at risk for what they believe in. But I also firmly believe that, unless we respect and try to communicate with the person sitting across from us who we are opposed to, nothing will ever get done."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"I just ordered Desert Solitaire for my dear friend Joel Stone after having a great conversation with him about his trip to Utah to visit his wife's family. It has been over twenty years since I read the book, back when I was living in Utah, teaching at East High School in Salt Lake City and going to the desert every chance I had. Abbey brings the desert to life like no other author I have read. In fact, he is the one writer who portrayed the desert as a real living scene. When I go back and read passages from Solitaire, it is like I am back in the desert trudging through the sand between some fins or gazing across the vistas watching the waves of heat undulate. Abbey's accomplishment in this book is his focus on the minute details of the desert and how it feels to be there. His description of how the whole world comes to a stop in the middle of the day when the heat hits hard is right on target. My wife and I and our oldest daughter Margo were camped in the Arches in July and had to seek refuge from the heat by climbing up between two fins and simply sit there on the slightly damp sand and spend the afternoon reading and playing games. There was a cool, damp breeze coming down between the fins less than a foot thick off the ground. This is the kind of experience that Abbey can bring to you with his writing and which gets you to the point where you want to go out and strap on the roof rack and head for the desert just to feel the heat and watch the eagles and vultures circle overheat. His treatment of the local human culture of Moab in his early desert days is outstanding. The characters are bigger than life, although essentially none of them were famous people. You can smell their sweat and hear their curses and feel the bumps as you ride around with them in their old pickups and jeeps. And you can hear the curses from Abbey himself as he eloquently and graphically described that which was happening to the desert, its ecology and its way of life decades ago. He seems quiet and sensitive but lashes out with anger or hatred at the endangerment he sees. This guy is not nice, accepting and philosophical. He is not like an environmentalist, but more like a mean old rattlesnake lying under a bush waiting for somebody to mess with his desert. Abbey's vision of that which might happen to the desert has, to a great extent, come to pass. Yet, he might be happy if he could know that vast tracts of land have been set aside and are less threatened, spoiled and polluted than back when he was there and mining and ranching were in their heyday. Whenever you read this book, it will still help you form a relationship with the desert in your time and your place and give you an awareness of its fragility and beauty and what must be done from here on. The scene has changed a lot, the decades have gone by, the Westerner Grill has closed, but the desert and Abbey's insightful perceptions of it remain the constant in whole equation. Reading this book takes you to a new, exciting, billion-year-old place. Even decades later."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"Edward Abbey's Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness, is an autobiographical account of Abbey's stint working as a park ranger at Arches National Monument in Utah. At once this book is philosophical and poetic, yet at the same time, sardonic and polemical. Although the author would probably scowl at such pigeonholing, this book is also a significant environmental statement, as well as being a great piece of literature. In Desert Solitaire, Abbey identifies and adeptly defines a common frustration shared by many writers; the annoyance of not being able to adequately express one's self through the medium of words. He states, \\"You cannot get the desert into a book any more than a fisherman can haul up the sea with his nets. Not imitation but evocation has been the goal.\\" However, even through his self-styled \\"evocation\\", he successfully and intimately enfolds his readers within his unique experience. A reluctant naturalist, Abbey blames the human inability to discern the true meaning of nature, on a tendency to always project our own expectations on the natural world. These are tendencies that exasperate him, and yet when he does achieve a near-true communion, as he describes in his experiences in isolation in Havasu Creek, he finds the encounter more disturbing than ecstatic. He describes losing the power to distinguish between himself and the natural world, creating in him a fear that his sense of self was \\"ebbing away.\\" In addition, throughout his career as a writer, Abbey refused the label \\"environmentalist.\\" Nevertheless, his books are useful instruments with which to measure our progress, or lack of progress as the case may be, in our relationship to our natural environment. In this book's chapter entitled, \\"Industrial Tourism and the National Parks\\", he lays out his philosophy that \\"growth for growth's sake is the ideology of the cancer cell.\\" Looking today at the corruption of the wilderness areas that he warned readers about three and four decades ago, it is plain to see how correct he was in his estimation and condemnation of policies pertaining to our National Parks. Whether he admitted it or not, Abbey set a tone of uncompromising environmental advocacy. In looking at Edward Abbey, the reader is also confronted by contradiction. He passionately argues for the importance of untamed wilderness and against the danger of industrial tourism. He declares he would rather kill a human than a snake, and then casually bops a rabbit on the head with a rock, just to see what his own reaction will be. He beguiles us with his description of Arches, and then chides us for wanting to go there. These passionate paradoxes are the tools he uses most effectively to lure us away from our complacency. Most importantly, Abbey's work his work serves as an inspiration to new generations of Western writers and historians, making us realize that wilderness really is a necessary ingredient of civilization."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"I've lived in the desert southwest for almost 30 years and have read many books about the area. Surprisingly, I never read one of Abbey's books until now. I guess something else always appealed to me more on the bookstore shelves.As many reviewers have pointed out, Abbey captures the true feeling that one gets when surrounded by the beauty of the desert. It's true that there are other books out there that have also achieved this. What made this book special for me were the author's writing skills. He is truly a gifted writer and knows how to use language. This book is a real pleasure to read.As I read the book I tried to glean a little about the man - Edward Abbey. As a resident of the Sonoran Desert, his name comes up frequently when environmental champions are listed. He is a man that truly believes that the deserts, and all wilderness areas for that matter, are sacred. They are areas to be preserved and enjoyed -- untouched, whenever possible, by the hand of man. What surprised me about this book is that Abbey describes how he engaged in some activities that seem to contradict this philosophy. A few that come to mind: Smashing a rabbit's head in with a rock, not for food, but just to see if he can. Killing a rattlesnake with a shovel just because it lives around his trailer and he is afraid that someday it \\"might\\" bite him. Recalling a large brush fire that he accidentally set in a wilderness area, not with remorse, but with humor. Rolling an old tire off the rim of a pristine part of the Grand Canyon just so he could watch it bounce of off the canyon walls (and leaving it there as trash on the canyon floor). He does not seem ashamed of any of these actions. However, I'm sure that if he saw one of the \\"automobile tourists\\" that he seems to loathe do any of these things that he would go on an irate tirade. However, although I found these types of things to be a little hypocritical, I respect Abbey candidness - other authors would have just left these transgressions out.This is a wonderful book and should be on the bookshelf of anyone that enjoys nature. If you live in the desert - read this book - you will love it. Even if you a thousand miles away from a desert - read this book - you will love it. Abbey takes you on a journey to a special place that you will enjoy immensely."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"Edward Abbey was an outspoken wilderness advocate, and his nonfiction writing falls somewhere between Thoreau and Hunter Thompson. &quot;Desert Solitaire&quot; is classic Abbey, written in the latter 1960s, when he was about 30, and it recounts a handful of summers spent ten years earlier in and around Arches National Monument in southeastern Utah. Here he was a park ranger, when the park was still mostly undeveloped. Living in a small trailer, keeping an eye on the campers and tourists, he mostly relishes the quiet, beauty, and indifference of the desert under its hot sun.The book begins with his arrival in April and concludes with his departure at season's end in September. In between are chapters devoted to descriptions of his rambles across the terrain, helping a local cattleman round up cows in the side canyons, trying to capture a one-eyed feral horse, camping on a 13,000-foot local mountain, hiking with a friend into an uncharted wilderness call the Maze, and retrieving the body of a dead tourist. There's also a dark story concerning the unfortunate fate of some uranium prospectors. The longest chapter is a rapturous account of a week spent rafting down the Colorado River, he and a friend among the last to see the canyons about to be inundated by the Glen Canyon Dam and the creation of Lake Powell.Along the way, there are ruminations on the meaning of it all and diatribes against urbanization, intrusive government, the tourist industry, and the destruction of wilderness. The word &quot;solitaire&quot; in the title is an apt choice, as much of the time Abbey is alone, thinking his thoughts and observing this desert world, its plants and wild life, geological formations, and the big sky with its turns of weather. Even when paired up with a companion, he is often off alone, on a walkabout of his own, like as not shedding his clothes.His thoughts, meanwhile, are informed by wide reading in philosophy, history, natural sciences, and literature. As a writer, he's frequently quotable: &quot;Where there is no joy there can be no courage; and without courage all other virtues are useless.&quot; &quot;It's a great country: you can say whatever you like so long as it is strictly true -- nobody will ever take you seriously.&quot;The vistas he describes so eloquently are not hard to picture in the imagination, but I recommend an accompanying volume of photography, such as Eliot Porter's &quot;The Place No One Knew: Glen Canyon on the Colorado.&quot; Unless you're familiar with borage, paintbrush, globemallow, and dozens of other desert species, a picture guidebook to the flora of the region would also be helpful. I thoroughly enjoyed Abbey's book, shared the excitement of his adventures, found his cranky, ornery, sometimes self-indulgent perspective refreshing, and felt saddened by the end-of-season farewell with which it closes. In any list of nonfiction books about the West, it should be near the top."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"\\"There are mountain men, there are men of the sea, and there are desert rats. I am a desert rat.\\" - Edward Abbey in DESERT SOLITAIREI'm not sure if I've ever read anything else by Edward Abbey. Perhaps The Monkey Wrench Gang in the rebellious mid-1970s. Memory fails. But in reading DESERT SOLITAIRE, I can see why he was - he died in 1989 - so controversial. A naturalist and rugged individualist, he would be brazenly politically incorrect by today's standards while perhaps not easily categorized as either left or right-wing. I think I'm a huge fan already.Centered around a six-month stint he did as the lone, resident park ranger in Utah's Arches National Monument - now Arches National Park - in 1958, DESERT SOLITAIRE is Edward Abbey's brilliant tribute to the flora, fauna and geology of the desert Southwest in general and southeastern Utah in particular. For the reader with an active mind's eye, Abbey is at his best when he describes the immediate environs around his Arches trailer residence, his boat trip down the Colorado River through Glen Canyon (before the dam was built), his ascent of Mount Tukuhnikavits, and his descent into The Maze area of what is now Canyonlands National Park.Much of the controversy surrounding Abbey most certainly emanated from his scathing opinions of the National Park Service, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, and what he terms \\"Industrial Tourism\\", that insidiously encroaching approach that would have all wilderness areas paved over and built-up to serve hordes of automobile-enclosed tourists whose idea of experiencing the landscape is to drive through in air-conditioned comfort. Indeed, Edward thought the national parks should be accessible only to those who could walk in or ride in on bicycle or mule from huge car lots at the parks' boundaries. Sometimes, his views verge on callous:\\"Children too small to ride bicycles and too heavy to be borne on their parents' backs need only wait a few years ... The aged merit even less sympathy: after all they had the chance to see the country when it was still relatively unspoiled. However, we'll stretch a point for those too old or too sickly to mount a bicycle and let them ride the shuttle buses.\\"(Some that arrive in cars should stay in them. Hiking in the Grand Canyon both last March and last September, my wife and I encountered tourists waltzing down the Bright Angel Trail with Plateau Point - 6.1 miles from the rim - or the Colorado River - 7.7 miles from the rim - as their intended round trip (!) destination without carrying so much as a thimbleful of water. Luckily, there are rangers at key points to turn such fools back. You know, perhaps some selective culling of the species wouldn't hurt; I think Abbey might have agreed.)His outrage concerning the construction of the Glen Canyon Dam knows no bounds:\\"No wonder the Authorities are so anxious to smother the wilderness under asphalt and reservoirs. They know what they're doing; their lives depend on it, and all their rotten institutions. Play safe. Ski only in clockwise direction. Let's all have fun together.\\"And his description of the doomed Glen Canyon environment approaches the reverential:\\"High above our heads the owls hoot under the lost moon. A predawn wind comes sifting and sighing through the cottonwood trees; the sound of their dry, papery leaves is like the murmur of distant water, or like the whispering of ghosts in an ancient, sacrosanct, condemned cathedral.\\"Abbey's critics made much of his rejection of anthropocentrism, which is evident within the pages of DESERT SOLITAIRE:\\"We need coyotes more than we need, let us say, more people, of whom we already have an extravagant surplus, or more domesticated dogs, which in all fairness could and should be ground up into hamburger and used as emergency coyote food, to raise their spirits and perhaps improve the tenor of their predawn howling.\\"Happily, I'm a cat lover.However, most of the book's narrative is descriptive rather than philosophic and, at times, becomes all too real as when he tells of the desert search for a lost hiker and his own near-death experience when apparently stranded halfway down an isolated canyon wall beyond any hope of rescue.DESERT SOLITAIRE is the best book I've read all summer, and perhaps all year. I intend to acquire and read more of the author's stuff."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"I loved this book and stayed up nights under the desert stars reading Abbey's writting that brought the desert to life. His appreciation for the wilderness fueled by the reflection of civilization gives the narrative depth. His rants of gapers and the great industry of being civilized are often humerous but sometimes turn mean. This book made me laught, cry, think, and act. A great book to take along for a road trip if you plan to get lost and leave the car at the end of the road to see where your feet take you."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"It's been almost 40 years since Desert Solitaire hit the bookshelves; and perhaps it is more appropriate reading now than it was in 1968; certainly \\"Industrial Tourism\\" has come to pass.This book is not gibberish from some \\"eco-hermit\\", whatever that is. Yes, old Cactus Ed is cranky and contradictory, full of hyperbole at times. This is his stamp as a prose-poet and unsurpassed storyteller; if you don't get this, you may be reading the wrong books.Abbey's iconoclastic philosophy of conservation over human \\"progress\\" has rendered Desert Solitaire as a true environmental classic. This book is most likely sitting on many home bookshelves between The Mountains of California and A Sand Country Almanac.Ed Abbey was well steeped in philosophy and literature; when he muses on the civilization vs. culture subject, you can see the meld of anarchism and german existentialism occuring. His impassioned rants reflect his love of the solitary places - landscapes unscathed by that \\"turbo-monkey\\" known as man. The humor is as dry and sharp as the the landscapes he describes: episodes with his pet gopher snake; the search for a dead tourist; and the idiocies of The National Park Service.Like many authors, Abbey's non-fictional writing outshines his fictional stuff. Hands down, Desert Solitaire is his finest work: Rough, Tough, and Combative. This classic is a must read if you are of the \\"Resist much, Obey little\\" mindset.

I was never aware of the inherent beauty of emptiness, the fullness of the barren landscape, and the passion that can be aroused by areas others reject as hostile and useless. For me, this book was pivotal in that it made me seek other books by Abbey as well as Stegner, Bass, Zwinger, McPhee, Dillard, and others whose senses and intellect are focused on God's creation.When I heard of Abbey's death almost a decade ago, I realized that a light had gone out - but on reflection, I realize he turned on many other lights before he left."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"I first read this book years ago when I was in college.

I read this book afterwards and was captivated by every word Abbey wrote. That being said, I have spoken with other people who have never been to the Moab area who just couldn't get into the book. I guess maybe it takes a deep love of the environment and appreciation of the beauty of the desert to really understand this book.

Desert Solitaire is part memoir, politics, opinion, beauty, myth, journal, eulogy, ravaging accusation of modern society, and general ramblings on the Southwest. There is very little structure, except that the book opens with Abbey entering Arches in the spring as a ranger, and ends with him leaving in the fall. He touches almost every subject under the desert sun.

Abbey's tranquil descriptionsof the beautiful yet harsh red rock environment of what was then Arches National Monument is the quintessential narrative of this lovely desert landscape.

But there is still too much to see and marvel at, the world very much alive in the bright light and wind, exultant with the fever of spring, the delight of morning. Strolling on, it seems to me that the strangeness and wonder of existence are emphasized here, in the desert, by the comparative sparsity of the flora and fauna: life not crowded upon life as in other places, but scattered abroad in spareness and simplicity, with a generous gift of space for each herb and bush and tree, each stem of grass, so that the living organism stands out bold and brave and vivid against the lifeless sand and barren rock. The extreme clarity of the desert light is equaled by the extreme individuation of desert life-forms. Love flowers best in openness and freedom.&quot;For both those who remember and lament the West as it once was and those who yet love it as it is, this is a must read."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"I began this piece with high expectations being a fan of desert exploration. My review for this product would be quite mixed. When Abbey is dealing with the environment itself, the book's a winner. When he is giving his very strong views on all other aspects of life it is very tedious...and I agree with his points. I just felt I was being bludgeoned with them. I'd recommend the book only with this caveat."},{"Title":"Philosophy and Philosophers: An Introduction to Western Philosophy (Penguin Philosophy)","review":"An excellent beginner's book without making you feel like a dummy or one that leaves you feeling you should never of opened the book. Dr. Shand is truly a needed author for the likes of people like me who have tried to read and understand philosophy and never could read or understand the main concepts of this interesting and challenging field of everyday thoughts.Plus the bonus of him being British. The Brits have a remarkable ability of making something difficult easy to understand. Dr. Shand starts out with the Presocrates and ends with recent Philosphers. Examples of recent Philosophers: Saul Kripke, J.L. Austin, W.V.O. Quine and many more. A beautifully written book for the average person.The book also includes an excellent bibliography with a brief word about each of the books mentioned.The world needs more people and books such as this to kick start our student's and the average person's interest in philosophy."},{"Title":"Philosophy and Philosophers: An Introduction to Western Philosophy (Penguin Philosophy)","review":"The aim of this book was was to provide an introduction that would also be useful for more advanced students. The author noted \\"The terrible consequences that have followed from dogmatically held beliefs throughout human history bear sufficient testimony to the need to philosophize. Anyone who open-mindedly and critically examines, rather than simply accepts, fundamental ideas, has started doing philosophy. Philosophy cuts very deeply into our beliefs concerning the world and our place in it.\\"Each chapter examines the major phases in Western philosophy, treating iconic figures in each phase. The Greeks are represented by Plato and Aristotle, medieval philosophy by Augustine, Aquinas and Ockham, rationalism by Descartes, Spinoza and Leibniz, empiricism by Locke, Berkeley and Hume, transcendental idealism by Kant, later German philosophy by Hegel and Neitzsche. In modern times there are chapters on analytical philosophy with Russell and Wittgenstein, phenomenology with Husserl and Sartre, logical positivism and falsificationism with Ayer and Popper, and linguistic philosophy with Wittgenstein (again). A chapter on recent philosophy provides short profiles of thirteen men from Ryle and Goodman to Searle and Kripke.The problem with this presentation is the tendency to degenerate into \\"factoid\\" mode, providing basic information devoid of analysis to help the student to find what is robust and helpful and what is merely of historical or sociological interest. This is apparent with Husserl and Sartre, where one could gain the impression that the serious and seminal work of Husserl is on the same level with the self-indulgent meandering and pontification of Sartre.The same applies to Ayer and Popper. Again one might obtain the impression that Ayer and Popper made comparable contributions to twentieth century thought. After struggling through several pages on the logical positivists it would be easy to miss the message that the verifiability criterion of the positivists never worked, despite many years of effort on the part of Ayer and others, due to the problems that Popper identified in the 1930s. So Ayer and the logical positivists contributed hardly anything and eventually Ayer conceded as much. In 1975/6 Bryan Magee conducted a series of interviews with \\"men of ideas\\" and he asked Ayer about the defects of logical positivism. Ayer replied \\"Well I suppose the most important of the defects was that nearly all of it was false\\" (\\"Men of Ideas\\", page 107).There is a good commentary on Popper's philosophy of science although the point was never made that he provided a program that worked in a way that the logical positivists did not.\\"It is possible to identify three important connected strands of thought in Popper's philosophy: (a) the solution to the problem of induction, (b) the problem of demarcating science from non-science, (c) the importance of maximizing criticism and maintaining a \`critical attitude' as essential for rationality and vital for the growth of knowledge.\\" (272)On the matter of induction, he offered the fair comment that Popper did not really solve the problem but showed how scientists can get on with their work without using \\"inductive logic\\", so the problem does not need to be solved in the direction that is sought by the inductivists.There is a good transition from the logic of falsifiability to the problems of testing (attempted falsification), a transition that is necessary due to the difficulties which Popper identified with the \\"empirical base\\" including the theory-dependence of observations and the Duhem problem. At this the author could have used the language of \\"turns\\" (and made a parallel with Wittgenstein) to describe Popper's \\"social turn\\" to identify a set of \\"rules of the game\\" for science. Other helpful material refers to Popper's metaphysical realism, his rejection of essentialism (obsession with definition of terms) and this \\"three world\\" ontology.In the extra reading he listed all Popper's major works, including \\"The Open Society and its Enemies\\" and the three volumes of the \\"Postscript to the Logic of Scientific Discovery\\". Given the consequences that have followed from dogmatically held beliefs which the author noted in the Introduction, and the way that Western philosophy has been described as footnotes to Plato, Shand could have referred to \\"The Open Society\\" as one of the great books of the century for the critique of the totalitarian elements Plato's \\"Republic\\" and \\"Laws\\". (With a note that Popper revered Plato as the greatest philosopher, despite the tendencies that he subjected to criticism).It would have also been helpful to explain that Popper rehabilitated metaphysics in the heart of the philosophy of science, in defiance of the program of the logical positivists. The author mentioned that most of Popper's work was in epistemology, political philosophy and methodology, but he overlooked probability theory in conjunction with quantum theory, where his propensity theory of objective probability grew into a whole cosmology.Another problem for the reception of Popper is the way that most of the \\"excellent books\\" that Shand listed for further reading came from hostile critics, recycling the standard arguments that are used to devalue Popper's contribution, especially his position on inductive logic.Of course in a book like this everyone thinks that their favorite philosopher has been slighted to a greater or lesser degree and so negative comments need to be treated with some scepticism. Still my main complaint is that a \\"fair and reasonable\\" treatment of all philosophers allows too much scope for the \\"factoid\\" treatment without identifying the really dangerous ideas that need to be subjected to criticism, even allowing that they are a part of our intellectual heritage and some of them were propageated with the very best intentions, like the ideas of the logical positivists that Freddy Ayer expounded for most of his life."},{"Title":"Philosophy and Philosophers: An Introduction to Western Philosophy (Penguin Philosophy)","review":"This text should become standard issue for A.P. high school and entry level university courses in Western Philosophy."},{"Title":"Philosophy and Philosophers: An Introduction to Western Philosophy (Penguin Philosophy)","review":"I received a great shock my first semester of college when I had to buy books. The price of the paperback version was great. It was the cheapest college textbook I've ever purchased. However, after using reading the Chapter 2, the pages started coming loose around page 20. Pages 5 through 10 actually fell out of the book. I've had to use super glue just to keep the book together. Cheap was a good thing, but the quality is incredibly poor. I would rather pay a little more for a book that actually stays together.John Shand really seems to like to listen to himself talk. I'm usually more confused after reading it than before.

This small book details and explains the wondrous turn around in three men's lives which were initiated as the results of devestating personal circumstances, with successful and happy lives gradually and sucessfuly being rescued from seemingly impossible circumstances. This treatise should prove to be invaluable as a tool for inspiring young people in our society."},{"Title":"Letting Go (Topics in Contemporary Buddhism)","review":"If the subject of this book had his way, this book wouldn't exist. Tosui Unkei was a promising monk during the late 1600's who rose to the upper echelons of the Soto Zen establishment only to give it all up, attempting to overcome the deeply ingrained desire for fame and reputation by seeking a humble life of anonymity in the back streets of Edo-period Kyoto. The reward for his efforts in this regard was the very fame he was avoiding, first in a biography by the impeccably orthodox Soto Zen monk Menzan Zuiho and then in this excellent translation of that biography spreading and immortalizing his name abroad. Ironic, yes, but it would be a shame nonetheless if the deeply inspiring and yet merrily entertaining life story of this uncompromising eccentric had lapsed into the obscurity he so assiduously sought. There is something arrestingly salutary in the example of this individual who eschewed the comfortable trappings of Buddhism so as to pursue the disciplined renunciation espoused by that religion to what he saw as its logical conclusion. Which is not to deny that there's also something humorous about such extremes.Just as the text in question here, \\"Tosui Osho Densan\\" (\\"Tribute to the Life of Zen Master Tosui\\") has spiritual and literary value, it is also historically significant, depicting as it does the brilliant and lively world of Buddhism during Japan's Tokugawa period (a period during which Buddhism is often alleged to be decadent and moribund). It is also a key work by a major figure in Soto Zen, and one he wrote in a manner intentionally accessible to a wider reading public than his more specialized erudite writings--but with a similar goal of defining and refining Soto Zen's sectarian identity. How intriguing that he picked an oddball dropout for this purpose, and this out of genuine admiration! Peter Haskel's translation does full justice to the multifaceted importance of the text, displaying a healthy combination of scholarly care and adroit linguistic sensitivity. His introduction, besides situating Tosui and Menzan's \\"Tribute\\" in their proper context, provides a succinct account of overall Soto Zen developments during this time period, even if he sometimes buys into later sectarian definitions of authenticity a little bit too much (it is enough to note that reformist monks like Menzan were trying to get away from earlier formulations of Soto Zen harmonized with esoteric Buddhist doctrines without joining them in deriding these as bizarre). The inclusion of the original woodblock illustrations accompanying the 1768 publication of the text along with Menzan's poetic captions to these is a delightful addition as well, one that takes the print culture of Tokugawa Japan seriously and grants the reader a vivid sense of participation in the text's provenance.In short, long time students of Japanese Buddhism and committed practitioners of Zen should find this book indispensable to their library, but it's nicely crafted so as to be open to the general reader and newcomer as well. All of which may seem like a lot of attention for a guy who just wanted to be left alone, but so it goes."},{"Title":"Letting Go (Topics in Contemporary Buddhism)","review":"I was very torn as to how to review this book, because while I appreciate the fact that someone wants to document obscure parts of our heritage, the story simply isnt that interesting.

About 1 to 2 millions of today's SF teen fans could, and probably would have written this storyline better. What saves \\"Seed of Earth\\" from zero stars are the last 25 - 30 pages, where the story turns into an interesting psychological drama. Four persons, virtually strangers, are forced to live together in a cave. The tensions, the frictions and the insights into their characters are developed quite nicely (albeit with 50's self censorship of certain scenes). Here at least is the seed of the future great master, Robert Silverberg."},{"Title":"Seed of Earth Signed","review":"I read THE SEED OF EARTH and, being a huge fan of Robert Silverberg, much enjoyed it. Mind you, this is not a classic, nor is it deserving of any awards, nor is it extremely memorable. More so beyond anything, it leaves you with a sense of beauty, a grand feeling that calms you inside. The story centers around a military program in the near future and, because of mans prominent belief that we are alone in the universe with so much wasted space, the government sends out recruits chosen by a supercomputer to board a ship and fly to the destined planet to begin a brand new Earth colony. The novel centers around about 4 or 5 characters who are neatly written that are chosen to board the starship Gegenschein. Once at Osirus, their destination, the crew discovers a race of aliens that lead the 4 characters into a cave. I will let it take out from there. I do recommend this book, but not over say DOWNWARD TO THE EARTH or THE FACE OF THE WATERS by Silverberg.

He is non other than Kilkenny, the fastest gun around and the greatest fighter too. Before it is over, he'll have to prove it. Check this book out.

I was a bit disappointed with this one. I like the funny wry novels better than the serious/gunfighter ones - and this falls into the serious gunfighter genre, it seems.IN this second book Kilkenny has drifted to Idaho into the mountains and properly filed for some land himself. Unfortunately he and his fellow 'nesters' have aroused the ire of the local land baron, 'King' Hale. Hale hadn't been interested in the land until the nesters came along, now he is ruthlessly driving them out aided by his violent son 'cub' and the tacit help of some of the locals including a shop owner who refuses to sell them any goods.Kilkenny now calls himself Trent and doesn't want to be drawn into anything he doesn't have to, but unfortunately it is brought to his door, his neighbour is ruthlessly murdered and his children hunted. They escape to Trent's cabin and then Trent himself is threatened. He refuses to budge but joins up with the other nesters and fights for what is his.What I liked about this book and other L'amours is that people are generally not simply black and white. Some of Hale's men are actually good men and they recognise in Trent a similar spirit which makes the action more complicated and richer for it. Also within the nesters there is Cain Brockman, whose brother Abel was killed by Kilkenny/Trent and has sworn revenge. Cain is a good man who fell in with a bad lot now trent has to use his persuasive powers to convince Cain of this.Like I said this is a rich and complex novel, a good easy read to take up an afternoon."},{"Title":"The Mountain Valley War","review":"The second of the three novels about Lance Kilkenny, a man with an unwanted reputation as a gunfighter, now he's got himself a small piece of land, a few head of cattle and has hung up his guns.

Pocket Full of Rye beings with a dead body (with a pocket full of rye no less!) and suspects aplenty. As it turns out, almost everyone in the house had a reason for offing poor Mr. Fortescue. Then more murders occur, which by definition one would think would make the mystery easier to solve as there are less suspects. However, Ms. Christie is too clever for that, and much as in And Then There Were None, the reader is baffled until the very end.My only [small] complaint is that Miss Marple is a relatively small part of the novel, and it would have been nice to see a tad more of her.Relic113"},{"Title":"A Pocket Full of Rye","review":"Christie wrote several books with nursery rhymes themes, HICKORY DICKORY DEATH being another. She also dealt with dysfunctional families several times, HERCULE POIROT'S CHRISTMAS and 4:50 FROM PADDINGTON were two. In this work she combined the two ideas.Rex Fortescue was a very rich and quite unpleasant man. He ran his family and his business with an iron fist. One morning his very efficient secretary took in his morning tea and found him dying. While investigating his death the police were met with one puzzle after another, what killed Mr. Fortescue?, how was it administered? and why did he have a pocket full of rye grain? As they were beginning to get some answers another murder occurred and then yet another each bringing more confusion to the scene.Jane Marple arrives to the house and begins to sort through the tangle of clues to steer the police in the right direction.This story may seem quite familiar. The Fortescue family is Christie's standard - domineering, wealthy father who keeps most of his family trapped in the family home, under his control. An errant &quot;black sheep&quot; child returns just as the murders begin and there are many family secrets.Although the story is somewhat formulistic it is still a well told tale and a fairly laid out puzzle. All the clues are there for the reader to use to try to solve the mystery before the last chapter.

Making use of nursery rhymes was one such formula. Nursery rhymes can reawaken the sense of wonder, mystery and enchantment in any reader. They also can carry symbolic levels of meaning, and some are allegories.In this her 1953 offering she makes use of the nursery rhyme &#8220;Sing A Song Of Sixpence&#8221;. Appropriately it is one of her Miss Marple books. Although her elderly spinster sleuth has little to do here, and is late making her appearance, it is she who perceives and urges the significance of the nursery rhyme. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you see, it makes a pattern to all this.&#8221;The murders occur in the disfunctional family of Rex Fortescue, a financier, and the action occurs in his London office and in the family home, Yew Tree Lodge. The opening chapters are wonderfully engaging. Agatha Christie, when she took the trouble, could sketch characters vividly. Amongst all of them in this book, there are not more than a handful of suspects. To compensate, Mrs Christie throws in buckets full of red herrings.You&#8217;ll enjoy the puzzle, and having innumerable theories suggested and dismissed.

Nevertheless, let the record show that i did, on this occassion at least, outthink the Queen, and come to the solution chapters before she revealed it. The characters are a good mixture, not all of them likeable ~ Percival, in fact, is quite obnoxious; i would have been happy to see him cast as murderer ~ and several with secondary motivations that are revealed at the right time. The lead policemant, Inspector Neele, is one of the more attractive creations Chirstie has made ~ much better than Dermott Craddock, for example ~ though, naturally, subservient to and not fully understanding the value of Miss Marple. Another nice touch in &quot;Rye&quot; is that Miss Marple doesn't appear until well into the story; nor is too much made of her, as we see far more of Neele than we do her.

When ambulances finally arrived and got him to the hospital, he was dead. The diagnosis was that a poison, taxine had killed him. This can be found in yew berries, and Mr. Fortescue lived on Yewtree Lodge. His wife was the main suspect in the murder, until she also was murdered. Her lover, Mr. Dubois, was the suspect next. Just about everyone that knew the family was a suspect. On the same day that Mrs. Fortescue died, the maid, Gladys, died also. This is when Miss Marple came to stay at Yewtree Lodge. She worked together with Inspector Neele, even though they had completely different thought patterns about what had happened. Inspector Neele eventually came to the conclusion that Percival, the son of Mr. Fortescue, was the murderer. While staying at Yewtree, Miss Marple made her own discoveries, biased on what the family members had told her. Neele was wrong, and soon agreed with Miss Marple that the other son, Lance had killed his father. Even though Lance was in Africa during all of the murders, Miss Marple proved that he had come back in the summer and given Gladys taxine, while pretending to be her boyfriend. He told her that the taxine would make Mr. Fortescue tell the truth, so Gladys put it in his marmalade. The marmalade wasn't eaten for months later, so Lance was in Africa when his father died. This gave him a strong alibi. He also killed Gladys and Mrs. Fortescue. He lured Gladys outside, pretending to be her boyfriend again, and then strangled her. Then he came to the front door and met up with his wife, pretending to just have arrived. While have tea with his step-mother, he pretended to drop sugar in her tea, but it was actually poison. Inspector Neele would never have discovered any of this without Miss Marple. This book was written with a surprise ending. This was a good book, but it had too many characters. An interesting part was that the murders fit perfectly with a nursery rhyme. Overall, I would recommend this book to anyone looking to read a good murder mystery book.The book was written so the person least likely to be the murderer turned out to be it. Lance was fired from his father's business, and moved to Africa. When his father was murdered, he was still in Africa. This made it seem nearly impossible for him to have committed three murders while being on a completely different continent. Percival, the other son was used as a distraction from Lance, and was portrayed as the murderer for a good part of the book. The MacKenzie's were also used as a distraction from Lance being the murderer. Mr. Fortescue left Mr. MacKenzie in Africa to die, so his family probably wanted revenge. All of these characters were used to make Lance seem less and less likely to be the murderer.There were too many characters. The author created too many suspects, so it got hard to follow. There were maids and housekeepers and cooks and a lot of relatives all living at Yewtree. This made them all suspects, and they kept being brought up. This made it hard to keep up with what was going on in the murder being solved. Also, the book seemed to go on and on, going through all of the possibilities of where everyone was during the murder.The murders were planned to fit a Mother Goose nursery rhyme. Miss Marple discovered that the murders perfectly fit the nursery rhyme about blackbirds. The people were killed in the same order and Mr. Fortescue was even killed with a grain of rye in his pocket. Gladys was killed with a clothes pin on her nose, to symbolize a bird snipping off her nose. The all seemed to be an odd plan the murderer was doing, until it was discovered that Gladys was killed before Mrs. Fortescue, which made it not fit with the rhyme anymore.This was a very interesting book that keeps the reader on the edge of their seat the entire book. There are many twists and turns that keep you guessing on who will be suspect next. It is almost impossible to tell who the true murderer is until the very end. Paying attention while reading this book is very important, but the book is a great mystery book that would be good for almost everyone, as long as you're willing to keep up with all of the different characters that come in and out of the book.A. Stone"},{"Title":"A Pocket Full of Rye","review":"Agatha Christie gives us an excellent addition to her &quot;nursery rhyme&quot; mysteries with this one. The king in the counting house counting out his money is Rex Fortescue, financial giant who dies at his London office in the course of a normal working day. For reasons unknown, his coat contains a pocket full of rye. The queen in the parlour who was eating bread and honey is his young second wife, rumored to have married him for his money. Although she is the first suspect, her murder the following afternoon after a tea of scones and honey, shifts suspicion. That same afternoon, the housemaid Glady Martin is also found dead. While unpegging clothes from the clothesline, someone strangled her with a stocking and left a clothespin attached to her nose to complete the rhyme's final line &quot;When there came a little bird and nipped off her nose.&quot;It is the death of the maid that brings Miss Jane Marple into the case. Gladys had been one of the village girls Miss Marple had trained for domestic service. Miss Marple considers it her duty to find the person who killed Gladys, and with Inspector Neele, the investigator in charge of the case, she does just that.The book is filled with possible suspects: Percival, the eldest son along with his wife and daughter; a younger son Lancelot and his wife; Miss Effie Ramsbottom, an elderly aunt; and several suspicious servants.Once again, it is Miss Marple's life-long experience with wickedness and her understanding of a young girl's mind that leads her to the solution of this outstanding mystery."},{"Title":"A Pocket Full of Rye","review":"I have 23 different BBC Radio 4 fullcast dramatizations and I have yet to be disappointed.

It is filled with tales of frustration, revenge and greed.Miss Marple becomes part of the investigating team when she reads that the maid at Yewtree Lodge is one of three people murdered. The maid is an orphan whom Jane Marple helped train for private service. Miss Marple is particularly upset when the maid is found with a clothes peg on her nose. She makes a train journey from St. Mary Mead via London and presents herself at Yewtree Lodge:Crump [the butler] saw a tall, elderly lady wearing an old-fashioned tweed coat and skirt, a couple of scarves and a small felt hat with a bird's wing. The old lady carried a capacious handbag and an aged but good-quality suitcase reposed by her feet. Crump recognized a lady when he saw one...The detective in charge of the case wisely decides to make use of Miss Marple's talents.Inspector Neele looked with some interest at the mild, earnest face of the old lady who confronted him now at Yewtree Lodge. He had been in two minds at first how to treat her, but he quickly made up his mind. Miss Marple would be useful to him. She was upright, of unimpeachable rectitude and she had, like most old ladies, time on her hands and an old maid's nose for scenting bits of gossip. She'd get things out of servants, and out of the women of the Fortescue family perhaps, that he and his policemen would never get. Talk, conjecture, reminiscences, repetitions of things said and done, out of it all she would pick the salient facts. So Inspector Neele was gracious.I don't think the murderer's identity came as a surprise. I was surprised that he used three separate murder weapons, albeit two of them were poisons. The maid's murder felt more callous and was certainly more violent."},{"Title":"A Pocket Full of Rye","review":"Agatha Christie keeps you guessing right till to the end (as usual). This was a enjoyable read with heaps of red herrings and twists.

If you know the rhyme you will follow the plot easily."},{"Title":"A Pocket Full of Rye","review":"I seriously enjoyed this Christie book.

Making use of nursery rhymes was one such formula. Nursery rhymes can reawaken the sense of wonder, mystery and enchantment in any reader. They also can carry symbolic levels of meaning, and some are allegories.In this her 1953 offering she makes use of the nursery rhyme &quot;Sing A Song Of Sixpence&quot;. Appropriately it is one of her Miss Marple books. Although her elderly spinster sleuth has little to do here, and is late making her appearance, it is she who perceives and urges the significance of the nursery rhyme. &quot;Don't you see, it makes a pattern to all this.&quot;The murders occur in the disfunctional family of Rex Fortescue, a financier, and the action occurs in his London office and in the family home, Yew Tree Lodge. The opening chapters are wonderfully engaging. Agatha Christie, when she took the trouble, could sketch characters vividly. Amongst all of them in this book, there are not more than a handful of suspects. To compensate, Mrs Christie throws in buckets full of red herrings.You'll enjoy the puzzle, and having innumerable theories suggested and dismissed. The solution, when it comes, however, is no more plausible than is the likelihood of a blackbird pecking off a maid's nose.If you can obtain the unabridged reading of the book by Rosemary Leach, your enjoyment will be enhanced. Rosemary Leach is unusually skilled at &quot;doing&quot; the voices of a large cast of characters, male and female."},{"Title":"A Pocket Full of Rye","review":"When an unpleasant businessman is taken ill at his London office and subsequently dies of taxine poisoning, authorities discover a house full of likely suspects: a young, sexy wife having an affair; a money grubbing son worried about his father's management of the family business; an angry daughter frustrated in love by her father's control. But no sooner do police suspicions begin to form around one of the three than murder strikes again--and then again--in such a way as to leave them baffled. Enter, of course, Miss Marple, who sets about uncovering a killer who may be a psychotic that is killing victims in accordance with the old \\"Sing a Song of Sixpence\\" nursey rhyme.Most of Christie's great novels were written in the 1930s and 1940s. Although she could still create a stunner when she wished, with A MURDER IS ANNOUNCED a case in point, by the 1950s Christie favored a less complicated approach, preferring to write novels that might be described as creamy confections for a very civilized high tea. A POCKET FULL OF RYE is perhaps the perfect example. Like most Christie novels, the plot is extremely contrived--but in this instance she makes no effort to conceal the contrivance; it is a shell game, pure and simple and without pretension, a game undertaken for the pleasure of it. And when Christie sets out to write a novel for the pure fun of it, there is always a great deal of fun to be had. This will never rank among her greatest works, but fans will devour it in a single sitting and feel as satisified as if they had just enjoyed a blow-out of cream buns. Thoroughly enjoyable."},{"Title":"A Pocket Full of Rye","review":"What \\"improvements\\" have been made for the Signet edition? There are already major differences in punctuation, word choices, and scene breaks between the original Collins and Dodd Mead editions of this novel. There are further differences between the Dodd Mead editions republished by Random House/Avenel and the Dodd Mead editions republished by Simon & Shuster/Pocket. There are further additions still in the Bantam, Berkley, and Black Dog & Leventhal editions. For every publishing house putting out her works, there seem to be a new batch of editors altering Agatha Christie's words and the sound of her voice. What's the matter with these publishers? Whose voice do they think we want to hear when we sit down to a novel by Agatha Christie? And what will she sound like twenty years from now? It's frightening that her estate has failed to see the importance of guarding her words as she wrote them. Please tell me I'm not the only one here who senses that a crime has been committed."},{"Title":"A Pocket Full of Rye","review":"Once again, \\"The Queen of Crime\\" pleased me with another thrilling mystery. Even more delightful, this book follows a similar pattern to \\"Three Blind Mice and Other Stories\\" and \\"Hickory Dickory Dock.\\" When Agatha Christie sets out to write a story with a nursery rhyme pattern it is truly suspenseful and intriguing.This installmen in Christie's large collection has Miss Marple, my favorite of her detectives, trying to solve the mystery of the poisoning of financier Rex Fortescue with taxeine. This case hits close to home for Miss Marple since Gladys Martin, a domestic maid whom she had trained for service becomes a victim of the killer. The culprit is following a bizarre pattern of using the \\"Sing a Song of Sixpence\\" nursery rhyme, and thus three victims are discovered. Rex Fortescue is discovered upon death to have a coat pocket full of rye grain, his young wife, Adelle Fortescue is discovered dead over a meal of scones and honey, and Gladys is discovered strangled with a clothespin on her nose, (A cruel imitation of \\"The little blackbird who nipped off the maids nose.\\") Miss Marple uses the nursery rhyme to discover the guilty person, and the motive is both enraging and poignant. Since there is a lemited amount of suspects, Christie superbly develops the characters and purposefully misleads the reader with plenty of red herrings.The characters in this particular installment are not as likable as in previous books of the series, but they each have complex personalities. Perhaps my favorite character is Jennifer Fortescue, whom I can relate too in a way. Of course, Miss Marple is unforgettable, and I cannot help but wish that Christie would have put more of her in to the book. Inspector Neal is fine, but Craddock is my personal favorite police officer in Christie's Miss Marple series. However, this book is terrific, and should be read by all mystery fans as a cozy whodunit that is both poignant and mostly fun. Happy reading to you all."},{"Title":"A Pocket Full of Rye","review":"Or so did Ms Marple say to one of her characters in the book, if I remember it rightly. This book stands out for me through the brilliant, albeit grisly, usage of the old nursery rhyme &quot;Four &amp; Twenty Blackbirds&quot;.The first chapter described the death of Rex Fortescue in great detail, although those details curtail none of the man's suffering but his assistants worries: whether their boss is having a sudden attack of epilepsy, drunk, or simply dying. I find this chapter very funny - I have a very strange sense of humour, so sue me - and sets the motion for the proceeding chapters when more of the rhyme came into fulfilment: the dead queen in the parlour, the maid with a clothespin on her nose to make up for the 'bird came and nipped her nose' and even the pie that contained dead blackbirds, which of course, accounts for the first part of the rhyme.Ms Marple commented these things in the book as horribly childish, and she set out to seek the murderer who not only killed from afar but also killed merely out of covering his/her own sad behind. Another brilliant novel from the Dame."},{"Title":"A Pocket Full of Rye","review":"\\"A Pocket Full of Rye\\" may perhaps be the best novel Christie wrote that features Miss Jane Marple. It is, at heart, a mystery with an ingenious setup that revolves around a familiar nursery rhyme. With murders happening aplenty and somewhat unexpectedly, this is a mystery that will keep readers on their toes until the very end.When Rex Fortescue is poisoned, suspicion immediately falls upon his young, second wife, an unfaithful woman who definitely had a motive to kill her husband. As do several (if not all) of his family members. Yet when a second poisoning claims the live of Mrs. Fortescue, she is wiped out as a suspect, but someone else within the family is definitely confirmed as the murderer. Almost every family member, or someone connected with them, had something to gain from these two deaths. Miss Marple becomes involved because one of her old serving girls is the third murder victim, filling out the last two lines of the nursery rhyme. Miss Marple helps put the detective in charge along the right track, separating murder from pranks, and finding the heartless killer among the family ranks.\\"A Pocket Full of Rye\\" is a fast-paced mystery, as are many of Christie's works, but it is spurred on by its unique story and a compelling cast of characters. As CID Inspector Neele says many times, every member of the Fortescue family is 'unpleasant', as are most of the people who work for them. As with other Christie works where Miss Marple helps out a detective, the mystery is solved but justice isn't necessarily served out in the end."},{"Title":"A Pocket Full of Rye","review":"This was one of a string of Agatha Christie mysteries I read ina very short time, but it is the only one which has really stuckwith me. What sets it apart is the unusually fine characterportrayal, the ingenuity of the crime and its solution, and thestriking contrast between the wry humor which pervades much ofthe book and the wrenching effect of its final pages (noted by aprevious reviewer). I'd never have expected to find a Christiework thought-provoking, but this one was."},{"Title":"A Pocket Full of Rye","review":"The seventh book to feature Agatha Christie's famous spinster sleuth concerns the mysterious death of Rex Fortescue, a powerful businessman with a rather unpleasant family who in turn have about a dozen different motives for killing him. There's the pretty young wife who is clearly having an affair, the suppressed daughter who was chafing under her father's control, the impatient young son who was concerned about the wellbeing of his father's business empire, and rumors of a family vendetta from years ago, involving an African goldmine.Inspector Neele is put in charge of the case, one that seems relatively straightforward what with the news that Fortescue was poisoned by taxine, a substance that was easily found in the yew tree berries that grow in abundance at Yewtree Lodge. This clearly implicates someone living at the household, whether it be a member of the dissolute family, or one of the servants - Neely in particular is intrigued by the impeccably calm and composed Mary Dove. More puzzling however, is why on earth Mr Fortescue had a pocketful of rye in his jacket, which seems a singularly pointless thing for him to have been carrying.But then two more bodies turn up in swift succession, both of which seem wholly unconnected. Neele's attention is suddenly drawn to Mr Fortescue's sons, the amusingly named Percival and Lancelot, who are respectively the white and black sheep of the family. Yet both have impeccable alibis...Christie often drew upon nursery rhymes in order to construct a mystery (such asHickory Dickory DockandOne, Two, Buckle My Shoe) and here it is \\"Sing a Song of Sixpence\\" that gets the treatment, complete with the king in his counting house, the queen in the parlor, and the maid hanging out the clothes. Miss Marple has figured out the pattern, and believes that the murders must therefore have something to do with blackbirds, however unlikely this connection may seem.As you may have guessed, the set-up and solution are borderline ridiculous, but that Christie wrote this book for fun is very clear - it's a puzzle, nothing more, with the usual fare of red herrings, mistaken identities, false leads and so on. The characters are lightly sketched, the murders are ticked off in quick succession, and though there is some amount of pathos involved concerning Miss Marple's desire for justice for the pathetic housemaid, the entire story is mostly presented as an intellectual puzzle, nothing more.Miss Marple takes a while to turn up (it's not until chapter thirteen that she makes her appearance), however, unlike some Christie novels, which take time for the body count to stack up, this one wastes no time in delivering cadavers to the reader. In essence, \\"A Pocketful of Rye\\" is vintage Christie. No one would ever describe it as her best work, but it's a comfortable read that is pure enjoyment from start to finish."},{"Title":"A Pocket Full of Rye","review":"Agatha Christie the peerless Queen of Crime wrote \\" A Pocket Full of Rye\\" in 1953.

A Pocket Full of Rye is so jam-packed with red herrings, Christie could've taken the story towards a half dozen or so different resolutions (at least!). The victim, Rex Fortescue, was a thoroughly unlikable man, and the dysfunctional family he leaves behind are, for the most part, equally unpleasant. The incredibly competent Inspector Neele is assigned to investigate the case, and what at first seems like a \\"routine\\" poisoning case soon grows into a veritable maze of lies and misdirection - beginning with the curious discovery of rye in Rex's pockets. When Rex's much younger widow is subsequently poisoned while taking tea, and the maid is found murdered by the clothesline, Neele struggles to find the connection between these seemingly random crimes.Miss Jane Marple barely appears in this novel, but her scenes are critical in revealing the killer's identity. She's the catalyst that helps Neele connect the threads of these seemingly random killings. I was quite impressed with Neele's character - for my money he's one of Christie's most interesting inspectors. He's extremely intelligent, intuitive, and knows how to read people. Most importantly, he knows how to use a person's tendency to underestimate him. He's not one of those investigators who must have every clue handed to him by the \\"civilian\\" or \\"amateur\\" sleuth. Christie could've written more novels featuring Neele's character and I wouldn't have complained at all.Christie incorporated rhymes or famous quotes as clues in her mysteries on more than one occasion (Poirot'sOne, Two, Buckle My Shoe (Hercule Poirot)or Tommy and Tuppence'sBy The Pricking Of My Thumbs (Tommy and Tuppence), to name just a few). Pocket probably isn't one of my favorites - the pool of suspects is relatively limited after all. But Christie throws so many misdirections and possible motives into the setting of this dysfunctional, very English, household that it's a delight to spend a few hours with Neele and Marple sorting through the red herrings in order to reveal the culprit."},{"Title":"Special and Decorative Breads: Traditional, Regional and Special Breads, Fancy Breads - Viennese Pasteries - Croissants, Brioches - Decorative Breads - Presentation Pieces","review":"This is actually Volume Two in a series. The first volume is similar, of the same name, twice the price and out of print. This one is outstanding in that it contains a reasonable array of classic breads that are presented in an optimal format with beautiful color pictures, commentary and good organization. Although it may be a bit too detailed for the average home baker, if you follow the recipes and techniques exactly, you will get bread that looks like those shown in the pictures. The weakness is that it doesn't always explain how to achieve these results in a hoome environment. For instance, to achieve the shiny patina of the breads shown on the cover you need to inject steam at the start of the baking. Although there are a number of ways to do this at home, none are explained here (You can pre steam the loaf in a roaster in advance). Other techniques are available, but not here, for producing large irregular holes, a lasting crust, etc. For my taste, instead of a book about how to make such and such kind of bread, I would have rather had a book about how to achieve certain textures and patinas in bread baking in general.

It is quite innocent by today's standards. I felt the book was a bit shallow, although considerable energy is spent on describing the girl's deep angst she experiences as she moves toward stardom. There is passing mention of her family, but not much emphasis is put on them. Hard work and discipline are seen as good qualities, and necessary for excellence in the craft.

Yet this book serves as a nice bringing together of both emphases in one volume, and is a good starting place for those interested in such topics.Moseley, a pastor and academic, believes that Christians need to love God with their minds, and develop a solid Christian worldview. We need to do this because truth matters, and because biblical truth needs to be maintained to assess and critique non-biblical thinking.But it is not enough to have a set of good ideas. They must be put into practice. Thus Moseley examines a number of contentious social issues, including abortion, homosexuality, wealth, and the environment.

This book brought me to tears, I laughed at times, and was scared for the main characters, all at different points in this book. I could not put it down. If I could rate this book higher than 5, it would be a 10. I need to buy another Gerri Hill book."},{"Title":"Hunter's Way","review":"Gerri Hill has taken her wonderful way with \\"killer\\" romance novels and added an interwoven crime story/mystery to keep the suspense (on both levels) going. A GREAT read, and I can hardly wait for the next book!"},{"Title":"Hunter's Way","review":"I just ordered this book on a whim, glad I did. I am not sure where Hill has been hiding, but glad I found her (just ordered three more of her books)I won't repeat what's already been said about the characters in the book... great writing, and great story lines!"},{"Title":"Hunter's Way","review":"I have read a few of Gerri Hill, I really like her books, this one I really loved, this is a must read."},{"Title":"Hunter's Way","review":"Amazing story... Great suspense and action mixed in with a true love story... Great to see the two genre didn't get in the way of each other... I loved this book and wish amazon would hurry up and make the sequels available!"},{"Title":"Hunter's Way","review":"I was surprised at how well this book was written. After reading a lot of lesbian fiction that turned out to be more sex than story I was hesitant about spending the money to get another, I am glad my family did. Hunter's Way is a wonderful piece of fiction. Gerri Hill gives you a story that flows nicely, she has found a way to build the sexual attraction and tension while never taking from the police investigation. The verbal play between Hunter and Kennedy is reminiscent of the play between Bruce Willis and Cybill Shepherd from Moonlighting. I highly recommend this book to all."},{"Title":"Hunter's Way","review":"this book was awesome. the characters were so real and the story line was so good i couldn't put it down. plus it made me want to buy a boat lol."},{"Title":"Hunter's Way","review":"I followed my friend's recommendation about this book and the author. I had an open mind about this so I went for it.Can I say it in simple words?: I LOVED IT!It is so fun to read although it isn't comedy. You will find yourself losing the track of time because you couldn't keep your eyes off the book. The characters have a strong personality and you can't help but love them all. You think you know how it's going to end but then it surprises you.If you really want to love a lesbian book, start with this."},{"Title":"Hunter's Way","review":"Exceptionally well written, which is far from guaranteed in Lesbian fiction. I would absolutely read other books by this author."},{"Title":"Hunter's Way","review":"It's one of those \\"can't put down\\" books! The characters just jump off the page and come to life.

Very engaging and fun."},{"Title":"Hunter's Way","review":"Love this book. One of the best of the genre (lesbian romance).

However, with this book I've stayed up two nights in a row well past midnight (and I get up at 5 am) just to finish it.I was a little hesitant to buy this book because I thought \\"oh great, another Lesbian cop story\\" but to my surprise the storyline kept me interested and kept me reading."},{"Title":"Hunter's Way","review":"This romance moves quickly with nice suspense. Tori is especially likable, despite being a tough cop. You find yourself rooting for her to get the girl (who happens to be straight until, of course, being partnered with Tori on the force and charmed by Tori's protectiveness.) The mystery provides the perfect backdrop for the two characters to grow close and ultimately get together. Definitely, a must have addition to any romance collection."},{"Title":"Hunter's Way","review":"Gerri Hill is a wonderfull author. She has talent beyond any talent I have came across with books. She is brilliant. This book \\"Hunter's Way\\" is by far the best book that I have ever read. Once I started to read it, I could not put it down. This book is a page turner.The two main characters well, you actually get to know them, the dialouge is subperb, the imagery is quite well, they characters start out slow and soon their feelings begin to take it's course. She did not rush the relationship she did such a darn good job. I loved it!! Like the whole build up to that part that we all seem to enjoy to read ;) well that was within many chapters later. She just did such a awesome job with this book.I could go on about this, like I don't know if words can explain but I loved this book and plan to own it to my collection. Checked it out at my local library.:)"},{"Title":"Hunter's Way","review":"This is my favorite lesbian cop book! I liked that their relationship progressed naturally and didn't feel forced.

Would love to see Detectives Hunter and Kennedy in a sequel or as secondary characters in another book."},{"Title":"Hunter's Way","review":"This is an outstanding book by Gerri Hill. I think it is the best of her books I have read so far. She lays out every scene in such detail you feel like you're right there. And I had a great time learning and reading Hunter's real Way !! Overall this has to be a 5 star in my opinion. There will be additional contact with Hunter in some of her other books, so this is a must read to learn about Hunter. Once I met Hunter I could not put the book down. Gerri Hill's books have a habit of doing that to you !"},{"Title":"Hunter's Way","review":"This book was interesting. The characters are well developed and the story is compelling. One of the better ones in this genre."},{"Title":"Hunter's Way","review":"I have read many, many lesbian romances and nearly all of Gerri Hill\`s novels. This one of the best I\`ve come across.

Lake's rendition of 'Xena and Gabrielle join the police force' in Gun Shy... I was not altogether opposed to meeting yet another tall, dark-haired, muscular, super sexy, anti-social butch cop who comes out of her shell via the sunny blonde and beautiful charms of her new and more sociable partner.Fan fiction is actually pretty fun! Yes, yes, I know I'm a tad late in discovering uber-Xena type stories... but the Xena and Gabrielle chemistry is so electric and universally adored that even a more distant likeness like Tori Hunter and Samantha Kennedy conjure this magic.So homicide detective Tori Hunter is our brooding protagonist in this story. She can't hold a partner- at work or personally. She's just too emotionally troubled to let anyone close. At 37 she still hasn't worked out some extreme trauma she experienced as a kid and apparently her obnoxious and reckless behavior at work hasn't forced her into some much needed long-term therapy with the department shrink. She is simply permitted to be the (somewhat juvenile) resident rogue.Along comes hot-tempered Samantha Kennedy (according to the back of the book), her new partner... who is anything but hot-tempered. Hot, maybe... persistent, for sure... but she's not swimming in passion and anger. Breaking a mirror doesn't equate with passion as much as it symbolizes changing herself. If anything, passion is a repressed part of herself upfront. She doesn't know herself at all and is rather passive. So it's no surprise that at 34 she's still wandering aimlessly in straight-ville with a controlling boyfriend in tow. When you don't take charge of yourself... others won't hesitate to do so.Together these two search for a serial killer who is targeting young lesbians... which in turn provides us with a convenient setting of queers to observe for our closeted straight woman. The charm of this book is not just that it is reasonably well-written with wonderful character chemistry and moves along at an easy pace... but that the romance is set at the forefront.I don't want to say that the police drama is a subtext, exactly, because it is plausible enough... but it's there to give these two every opportunity to get closer, visit lez bars together and even behave like girlfriends. This is a very sweet union... which is why it's a little surprising when violence actually does ensue. There is a rape scene that I almost want to say was just kinda glossed over... but it really didn't feel that way. Again, this is not a book that wants to focus on dysfunction and depressing stuff... it is first and foremost a romance and manages to stay as much despite the drama that emerges.The one annoying factor for me about this story is the needy boyfriend who doesn't go away until, like, page 227... and then somehow STILL manages to resurface again, and again, lol... geez. GO AWAY ALREADY!! Coming out story or not... this author allowed way too much time to this clown. I'm not sure if he was supposed to be amusing (not) or prepped as a stalker for book 2... but if nothing else he is more evidence of Samantha's passive nature. If she were truly hot-tempered he'd of been found in a ditch by page 23.It is Samantha's vulnerability and femininity that appeals most to Tori and breaks down her defenses... Sam is someone Tori instinctively wants to protect.Whatever its little flaws, you're still gonna get hooked on this sexy couple."},{"Title":"Hunter's Way","review":"What an AWESOME book, totally enjoyed every second of reading this book. I finished this book a short time after I got it. From the time I started reading it, I just could not put it down."},{"Title":"Hunter's Way","review":"Gerri Hill does it all with this book. Hunter's Way is a romantic mystery that is sure to please all. You will laugh out loud, and yet, there are parts that can make a heart skip. Let's not forget about the intrigue. Tori and Sam will quickly become your favorite cops. Hunter's Way is a must read!"},{"Title":"Hunter's Way","review":"Gerri Hill time after time creates fresh powerful thrilling stories intertwined with heart-pounding romances and Hunter's Way is no exception.Tori Hunter is an arrogant, abrasive Homicide detective who alienates every partner she has ever had. In the middle of a series of murders, Samantha Kennedy transfers from the Assault division and is paired with Tori after she blows through another partner. Even though Tori is considered a nightmarish partner, Samantha stands up to her. While Samantha challenges her attitude, she respects Tori's strong instincts as an effective detective. This bodes well for their relationship as they pursue a serial killer who may be targeting the gay and lesbian community. As their professional partnership develops, their strong attraction for one another is undeniable. Their only obstacles are Sam's boyfriend and Tori' very tragic past.Hill is a master at building her characters' professional and personal relationships slowly, effectively absorbing them into the main storyline. We get to know Sam and Tori well as the plot progresses. We understand Tori's total immersion into her career as her horrific past unfolds. We see Sam struggle with her lack of passion for her boyfriend while she is discovering new and powerful feelings for her partner that cross the line of professionalism. Tori\`s and Sam's characters grow as their partnership intensifies. They learn to trust each other as they encounter dangerous situations, and this aspect of the partnership is very different for Tori. For the first time in Tori's career she has a real partner, and for the first time in her life, she has a friend who cares about her. Tori also wrestles with inappropriate feelings, especially because she believes Sam is straight. But as the violence in their daily lives continues, they are forced to face their attraction to one another.Hill weaves a romance that leaves this reader breathless while crafting a police procedural that is thorough and easy to follow. The stages of tracking down a serial killer are interspersed in the story, moving it along smoothly. The dialogue throughout is on fire with passion. The tenderness in the story embraces the reader and is overpowering. Hill's pacing is even with no abrupt starts or endings. Even though we learn the killer's identity two thirds of the way through the story, the ending is a surprise. There is more to Hunter's Way than we suspect."},{"Title":"Hunter's Way","review":"I never thought I'd be able to read one and enjoy it, but I did. It didn't dawn on me until well into the book that one character was \\"tall and dark-haired\\" and the other was \\"shorter and blond\\". It's a well-written if pedestrian mystery. Anyone who reads mysteries on a regular basis will figure out \\"who dunnit\\" fairly quickly, but the interactions of the characters are fun to read.This is a great example of how an uber-Xena should be.I'll definitely be putting Ms. Hill on my watch list."},{"Title":"Hunter's Way","review":"At last I've found a writer who can write a decent mystery while at the same time adding a decent romance thread to the story. Hill is expert at slowly unraveling the mystery - and doesn't with hold key clues from the reader - and building the tension as the killer kills again and again. She is also an expert at building the sexual tension between the two key characters of the book.Another talent of Hill's is to introduce minor characters and keep them in the story so that the interaction between our heroines and the minor characters develop over the course of the book.In Hunter's Way, I'm not sure that I believe that Hunter would change from being a curmudgeon to a teddy bear in only a couple of months, but hey, Hill was able to make me believe it was possible as I was reading the book.I'm trying to convince myself not to buy everything Hill has written all at once so I won't get to the point of having to check Amazon every day to see if her latest book is being published. Surely, I have more restraint than that. However, all her books are sitting in my Amazon cart as we speak."},{"Title":"Hunter's Way","review":"Hunter's Way, a thoroughly engrossing read, hit all the right notes for me. The quality of writing is above average, as is the mystery/crime plotline, which is handled well giving us enough twists and turns along the way and, happily, the book is populated by a cast of fairly believable characters who don't hover too close to the usual stereotypes.If I had to put my finger on the pulse of what makes this one work, for me, I'd say it was because the story's titled protagonists, Hunter, is this wonderfully flawed, all-too human cop with a past that illumines her from within. Add to that mixture, Samantha Kennedy, and her complicated unravelling life, you have two characters that slowly find they have chemistry, giving life to&mdash;at times&mdash;a deliciously erotic love-story that finally finds fruition by the end.I'm not usually fond of the straight girl suddenly finds she's gay scenario, but this one worked. Why? Simply put, author Gerri Hill's deft handling.Hunter's Way is now firmly fixed as one of my favourite reads."},{"Title":"Hunter's Way","review":"When I first picked up this book and realized the main character is named \\"Tori Hunter,\\" I was a little concerned. You see, I live in Minnesota and one of my favorite players on the Minnesota Twins baseball team is outfielder Torii Hunter. Let me put your fears to rest... Tori in the book is NOTHING like Torii on the field... She's much, much more intriguing.Tori is a homicide detective who has had six male partners in as many years. Her partners either threaten to quit or they are injured on the job, so she gets assigned to someone else. Known as cold and heartless, many of her peers shun the idea of being assigned as her partner.In walks Samantha Kennedy. Samantha has recently been reassigned to Homicide per her request and is Tori's new partner. Samantha's boyfriend doesn't support this career choice because he envisions their marriage, children and grandchildren. (Note: Her boyfriend is more of a frightening comic relief than a part of the real story. He seems almost seemed like an afterthought on the author's part. Hill builds the tension between Sam and her boyfriend, almost turning it violent when she tells him it's over. However, even that tension doesn't play a pivotal part in the story.)As Sam begins to break down Tori's rigid exterior, she begins to have feelings for a woman for the first time in her life. Confused, but intrigued, she doesn't resist. Tori can't deny the growing magnetism she feels for Sam and struggles with allowing the other woman in.Hill is undeniably one of my favorite authors. Her characters seem to spring to life. Admittedly, they are a little \\"more\\" than real, but that's what makes her books so fantastic. \`Hunter's Way' is a welcome addition to my personal, permanent collection. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Hunter's Way","review":"Though I am not an avid fan of this author's work, I have spent many a late night reading her fiction these past three weeks. For whatever reason, I keep coming back for more.Though the murder mystery elements in \\"Hunter's Way\\" were not as powerful for me as they were in \\"The Killing Room,\\" the unfolding mystery of the relationship between Tori and Sam was superb.I think this is one of the best, if not the best, character/relationship developments I have ever read. Nothing in the writing forced the relationship to grow unnaturally. Most enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Hunter's Way","review":"I've often read other reviewers saying, \\"I couldn't put it down. I read it in one sitting.\\" I never had experienced that myself, but I did with this book. I really couldn't put it down and stayed up way too late becaue I just had to find out how it turned out: how the murder mystery turned out, how the relationships turned out, how the sex turned out.... I thoroughly enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Hunter's Way","review":"Great read! This book flows smoothly and is a page turner. As a proven romance writer, this author's first attempt at a murder mystery is right on. The romance mixes well with the suspense, neither over-shadowing the other. As much as I love Hill's romances, I wouldn't mind her mixing in an occasional \\"cop\\" story. This one was very enjoyable!"},{"Title":"Hunter's Way","review":"I loved this book because of the proofreader/editor. Finally, a book that flowed, did not have a bunch of misspelled words and sentences that made no sense. Also, a book with length and substance. Have gotten so aggravated with the books that Bella puts out only having 200 pages or less. The above out of the way, the story was good and the characters were nicely done. There was one part that made me put the book down and just do something else for awhile. Have to admit, that while I love crime and mayhem, am not much into rape scenes...especially graphic ones. They do nothing for the story to my way of thinking, but the victim handled it well. And, maybe the ending was a little cliched, but all and all, very enjoyable. Plus, and I thank you Ms. Hill, the main character did not look like Xena, well, not too much."},{"Title":"Hunter's Way","review":"As a somewhat \\"newbie\\" to reading lesbian novels, I have come across very few that have enthralled and captivated me like Hunters Way. Not only is it believable that a tough, unsociable, distant woman (Tori) could find herself drawn to her warm, thoughtful and full of life partner (Sam), it was completely entertaining to see it unfold....slowly. Not a minute of this read was boring. From page one, it caught my attention and drew me in, giving me the feeling that I knew each of the characters personally.Gerri Hill can simply tell a story and while this book was full of hot, believable passion, it was also full of drama as the story unfolds. I HIGHLY recommend this book. It will be one of many that I read from this author and she has now set a very high standard of what I expect from a fiction novel."},{"Title":"Hunter's Way","review":"Intense and entertaining...and never missing a beat! The author really developed the characters well. The scenes were deep and the passion between the two women flowed. A good balance between mystery and love!"},{"Title":"Unlimited Visibility: Lessons and Processes to Improve Your \\"I\\" Sight","review":"I tend to shy away from &quot;self-help&quot; literature in general, because so often it falls into one of two categories: the overly simplistic, wide-eyed, plastic-smiled &quot;power of positive thinking&quot; genre, touting yet another new way to hypnotize oneself into believing he or she is (select one): attractive, prosperous, successful, etc. The other category would have, for me, more credibility if I could only read it without my eyes tearing up from the dryness. What struck me about Unlimited Visibility from the outset was that it was both based on well-founded, structurally sound principles, and was a pleasure to read as well. I found myself saying aloud &quot;I get it!&quot; and &quot;Of course!&quot;Rather than introducing us to yet another &quot;Get-Happy-Quick&quot; scheme, Ms. Sorensen shows us how to use the principles we already know. By using everyday examples from real life, she makes that connection between ourselves and the Truth that can seem, at times, so remote and theoretical."},{"Title":"Unlimited Visibility: Lessons and Processes to Improve Your \\"I\\" Sight","review":"Stephanie Sorensen eloquently reminds us that our spiritual journey is a journey within. The entire book is filled with truths that left me saying, &quot;Yes! I understand!&quot; The format was wonderful. She gently guides you through the process of looking within. Each chapter ends with a lesson and meditation to explore your thoughts. Recognizing our personal power and perfection in times of personal crisis can be challenging, but each chapter leaves you feeling more secure in the knowledge that each and every one of us is beloved by our Father. Ms. Sorensen's book has touched my life is such a positive way. My &quot;I&quot; sight is much more clear, beyond 20/20. I can't wait to read her next book! I recommend this book to everyone who is brave enough to look within. You will never regret the journey!"},{"Title":"Unlimited Visibility: Lessons and Processes to Improve Your \\"I\\" Sight","review":"This is another of DeVorss's great books. (I haven't found any published by DeVorss to be duds.) Ms. Sorensen brings to consciousness many fascinating aspects of the human self. Using her Religious Science background, complete with Licensed Religious Science Practitioner status, Stephanie offers you an array of insights and techniques for furthering your own sacred journey. This book, along with her ever-popular THE SACRED CONTINUUM, provides the right balance between theory and practice, common sense and intuition, wisdom and knowledge."},{"Title":"Sex without Fear","review":"This book is a scientific explanation of the male and female reproductive systems and their function for adolescents and young marrieds. It tells in simple and objective language what we do and what to expect. The graphics are high-caliber, and are what you might expect to see in a medical book. Nothing is omitted or hidden. Call-outs are extensive. There are no pictures of intercourse and nothing suggestive or seductive. The title suggests nothing. It means that, once the ordinary young person understands the process, he or she need not be afraid of it."},{"Title":"Spiritual Destiny: Grow Your Capacity to Love","review":"This is a simple and effective book that can help you identify patterns and behaviors in your life experiences that have brought you to where you are today. Using the Soul Wellness Inventory, you can find your purpose and craft your future in a way that will work with your tendencies, skills, and talents, instead of fighting against yourself. The book shows how spirituality is inherent in all our lives, regardless of our faith or even if we follow any kind of faith. Your inner life exists apart from dogma and doctrine, but you must understand how you reached your current destination before you can move forward to a new, more rewarding one. Contains true stories of how using the techniques in the book helped the author's clients in his career counseling practice."},{"Title":"Step One: Play Harmonica (Step One)","review":"As a beginner, I found this book is well organized, easy to follow, written with plain English and a little bit of humor. The etudes are well selected, not boring at all. It is the best book for you if you are also a beginner, still know little about harmonica and musical theory. It is better to buy a C tone harp first, although this book (maybe the only book) does not urge you to do that."},{"Title":"Step One: Play Harmonica (Step One)","review":"This was the book that got me started with the harmonica. It starts very easy, with just two chords, and it goes slowly to the blues. In the blues chapter you can find some solos, and some are more difficult. What I liked about this book was that it goes through the basics at a slow pace and with many examples. Also, the recording is very good. The channels are separated, one for the backup song and one for the harp."},{"Title":"Vilna Gaon Haggadah: The Passover Haggadah With Commentaries by the Vilna Gaon and His Son R'Avraham (Artscroll Mesorah) (Hebrew Edition)","review":"This volume is a must for the seder table and should be at the elbow of every Jew throughout the year acting as a mussar (ethics) instrument. The authors are the incomparable Vilna Gaon, whose birthday was/is the first day of Passover 5480/1720, and his son Rabbeinu Avraham. Rabbi Yisrael Isser Zvi Herczeg performs an elegant translation.This review will attempt to adhere to the spirit of Rabbeinu Avraham in his \\"Commentary on the Daily Prayers\\" and brought by Rabbi Herczeg on page 1 of the translator's preface - \\"To communicate one's intent to another, one should be brief in his language, so that the other will be forced to give it deep thought.\\"Allow me to examine just three of the sparkling diamonds of the \\"Vilna Gaon Haggadah\\" and not slow your actions unduly in purchasing this majestic book.For one, the GRA/Gaon and Rabbeinu Avraham go contrary to every other haggadah I've read in demonstrating that the taam son is really the best son. Most translate taam as \\"simple\\" but the GRA's translation is \\"perfect.\\" I won't preempt your joy by giving away what our illustrious authors elaborate. Instead I'll give you what my small mind takes from it: Compare the taam's question - \\"What is this?\\" - to the \\"wise\\" son's question that mentions chukim and mishpatim (statutes and judgments). The taam views the Torah as one thing where as the wise son, although employing the Torah's own use of the terms chukim and mishpatim, has set at least one toe on the path of rationalism by separating the Torah's laws. As Rabbi Avigdor Miller ZT\\"L taught me - the entire thing is a chok (a unity beyond reason).We should note that the taam is the third son and the Torah was given on the third day after the Israelites reached Mount Sinai. Let us recall that Jacob's third son - Levi - received a special spiritual heritage with us to the present day.The GRA and Rabbeinu Avraham are again at the barricades against rationalism in their comments about Rabban Gamaliel's teaching about pesach, matzah, and maror (p. 72). I was drawn to this section by Rabbi Daniel Lapin's teaching that those items correspond to the three elements of time - past, present and future. Again, I won't ruin it for you by telling which items Rav Daniel assigns to which time periods - see his tape \\"Making Your Seder a Growth Experience\\" for the answer.In commenting on Rabban Gamaliel, the GRA settles the long-simmering issue, for me at least, of the way of Torah (encapsulated in Pirkei Avos 6:4) in relation to worldly goods. Delving into Psalm 128, the Gaon masterly defeats thorough-going asceticism and consumerism in the same passage.If you're worried the GRA put one toe onto the path of profligate living, you'll relax upon reaching his comment about money being the avi avos hatumah (father of all materialist pollution) on page 96. I'll leave it to you to discover the section where Rabbeinu Avraham openly derides the rationalism of the Greeks (for that was really what the war of Chanukah was about) and those that follow them.Having brought a series of three ideas let me stop here and pray that I have achieved chazakah. You should strike a blow against the avi avos hatumah and use your money to purchase the \\"Vilna Gaon Haggadah\\" and go from strength to strength."},{"Title":"The Books of Magic: Bindings - Book 1","review":"This isn't my favorite of the &quot;Books of Magic&quot;--Summonings takes that honor. It's an interesting tale of Timothy Hunter, perhaps the greatest magician of all time, the illegitimate son of Tam Lin and Queen Titania of the Faeries.Tim lives as an ordinary boy in our world, with a sloppy but loving father, and a few rather unworldly acquaintances. His father, Tam Lin, occasionally pops up in human form as does the Amadan, a rather repulsive little sprite who waits on Queen Titania. The Queen herself is furious because the Faerie lands are dying, for reasons that no one knows.Tim has problems of his own when he ventures into the lair of a mysterious - and sinister - creature. This will lead to the discovery of what is killing the Faerie lands, and exact a terrible price in return.While I found the story tight-paced and enjoyable, I wished they'd give us a little more backstory as to how Tim knows who his true father is. It would've made Titania's comments in the garden a little easier to understand (&quot;we made love and a child in this garden&quot;). I also felt that the explanation for the dying Faerie lands was a little too pat.The artwork was pretty bad - often it shifted from one frame to another, becoming well-defined in one frame and blurry in another. Dimensions altered. And Titania was terribly drawn - she's supposed to be beautiful, darnit! It looks like they simply took a picture of a none-too-pretty woman and colored her green (not to mention the fact that her teeth often appear the same color as her skin). She looks much better in future books.However, the atmosphere is unparalleled. The clash with the Manticore was downright chilling, as was the effects on Tim. I was quite surprised by Death's arrival, you'll be surprised at the face and personality of &quot;death.&quot; And the last few pages were both sweet and sad.A nice comic book, hardly flawless but nor is it bad."},{"Title":"The Books of Magic: Bindings - Book 1","review":"Bindings was the first Vertigo anything I had read, and since now I own all of the Books of Magic and Sandman paperbacks, not to mention a few others, I can tell you that it's addictive. It has a few lines that I love - I'll try to type them here, but I may not have them exactly right: &quot;Love is what keeps things moving so that they stay together, and fear is what makes you hold so still you fall apart.&quot;, and &quot;Was this Arraune, where the lake women wove water and sighs into blue-green silk, or was this Telis, where lost hopes paced the streets, begging strangers to take them in?&quot; So I like parallel sentence structure . . . The story line is also very interesting; the manticore is a terrific villian, and I think we all like Death of the Endless. I do, however, have two complaints. The first: it's kind of short. Second, and this is more of a real complaint, when Tamlin first shows up, Tim recognizes him and launches into this dialogue that is kind of confusing, because Tamlin wasn't in the first miniseries paperback, by Neil Gaiman, and Bindings contains issues 1-4 of the series itself. The incident Tim refers to is in the story Long Walks In Dancing Shoes, which is in the Books of Faerie paperback (which story also explains Marya and Daniel fairly well, for those who have read Summonings), but Bindings does not try to explain this. Sigh. It is,however, excellent on the whole."},{"Title":"The Books of Magic: Bindings - Book 1","review":"The original Books of Magic, written by Neil Gaiman was great reading. John Ney Rieber Takes over writing chores for the regular series and manages to put together a decent arc in &quot;Bindings&quot; which takes place in Books of Magic 1-4.There are a few subplots in the story, but the main driving force is Tim Hunter's battle with the Manticore. The Manticore is a changeling beast that captures children, &quot;educates&quot; them and eventually eats them. This is vintage Vertigo horror stuff, and is creepy enough to make you think that Gaiman might have ghostwritten it.Tim's search to find the identity of his real father is also dealt with, although not to my satisfaction. Also something about the destruction of the lands of Fairie is thrown in, but it seems like an afterthought and isn't developed very well.Death also makes a housecall, but is she there on business? Read the book and find out.Overall, it's a very good story, the artwork is serviceable, but at times sketchy. This is another hallmark of early Vertigo work, and it does seem to add to the atmosphere of the book. The covers by Vess, on the other hand, are great. Too bad Vertigo reprints them 1/2 their regular size in this edition, you lose a lot of the detail."},{"Title":"The Books of Magic: Bindings - Book 1","review":"Good story. John Ney Rieber is to be congratulated for his script, but Peter Gross should either go back to art school or SLOW DOWN. One gets the impression that he either lacks skill or was in a hurry to meet his deadline. I wish to god Charles Vess, who is created with the cover art, had drawn the whole piece, because his work is really quite fine. As if to back me up, the introduction by Jane Yolen praises the storytelling but never once mentions the art work.

It's a bit heavy to tote about (as were the copper pizza pans from the shop in Lucca it led me right to); but we never left a hotel room without it. The layout (for first time visitors) requires a fair bit of cross-referencing until you get the knack of matching towns, descriptions and maps in the book to more detailed roadmaps that you will find to be an essential extra. There are so many worthwhile destinations in such close proximity to each other that it's impossible to see as much as you would wish. But that said, there's not a chance I would otherwise have found Dai Dai frozen desserts, savoured the unusual taste of lardo di Colonnata (or survived the nerve jangling drive there!), nor experienced the simple 'grand tour' pleasure of snacking on a truffle sandwich in such quiet elegance in Florence. My copy of this book, bought almost as an afterthought, just before leaving home, is thoroughly dog-earred and annotated throughout with huge exclamation marks and wistful 'next time's.' Not one comment lead us astray, although we managed to take a few unexpected detours. I only envy the author the obvious time she spent in completing her research."},{"Title":"Food Lovers Companion To Tuscany","review":"This is an essential book for Tuscany travel. Not only are the reviews of restaurants wonderful (and VERY accurate) but all the extra places that are recommended - a wonderful beekeeper in San Gimignano, delightful ceramic shops, a place to buy fresh pasta in Lucca (for both man and dog!), farmers markets, out-of-the-way restaurants in busy &quot;touristy&quot; places like Pisa and Florence; we never left home without it. We found it particularly helpful that directions to locate the place described were provided -- very important when traveling in unfamiliar areas. Although it can be bulky to carry, it's worth it.

The book is a great read and hard to put down. Have had this book on my shelf for a lot of years and simply did not get around to it.

I remember reading most of these over a decade ago and liking all of them except 1 (which was way over the top). Just re-read this one and it still works. Plots are all similar - serial killer is operating in NYC and Det. Ben Tolliver is involved. James Neale Harvey keeps the tension ratched, and the plot never gets too preposterous - until the end - when the killers identity is revealed. This makes it sound kind of boilerplate - which it was - but the writing is good and I think most fans of Red Dragon or Silence of the Lambs or any of that ilk would like this title."},{"Title":"Conversations with James Joyce.","review":"There are not many books dealing with Joyce's literary opinions and few are privy to what Joyce actually thought about modern literature or modern writers. Arthur Power (1891-1984) was just establishing himself in the Paris of 1922 when by chance he met Joyce at at dance hall, the Bal Bullier, after a young French 'blanchisseuse' stood him up. What followed was an intimate friendship where the 40 year old Joyce and the 30 year old Power talked and discussed many topics such as Russian Literature (with surprising comments by Joyce on Pushkin: 'He was born a boy, lived like a boy and died like a boy'), the merits of Thomas Hardy, modern, romantic and sentimental literature and even a topic Joyce eschewed, religion. Power's recreation of his conversations with Joyce are almost Boswell-like in their idiosyncratic moments and literary style, no doubt due to Power scribbling down what Joyce said to him every evening once gettnig home to his artist's garret.This is a book to go alongside Budgen's own account of his frienship with Joyce and gives you a broader insight into Joyce as perceived by close friends in contrast to the distant, non-commital but polite evasiveness he often displayed when approached by strangers."},{"Title":"The History of the Russian Revolution","review":"It's said that \\"The first ones to cry for revolution are also the first ones to be lined up against the wall & shot after the Revolution overthrows the prior regime.\\" This book is a representation of this truism.

The author himself, by the way, was killed on orders from Stalin (with an alpine ice axe, to boot) while in exile in Mexico.

Much was concealed even by his enemy Stalin, as it would have exposed Lenin, Trotsky's boss, as complicit. Trotsky was basically Lenin's enforcer and executioner. For example, his violent fist-shaking \\"take no prisoners\\" speech to the drunken mob in front of the Winter Palace in October 1917, defended only by a woman's brigade and troop of boy cadettes, led to unnecessary rapine slaughter. This event was white-washed also by the later propaganda films of Sergei Eisenstein, which distorted the violent Bolshevik coup against human freedom into something heroic. Trotsky lied to the Kronstadt sailors defending the remnants of the early Russian democracy to get them to surrender, and then had most of them shot, unleashing the Red Army to pillage Petrograd. As Generalisimo, he sent the Red Army across large areas of Russia to terrorize and murder the remnants of the democratic Soviets, stomping out all opposition to Bolshevism in what was little more than a prelude to the Red Terror and gulag death-camps. His conduct and advocacy of violent and global \\"War Communism\\" indicates, had he succeeded in the power struggle against Stalin, there would have been little difference in Soviet policies or behavior. For example seeTrotsky: The Eternal Revolutionary; alsoLeaves from a Russian diary,: And thirty years after."},{"Title":"The History of the Russian Revolution","review":"In spite of its length, I've read this book several times. It isn't just a widely acclaimed historic and literary masterpiece, written by a leading participant in the events he describes. It isn't just vividly written and thoroughly researched.More importantly, it's one of the best books ever written about revolution, as relevant today as ever.The most important conclusion that emerges is the crucial role of a revolutionary party with an overwhelmingly working class membership, leadership and political orientation: a party that has trained itself in the many years of partial struggles that precede a revolutionary crisis; studied together the lessons of past revolutionary struggles throughout the world; and done everything possible to educate broader layers of workers in those lessons.(The point is illustrated both positively and negatively. More than once, Lenin had to turn to the Bolshevik's working class rank and file against wavering intellectuals in the party leadership.)Please don't be put off by the first chapter, the driest and most difficult in the book. The basic idea is that capitalism arrived late in Russia, imported from abroad in the form of huge factories, which laid the basis for the rapid development of a strong, militant labor movement. As a result, the emerging capitalist class was reluctant to mobilize the masses against the feudal nobles and landlords that stood in their way, for fear that the aroused workers might turn on the capitalists themselves.Under the impact of war and economic crisis, the resulting mixture of different forms of class oppression exploded in a combined revolt of workers, farmers, and oppressed nationalities, destroying both feudalism and capitalism by the time it was through.Several postcripts:(1) If you're wondering what went wrong in the Soviet Union after such a promising start, I recommend \\"The Revolution Betrayed\\" by Trotsky; also \\"Lenin's Final Fight\\" by Lenin.(2) I disagree with Trotsky's assessment of the pre-1917 differences between himself and Lenin concerning the role of working farmers, the relationship between democratic (anti-feudal) revolution and socialist revolution, and Lenin's formula, \\"the democratic dictatorship of the proletariat and the peasantry\\". I think Trotsky's discussion of this is confusing. I recommend \\"Their Trotsky and Ours\\" by Jack Barnes. There is also a good debate in \\"Bolshevism and the Russian Revolution\\" by Doug Jenness, Ernest Mandel, and V.I. Lenin.(3) Another reviewer pointed out that this book is available online. However, the printed version has glossaries of people, places, organizations and unfamiliar terms; a more complete chronology; and a thorough index. I relied very heavily on all of these, so much so that I used color-coded post-its to turn to them easily. Also, parts of the online version are full of obvious typos; books from Pathfinder Press are proofread very thoroughly.(4) Finally, I recommend the ads in the back of the book. Pathfinder Press is defined by a political goal, not commercial success. It aims to provide a platform for revolutionary leaders speaking in their own words. If you like one book, you will probably like others."},{"Title":"The History of the Russian Revolution","review":"Leon Trotsky's History of the Russian Revolution is partisan history at its best. One does not and should not, at least in this day in age, ask historians to be \`objective'. One simply asks that the historian present his or her narrative and analysis and get out of the way. Trotsky meets that criterion. Furthermore, in Trotsky's case there is nothing like having a central actor in that drama, who can also write brilliantly and wittily, give his interpretation of the important events and undercurrents swirling around Russia in 1917. If you are looking for a general history of the revolution or want an analysis of what the revolution meant for the fate of various nations after World War I or its affect on world geopolitics look elsewhere. E.H. Carr's History of the Russian Revolution offers an excellent multi-volume set that tells that story through the 1920's. Or if you want to know what the various parliamentary leaders, both bourgeois and Soviet, were thinking and doing from a moderately leftist viewpoint read Sukhanov's Notes on the Russian Revolution. For a more journalistic account John Reed's classic Ten Days That Shook the World is invaluable. Trotsky covers some of this material as well. However, if additionally, you want to get a feel for the molecular process of the Russian Revolution in its ebbs and flows down at the base in the masses where the revolution was made Trotsky's is the book for you.The life of Leon Trotsky is intimately intertwined with the rise and decline of the Russian Revolution in the first part of the 20th century. As a young man, like an extraordinary number of talented Russian youth, he entered the revolutionary struggle against Czarism in the late 1890's. Shortly thereafter he embraced what became a lifelong devotion to a Marxist political perspective. However, except for the period of the 1905 Revolution when Trotsky was chairman of the Petrograd Soviet and later in 1912 when he tried to unite all the Russian Social Democratic forces in an ill-fated unity conference, which goes down in history as the \`August Bloc', he was essentially a free lancer in the international socialist movement. At that time Trotsky saw the Bolsheviks as \\"sectarians\\" as it was not clear to him at that time that for socialist revolution to be successful the reformist and revolutionary wings of the movement had to be organizationally split. With the coming of World War I Trotsky drew closer to Bolshevik positions but did not actually join the party until the summer of 1917 when he entered the Central Committee after the fusion of his organization, the Inter-District Organization, and the Bolsheviks. This act represented an important and decisive switch in his understanding of the necessity of a revolutionary workers party to lead the revolution.As Trotsky himself noted, although he was a late comer to the concept of a Bolshevik Party that delay only instilled in him a greater understanding of the need for a vanguard revolutionary workers party to lead the revolutionary struggles. This understanding underscored his political analysis throughout the rest of his career as a Soviet official and as the leader of the struggle of the Left Opposition against the Stalinist degeneration of the Russian Revolution. After his defeat at the hands of Stalin and his henchmen Trotsky wrote these three volumes in exile in Turkey from 1930 to 1932. At that time Trotsky was not only trying to draw the lessons of the Revolution from an historian's perspective but to teach new cadre the necessary lessons of that struggle as he tried first reform the Bolshevik Party and the Communist International and then later, after that position became politically untenable , to form a new, revolutionary Fourth International. Trotsky was still fighting from this perspective in defense of the gains of the Russian Revolution when a Stalinist agent cut him down. Thus, without doubt, beyond a keen historian's eye for detail and antidote, Trotsky's political insights developed over long experience give his volumes an invaluable added dimension not found in other sources on the Russian Revolution.As a result of the Bolshevik seizure of power the so-called Russian Question was the central question for world politics throughout most of the 20th century. That central question ended practically with the demise of the Soviet Union in the early 1990's. However, there are still lessons, not all negative, to be learned from the experience of the Russian Revolution. Today, an understanding of this experience is the task for the natural audience for this book, the young alienated radicals of Western society.The central preoccupation of Trotsky's volumes reviewed here and of his later political career concerns the problem of the crisis of revolutionary leadership of the international labor movement and its national components. That problem can be stated as the gap between the already existing objective conditions necessary for beginning socialist construction based on the current level of capitalist development and the immaturity or lack of revolutionary leadership to overthrow the old order. From the European Revolutions of 1848 on, not excepting the heroic Paris Commune, until his time the only successful working class revolution had been in led by the Bolsheviks in Russia in 1917. Why? Anarchists may look back to the Paris Commune or forward to the Spanish Civil War in 1936 for solace but the plain fact is that absent a revolutionary party those struggles were defeated without establishing the prerequisites for socialism. History has indicated that a revolutionary party that has assimilated the lessons of the past and is rooted in the working class allied with and leading the plebian masses in its wake is the only way to bring the socialist program to fruition. That hard truth shines through Trotsky's three volumes. Unfortunately, this is still the central problem confronting the international labor movement today. Read this book many times."},{"Title":"The History of the Russian Revolution","review":"Considered by some to be the greatest 20th century work of history, Trotsky's masterpiece could equally be considered great literature. Trotsky's &quot;protagonist&quot; is the Petrograd working class, whose consciousness develops under the ebb and flow of the revolution. Trotsky writes with superb eye for individual detail, his crowd scenes as masterly as Tolstoy's battles. This is one of the great works of the 20th century."},{"Title":"The History of the Russian Revolution","review":"If you're looking for a light read, Trotsky's History of Russian Revolution is not the way to go by any means. But, despite its length, and despite the enormity of its topic, this is an amazingly accessible and engrossing account of one of the modern world's most important political and historical events, written by one of its main players. There are certainly some parts that are more difficult than others, and some where clearly Trotsky assumes an understanding of what happened in Russia during 1917 - an expectation of his readers that would have been utterly reasonable for the audience he was writing for, at the time he was writing, but which at times can be a bit confusing for a Westerner reading it almost 100 years later. But this is only occasionally frustrating and there is, in any event, a very helpful set of appendices and glossaris at the back that help you know who's who and what's what. It is, undoubtedly in my view, well worth the effort that it will take you to get through it. I don't think any other history of the revolution is as detailed, as comprehensive, and as engaging as this. There are times when it really has you on the edge of your seat - and that, no doubt, is largely because it is written by someone who was actually there.Max Eastman, who was a friend of Trotsky, gives us a translation that feels tremendously fresh and was enthusiastically endorsed by Trotsky himself."},{"Title":"The History of the Russian Revolution","review":"If you want to learn how to change the world, read this book, not for the history, but for the practical realities of struggle, of how working people, peasants, oppressed nationalities, in struggle can topple what might seem an invincible and unjust regime. If this is a literary masterpiece, if it gives the real history, if it is a great analysis, it is because the writer wanted to share the experience of working people of the Old Russian Empire with people of the world, because he knew there would be a future that needed this book. This is that future!This is best read with volumes 25,26,27, & 28 of Lenin's collected worksWhile this book is not always available on Amazon, it is always available from BooksfromPathfinder, an Amazon Z store that you can get to by clicking on New and Used further up this page!"},{"Title":"The History of the Russian Revolution","review":"This is one of the most exciting books I've ever read. It tells the amazing story of the Russian revolution of 1917, from the overthrow of the Czar to the Bolshevik Revolution of October. What makes it an incredible read is that the author, Leon Trotsky, was at the middle of it all, as one of the central planners of the insurrection that took power. Trotsky was a great revolutionary and great writer. But one thing I especially like about the book is that Trotsky uses excerpts from many other accounts, including those who hated him with a passion, to tell the story accurately. It is an inspiring story, especially for new generations of young people, workers and farmers who need to learn about an example showing that the dog-eat-dog system of capitalism we live in can be overthrown. For the definitive account of how this great revolution was later derailed, see Trotsky's Revolution Betrayed."},{"Title":"The History of the Russian Revolution","review":"What a fantastic book! This is the Russian Revolution that you were never taught in school, full of fascinating detail. It shows you how workers can run society, and is a welcome antidote to all the right wing and Stalinist rubbish that has been written about the Russian Revolution in the last 80 years. Leon Trotsky was one of the great thinkers of the 20th century and his genius shines through in this magnificent book. Don't be put off by images of dry, dusty, incomprehensible academia - 'History of the Russian Revolution' is a vibrant living book which is just as valid and relevant today as when it was first published."},{"Title":"The History of the Russian Revolution","review":"This book provides a very unique perspective into the Russian Revolution. Written by Leon Trotsky himself, it is an excellent way to get first hand information on the events of the revolution. Furthermore, it is very interesting to read how a leader of the revolution viewed the event after several years. Trotsky is an excellent writer, and his book is very detailed. My one warning is that if you don't know much about the Russian Revolution to begin with you may get somewhat confused because of the great amount of detail in this book.Trotsky's History of the Russian Revolution is written in the third person - just as a historian would write it - not in a first person narrative. After reading the book for a while, I sometimes even forget that it was written by Trotsky. Then, when some bizarre interpretation appears, I think - &quot;What is this? Who wrote this book?&quot; only to realize that, obviously, the book is written by Trotsky and would naturally be biased!Even if you don't read the entire book, just reading some of the passages can give you a very facinating perspective into the revolution. After all, Trotsky was one of the most important leaders during the revolution. It is not often that a revolutionary leader has time to record the events he lived through. Luckily for us, Trotsky did write an account of the Russian Revolution, an event that has clearly had immense influence on world history! So, I would totally recommend this book - read it, and see what Trotsky himself has to say!"},{"Title":"The History of the Russian Revolution","review":"Trotsky's History of the Russian Revolution is a long, very complex, and extremely detailed treatment of the remarkably eventful period from February to October of 1917. Russia at the time was at war with Germany as part of an entente or three-country coalition that also included Great Britain and France. The Russian army was doing badly, its troops were ill-equipped and poorly supplied with essentials, and desertion and simple refusal to fight were commonplace. Some on the Russian political left, conspicuously the Bolsehviks led by Lenin and Trotsky, called for a separate peace, thereby hoping to put an end to the slaughter of Russians and enabling Russia's largely peasant army to return to its small plots of land.Russia, however, was still an hereditary monarchy, headed by Tsar Nicholas II. The Tsar was oblivious to his army's mounting losses and indifferent to the privations suffered by most Russian citizens. He was insular, oddly detached, inexplicably cheerful, and easily led by the Tsarina, who was under the pernicious influence of Rasputin, a semi-literate monk who ostensibly possessed preternatural foresight and wisdom.In February, with conditions throughout the country insufferably deteriorating and the army becoming more disorganized, ineffective, and badly bloodied, the Tsar was forced to abdicate. His most likely heirs had no interest in succeeding him, preferring lives of untroubled leisure. Mainstream political parties, including the Mensheviks and mis-named Social Revolutionaries, were indifferent to taking power, recognizing that Russia might prove to be simply ungovernable. On the left, the Bolsheviks were regarded by many as ideologically and programatically ill-suited to fostering the best interests of a state that was shedding the ill-fitting cloak of monarchy in favor a liberal-bourgeois regime.However, the liberal-bourgeois coalition that came to power in July proved as ill-suited to governing as its immediate predecessor. Yes, a revolution had occurred. Russia struggled into the 20th Century having divested itself of the most obvious and outmoded institutions peculiar to a monarchy. But the coalition-based liberal-bourgeois state that succeeded the rule of Nicholas II was equally ineffectual and even more unstable.All the while, the Bolsheviks, champions of the proletariat, the small peasants, and the front-line,trench-bound soldiers were anticipating and planning for an insurrection that would open the way for creation of a genuinely socialist state. As the popularity of the once-discounted Bolsheviks grew and conditions within Russia and at the front became increasingly intolerable, occurrence of an insurrection followed by a full-blown revolution became more likely. In late October the insurrection erupted, and the Bolsheviks were ready.This historical sketch does not begin to do justice to the astonishing mastery of detail and profound interpretative power that Trotsky brings to bear in his history of the Russian Revolution. The reader can only imagine that Trotsky had to be a man who never slept and never stopped thinking, observing, and reading, a revolutionary intellectual in the most powerful sense.At the same time, and recognizing that this book was originally published in three volumes, it's not difficult to find ways in which judicious editing could have made Trotsky's History shorter while losing nothing of importance. The book is interesting throughout, but there is so much material that it's hard not to lose the connections between various parts, from start to finish, of Trotsky's magnificent story. Trotsky, no doubt, would have had effective arguments for leaving the book just as it is.In view of the book's subject and length, I was surprised to find so few references to Marx as providing material useful in guiding the work of the Bolsheviks. Trotsky, unquestionably, benefited from reading Marx, but Marx seems clearly to have been but one source among many that Trotsky used in thinking about the development and destruction of social systems.Given the time and the place, even more surprising is the near-total physical absence of Lenin. Trotsky repeatedly, perhaps even gushingly, pays homage to Lenin as the wellspring of revolutionary wisdom. Perhaps so. In Trotsky's history, however, Lenin is almost always out of the country, in deep hiding, or incapacitated by illness. For one who held that being close to the people and sharing their struggles was essential to understanding the class-based nature of a society and its development, this seems a debilitating handicap. Perhaps Trotsky underestimates his own contribution and overvalues that of Lenin.Trotsky acknowledges that the work of any historian is open to charges of incidental subjectivity, tendentious selectivity, and self-interested interpretation. He holds, however, that his adherence to the materialist method provides safeguards against such sources of error. In making this claim, he uses the term \\"method\\" not as referring to a set of procedures and techniques, but a perspective, much as, say, Gadamer uses hermeneutics in Truth and Method. In my view, claims such as this are impossible to evaluate, and it would be remarkable, indeed, if Trotsky's History were not influenced by his own peculiar perspective. In that regard he is like the rest of us: his and our flights of fancy are constrained by the knowledge that others are studying the same thing. Trotsky fairly often refers to the work of other historians of the Revolution, including those on the right, especially Milulov, with whom he agrees more often than he disagrees. In Trotsky's case, however, it seems reasonable to argue that his actual method was his brilliance.Making a revolution is one thing, but building a socialist society is quite another. Trotsky understood this perfectly well. However, governing by giving \\"all power to the soviets,\\" while it may have a stirring populist appeal, is not self-explanatory. How Trotsky, Lenin, and others expected this to work is not evident; perhaps it was something that had to develop historically.Finally, both Trotsky and Lenin were convinced that \\"socialism in one country\\" would not last. Surrounded by capitalist nations, an isolated socialist state would soon be overwhelmed by bourgeois interests that governed the context in which it was located. Acknowledging the need to foment socialist revolution as, ultimately, a world-wide phenomenon is all well and good, but how does one transform the entire planet.Trotsky's History of the Russian Revolution is a demanding book, one that merits careful study. Given its length and complexity, however, it's difficult not to give up on it. Nevertheless, sticking it out until the end proves worth the effort."},{"Title":"The History of the Russian Revolution","review":"Whatever Trotsky's faults or your own political persuasion, his own history of the Russian Revolution is an excellently written, engaging and energetic work. Openly biased and without apology, Trotsky recounts the events before, during and after the Bolsheviks rise. Essential to understanding the motivations and mindset of one of history's greatest revolutionaries."},{"Title":"The corner : a year in the life of an inner-city neighborhood","review":"The Corner is a very telling book. It gives the outsider a close-up view of the life on an inner-city drug corner. These drug corners have one simple overarching rule: You need the blast and nothing else matters. The authors also try to make sense of the whole tradgedy through their own outside comments about the police, the welfare system, and the like. In addition to that, the true story takes on the form a novel, letting you into the daily life of the McCullough family. I couldn't help but feel some type of connection with characters like DeAndre, Fran, and Gary. As I read on, I couldn't help but care for these people, to feel happy when things went right for them and to be a little sad when things went wrong. It was an enjoyable book to read, but a little repetitive. Perhaps that was the authors' plan to drive the idea home, but I think it could have been cut down a little without losing the point. Still, don't let this stop anyone from reading this book."},{"Title":"The corner : a year in the life of an inner-city neighborhood","review":"This is must reading for those concerned about the fate of our cities and about social justice."},{"Title":"The corner : a year in the life of an inner-city neighborhood","review":"An explaination as to why in 30 years of action plans etc the problem still exists.

I only came back to the issue because I lent somebody a copy of \\"Homicide\\" and was thinking about Simon's work. This is in many ways a much better book but you won't enjoy it.

Long and sometimes pedantic, but the characters are all real and the book lets the authors get deeper into their heads; worth a read if you're a Wire junkie. (And if you're not a Wire junkie, this will all be new to you anyway. ...but you might as well start by watching the show. Thank me later.)"},{"Title":"The corner : a year in the life of an inner-city neighborhood","review":"If you are a fan of HBO's the Wire this is for you. I have been a fan of the David Simon/Ed Lynch team since Homicide, Life on the Streets. The Corner is the second prong of the Baltimore set books/ television series 1. Homicide 2.The Corner 3. The Wire trilogy. Similiar to Homicide, Life on the Streets, The Corner is a year long academic observation through the eyes of a team of a reporter and police officer/educator. The is no arch. No beginning/middle/end. Just the calendar. The observations are real-time, using the street's dialogue. Since, the language is unique to Baltimore at times , it could be a tough read. There are no winners or losers. No heros. No moral. No Grand Plan. No car chases. No surprises. No excitement. Just solid, plain matter of fact reporting of the life and death struggles of those who share this forgotten patch of an American urban northeast city. The book's focus is the daily struggles of the bottom dwellers/the have nots (the junkies,thieves, police, not for profits and the educators.) The book explores the dirty little secret that places like this are a reality in our America. The book sheds light on the fact that there is thin line between those in law enforcement and education and the corner. That there are American children who have been forced to be thier own parents. Surviving along aside the good parents fighting for thier own children. This book is not for those who live/d the life (city police/urban poor.) If you did not like Homicide, Life on the Streets this is not for you. If you liked Homicide, you may enjoy The Corner. For this study is deeper in the narcotic demand culture of the user/street dealer. Rather than their law enforcement brethern. If you are a fan of HBO's The Corner you will enjoy this book because although you are familair with the characters. The book will bring the characters to life and you will leave you with a better understanding of how America thrives while one of it's cities dies and is never able to resurect. This book is for the fan's of HBO's The Wire who don't understand the everyday complexities that face the poor, uneducated, under employed. This book is for academia and the Ivy Tower elite. Who enjoy the grittiness of The Wire. However, don't understand it. This book will ready those with a new skill set for the next season. Recommend."},{"Title":"The corner : a year in the life of an inner-city neighborhood","review":"I read this book in January 1996, shortly after it came out I'm pretty sure. I saw it displayed on a bookshelf in the library and somehow was struck by its cover and decided on a whim to leaf through the first few pages. After that I couldn't put it down. The book made a searing impression on me - it's been so many years later but it is still one of those stories (a true one unfortunately) that weighs on my mind. One thing I liked about it was its honesty. It didn't pretend to know any easy answers to the problems it documented. The authors just told the story as they saw it and as truthfully as they could. Ever since then this book has been a reminder to me that every person has a whole, complicated story behind them and that making snap assumptions about someone's character or whatever because he or she is a drug addict or anything else is foolish. For all the people who are \\"successful\\" in America, you've got to wonder exactly how \\"successful\\" they'd be if they happened to be born and grow up in the kind of environment depicted in the book. That provides a different kind of test of character that most people, including myself, will likely never even face. Anyone whose only answer to these problems is made up of moralizing platitudes of whatever political stripe is full of hogwash and should be more honest with themselves. When friends told me about \\"The Wire\\" much later on, I remember thinking, hmm, that sounds awfully like that book I read - and of course it turned out that's no coincidence. I'm watching and enjoying episodes of \\"The Wire\\" on dvd now, but I would still say that this book is a whole lot more powerful and heartily recommend it to fans of the series."},{"Title":"The corner : a year in the life of an inner-city neighborhood","review":"I bought the book after I was absolutely enthralled by the mini-series. The book and movie both give you a very emotionally capturing look into the world of the drug corners of every inner city ghetto. In the book's case, it focuses on life in the most dangerous ones of Baltimore, homicide capital of the USA. The book is a stunningly accurate portrayal of a world that is often forgotten, neglected or never talked about.So far I would say the book is even better than the mini-series as it contains much more detailed information, many new stories, and the world of the corner through the eyes of many new perspectives that are only briefly mentioned in the mini-series movie."},{"Title":"The corner : a year in the life of an inner-city neighborhood","review":"David Simon and Ed Burns studied a typical inner-city American neighborhood over the course of a year in 1993 and this book is the journalistic enterprise that reports on what they learned. We are presented with a West Baltimore universe that could be, and most likely is, representative of any city's neighborhood that has two things: poverty and open-air drug markets. We are presented with the experiences of those involved in that drug culture and those still trying to live among it while doing what they think is right.It is a satisfying read in that you never get the sense that you are not getting the real deal. And that is the singular reason that it is so heartbreaking. To see people give so much to get out of the hell that they are in and fail again and again is almost too much to bear. You may not be able to contain your tears when you discover the final fate of Gary McCullough. You understand why this was the only way that it could have ended for him and the fact that you understand why just breaks your heart. This book is not supposed to be hopeless and it definitely is not. The authors make it pretty clear that there is a way out of this and it is certainly not what we are doing now. Until we can see these people involved in the \\"War on Drugs\\" as human beings we haven't even gone through the first step. When all we are willing to do is cut welfare and build more prisons we, and by we I mean all of us in America, are doomed.The most interesting aspect of this book are the chapter parts that sometime show up that are essentially a set of facts that elucidate the part that just happened and the ones to come. These facts apply to West Baltimore but can be generalized to any inner-city drug culture. They are very eye opening and beautifully allow you to look at things in a way that you never even thought of before. These make the lives of all of these people make so much sense but the sense is senseless. As Ella Thompson likes to say: \\"It just doesn't make sense.\\" But it does and she knows this. It is just that the knowledge is too painful."},{"Title":"The corner : a year in the life of an inner-city neighborhood","review":"David Simon and Edward Burns have managed the seemingly unthinkable: they have written a piece of non-fiction about street level drug addicts and hustlers with compassion and humanity, that confronts rather than conceals the harshness of their lives.&quot;The Corner&quot; chronicles &quot;A Year in the Life of an Inner-City Nieghborhood,&quot; following members of the McCullough family through the streets of West Baltimore. We witness drug dealing and shooting galleries, theft and arrest and violence. We see the glimmerings of hope extinguished, and innocent lives wrent by little more than circumstance. But &quot;The Corner&quot; does more than document the course of ongoing disaster. It is a reminder of things lost, of things that should have been, and of how broad social trends have narrow human consequences.While &quot;The Corner&quot; has been criticized for its lack of proposed solutions, its most important function is not so much in advocacy, but in clarifying the human impact of social policy (or lack there-of). The pointlessness of the war on drugs, the need for real capital investment in human potential, and revealing the face of &quot;urban poverty&quot;: these are the issues that the text exemplifies. Balzac, Dickens, and Steinbeck all used fiction to advance their social arguments. Much of what the wrote was to raise awareness of conditions they found offensive: very few novels were appended with blue-prints to rebuild the world. Because the authors of &quot;The Corner&quot; use facts, they are not liable for the ressurection of West Baltimore. If there's a fire you yell fire, whether or not there's a hydrant handy.Some other works that talk about the causes of problems that are at least parallel to those observed in &quot;The Corner&quot; are Stephanie Coontz's &quot;The Way We Never Were,&quot; and discussing California and Los Angeles respectively (although having broader analytic implications) are Peter Schrag's &quot;Paradise Lost,&quot; and Mike Davis's &quot;City of Quartz.&quot; And for those who feel I'm hawking nothing but revisionist leftist history, I recomend Lawrence W. Levine's &quot;The Opening of the American Mind.&quot; So there."},{"Title":"The corner : a year in the life of an inner-city neighborhood","review":"This is the second time I picked up this book, but finally had time to finish it. It's a difficult book to read, but very rewarding. The drug culture is so strong and takes a toll on the people. It made me want to write my congressman to request more money for treatment and rehab. A modernday Dickens, a true masterpiece."},{"Title":"The corner : a year in the life of an inner-city neighborhood","review":"This book was absolutely moving. The story that Simon and Burns tell is brutally honest. By the end of the book, it feels as if you have spent the year on Mount and Fayette watching the struggles of DeAndre, Fran, Gary and countless others. The fact that the book is a documentary is a unnerving reminder that the problems of the inner-city are real and cannot be solved by simply throwing dollars at government programs."},{"Title":"The corner : a year in the life of an inner-city neighborhood","review":"I read this book for my family law class and I was very impressed with the detailed characters and intense research done by the authors.

A truely amazing portrayal of human life."},{"Title":"The corner : a year in the life of an inner-city neighborhood","review":"This book is a 1990s version of a classical sociological text, Tally's Corner, in which a researcher hung out on an urban street corner and watched the life around him. Needless to say, lots has changed, and none of it for the better. This is an unrelenting story of drugs, sex and the pressures of every day life for inner city Baltimore. Simon and Burns do an excellent job delving into the private lives of the individuals involved, and an even better job when they use a page or two to comment on the overall problem they are describing. When one of the characters happens to show up at school, they write generally about the problems facing city schools. This book isn't a 10 because it got to be, frankly, too much. Every day dragged into every other day, into the next day or drugs or gangs or smoking crack. I found myself skipping forward and not missing much. An even larger problem I found after having read through the book was the question not answered: How does anyone succeed in that environment? The book supplements what we read in the newspaper and see every day on TV. What we don't see that often, and what such a book could do, is to highlight how students do attend school and do get good grades and how families do make it, either in the neighborhood or out, in the face of such unrelenting pressures of the drug and gang culture. Those would be worthy subjects for someone's next book."},{"Title":"The corner : a year in the life of an inner-city neighborhood","review":"&quot;The Corner reads like a brilliant, heartbreaking novel, and at the same time it's as important a social document as any to be written on such a theme.&quot; Review date 9/28/97"},{"Title":"The corner : a year in the life of an inner-city neighborhood","review":"how do i know i've read an incredible ethnography?? when I'm done, and I put the book down, I am overwhelmed with emotion and I cannot stop thinking about the book for weeks. this is that ethography!

My Aunt's house was three blocks South of The Corner and my memories are nothing but good of the area in the 1960's. This book demonstrates what the drug epidemic does not only to a family but to large sections of the city. Gary, Fran and DeAndre are not caught up in the epidemic, but washed away from it. Simon has a style of writing that is both entertaining, yet captivating. The psychology of what is transpiring between DeAndre and his teenage girlfriend after she discovers she is pregnant is one of the best examples of Simon's insight and style. He is very much a modern journalist, but his work in bringing a depressing and explosive environment to the reader is impressive. Read his work and watch the shows, \\"Homicide,\\" \\"The Wire,\\" \\"The Corner,\\" and the newest HBO show \\"Generation Kill\\" because Mr. Simon is the wave of not only new journalism, but new programming. I feel this is his best written work and the subject matter makes it a must read."},{"Title":"The corner : a year in the life of an inner-city neighborhood","review":"The Corner clearly tells us about the life of inner-city neighborhoods and its inhabitants. The dark side of the world is revealed through extremely realistic descriptions, terrible moments of life that are so usual in there. The gap is deep, the suffering is obvious, hope just behind, so present in minds, but so abstract. Future is only tomorrow, violence is evidence, fear is everyday...I advise to watch The Wire, a good complement to this amazing book!"},{"Title":"The corner : a year in the life of an inner-city neighborhood","review":"Fans of David Simon who are preparing to mourn the imminent end of The Wire on HBO should definitely check out this massively powerful book, if they haven't already done so. Simon and Burns's impressively detailed and nuanced depiction of one year on a drug corner in an impoverished Baltimore neighborhood grows into a scathing indictment, not only of the narcotics business but of a failed criminal justice system as well. This is not light reading by any stretch of the imagination, but well worth it. A hard book to forget, and that's a good thing."},{"Title":"The corner : a year in the life of an inner-city neighborhood","review":"I think everyone in the United States should read this book. The authors put the reader on a West Baltimore corner looking at it through a first person perspective. I don't think we can understand our society and the policies we try to implement unless we understand the people these policies are directed towards. This book puts a face on the truly poor, the drug addicts, and those trapped on the brutal drug corners of many cities. The book shows the reader how so often the policies adopted by elected officials and idealogues miss the point and end up failing. When we understand the lives of those of the bottom, only then can we help them."},{"Title":"The corner : a year in the life of an inner-city neighborhood","review":"I just finished reading The Corner for my bookclub and truly enjoyed it. Although it took a while for me to get into the book I felt more and more connected to the characters, learned about ghetto culture and understandood more the drug addict's lifestyle as the book progressed.In The Corner, opportunities were both a curse and a blessing. Gary having a job at the [...] place was good because he didn't have to do any dangerous capers. But having so much money fueled his addiction. When Fran was clean, she began to have hope for her family and her own future. But she then became very disconnected from most of her familiar life, and, in turn, very lonely and unhappy.What was clear to me is that the social structures have to be available for people. I don't think we can spend too much in this area. Every piece should be there even if they don't all work perfectly. The educational system and the justice system, which are deeply flawed served an important purpose. DeAndre was deterred from the streets out of fear of going back to the juv. detention center. Tyreeka was able to make something of her life via higher education. Access to the homeless program, drug rehab and social programs were essential stepping stones to Blue's and Fran's long term rehabilitation.By the time i finished the book, I felt connected to the folks on the corner, less judgemental and sympathetic to them and their daily struggles to survive."},{"Title":"The corner : a year in the life of an inner-city neighborhood","review":"One of the outstanding books of our times.

This book is an eye-opener for those who have never had to deal with inner-city life and the constant battery it places on its inhabitants. The book is highly engrossing and the characters draw you in quickly. Be forewarned, once you pick this book up you will have a hard time putting it down. I took this book with me on a vacation and spent the whole time reading, and I didn't regret that decision at all!Gary McCullough is one of the most fascinating characters in any book I have read. I cried for him...what a shame that such a promising person was lost! I defy anyone to read this book and still feel contempt for people who are trapped in addiction. There are no simple solutions to the problems presented in this book, but it would be a nice change if the lawmakers in the US would at least open their eyes to the situation and make a real effort to learn about the issues that face those in the inner-cities. This book will challenge your notions of what it means to live in America, and you will never look at the inner city the same way again."},{"Title":"The corner : a year in the life of an inner-city neighborhood","review":"WEll i first want to start off by saying that this book was amazon and i actually saw the movie on hbo first then it made me go out and pick up the book.I just wish there could have been more scenes thats how much i enjoyed it.

The authors managed to capture the essence of the corner and its entraping qualities. I found myself helplessly attached to the characters. The book, however, does indeed go too far into public policy. The authors' analysis leaves much to want and tends to generalize the problem and places blame is the conventional places.

Don't close you eyes or turn your back on this subject; considering the rate of this disaster, it will soon be in a neighborhood near you."},{"Title":"The corner : a year in the life of an inner-city neighborhood","review":"There should be a sign posted at the corner of Fayette and Monroe Streets that reads &quot;Abandon all hope, ye who enter here&quot;. David Simon and Edward Burns take the reader on a Dantean trip through hell, leading us into the world of a drug-infested neighborhood in Baltimore. Here we meet Fat Curt, who keeps on keeping on until his body, ravaged from years of drug abuse, gives out; Ella Thompson, who never gave up on the neighborhood and its inhabitants; Gary and Fran, who threw the rich promise of their lives away on drugs, and their son DeAndre, a manchild who may never reach the promised land. Burns and Simon get us intricately involved in the lives of their subjects; and while we may react with disgust at Gary keeping on a straight course aimed at hitting rock bottom, we also feel sympathy and respect for Fran, who manages to get back up every time after she falls down. Above all, we feel the despair and disillusionment of the young people who learn from a very early age that to the rest of America, their lives have no meaning. What do these youngsters, left for the most part to raise themselves while their parents are strung out on drugs and living for nothing but their next hit, have to look forward to, when their role models are drug pushers and stickup men? Simon and Burns have been criticized for not offering answers, which would have lent an upbeat tone to this book. The criticism is beside the point. They have no answers and don't pretend to. Their aim is to show the reader how this country's &quot;anti-drug program&quot; is lacking in coherence, goals, or any kind of common sense, and in this they succeed admirably. What would have lent additional interest to this book is some exploration of how some of the people of the Corner, despite every strike being against them, manage to make positive lives for themselves when others try and fail, and some never seem to try at all: why is DeAndre still headed downhill when Preston, his friend and partner in crime, turned his life around, married, found a job, and moved his family out of the neighborhood? Why has Blue, an old Corner hand, stayed clean for three years when so many of his friends have died from drugs? How did Tyreeka, giving birth to DeAndre's son at age 14, manage to avoid another out of wedlock pregnancy, finish high school and look forward to college? And where has Fran found the strength to keep trying to get clean and stay clean when an overdose put Gary into a coffin? We can only pray that Fran stays straight this time, that DeAndre pulls his life out of the tailspin it has been going in, and that this country finally develops a meaningful drug policy that will offer some hope and some real assistance to the drug fiends on all of the nation's Corners."},{"Title":"The corner : a year in the life of an inner-city neighborhood","review":"I am a sociology major and at times we have to read some boringbooks, but this was not one of them.

If you don't come out with a better understanding of their world, then you didn't listen to what the authors were saying."},{"Title":"The corner : a year in the life of an inner-city neighborhood","review":"After reading and enjoying \`Homicide', I expected Simon and Burns to simply offer a conflicting story from the street perspective*. \`The Corner' exceeds the detective chronicles in presenting a compelling group of characters stuck in system that seems to be working against them.The brilliantly crafted story reads like fiction. BUT, those of you expecting \`The Wire', will find yourself on a very different journey.** The characters are richer and a larger palette is used in this Baltimore painting.While the series offered a subtle indictment of the US drug war, this book pulls no punches. Neither Simon nor Burns assign simple answers to these endemic issues, but they seem to have pinpointed the problem.Above all, this book is for those who desire a true understanding of the inner-city. While not dismissing personal responsibility, the story turns the \`bootstrap' notion on its head.\`The Corner' epitomizes how empathy grows through sustained, close examination. I'll finish with what may be my favorite paragraph in the book:\\"It's a reckoning of another kind, perhaps, and one that becomes a possibility only through the arrogance and certainty that so easily accompanies a well-planned and well-tended life. We know ourselves, we believe in ourselves; from what we value most, we grant ourselves the illusion that it's not chance and circumstance, that opportunity itself isn't the defining issue. We want the high ground; we want our own worth to be acknowledged. Morality, intelligence, values- we want those things measured and counted. We want it to be about US.\\"*which would've been fine**and you won't find a bigger \`Wire' fan than me"},{"Title":"The corner : a year in the life of an inner-city neighborhood","review":"well i wanted to rate this book with 4 and a half stars, but thats not possible. overall this book does exatley what it claims to do, &quot;take you into a year in the life of an inner city neiboorhood.&quot; it does an exellent job of showing how a street corner works, and how people end up spending there lives on the corner. it gives faces to people who are often seen as faceeless: drug addicts. the author(s) shows you that drug addiction, violence, and crime affect PEOPLE. not just numbers. you read the paper and see that someone was arrested for possesion of crack cocaine w/ intent to distribute. but that doesn't tell you the story of who that person is, and why they were selling drugs.... his book will show you who these people are, and how good people can do bad things when their backs are against the wall. it is not possible to read this book and not feel heartfelt sympathy for the characters. you will sit up at night and wonder, &quot;what has become of deandre mccullough, and fran boyd?&quot; my only complaint about the book is it's length. it's a long read that could have been shortened by editing out a few of the authors rants against the system that treats drug addicts as criminals and not sick people. his opinion (to me at least) is correct, but he keeps coming back to these rants over and over again. and each time he says the same thing using diffrent wording. towards the end i found myself skipping through pages of these self righteous rants so i could get back to THE STORY! overall though, this book was ecquisitly done, and i would recomend that you purchase it."},{"Title":"The corner : a year in the life of an inner-city neighborhood","review":"I had to read this book for my criminology class, and finished it early.

Mr. Simon follows around the denizens of a coke and heroin infested neighborhood in Baltimore, MD for a whole year as they deal with deindustrialization, crime, drugs, unemployment, an uncaring and unresponsive welfare system, a clueless criminal justice system, and urban blight. The withdrawal of government, industry and community from the neighborhood leaves a vacuum which is filled by what Mr. Simon calls &quot;the Corner&quot;--the open-air drug bazaar common to most American cities. People steal, strip cars and houses, and dissipate their welfare checks to feed their habit. Stepped up police and tougher laws make no dent in the problem. As the author says, if people are to say no to drugs, what is there to say yes to?The character portraits of this book are very telling and finely drawn. Especially poignant was the story of Gary, a man with a plan to leave the Corner by starting his own (legitimate) businesses and investing in stock funds. But the Corner brings him down too in the end as he succumbs to addiction, his brick home becomes a shooting gallery and his wife and children become caught up in the drug culture. Also well done was the portrait of Ella, the community activist without a community, a woman who vainly strives to instill a sense of neighborliness where none exists, where none can exist under the rules of the Corner.Mr. Simon has no words of comfort and much scorn for both liberals and conservatives. Liberals will find no solace in Simon's disdainful treatment of the educational system as largely irrelevant (as he says &quot;the students pretend to learn and the teachers learn to pretend to teach&quot;). Conservatives will reel from his repeated hectoring that the drug problem is one that will not go away after more arrests or more prisons.Mr. Simon is a master of nonfiction writing. If you like this book, check out &quot;Homicide: A Year on the Killing Streets.&quot;"},{"Title":"The corner : a year in the life of an inner-city neighborhood","review":"Disguised in the fabulous storytelling language and rollercoaster plot that gave us HOMICIDE: LIFE ON THE STREETS, the true tale of THE CORNER turns out to be information about the foundation of our society that everyone in the U.S. needs to read. In fact, those making drug policy and welfare policy should be required by law to read this book. Anyone who loves literature will love this."},{"Title":"The corner : a year in the life of an inner-city neighborhood","review":"I grew up in that neighborhood and many of my relatives still live there today. I believe I'm qualified to say that Simon's portrait of West Baltimore life is extremely accurate. However, the authors could have presented the complete story, Fat Curt wasn't always the soulless junky that Simon highlighted, he had a family and friends, I was one of them.Athletic talents got me out, but what of those that can't shoot a ball, or rap, or those that have to attend a West Baltimore public school. Life is tough in the ghetto, I think everyone knows that. Now Simon needs to write a book of solutions to the problem that he so profoundly explained."},{"Title":"The corner : a year in the life of an inner-city neighborhood","review":"Ignore the second editorial review quoted at the top - they've completely missed the point, the quality, and the impact of this book. It is some of the finest writing I've ever read, from any genre, and that's only one aspect missed in the editorial review above - this isn't sociology, it's storytelling. You could almost call it the Dickens of its time and place except the stories happen to be, I'm sure mostly, true. Beautifully written, it's incredibly readable despite being about a people Simon feels are beyond hope or saving. After all, how many of us would read a sociological treatise into the lives faced by those chained to an addictive drug economy? Very few, of course, and that's at least some of the point of The Corner. Tens of thousands will read this and come to understand a world foreign to them, a world previously made opaque by a compliant and apathetic media, and ring-fenced by academics and politicians alike. It's taken a master storyteller like David Simon to partner up with Ed Burns and share their tales and insight - insights which utterly gut the pretences of those who claim to be waging a noble War on Drugs. There is no war on drugs. There never was. There is only a government-sanctioned industry of institutionalised retribution against those who live in the drug economy. Finally, for those who read and enjoyed Homicide, this is written differently but as well or better. Yes, it's that good. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The corner : a year in the life of an inner-city neighborhood","review":"This was a fascinating book that gave me a new perspective on the hardships inner city youths and adults have to endure."},{"Title":"The corner : a year in the life of an inner-city neighborhood","review":"Simon and Burns, in one paragraph, display more talent and creativity than most writers will dispense in a lifetime.I bought this book 5 years ago.

Well, even of the heroin addicts, that'snot true. The books makes excuses for bad behavior -- living in sucha neighborhood = a criminal, drug-addled lifestyle. But we seeinstances in which the facts of the book prove this to be incorrect,e.g., the guy who joins the Navy, Ella, and -- to a lesser degree --Ella's son.The authors disagree, but one could find ample evidence here that thedrug war is winnable -- it would just take some juvenile justicereform, some judges and and an electorate with the backbone toenforce the law. The cops scoop 'em up, but they're right back atit, as judges mete out probation after probation. The authors say,\\"What's the solution? More prisons?\\" dismissively, but perhaps thatis the solution, as the average person who is engaged in criminalactivity full-time commits 400+ felonies per year -- at a cost tosociety far outweighing the cost of incarceration. Also, after thisbook was published, in the 1990s, tax increases to fund prison buildswere among the only popular taxes with voters and there wasevidence that higher incarceration rates lead to lower rates ofcrime.The book also makes it all too clear that the welfare state,supposedly gutted in the Reagan 80s, makes it all to easy for nonetoo deserving (in the sense that they largely or wholly created theirown problems -- by quitting jobs, using drugs, etc.) recipients toget a check. The authors claim the welfare payments (at the time) of$250 or so aren't much money, but ignore facts to the contrary intheir own book, e.g., no one has any money in West Baltimore, sothat's quite a bit in comparison, whole families were paying $30 permonth rent, etc."},{"Title":"The corner : a year in the life of an inner-city neighborhood","review":"I had heard quite a bit of positive buzz about this book, but if the &quot;characters&quot; weren't based on real people, this book would be the worst sort of white liberal breast-beating silliness. I had read Homicide, which was a somewhat compelling trashy book - at least the author had something in common with the people he was writing about.However, in this book, we get white man's guilt by two white men who, by hanging out with drug abusers for a year, believe that they give us a &quot;gritty view of the American dream gone bad&quot; or whatever the book jacket says. I think that by far the worst part of this book are the occasional glimpses into the &quot;inner thoughts&quot; of the characters, such as when Tyreeka ponders why DeAndre is chasing other girls, not paying attention to her at Christmas dinner, etc. C'mon, Tyreeka was thinking &quot;I wonder if I like vanilla?&quot; These &quot;characters&quot; are not the most introspective of people, so we mostly get Simon's introspections on their life.Fran, Fat Curt, Gary and the other castaways would have ended up at the bottom no matter where they had started. Drugs and prejudice are just convenient excuses."},{"Title":"The corner : a year in the life of an inner-city neighborhood","review":"...I lost interest in this book after I read about how one of its central characters tortured a cat."},{"Title":"The corner : a year in the life of an inner-city neighborhood","review":"David Simon's follow-up to Homicide, The Corner, is a look at the other side of the Baltimore crime beat. Simon and his collaborator, Burns, spent a year observing an active drug corner and the lives of it's key players and inhabitants. At times funny, triumphant, brooding, heartbreaking, and always compelling, their observations and insight into the reality of America's war on drugs, and the utter failure of drug policy, is eye opening. You'll never look at the drug problem, or the criminal justice system, the same way after reading this."},{"Title":"The corner : a year in the life of an inner-city neighborhood","review":"The copy of \\"The Corner\\" I ordered had been released from a library in Virginia because of, the red stamp in the front of the book read, \\"low demand.\\" Therein lies a reflection of the tragedy at the heart of the book.David Simon and Edward Burns portray a year in the life of a drug-ravaged West Baltimore neighborhood -- \\"the corner\\" -- represented primarily by Fayette and Monroe streets, the site of one of numerous open-air drug markets in the area. But \\"the corner\\" is also an entity, in Simons' and Burns' telling, a being that draws residents to it, demands their money and daily commitment and ultimately consumes them in their daily quest for a \\"blast.\\"A clutch of characters the two reporters followed live at the heart of this big, vital book. Fran Boyd and Gary McCullough, each addicts, are parents to DeAndre McCullough, a teenager slipping toward the corner. In the course of the year DeAndre fathers a child with 14-year-old Tyreeka Freamon, ultimately all but abandoning them. Various members of DeAndre's crew and \\"touts\\" for the dealers slide in and out of the narrative, many of them drifting toward death or prison.There is also a moving portrayal of Ella Thompson, a stubborn organizer of community resources who struggles mightily to wrest the underlying humanity she still sees in her neighborhood to the surface.Throughout the book the authors keep the reader teetering on a razor's edge of fear and very slim hope. The people who inhabit \\"The Corner\\" are damaged people. As a middle-class person I found myself disappointed and angry when DeAndre blows off a job for no good reason or Fran struggles bravely toward kicking her habit but falls back or the tout \\"Fat Curt,\\" gravely ill, fails to adhere to the medical care he so desperately needs. And we wonder why Gary, one of many members of a solid, hardworking family and a man who had gained a large measure of success and security in his life slid into an abyss of addiction.\\"The Corner\\" is not without a point of view on this subject. The book is an indictment of the futility of the war on drugs, the ineptitude of the public school system and the frankly uncaring attitude of governments at all level toward people they view as expendable in the grand scheme of American life.This book is painstakingly detailed, a masterpiece of sociological observation, but it is not a old, clinical report of a crumbling neighborhood. The authors look at what they see clearly and unflinchingly and allow the voices of their subjects to shine through. Those voices may make you uncomfortable, they may make you angry, they may make you nod in agreement, they may make you laugh. They are always real, and the authors' connection to them is obvious.I am afraid that books like the \\"Corner,\\" which portray urban life in the early and mid-90s, will more than ever be consigned to dusty library corners or the shelves of private collections like my own. Listen to the rhetoric of the 2012 presidential race and it's clear how completely the descendants of the characters on \\"The Corner\\" have been marginalized. While we wring our hands about \\"the middle class,\\" another class continues to struggle, as it has for years, outside our view.I was grateful for the small ray of hope that emerged at the end of \\"The Corner.\\" Grateful because it had to fight its way through so many layers of the sadness that is at the heart of this unforgettable book."},{"Title":"The corner : a year in the life of an inner-city neighborhood","review":"There is nothing new that I can add in praise of this book. What's depressing, disgusting, even, is that in the 14 years since this book was written nothing has changed for the better. As reviewer B. Marshall so succinctly stated: \\"There is no war on drugs. There never was. There is only a government-sanctioned industry of institutionalised retribution against those who live in the drug economy.\\" This is as true under Obama as it was under Nixon and everyone in between. The concept is so fundamentally flawed that it's hard to believe adult human beings thought it up.In any case... The primary purpose of this review is to reiterate the opinion of a 1997 reviewer: if you have not done so, you should read \\"Tally's Corner\\" by Elliot Liebow. Liebow wrote about an inner-city corner in Washington D.C. 30 years before Simon and Burns. The juxtaposition of the two books gives enormous emphasis to the rather horrid (though unfortunately not surprising) changes that occurred in those 30 years. Which, interestingly, include the entire span of The War on Drugs."},{"Title":"The corner : a year in the life of an inner-city neighborhood","review":"I've lived in Baltimore my entire life. Well to be fair. near Baltimore. I found this a compelling and interesting look at a social epidemic. For those of us that don't understand addiction or the situation in the inner cities first hand this is a mind blowing and outlook changing look at the situation from the side of those that live it every day. This series changed my entire outlook. If you like this try watching 'The Wire' and 'Homicide: Life on the Street'"},{"Title":"The corner : a year in the life of an inner-city neighborhood","review":"This book was excellent. It opens your eyes to how drugs in communities affect everyone not just those that choose to use them. It is a dose of reality for those who have not been exposed to drugs within their own community. It is a sad but true epidemic in today's society. If you would rather watch it than read it, I highly recommend purchasing the movie version. THIS IS A GREAT MOVIE FOR TEENS."},{"Title":"The corner : a year in the life of an inner-city neighborhood","review":"This is an eye opening account of life on the streets of Baltimore or any other American city where drugs, alcohol, and poverty prevails. Eye opening to me because this is my neighborhood; I live between Baltimore and Gilmore and McHenry and Gilmore. This book gave me the sight to see the disaster happening two blocks from my front door. I highly recommend this book to everyone. Don't close you eyes or turn your back on this subject; considering the rate of this disaster, it will soon be in a neighborhood near you."},{"Title":"The corner : a year in the life of an inner-city neighborhood","review":"After watching the HBO mini-series based on this book I had to read it. As always the TV did not do the book justice. I found this book very eye-opening. It not only tells the story of several different charactors, it explores the history and gradual deterioration of this neighborhood. A rude awakening. For me personally, I related almost every charactor to someone I've known and even found some of myself there. What a difference being born 10 miles from the corner makes. Never say never."},{"Title":"The corner : a year in the life of an inner-city neighborhood","review":"Thank you so much for humanizing the drug culture in our inner-cities. I learned so much, like drugging is extremely hard work, and yet the book also confirmed what I'd always believed: getting a job at McDonald's is not the answer to ending a drugging life. As I was sucked into this story, I found myself praying, crying, frustrated and hopeful for these people - but never condemning. This should be required reading for every social sciences course in this country."},{"Title":"The corner : a year in the life of an inner-city neighborhood","review":"I have worked near the area where the book takes place and can say that this is the best account of what it's like in the &quot;hood&quot; of Baltimore.

One of my clients spotted the book and became instantly interested. He knew all the people in the book, and lived right smack in the corner of the open air drug market. After talking with him, he said the book was extremely accurate - And yes the names are real. Blue is no longer at the house (it's another abandon rowhouse). Fat Curt has passed away. And yes - even with all the publicity, the users and dealers are still there. This is an excellent view of what life is like out htere. We are mostly outsiders and will never truely understand, but this book gets you just a little bit closer."},{"Title":"The corner : a year in the life of an inner-city neighborhood","review":"David Simon and Edward Burns have created a gripping and moving documentary of inner-city life. As a teacher who works not far from that corner and as a co-worker of Ella Thompson, I can tell you that everything in the book is real. I've stood on that corner and worked with Miss Ella's kids. The book hits the nail right on the head. It should be required reading for anyone thinking about working with urban issues."},{"Title":"The corner : a year in the life of an inner-city neighborhood","review":"This is by far one of the best books on the issues of poverty, drug addiction and the failure of social services that I have ever read. But, more than that, it is the heart wrenching story of a family and neighborhood caught in the torpor of the inner city. I came to care about all of the people as though I knew them. And I finally began to understand the dynamics of drug addiction and why all of our well intentioned social programs (welfare etc.) will never save us. Awe inspiring."},{"Title":"The corner : a year in the life of an inner-city neighborhood","review":"Simon proves that his reporting skills -- exhibited to tremendous effect in &quot;Homicide&quot; -- is no fluke. He and Burns have produced one of the three best works on urban America in the 1990s -- the others being &quot;The Promised Land&quot; by Nicholas Lemman and the film &quot;Hoop Dreams.&quot; While the story is unrelentingly grim, with only spare glimpses of hope amid the chaos of the corner, Simon and Burns do a wonderful job of making the plight of their subjects sympathetic in many cases. However, Simon and Burns engage in policy analysis that decries, accurately at times, the failure of public policy solutions, but then demure from offering cogent alternatives. Moreover, the epilogue seems to counter the book's overall point of view -- that addiction is far too complicated to solve with messages of self-reliance -- by portraying the successful (to date) recoveries of Fran Boyd and Blue as acts of sheer will. Nevertheless, the book is fascinating throughout and draws the reader to hope against hope that al"},{"Title":"The corner : a year in the life of an inner-city neighborhood","review":"&quot;These characters transcend stereotype. They shine forth as complex individuals, full of regret and irrational hope...David Simon and Edward Burns have written a horrible, wonderful book. Horrible in its revelation of a slow-motion civil war at the center of our nation. Wonderful in its reportorial depth, its narrative art and its recognition of common humanity.&quot;"},{"Title":"The corner : a year in the life of an inner-city neighborhood","review":"This is a book that every politician should read before he is allowed to talk about drugs. The years of legislation and the war on drugs has been unsuceessful. This book gives a account of how drugs have afffected the inner cities. The authors have done a great job in giving details about life and characters in Baltimore. Could not put down this book once I started reading in. Even though it is documentary it makes engrossing reading. Would recommend it!"},{"Title":"The corner : a year in the life of an inner-city neighborhood","review":"I would give this book 4 stars, overall it does exactley what it says it will, &quot;take you into a year in the life of an inner city neighborhood.&quot; It does an great job of showing how a street corner works, and how people end up spending there lives on the corner. This book gives faces to people who are often seen as nobody and faceless; drug addicts. David Simon and Edward Burns showed me that drug addiction, violence, and crime affect people, not just numbers. When you read the paper and see that someone was arrested for possession of crack cocaine with intent to distribute (sell), yeah now your informed but that doesn't tell you the story of who that person is, and why they were selling drugs. This book will show you who these people are, and how good people can do bad things when their backs are against the wall and they can't turn either way. This book will definitely grab your heart and you can't help but feel sympathy for the characters. One complaint about the book is its length. It's a long read that could have been shortened by editing out a few of the authors long spiels against the system that treats drug addicts as criminals and not sick people. Also I felt it started kind of slow and there were a few parts I was wondering if the story would speed up. Its like the authors were repeating themselves saying the same thing just using different wording. Towards the end I liked this book a lot but glad that the end was near. Overall though, this book was great, and would recommend it to anyone who can relate to this lifestyle or topic and anyone who is interested. You definitely have to care though because it can be slow at times."},{"Title":"The corner : a year in the life of an inner-city neighborhood","review":"Wonderful book. No pussy-footing in this book, it is an in your face look on The War on Drugs, and why it doesn't work. The author did a BEAUTIFUL job on describing this in words. I recommend this to the people who feel all drug addicts are criminals, and not sick with a terrible addiction. Your views will be changed when you hear THEIR story, and not the story the government has been feeding you all your life.(...)"},{"Title":"The corner : a year in the life of an inner-city neighborhood","review":"The Corner is a very telling book. It gives the outsider a close-up view of the life on an inner-city drug corner. These drug corners have one simple overarching rule: You need the blast and nothing else matters. The authors also try to make sense of the whole tradgedy through their own outside comments about the police, the welfare system, and the like. In addition to that, the true story takes on the form a novel, letting you into the daily life of the McCullough family. I couldn't help but feel some type of connection with characters like DeAndre, Fran, and Gary. As I read on, I couldn't help but care for these people, to feel happy when things went right for them and to be a little sad when things went wrong. It was an enjoyable book to read, but a little repetitive. Perhaps that was the authors' plan to drive the idea home, but I think it could have been cut down a little without losing the point. Still, don't let this stop anyone from reading this book."},{"Title":"The corner : a year in the life of an inner-city neighborhood","review":"A well written insight into the dark side of American society and the real victims of the drug war. Although, the rambling editorial comments can be bit much.Fans of The Wire will be able to pick out characters that in this book that the TV series is based on."},{"Title":"The corner : a year in the life of an inner-city neighborhood","review":"David Simon & Ed Burns bring you into a fascinating world - Inner City Baltimore - while interspersing big picture discussions about the War on Drugs. The \\"you are there\\" look at poverty, drugs, and the inner city makes this book impossible to put down, and the meditations on those topics and their causes makes this book impossible to stop thinking about. Even if you don't agree with their political conclusions, it's both an enlightening and emotionally provocative read. Also a must read for any Homicide or The Wire fans."},{"Title":"The corner : a year in the life of an inner-city neighborhood","review":"this book took me back to an area i grew-up in and escaped from in my early 20s. I've known many persons such as the characters in this book. They are real and do exist unfortantly. I am now employed and daily working with the court system in Baltimore, Maryland where I grew up. I know that some of these characters lives have not changed for the better at least because i've seen them in court. I know that the areas are worse than before because I visit them to do home visits for my job, and I know that the police still perform as they did when the book was written, and Baltimore's crime rate remains the same. Sad as it is, ther are still no real solutions to the problem that the arthors wrote about, and the corners are still in existance, but the players, or shall I say victims are becoming younger everyday. The faces are new and the conditions are worse. The Corner, in my opinion is a powerful story. Unlike some readers, I at times had to but it down, collect myself, and then pick it up at a latter time. To be in it, but not of it was hard and always is. To see that someone else has taken the time to witness it and but it into story is heartwrenching. I know these characters, feel for them, cry for them, and each day I pray for them."},{"Title":"The corner : a year in the life of an inner-city neighborhood","review":"The Corner is one of those stories that stops us out-to-save-the-world types in our tracks. What do you do with a situation like this? Police, politicians, charitable organizations, treatment centers, educators, and tireless optimistic reformers seem to be completely ineffective throughout the book. The book has its bright spots: when someone goes into rehab, when a long-term user leaves the corner for good, when one of the kids returns to school. But everyone knows, and the reader begins to have a sense, that the changes don't last long and tragedy will strike again, so why hope?But the book is much more than a recounting of failed social programs and policing. The Corner is the story of real people with real desires and dreams. All have dreams beyond the corner, but none have a way to get there. Some have fallen from successful pasts, and some were born into the strange West Baltimore economy of buying, selling, and using. The authors looked closely enough to know that Gary was once a successful businessman, that Fran was once planning to attend college, that Blue is an accomplished artist. But to most of America, they are faceless drug addicts who should know better, who should clean themselves up and get out of there.As the yearlong account unfolds, it is clear that getting &quot;out of there&quot; is not a realistic option. Few have any support system to speak of, and the government programs designed to help don't always-even if someone manages to navigate the endless bureaucracy. In the end, the corner triumphs in all but a few cases. The Corner is an eye-opening story that asks us to become aware of the people caught in situations like these in inner-city America. They are real people who have become completely detached from society at large, but they are still human beings. The book does not provide any answers, but it provokes thought as to what could possibly bring the people of every Fayette Street in every West Baltimore a glimmer of real hope.&quot;Empathy demands that we recognize ourselves in the faces at Mount and Fayette, that we acknowledge the addictive impulse as something more than simple lawlessness, that we begin to see the corner as the last refuge of the truly disowned.&quot; ---David Simon and Edward Burns"},{"Title":"The corner : a year in the life of an inner-city neighborhood","review":"I am a white suburban woman who began to read this book to learn about a life that is very different from my own and because I wanted to learn about the IV drug culture, having a cousin who shot drugs in NYC for 15 years. This book should be read by anyone who thinks that have the answer to the ills of the city, or education, or healthcare, or poverty or whatever. They will quickly see that the problems that plague our inner cities are much like trying to treat a cancer in the human body: you can't try and single out or isolate one specific problem area and try to fix it. You need to look at the entire system, taking into account the interconnectedness of these problems when you try and come up with a solution.It is naive and utterly foolish to think that you can isolate the issues of the city and solve them independently- you can't. I urge anyone who has any influence over public policy of any kind to spend a few days and read this book. It will forever alter your view on how to &quot;fix&quot; the problems of neighborhoods like these and make you realize you are up against something that is much bigger than it appears. And policy makers: it is not as easy as as having a war on drugs. You need to start by bringing a thriving economic job base back into our cities so people have the opportunity to become meaningfully employed and can try and have a chance at life. When you strip away one's economic opportunities- you are cutting off their blood supply. It is just that simple. A MUST READ FOR ALL ELECTED OFFICIALS IN THE USA!"},{"Title":"The corner : a year in the life of an inner-city neighborhood","review":"This is one of my top ten non-fiction books of all time. Here is why: First, it is well-written and intriguing. There is little to no academic jargon to wade through. It is a plain spoken book about the realities of inner-city life. It is not difficult to read in a literary sense, but certainly in an ethical and moral sense. This brings me to the second reason why I found it to be such an important book: It puts a face on the experiences of poor minorities living in urban areas. I'm 23 and I've been working in inner-city communities since I was 15. When I hear people talk disparagingly about minorities, inner-city youth, single moms, &quot;welfare moms,&quot; my heart breaks, and in many ways, I am also angry that people talks so much about a life they know so little about. I found that this book accurately put a face on the people who are so often referred to as one statistics or another (related to drugs, single moms, incarceration, welfare). There was no glorification and little over-victimization of the people in the book and their experiences as poor, black, and affected by drugs and the underground economy. This book should be required reading for all Americans who wish to learn more about and develop informed opinions about poor, inner-city communities and the people who live there. I find it particularly relevant to those interested in drug laws and sentencing, as well as access to drug treatment. I think that this would also be a very helpful book for people who work in urban areas or are planning to someday (social work, education, ministry). The book leaves very big questions to be answered by the reader. How do I judge the people in this book? What would I do if I grew up in such a community? How do I go forth from here? A very powerful book."},{"Title":"The corner : a year in the life of an inner-city neighborhood","review":"&quot;The Corner,&quot; by David Simon and Edward Burns, is one of the best books I've ever read.Nothing I've seen or read humanizes inner-city drug fiends, pushers, gang members quite like this does. By gaining the trust of the people of Monroe and Fayette streets in West Baltimore, the authors were able to put the reader in their shoes, capture their thoughts, dreams, and histories.Rather than glamorize drug use and gang violence as many books and movies do, it plainly shows the heartache experienced and the physical, emotional, and social barriers faced by people living in inner-cities.So many judge themselves to be morally and intellectually superior to those living in the inner-cities of our country. Simon and Burns do a masterful job demonstrating people of inner-city neighborhoods, for the most part, are victims of circumstance and, given the same upbringing, the same surroundings, the same resistance, those outsiders who judge them harshly would live no differently.Published in 1997, &quot;The Corner&quot; has received mostly glowing reviews. The few criticisms hurled its way usually center around a lack of solutions offered. Simon and Burns do not have the answers and don't pretend to.Their book effectively argues society's &quot;war on drugs&quot; has not only failed miserably, but is actually a war on the underclass itself.If a solution is to be reached in the upcoming century, it will be through a drastic change in attitude of the &quot;haves&quot; towards the &quot;havenots.&quot; This book and others like it may go a long way towards changing opinions and ultimately sparking a solution. I challenge the Rush Limbaughheads out there to read &quot;The Corner.&quot;"},{"Title":"The corner : a year in the life of an inner-city neighborhood","review":"The Corner was given to me by my fiance, who grew up two blocks from the actual 'corner'. Many of the individuals in the book were people he knew from childhood, grade school, the play grounds...I had the opportunity to ask many questions about people like Blue, Fat Curt, Gary, etc. These people became real to me and I was pulling for all of them to make it - to escape - to survive. My fiance left Baltimore for another life - but realizing that he grew up amidst the turmoil and temptation of The Corner - has given me a greater respect for him. He escaped - God help all of those who weren't so fortunate. I highly recommend this book to anyone - but especially to those who have never experienced the harsh reality of the inner city up close and personal. And once you read it, share it with a friend so everyone can come to realize how far this country has to come."},{"Title":"The corner : a year in the life of an inner-city neighborhood","review":"Books don't get much more powerful or moving than this.The premise is simple--Baltimore Sun reporter Simon (who's lately been earning acclaim as the driving force behind HBO's \\"The Wire\\" which takes place in the same area). spent a year living on or around one of the busiest drug markets in Baltimore and reports what he learned. In doing so, he tells the stories of the people who inhabit this world, street pushers, kids trying (although often not that hard) to stay straight and the parents who worry about them, when they're not too busy trying to score their next fix. The stories are harrowing--from hardcore junkies who spend their days cashing in scrap metal for cash to earn their next fix to families sharing one small bedroom in a walk up shooting gallery. Pretty much everybody is hoping for a change in fortunes, but the book offers few happy endings. In spite of this, its a fascinating glimpse of a world where most of Simon's readers will never go.The narrative is occasionally broken up by Simon's musings about the war on drugs. No matter where you fall on the political spectrum, its hard to disagree with Simon's belief that the war has failed, at least in this little corner of the world. There's a particularly powerful passage near the end where Simon flat out shatters the Horatio Alger myths that many middle-class suburbanites cling to, particularly the idea that should they find themselves in that situation, they'd simply apply a little Puritan gumption and work their way out their unfortunate circumstances. In the end, he doesn't offer any solutions and precious little hope.Yet, the characters who populate the corner are more than mindless junkies. They're human, with hopes and dreams and stories to tell. Perhaps Simon's greatest achievement is the way in which he employs his sharp eye and powers of observation to paint a wholly three-dimensional and, given the circumstances, refreshingly non-judgmental picture of a community in deep decline.In the end, its an amazing powerful read, one that will leave readers deeply affected and likely having shed at least a couple of tears along the way."},{"Title":"The corner : a year in the life of an inner-city neighborhood","review":"Reading 'The Corner', you are transported into West Baltimore and the life of the denizens of Monroe and Fayette. David Simons and Ed Burns attempts to put a face to the addicts that are normally ignored in people's everyday life.I was saddened by the hoplelessness and despair that most of the people felt, and also by the fact that these were real people, not characters that could be filed away for a later time. To use a worn cliche, this book is indeed an eye opener, telling the tale of people who fell and have no reason to hope for anything beyond the next blast from a pipe.This is not a book for the faint. The scenes are graphic and the writing allows for the reader to be there in real time as an observer.The writers chronicle a year in the life of residents who have their shares of ups and downs, positive and negative experiences. This is a book to be read with an open mind and open heart."},{"Title":"The corner : a year in the life of an inner-city neighborhood","review":"Having Not Only Read this Book but being in Enviroments such as this it's Something that A Larger Part OF Society refuses too Acknowledge.This Book Pulls No punches about The Surroundings.Drugs,Education&amp;Healthy Living are Something that all People want&amp;deserve.I got Mad Respect For HBO&amp;Charles Dutton for Bringing this Powerful Book too the Eyes.it's Ashame when Folks say that's their Problem.it's not a One-Sided thing it's America's Problem.Their is No WAR ON DRUGS!it's a WAR on People that Become Addicted Too them.People Matter No Matter What.it's very SAD&amp;Racist.for Folks want changes Read this Book&amp;try too Understand the Depths OF Pain felt.People Need OPPURTUNITY NOT INSTITUTION."},{"Title":"The corner : a year in the life of an inner-city neighborhood","review":"I live only a few miles or so away from the area described in &quot;The Corner,&quot; and have no doubt passed it many times, but it might as well be another world. The closest I ever got to realizing what the people on the corner of Monroe and Fayette Streets in Baltimore go through every day was a couple of visits I made to one of the elementary schools that is mentioned in the book, as part of a &quot;Big Brother&quot;-type program several years ago. And I was pretty young then, so I really didn't notice much. But still, the harrowing, hard-hitting, and heartbreaking tale of the parents and older siblings of the kids I met there, kids who were destined to follow in their footsteps just a few years after I left, held me in its grip for the most part. I was stunned to learn of the realities of Baltimore's inner city that until now I really did only hear about in reports on the evening news. David Simon and Edward Burns' reporting is so intimate, you really feel like you're right there. Even though I never knew DeAndre, Gary, Fran, Curt, Ella, or R.C., or the dozens of other characters in the book, I really felt as though I'd come to know them and was caught up in and moved by their stories.The stories of these people certainly tell the tale of the utter hoplessness of drug addiction on the streets, except for the privileged few, but here is the only real flaw in the book: Simon and Burns feel it necessary to stop frequently and spend about 10 pages bashing the &quot;drug war,&quot; arguing that it is incompetent and that for every soul who is rescued, a million more, and millions more after them, will be stuck on the streets no matter what we try to do. After reading about such people in firsthand accounts, we get that point pretty well. The authors overstate it almost to the point of overkill, and only make the book longer by doing so, but eventually, the story always takes over again and drives that point home much better than all those diatribes.If you think you know what the drug culture in the inner city is really like, then think again. And read &quot;The Corner,&quot; which puts a human face (Actually, many human faces) on the tragedy and will certainly help you see it through new eyes."},{"Title":"Chinese Women in a Century of Revolution, 1850-1950","review":"Few scholarly tomes are written covering the history of Chinese women -- at least in the Western World -- so this book comes as an interesting overview of one hundred years of Chinese history, from the foot-binding days at the edge of the Opium War, all the way through the Boxer Rebellion and the 1911 Revolution, to the Communist victory in 1949 and the establishment of the Marriage Law of the People's Republic of China in 1950 which helped liberalize Chinese women. It is an interesting look into the differences that have always existed between the women of Northern and Southern China, as well as the growth of the role of women in Chinese society form the middle of the 19th Century to the middle of the 20th. Given the scarcity of detailed works in the West regarding the rise of Chinese women in their society, the book is worth reading."},{"Title":"The Night Shimmy","review":"O.K., the title-fascinating the story-interesting, but could have better written, I think. The pictures-five stars, awesome pictures. They're like Magritte meets that pair of jams I had in the fifth grade. Incredible. They totally remind me of dreaming as a child-gorrilas in the trees in the park, lizards under my bed, kites that turn into parrots. Also, I'm inordinately fond of food references in children's books, so the bit about oatmeal with honey and milk is a big part of the book's appeal to me. The story is basically an imaginary friend book, but with a charming colorful twist."},{"Title":"Harry Cats Pet Puppy","review":"As a teacher, I have used Selden's &quot; Cricket in Times Square&quot; for years as a read aloud to my students.

Harry and Tucker find that having a growing dog can make life in Times Square Subway station a bit difficult.

First, The Cricket in Times Square (1960). Second, Tucker's Countryside (1969). In the third book, Harry Cat's Pet Puppy (1974), I saw that Tucker Mouse and I have something in common. He \\"rearranged the clutter of everything he'd collected.\\" (p.27)Besides the delightful story and characters, Seldon has used some excellent writing techniques. One, this unusual phrase, \\"To put a dent in an iron silence...\\" (p.61) Two, his personification of nature, as in \\"A cold, gray rain...was punishing New York for something.\\" (p.38)He slipped in \\"rhetorical questions,\\" \\"inveigle,\\" and \\"pun,\\" which might cause the child listener or reader to ask the reader/ or the adult in the room the meanings of those words.He is good about showing emotion instead of telling. \\"A heavy minute passed.\\" (p.90). And, \\"They looked away from each other. Eyes, when you're ashamed, can be painful.\\" (p.96)\\"He unhooked his eyes from Harry.\\" (p. 129) I fear that one of the writers in my group would tsk-tsk at that phrase.And then there's the marvelous assonance in two places. On p.103, this phrase: \\"...scurrying, furry nerves.\\" And, on p.140, \\"...tufted Huppy's fur.\\"Readers of any age (I'm seventy-something) will find something to delight in while reading this book."},{"Title":"Harry Cats Pet Puppy","review":"The book made it to the house very quickly and it was in fantastic shape.

Will Durant's concept of offering up an &quot;integral&quot; (as opposed to &quot;shredded&quot;) view of history (&quot;in which all the phases of human activity are presented in one complex narrative, in one developing, moving picture&quot;) is just what I wanted. It tells the story of the people, culture (art, architecture, music, literature), politics, religion/mythology, philosophy and, of course, war.While somewhat daunting at 700 pages, Durant's user-friendly (almost conversational) writing style makes the going very pleasant. I won't go so far as to say that it reads like a novel---there are parts that drag a bit---but it's well worth sticking with it. The people, culture and philosophy sections were the most fascinating to me, but because the political and war bits were not overly drawn out, I read them as well, and am glad I did.I was so impressed by this book that I wanted to learn more about Will Durant, so I read &quot;Will and Ariel Durant: A Dual Autobiography&quot; directly afterwards. They are an interesting and admirable couple and their autobiography is a good read. I look forward to furthering my education most enjoyably by reading the other books in &quot;The Story of Civilization&quot; series."},{"Title":"The Life of Greece (Complete 2 Volume AUDIO Set on 20 cassettes)","review":"My set of Durants The Story of Civilization was purchased at a garage sale. Poor fools, they did not know what they were selling. Their loss is my gain. Volume Two, however, was missing, a situation that was remedied when I wandered into a used bookstore and there, on a shelf was Volume Two- The Life of Greece calling my name. I immediately forked out eight bucks and headed down to the local coffee house and began a fascinating and enjoyable read.Having read through Volume 5, The Age of Faith, this has to be the best volume thus far- I could hardly put it down. To be sure there are areas that one has to plow through, that is to be expected of a work of this scope; but Durant has filled my world with the genius, history and drama of ancient Greece.What made this book so fascinating is that, over and over again, Durant brought us into the lives of these men. We are not merely dealing with historical figures, but real people who lived, made love, made war, wrote masterpieces and who could act with courage, fall to cowardice or just make stupid mistakes. By far my favorite chapter was The Suicide of Greece. It told how a great civilization could fall. The story of Alcibiades was absolutely riveting. Both a brilliant leader and a scoundrel, he pushed Athens towards destruction by his fraternity style pranks that doomed his invasion of Sicily contributing significantly to the downfall of Athens as a power.Consistent with all his volumes, Durant again shows us the cycle of civilization. He shows us again that the life of thought endangers every civilization that it adores. He writes:As civilization develops, as customs, institutions, laws, and morals more and more restrict the operation of natural impulses, action gives way to thought, achievement to imagination, directness to subtlety, expression to concealment, cruelty to sympathy, belief to doubt the unity of character common to animal and primitive men passes away; behavior becomes fragmentary and hesitant, conscious and calculating; the willingness to fight subsides into a disposition to infinite argument. Few nations have been able to reach intellectual refinement and esthetic sensitivity without sacrificing so much in virility and unity that their wealth presents an irresitble temptation to impecunious barbarians. Around every Rome hover the Gauls; around ever Athens some Macedon.I hope that Durant has not just written our epitaph as a great nation."},{"Title":"The Life of Greece (Complete 2 Volume AUDIO Set on 20 cassettes)","review":"As an avid history buff I have heard all my life about the series of books by Will Durant. I started reading them only recently and I can't believe what I have been missing.Durant writes beautifully and even though some of these books were authored over 50 years ago they still hold up. He doesn't just cover the political activity of the time but includes much on the way that people lived, loved and died. His sections on the development of art are extremely interesting.After reading this book, I had a much greater understanding of the Athenian culture and especially the idea of democracy and how it developed. His sections on the great philosophers of the time have led me to read several others books about this topic and to me that is the sign of a great book...when it makes you interested to read even more. I would have never attempted Plato's Republic without reading this book."},{"Title":"The Life of Greece (Complete 2 Volume AUDIO Set on 20 cassettes)","review":"...was Simon and Schuster. It was the Durants' 11 volume, bestselling series that put Simon and Schuster on the map, making it one of the biggest publishing houses in the US.It's impossible to find an American library that doesn't have at least one or two of &quot;the Story of Civilization&quot; and more likely has the whole set.So I'm surprised that the entire 11 volumes aren't as cherished in the rest of the Anglo-Saxon world as they are in the US. After all, the Durants Anglophilia is undisguised (not that they let this affect their judgement).In many ways, they were the last of a breed. Born and raised in a time when the echoes of the great Catholic-Protestant struggle had not yet vanished, the Catholic-raised Will and the Jewish &quot;Ariel&quot; (nee, Ida Kaufmann) don't allow their prejudices to get in the way of the truth (and admit it when they can't separate the two; how many contemporary historians would do that? Plagirism, perhaps? I'm sure Doris Kearns Goodwin and the late Steven Ambrose could tell us...).And, I can't go without mention the beauty of the language. The Durants clearly loved languages, the lovingly quote long passages of, especially, French, Italian, and Latin (which they fortunately translate!).Will Durant represents an archetype that is extinct: the gentleman scholar who pursued knowledge to enlarge his understanding of Man and to spread the amazing story of our civilizations rise from &quot;mudhuts on the Rhine&quot; to the greatest, wealthiest and most powerful in history--all without the almost unconscious prejudice which mars many other historians of their generation (e.g. the chest-thumping nationalism of the Germans).The books aren't perfect. Errors are made (in a work of over 10,000 pages it would be impossible not to!). Older naming conventions are still there. The most obvious to early 21st century eyes are the terms &quot;Mohammedan&quot; and &quot;Mohammedism&quot; instead of Muslim and Islam. This was how Muslims were quite commonly referred until recently. It derives from the ancient confusion of Christians about exactly what Islamic beliefs were. The assumption of an analogous role to Christ's for Mohammad is not so farfetched. If you are a Muslim, don't let this small matter of nomenclature put you off. The Durants devote large sections to Islamic Civilization and frankly admit with the pendulum had swung the other way (briefly tho' it was).All books reccomended with high praise. They stand on their own as well as making a coherent series.I'm rereading &quot;The Age of Reason Begins&quot; for little more reason than the beauty of the prose. Other than Gibbon, how many other historians are read simply for the art of their words?No hands? I didn't think so....(Still, it is funny to think that Carly Simon's inherited millions derive largely from the Durants' work...)"},{"Title":"The Life of Greece (Complete 2 Volume AUDIO Set on 20 cassettes)","review":"I heard about Will Durant, and his Story of Civilisation, from general meandering through the reviews on Amazon. It is to the shame of the UK, where I live, that he is virtually unknown here and his works unobtainable.I bought this book via one of the used book suppliers on Amazon and the mystery of Durants' obscurity in England has only deepened. Here clearly is one of the major historical writers of the last century, possessing a skill of verbiage and phrase the equal of Churchills.The Life of Greece is well named. You trul;y are lead by the hand into that long ago civilisation. You are shown its cities, its institutions, its armies, its arts, its gods, its hopes, its fears, all to a background cacophony of slaves chisels clinking in the silver mines at Laurinium, or the howls of outrage from the crowds in the theatre over Euripides' savage potrayal of the Gods' caprice and cruelty. You really feel that you begin to understand the ancients, and to a degree see through their eyes.The book is very much for the general reader with a thirst for knowledge. One immediately feels upon finishing the book that further readings will be required, and enjoyed, because the is such a depth of detail in the book that it would be impossible to absorb more than a fraction of what is there.A further reading will have to wait however. My copy of Caesar and Christ has just arrived - and I'm off to ancient Rome for a while."},{"Title":"The Life of Greece (Complete 2 Volume AUDIO Set on 20 cassettes)","review":"This book is superb. It's beautifully written, and it benefits greatly from Durant's impressive judgment in determining just how much detail to include for non-specialized readers.For readers seeking a good sense of the broad outlines of the history of ancient Greece -- from the Homeric age to the Roman -- this book is excellent.I was struck throughout by how important free trade was to the formation of Greek prosperity and culture (particularly in Athens). Durant clearly explains why this fact is so."},{"Title":"The Life of Greece (Complete 2 Volume AUDIO Set on 20 cassettes)","review":"This is one of those &quot;important&quot; books that I had been intending to read for more years than I want to admit. I truly regret not picking this up sooner (or any of the Durant's other works) as it reads almost like a novel, though it is also very scholarly as can be seen from the copious notes and bibliographic sources contained therein. Durant's observations about the personalities and their actions are often touching and sympathetic, but he doesn't shy away from stern criticism of the social weaknesses and short-sighted treacheries that finally destroyed the Greeks. As a society, these people had faults that were all too human, yet they had a creativity and vitality that Durant is able to bring to life with a startling immediacy. He manages to peel away the interveaning millenia between then and now and reveal the Greeks not as &quot;ancients&quot;, but as our virtual contemporaries. Read this book and understand why Greece is the fountainhead of the West."},{"Title":"The Life of Greece (Complete 2 Volume AUDIO Set on 20 cassettes)","review":"This is the second of the multi-volume work by the Durant's. It is as good as the first (and not wanting to give anything away, chuckle), they only get better and better. The author's prose is almost as wonderful as the actual historical work. The author apparently spent fifty years in writing these books and it certainly was worth the effort. He, and his wife, make history come alive. Now granted, I am a history buff and simply cannot get enough of it. I realize that not all share my love for the subject, but I truely feel that the entire work should be required reading in our schools. Not only are they superior to any and all text I am familiar with, they are truely a joy to read. This particular volume gave me much more insight to the ancient Greeks, their culture, art and philosophy than any work I have read, thereby giving me a much better understanding to our own culture, etc. It's just me, I know, but an added joy to this work was prowling used book stores and finding these things one by one to add to my collection. Highly recommend these books."},{"Title":"The Life of Greece (Complete 2 Volume AUDIO Set on 20 cassettes)","review":"Another reviewer states that &quot;The Life of Greece&quot; should be termed an important work. I concur. Durant's analysis of the Greeks' attempts at various forms of government provides a context for us to evaluate our own republic. He identifies key mistakes the Greeks' made when they designed representative governments. These mistakes were based upon a false premise that people are capable of rising above their own selfish interests when deciding critical issues. As a consequence, the Greek society suffered from internal strife and this lack of unity made it vulnerable to its enemies.This author also provided an excellent overview of the Greek philosophers. I was vaguely familiar with these men and was surprised to see some of the statements that were attributed to Plato and to Aristotle."},{"Title":"The Life of Greece (Complete 2 Volume AUDIO Set on 20 cassettes)","review":"All about the Greek Civilization.

I wish author used more current city names or approximate locations so that one could visualize locations. To me mythological part and literary part seemed to be more than necessary but it is part of the civilization.

The violent society of Homer's Iliad. The rise of classical Greece; a society of traders and navigators, explorers and colonists, soliders, sailors, and settlers. The origins of democracy and the political legacy to the Western world. The heroic battles against the Persians. The golden age of Athens. Backgrounds of Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, and the birth of the Academy, and of course....Alexander the Great! Plus much more including plates and maps.As with all of the volumes of The Story of Civilization, these books were written to stand alone and most likely will be read by the more serious students of history, however, they are composed and written to be understood by the layperson as well.

But more than that, it tells the story about how the events unfold and gives insight into how science and philosophy came into being for the first time in civilization. For a long time, I had only a very scattered understanding of the ancient Greek world. This work gives me a much clearer view of the whole picture. There were a few sections where I did get stuck on the details - in the enumeration of people, places, and events - but it wasn't very often and it was probably due more to a lack of imagination on my part.In trying to make a overly short synopsis, the book can be viewed as divided into three parts covering three different eras in Greek civilization. The first part delves into indefinite origins that can be traced back to the culture of ancient Crete, then the Mycenaean civilization, the Achaeans and the Homeric epic of Troy - which the archeologist Schliemann found actually existed in Asia Minor - and then the Dorian invasion. The second part concerns the Persian War and the coming of age of the city-states including Athens, it's friends and foes; and also the great advances in art, literature, science, philosophy and law as well as the decline that results mainly from the Peloponnesian War. The third part concerns the decay of mainland Greece but the diffusion of it's great culture to most of the known world through especially the conquests of Alexander the Great.Vital to the development of Greek culture was the city-state, which grew in mainland Greece after the Dorian invasion (1100-950BC), and spread across the Aegean to the many islands and far-off shores of the Mediterranean. The city-states were separated and protected by mountainous terrain, which made it difficult to assert centralized control. They were linked principally by the waterways of the Aegean, and this linkage stimulated trade and preserved a common heritage, despite the many squabbles and wars. It was the burgeoning of trade and the opportunity for people to interact with others of different cultures that helped shake some of the ingrained beliefs and traditions and stimulate the inquiring mind. The Greeks were also freed to question supernatural explanations of the universe - and therefore develop science and philosophy - because they did not have a powerful priestly class, and thus were not so readily subject to persecution for the shattering of old myths. They were really quite ingenious in an age that had a very narrow view of the world. For example, Eratrosthenes made calculations concerning the curvature of the earth and computed the circumference of the earth to be very close to what we know it today.One of the remarkable facts of the Golden Age of Periclean Athens (but not uncommon in those days) is that of the total population of Attica, some 315,000 peope, something like 115,000 were slaves. Of that difference consider, too, the number of woman, who were not participants in the political process. With that kind of distribution - more than half were not eligible - democracy had to be tenuous and fragile at best. For much of the history of the Greek city-states, there was this back-and-forth struggle between an obligarchy, the very richest and the aristocratic, and free citizens, who managed from time to time to rise above menial labor and assert themselves. During the time of Pericles, somehow a significant number of free citizens became active participants in government, signifying the dawning of a democratic process. But it did not last for long."},{"Title":"The Life of Greece (Complete 2 Volume AUDIO Set on 20 cassettes)","review":"Will Durant's vast knowledge is presented in a very enjoyable style.

Among the early lyric poets, Archilochus may have been the most hypersexual in his forms of expression. According to this book, \\"Archilochus was born, son of a slave woman, but one of the greatest lyric singers of Greece. A soldier's fortune led him north to Thasos where, in a battle with the natives, he found his heels more valuable than his shield; he took to the one and abandoned the other, and lived to turn a merry quip about his fight. Back in Paros he fell in love with Neobule, daughter of the rich Lycambes. He describes her as a modest lass with tresses falling over her shoulders, and sighs, as so many centuries have sighed, \`only to touch her hand.' But Lycambes, admiring the poet's verses more than his income, put an end to the affair; whereupon Archilochus aimed at him and Neobule and her sister such barbs of satiric verse that all three of them, legend assures us, hanged themselves\\" (p. 132). Will Durant praises his \\"short and stinging lines of three feet; this was the \`iambic trimeter' that would become the classic medium of Greek tragedy\\" (p. 132). Archilochus was finally killed in a battle against the Naxians. Most of this book is concerned with early artifacts of our culture, and the spiritual tradition which can be traced back to Archilochus seems to be particularly strong among people who would like to make a name for themselves in our modern world."},{"Title":"The Life of Greece (Complete 2 Volume AUDIO Set on 20 cassettes)","review":"My copy of this book indicates that it was written in 1939, about the last year in which an exceedingly smart American could be considered orthodox in maintaining the views that are considered the fundamental foundations of civilization in this popular historical study of intellectual greatness. Something of the spirit of that time may be indicated by the final comment on the back flap (which might not be the same now, as then): &quot;THE LIFE OF GREECE may well take its place as the most brilliant story of a magnificently endowed people whose career ended in tragedy and unwanted assimilation because they discovered a world view too late.&quot; Since this book was written, others have tried to create more complicated views of the problems involved in tragedy, history, philosophy, and fate, but much knowledge can be accounted for by the spurious needs of a superpower seeking an alternative to the lessons which this book clearly illustrates in its consideration of Euripides as a philosopher and an exile. Euripides is most famous for his plays, and Durant informs us that at one performance, &quot;the crowd protested so loudly against what seemed to be an outrageously immoral proposition that Euripides had to rise in his seat and comfort them with the assurance that Hippolytus would suffer edifyingly before the story closed ~ a safe promise for almost any character in Greek tragedy.&quot; (p. 417) I couldn't find anything about impeachment in the index, but Durant has two versions of the end of Euripides' life. &quot;At Pella, under the protection of this Frederick ~ who had no fears for the orthodoxy of his people ~ Euripides found peace and comfort. . . . Eighteen months after his arrival he died, attacked and dismembered, said pious Greeks, by the royal hounds.&quot; (p. 418)"},{"Title":"The Life of Greece (Complete 2 Volume AUDIO Set on 20 cassettes)","review":"The problem is, i feel completely inadequate to write anything about this work; it has so much history to it (sorry about the pun), so much approval for the series, so much scholarship, that i cannot truly make a judgement of its value. On the other hand, in each of these reviews i try merely to give my own response to the books i read; that i am competent to do. So, my response is...? I like the book (there's a tentative quality to my voice, can you catch it?), for the most part. I'm not even sure i can put my finger on anything specifically that i question; perhaps it is simply the history of the book ~ i ought to like it, so much, so many times have i read about it, seen it held up as a classic. Maybe i just don't like having something pushed down my throat ~ in which case the question arises: Why did i bother to read it? A more interesting question is, Will i, now or later, find another of Durant's series and read that? I think so, yes; later. So, from that perspective, i must have enjoyed &quot;Greece&quot;. Some things i might have enjoyed a little more (better reproductions of more artworks), but overall, yes, i did enjoy it. I am fascinated ~ have been for years ~ with the origins of peoples, especially those of the eastern Mediterranean; Durant has some excellent information there ~ of course, it is seventy years old; i wonder what scholarship has changed since then? At the very least, i know, Linear B has been deciphered, so that's a new line of information to follow. Perhaps i shall find another, more recent, book i can pursue it in; another measure of success for &quot;Greece&quot;! In the end, then, the tentative tone must leave my voice as i reiterate, i enjoyed reading Durant."},{"Title":"Back from the Land: How Young Americans Went to Nature in the 1970s, and Why They Came Back","review":"This is one of the best books I have ever read about homesteading.

Some are, unfortunately, considering a similar path with many of the same unrealistic expectations. They call it \\"sustainability\\" these days but to far too many that buzzword is nothing more than the same old simplicity-lust that rears its longing head every every now and then in complex cultures. There is surely some path to a less hectic, more meaningful, more holistic life to be had than the conventional materialistic overachiever society we are (once again) ensconced in but my tongue-in-cheek advice to young friends, largely ignored, has been: \\"The 'simple life' isn't all that simple, the 'natural life' doesn't occur naturally, and the only real way to get 'back to the land' is through a six foot hole in the earth.\\"The author illustrates through stories about the lives of those who were there just how difficult it was to jump back into a more self-sufficient country life, especially as we had children who needed more social interfaces. Or as we just realized that getting sick, injured, and just plain older and feebler away from the protective elements of mainstream culture wasn't as great as it seemed when we were young, invincible, and blind with our own ideals. Maybe a few young people will actually read this book before taking a similar plunge and be better off for it. Forewarned is forearmed after all.

It is a quick read, mainly stories of the experiences of the author and her friends who were lured to live \\"the simple life\\" \\"off the grid\\" in the country. Many references are made to how easy Mother Earth magazine made it seem to drop out; a simile might be drawn that says Mother Earth magazine is to back to the landers as Lansford Hastings' The Emigrants' Guide to Oregon and California was to the Donner Party-both documents were oversimplified and omitted many important details to the sorrow of those that used them as a guide. The book is frequently laugh out loud funny when describing the attempts of city folk to adapt to country life. I especially liked the chapters that outlined how the \\"back to the landers\\" dealt with their unexpected poverty. I only wish that experience had given more of them impetus to fight poverty for all rather than just escape it themselves. I wanted the author would have included stories from a broader range of people, and to give communes a separate section in the book rather than combining those experiences with the stories of families who lived independently in the country. Another topic that isn't adequately dealt with is feminism (or lack thereof) amongst the people who chose this lifestyle. The author makes several references to having to do all the traditionally feminine tasks without help from her husband and being bitter about that. Why didn't she ask for help? Was it easier to fall into sex role stereotypes in this situation? I wanted to know more about this topic. The book also wraps up too quickly and doesn't explore why people left the land and how they assimilated back into society in the depth that I wished for. Still, a worthwhile read."},{"Title":"Back from the Land: How Young Americans Went to Nature in the 1970s, and Why They Came Back","review":"As oil and natural gas decline, many of us will have to go back to the land. There is something to learn from those who have tried this in the past. Although much has been said about why communes and Utopian communities failed, little has been written about the fate of individual homesteaders.Part 1 is a book review of Agnew's very insightful history of this movement, and Part 2 is why I believe we need to go back to the land again and how to do it right this time given the problems and failures of homesteading in the \`70s.Part 1. Review of Agnew's \\"Back From the Land\\"Eleanor Agnew, in her 2004 book, \\"Back from the Land. How Young Americans Went to Nature in the 1970s, and Why They Came Back\\", discusses the millions of young adults who tried homesteading. Agnew speaks from experience -- she went back to the land with her husband and two boys in Troy, Maine.Agnew estimates between 750,000 and one million people dwelled on communes then. Millions more went back to the land independently. On the whole the movement consisted of educated, young, white, middle class men and women.Their rejection of the current system wouldn't have been possible if the overall economy hadn't been so wealthy. It was a luxury to be able to experiment.There were many reasons people went back to the land. The value system of American society was repulsive to many. They abhorred the rat race, boring jobs, crowds, the corrupt establishment; consumerism, destruction of wilderness, and advertising to get people to buy things they didn't need. Some also felt the need to \\"redeem their souls\\" because they'd done nothing to deserve the abundance they'd experienced. America has a long tradition of associating virtue with moderation, hard work, self-denial, and simple living. Many associated farming with the romantic notion of self-sufficient pioneers.The oil crisis in 1973 led some to believe that the capitalist system was in imminent danger of collapse, so going back to the land would be a matter of survival.Homesteaders wanted to invent a new and better civilization based on community, healthy food, a love of nature, and avoidance of toxic chemicals.Many, if not most, were unrealistic about what it would take to make the urban to country transition.Raising animals meant no days off, and the joy of raising them was shattered when they were slaughtered.Farming was hard. Some bought land that was mostly rocks, which made building homes and starting gardens very hard. Good topsoil was washed away in storms. Then there were assaults by flies and no-see-ums, blistered hands, and aching muscles while tending crops, which in the end might be lost to drought, frost, hail, and pests. The surviving crops required hard work to harvest and prepare for storage.In the winter, scraping ice off floors and walls, chopping wood, frozen pipes, broken cars, icy paths and roads, and uncovered wood piles frozen into a block of ice added to the discomfort and hard work.Fires could be a problem if the wood hadn't been aged long enough - at least a year - because it didn't burn well and added creosote to the chimney - a fire hazard.There were many new skills to master. Building a home, clearing the land, digging holes for the foundation through rock, fixing tractors, cars, chainsaws, chasing down escaped farm animals, cooking with wood, and canning food are just a few of the many skills needed to successfully homestead.Although many had realized they'd be cash poor on the land, they hadn't thought of this as being real poverty. After all, they'd grow their own food, build their own homes, and trade with other community members for anything missing.But they found out they couldn't be independent of the outside economy. Isolation meant even more dependence on cars, which were absolutely essential in the country, and repairs were expensive. People couldn't grow all of their own food and needed to get some items at the supermarket. And just about everything required money on the farm: seeds, animals, stoves, and so on.People and publications made it seem easy to live off the landBooks like \\"Independence on a 5-acre Farm\\" made it seem like it was no big deal to go back to the land. Mother Earth News had articles such as \\"Raise Worms for Fun and Profit\\" that misled people into thinking they'd earn enough money on the farm to pay for necessities.Eliot Coleman told people that they didn't need health insurance, and since everyone was young, healthy, and thought insurance companies were evil, they were glad to opt out. Agnew devotes a hair-raising chapter to how wrong Coleman was - just because you're young doesn't mean there won't be a need for emergency care, especially on a farm doing heavy manual labor, where the odds are many times higher than an office job that an accident will occur.Health care was often poor in the country - there weren't enough doctors per capita.Those who thought they could doctor themselves with herbs were sometimes dead wrong. Comfrey, which was supposed to cure just about everything, turns out to have liver damaging and carcinogenic effects. An alternative doctor prescribed Chinese herb cocktails that led to total kidney destruction in 100 women. Natural is not always better.Scott and Helen Nearing were the role models for the back-to-the-land community. They built an ideal homestead working four hours a day, spending the rest of their time reading, playing music, etc. They made it seem possible to do this with very little cash.But the Nearings made money from speaking, writing books, and donations. They had many followers who worked on their farm free of charge.Thoreau made it sound easy to build a cabin and live in the wilderness. But the truth is, he was two miles from town, where he went nearly every day and visited friends, family, and where he dined out often.Back From the Land - Why did people leave?Economics. Many idealists had one-dimensional ideas about capitalism, that it was nothing but ruthlessness, and that they could avoid the capitalist system by becoming self-sufficient.But Copthorne Macdonald believes alternative society never got large enough to separate from the mainstream society. You had to buy your tools at the hardware store since there weren't enough people making them on forges. The basic infrastructure of the economy forced people to buy outside the alternative lifestyle community. The bottom line is that small economies like communes and homesteads don't have the \\"size, complexity, cash flow, or diversity of goods and services to survive very well independently\\".Doing something at home didn't pay well either. One farmer worked out he was making about ten cents an hour by the time he'd grown wheat and turned it into flour.People had confused consumerism with cash - but even a sparse existence requires goods that can't be made or grown on the homestead.To afford necessities and improvements, people found they had to take jobs that were boring, low paying, with no benefits, and sometimes dangerous. Those who'd thought their middle class careers were hard or dull discovered otherwise. Since most lived far out in the country, it wasn't usually possible to return to abandoned careers. By leaving homesteads to work outside, they lost the time and energy needed to make themselves self-sufficient - time versus money. They needed time to build homes and garden, but they needed money to buy cement and garden tools.Homesteads failed as they tipped towards more time spent off the farm working than improving the homestead. People began to realize that rather than being homesteaders with outside jobs, they had awful jobs and happened to own a homestead. So many decided to return to the middle-class high-paying, rewarding careers they'd abandoned.And many had no choice but to leave the land - they were bankrupt, out of savings if not deeply in debt. Many couples had children, and didn't feel it was fair to them to lead isolated lives on farms, far from good schools.Divorce. Despite love being what the counterculture was all about, the reality of never-ending hard work, poverty, and lack of privacy in small cabins took a toll on marriages.When a marriage failed, one partner usually had to quit the land and go back to civilization. The other partner often found someone who didn't want to homestead, or found no one and couldn't cope with all the work alone.Commune failures. Meanwhile, people on communes were returning as well. Agnew lists these reasons for commune failures: lack of clear goals and structures, aggravations of shared space, irritating personal habits, and not liking each other once acquainted. Factions developed over all sorts of things - religion, politics, etc.The \\"unanimous consent\\" nature of decisions also caused problems - either there was a hung jury or underground resistance. Mutual consent favors the verbally aggressive and quiet people lose out, but giving in all the time soon made the silent ones resentful.New members threw communes off balance if they weren't screened well enough to see if they fit in.Probably the most important factor that broke communes up was the resentment hard workers felt for slackers. People disagreed about work contributions and money making efforts. Those who worked hard didn't want to share money with those who didn't, and tried to get shirkers to work, but there was no way to enforce it, so these measures failed.The Malthusian Die-off didn't happen. Back-to-the-landers hoped to escape the famine, overpopulation, war, and chaos that threatened to result from energy shortages and ecological destruction. But life went on, and friends and family on the outside were having it much easier, having more fun, living in warm homes, and leading far more interesting and intellectual lives in cities.Fatigue. The novelty and idealism of hauling spring water in heavy buckets over rough ground, endlessly chopping wood, feeding fires all night and other hardships grew thin.Conclusion. According to Jeffrey Jacob's research on the success rate of back-to-the-landers, only 3% subsisted on a combination of cash crops and bartering, only 2% through \\"intensive cultivation of cash crops\\". The others all found themselves preoccupied with money:44% worked full-time away from homesteads18% had pensions and investments17% survived on part-time or seasonal work15% got their income from businesses they could run from homeIn the end they found they had to participate in the economy, capitalism infused every aspect of life and was beyond overthrowing or disregarding.Part 2. Peak Energy: Time to Go Back AgainIn the \`70s, ecology, energy, population, and environment were common topics of conversation. Not anymore. It seems as if institutions and people have retreated from reality and reason. Environmental groups have abandoned population as an issue, even though they know it's responsible for all of the issues they're seeking donations for. In social networks, there's a taboo against discussion of ecological issues--the social pressures are to be witty and entertaining, yet another insidious influence of TV.Most young people are aware they're being handed a crummy planet, but they have a vague sense of unease, not a fine-tuned understanding of the situation, because the vast majority don't read due to sedentary computer games, TV, and cell phones.There's little awareness, as there was in the \`70s, that a back to the land movement is even needed. If there were, would Generation Y, overweight and suffering from nature deficit disorder, be willing to be at the forefront of a growing return to agriculture?Those who are aware, and would like to go back to the land, usually can't afford to buy a farm. Land is more expensive now than in the 70's because there are 100 million more of us, the majority immigrants and their children. We are losing land from development, erosion, and population at a rate where there won't be any crop land in 140 years.Population has increased 2% a year since 1950, a rate 133 times faster than before fossil fuels powered civilization..One of the reasons we were even able to grow from 100 to 300 million people in only a century was to shift to vehicles from oxen and horses, which did the most brutal farm work and transportation. Not having to pasture oxen and horses on at least two acres per animal for labor and transport freed up a lot of land, which was then used to grow food for people and build suburbia on instead.What needs to be doneHirsch pointed out that you'd want to prepare for Peak Oil 30 years ahead of time with heavy oil, gas-to-liquids & liquefied natural gas, enhanced oil recovery, efficient vehicles, and coal liquids to mitigate the most critical weakness in our infrastructure: the utter dependence of combustion engines on liquid oil.We don't have an alternative liquid fuel to replace oil, and it doesn't look like we'll have one for over a decade, if ever. Chris Somerville, head of the Energy Biosciences Institute (EBI), the joint $500 million collaboration between BP, U.C. Berkeley, LBNL, and the University of Illinois, has ruled out ethanol or biodiesel as potential biomass fuels. Instead, EBI is focused on researching how to make cellulosic biofuels from bio-diverse grasses with end-products of gasoline and diesel. Such fuels are at least 15 years away since there are so many problems to overcome. Dr. Somerville thought biofuels had more promise than solar and other alternatives (slides and lecture here).Nearly everyone assumes that the next step is to throw huge amounts of money at energy research and building coal liquefaction and nuclear power plants, windmills, solar panels, and so on. Yet if all of the problems in all of these energy sources were solved today, there were enough engineers, and population growth stopped, it would still take decades to scale up enough to provide the same energy fossil fuels provide now.And as Congressman Bartlett has pointed out, there's no point to all-out energy projects - because if we succeed, the population will double again, and the number of people experiencing hardship when the fuel runs out yet again will be even greater. Not to mention the continued destruction of fisheries, forests, and aquifers and potential extinction of humankind and other species from climate change by burning coal.Even if an energy \\"Manhattan project\\" is attempted, we will also need to employ more people in agriculture to make up for the coming shortfall in energy. Changing agricultural methods and infrastructure takes decades as well.The downshift from an industrial to an agricultural society must be funded by both government and private capital, because a huge amount of capital is needed.Government needs to be in the driver's seat, since energy will need to be allocated across many other essential services besides agriculture, such as water purification, delivery, and treatment, garbage collection, military and police, roads, disaster recovery, and to keep our poorly maintained infrastructure from failing.Educating and retraining people for coping with energy descent is essential. But since less than ten percent of Americans are scientifically literate, and any politicians who tried to educate Americans on how serious our energy and population situation is wouldn't get re-elected, it's unlikely any action will be taken at the top. The necessary changes and awareness will have to come from a grass roots movement of self-educated citizens.The local food movement is one such effort. Many people are buying local organic food to encourage organic farming, assuming that capitalism will take care of the situation, because if we pay more for organic food, more people will become organic farmers.But it's likely that once energy shocks hit, there'll be massive unemployment. People will have a hard time affording enough food, let alone farm land.The local food movement also ignores the potentially higher amount of energy used to deliver local food. Mariola, in his paper \\"The Local Industrial Complex? Questioning the Sustainability of Local Foods\\", points out that energy used to move a large amount of food by ship or rail is probably less, due to economies of scale, than having hundreds of local farmers move tiny amounts of food to local markets which thousands of people drive to. Perhaps if customers walked, biked, took mass transit, the energy balance might be better, this needs to be researched further.The most important lesson learned from the previous back-to-the-land movement is that we are all part of the capitalist system, and consequently, a new organic farming movement will not survive without government help. Large, industrial farms now depend on government help to some extent, and receive billions of dollars in subsidies. Over 5 million farmers were driven out of business against their will in the last century as farmers were forced to get bigger or go out of business. Now there are only 2 million farms left.So the most critical reform would be to shift subsidies to organic Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) and small farms, and to stop all development of prime farmland.Making a downshift to agriculture will take many years to:* Train enough people in soil science, plant propagation, integrated pest management, etc for outreach to farms to make the industrial-to-organic transition* Shift people from ecologically unsustainable regions to food producing areas* Improve topsoil. Industrial farming has ruined soil structure and nutrition. It will take at least five years to for soil to recover before organic food production gets back to previous levels.* The learning curve for organic farming done in a sustainable way can take up to ten years.* Plant forests to provide firewood, lumber, etcThe downshift needs to start now to mitigate suffering. Our nation needs to focus on a return to agriculture, not new energy infrastructure. To stay under the depletion curve, the number of people returning to the land to grow and distribute food needs to steadily increase.As far as reducing the energy used in agriculture, we can start now by cutting back on calories, eat a vegetarian diet, grow victory gardens, use less packaging, etc. David Pimentel has a paper that will be published soon on how to cut the energy used in agriculture by half.We need university students to major in agricultural disciplines, and above all, to try to shift mostly petrochemical and mechanization-oriented agriculture departments to teaching and researching sustainable farming methods. Cuba's success in coping with their downturn was partly due to having enough people trained in organic farming to train petrochemical farmers how to switch to organic methods.The huge number of agricultural students we need doesn't exist. The Los Angeles Times article, \\"Agriculture schools Sprucing up their image\\", says that many professional agriculture workers in soil science, pest management, and growing crops are about to retire, but enrollment in these areas is declining.Instead, students are majoring in professions that can easily be off-shored and will be useless in a world of declining energy.Given the short window of time we have left, a better alternative than university agriculture departments would be John Jeavon's bio-intensive workshops, Rodale Institute programs, and gaining experience on sustainable organic farms (not all organic farms grow food with topsoil sustaining methods).This time around, the model to follow for a group endeavor is already here - Community Supported Agriculture. Lazy members who don't farm their tract will earn far less than hard-working members. Pooling resources will be an advantage over individual farms, if the members can learn to get along, cooperate, and select good leaders.CSA's and homesteads should be forming now, with a government agency acting as the central agent for connecting people who want to farm, providing agricultural scholarships, training, outreach, buying land and loaning money to farmers, and so on.It will not be simple to make the transition. The easiest path is to ration the remaining oil to essential services like agriculture and continuing on as usual, not only to maintain social order, but to have food to export in exchange for oil and natural gas based fertilizers. Land will continue to be concentrated in a few hands, pushing society towards feudalism and fascism as people work for minimal wages to survive. Business as usual, until energy shortages cause sudden dislocations, leads to civil wars and collapse.If the U-turn can start now, there's a better chance of remaining a strong democratic nation, and to finally do what we always should have done: live within our means -- what the ecosystem can provide sustainably.There's no point trying to prepare for energy descent and climate change if the current levels of immigration, birth rate, and loss of prime farm land continues.Everyone needs to get involved, because we're a social, cooperative species, utterly dependent on each other as much as bees or ants are. Peter Corning's brilliant book, \\"Nature's Magic\\", shows that synergy and cooperation at group levels were far more important in the emergence of homo sapiens than competition between individuals. We must all pull together and work towards the best possible future we can imagine, because we're all in this together.It would be better if people chose an agricultural future with hope and courage. Farming can be an immensely satisfying and rewarding way of life. It would be best for democracy and preserving our remaining resources if Americans could embrace reality and take appropriate back-to-the-land action."},{"Title":"Back from the Land: How Young Americans Went to Nature in the 1970s, and Why They Came Back","review":"One of the better books by former Hippies about the 60's and 70's.

One option we are weighing is to go out build a homestead, like they did in the '70s. I like the idea, so I read this book to ensure that A.) I don't have rose-colored glasses about the process and B.) I learn from others' mistakes. I wanted to anticipate the challenges we'd face without the bias of my own idealism, as well as invent solutions ahead of time to tackle these challenges before we even step foot on a farm. I found that this book had served both of these purposes, and was a light and entertaining read as well. I was able to finish the 250 page book in less than a week because I couldn't put it down.It's a book of many stories woven together. The author both tells her own experience, a story of pain and difficulty in which many things went wrong, along with stories drawn from interviews of many homesteaders and community dwellers, both current and former, crafted together into an entertaining and educational anthology. The details were truly palpable. I could almost feel the bristling cold water from a winter wash day, or the deep disappointment of yet another car breakdown.I was excited to get insight into the methods these farmers from 40 years ago were trying. The homesteading technology and methods have advanced somewhat since then. For example, we now have the better-developed understanding of plant/plant and plant/animal interaction in Permaculture. Yet it seems that many of the things I'd planned to do were already being tried back then then, which lends to predictability of the outcome of our choices. While my motives for going back to the land were different than theirs, many of the things I'd planned to do are the same, and seeing the outcomes and amount of input required (labor, costs) were helpful.I appreciated that not all of her book was about homestead failure. Eleanor shared some of the happiness of a rural homestead, but unfortunately much of that was at the beginning of the book; as you neared the end, much of the joy had been forgotten, replaced with miserable cold, frequent trips to the hospital and stubborn poverty. She left you with the impression that it's just not possible to live contentedly on the homestead for the rest of your life, even though many homesteaders continue to live happy, healthy lives on their farms to this day. I know that because she included stories from currently successful homesteaders in the beginning. Yet toward the end they were forgotten as though they didn't exist. One Amazon reviewer described this book as \\"a real wet blanket\\" for those who want to homestead, and reminded us that there is in fact \\"a rose on the thorn bush.\\"I agree with the author that such happy endings are rare. The book reminded me that there are few homestead celebrities who make a living strictly by homesteading, without book sales and tours on lecture circuits, miles away from their farms for days on end. The book makes an example of Helen and Scott Nearing, who the author got to meet. The Nearings claimed to be able tolive the \\"good life\\", but not, it seems, without book sales, lecture fees and many volunteer workers on their farm. (For more behind the scenes of the Nearing's so-called \\"good life,\\" see a book entitledMeanwhile, Next Door to the Good Life, written by a neighbor who lived between both the Nearings and Eliot Coleman.)The difficulties that homesteaders in her book faced include:* Grinding poverty* Miserable, dangerous or boring jobs many miles away* Constant cold* Transportation costs, thus necessitating an off-farm job* Strained relationships* Overwhelming routines* Constant setbacks and disappointments* Dangers* Health problems, and lack of either money or quality government facilities to pay for it* Lack of community (not enough neighbors close by)I could add two more things: Finding a good --or any -- church, and an over-dependence on the government.In the end, many of the homesteaders found life somewhere between urban and rural, by growing gardens, working with ecology, helping the poor, etc. The author seemed to feel that contentment was somewhere in the middle between simple homesteading and hard-core urban living.So what did I take away from this book? What lessons did I learn?The first thing I learned is that homesteading really is quite difficult. Her book took the shine off it. I had been viewing it, to a degree, with rose-colored glasses. Maybe homesteading is a great way to make it through the coming dark days, but I'd better be sure it's the right thing for our family before risking their well-being. I'm currently doing a risk assessment to see if that's best for us.The second thing I learned is that we shouldn't try to do a homestead alone. The obstacles that lone homesteaders had to face would likely prove too great for our family. Once you start getting expensive repair or hospital bills, it's a slippery slope back to working in the city.I've learned enough about farming to know that it's very difficult, even risky, to do well. We're going to need some backup. With that in mind, I'm also reading Amazon's two top-rated books on building and forming community, both by Diana Leafe Christian:Creating a Life Together: Practical Tools to Grow Ecovillages and Intentional CommunitiesFinding Community: How to Join an Ecovillage or Intentional CommunityThat's not to say that forming community is a picnic. One co-housing founder called it \\"the longest, most expensive personal development course you'll ever take.\\" Nine out of ten (!) intentional communities fail. 90 percent! So we've got to go methodically and carefully.One way to fight for community is by meditating on what the Bible says about leadership, generosity and discipleship, all of which assist in forming and keeping community.The author discussed stories from communal dwellers but didn't give as much detail why these returned to the city. I suspect it was for the same reasons that nine out of ten communities fail; you can read about those in Diana Christian's books.One way to circumvent the problem of finding a quality church is to form a small home church. That too is fraught with difficulties and must be pursued with prayer and caution.An over-dependence upon the government can be mitigated through increasing sales by improving one's marketing skills and improving one's business methods. More sales = more doctor bills paid out of pocket instead of other taxpayer's pockets.Finally, I was reminded that it's not necessarily virtuous in and of itself to simplify your life. Simplification may promise happiness but it doesn't necessarily deliver. After all, I could live like a poor Vietnamese farmer, but many of these are forced into their situation, without much hope of being able to climb out of their hole.In this life, we have no promise that we will be able to remain safe and happy until we die. I will struggle in the city, I will struggle in the burbs, I will struggle in the country, either alone or with a group. I will struggle if I have complex tools, or if I live simply. Simplicity can actually become like a carved idol which people serve in order to obtain the promised happiness, safety and contentment. I intend to use simplicity as a tool to magnify Jesus, rather than abuse it as a hand-crafted idol to replace Him.Would I recommend this book to a friend? Definitely. With caveats, but I want those who are considering homesteading to check themselves. Maybe their glasses are rose-colored, too.If you thought this review was helpful, please click Yes below."},{"Title":"Back from the Land: How Young Americans Went to Nature in the 1970s, and Why They Came Back","review":"Like an earlier reviewer stated, take it with a grain of salt.

I understand exactly how hard it is going to be, having been born and raised in rural Appalachia and having relatives that are still alive that lived exactly like this up until recently. I had just hoped that there would be some sort of, I don't know, silver lining that would let people see that there is a rose on the thorn bush. Overall, though, it is a first hand look at someone who was doin' (think Mother Earth News) and unfourtunately didn't like the lifestyle. I would recommend that if someone bought this book to see exactly what it was like to homestead, don't put all your eggs in this basket. Check out some other books that show the pros also to living intentionally, like Helen and Scott Nearing's Good Life books (even though they are described as virtual \\"sell outs\\" in some writtings)and some of the \\"Reports from Them That's Doin\\" in the older issues of MEN."},{"Title":"Back from the Land: How Young Americans Went to Nature in the 1970s, and Why They Came Back","review":"This book is thoughtful, insightful, and well written. Unfortunately, it represents the angry absurdities of a disgruntled failure. The author was an unrealistic, half-willing homesteader who sort-of attempted to go \\"back to the land\\" according to a plan that disrespected rural folks, disregarded rural economics, and was destined to fail from the get-go. It is interesting how she portrays her ex-husband's experience homesteading as a failure rather than a success, as if the fact that he stayed on the homestead and changed certain aspects of both the home and the lifestyle was not a reasonable adjustment of a flawed original dream. By the end of the book, she reveals herself to be an urbanite at heart, soft, and disinterested in the things she pretended were important when she jumped on the homesteading bandwagon in her early adulthood. Instead of admitting the fact, she processed t he experience by trashing the idea, and pretending that it was the general and inherent failure of a movement rather than her own personal failure that drove her from the land. Most people who want to be actors or athletes don't make it either.Would-be homesteaders take note; this is the important lesson from the book: homesteading is like any other lifestyle--it is about economics first. Those who, like the author, failed to comprehend this, or rejected the economic realities once they faced them, failed at homesteading. It probably doesn't need to be said that this was the majority of back-to-the-landers. However, Eleanor chose a self-serving selection of negative experiences to recount in her book, and viewed them through her myopic negativity. There are indeed many thousands of these homesteaders still on the homestead, living that dream in a realistic and successful way, all these years after her failed attempt."},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"I'd like to highly recommend Linore Rose Burkhard's BEFORE THE SEASON ENDS, an inspirational Regency published by Harvest House.BEFORE THE SEASON ENDS features a young, innocent heroine, Ariana Forsythe, and a moody, irascible hero, Phillip Mornay. This book will appeal to all who loved Mr. Darcy's character in PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, yet it goes on beyond that classic in that the book contains a faith journey as well. There's the required ingredients that make a book a Regency--the clothing, the places--Carlton House, Vauxhall--Regency bucks and Prinny himself, but the ingredient of faith makes this book so much richer. Bravo, Linore!I am beyond ecstatic to learn that there will be a sequel--THE HOUSE IN GROSVENOR SQUARE in April of 2009!Laurie Kingerywww.lauriekingery.comHILL COUNTRY CHRISTMAS, Steeple Hill Love Inspired, Oct.'08"},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"Oh, bliss! Beautiful, breathtaking bliss! I picked up Before the Season Ends and was immediately swept away into one of my most favorite places--England of 1813, when the Prince Regent reigned and Jane Austen's pen wove its magic. Is there any better place to escape to in a good book?Ariana Forsythe gets packed off to her aunt in London because of trouble at home, only to find even more of it when she debuts into society. She didn't mean to offend the contrary noblewoman by running into her--she just got distracted staring at the fashionable man with the haunted eyes. And she didn't know that man was the Paragon--the one man her aunt had warned her to avoid at all costs. Philip Mornay, everyone knew, had no greater pleasure than setting down young women who dared to try to engage him. So why, then, does he play the hero for her, even after her wayward tongue argues with him when it ought to have meekly demurred?A young woman after the Lord's heart, Ariana is not London's typical debutant. But can her faith and heart survive the fickle affection of the ton, or will she be sent back to Chesterton in disgrace, brokenhearted?Loved it! Loved it, loved it, loved it! Linore Rose Burkard has done a superb job of crafting a tale to make any romantic heart swoon. What's more, the style is more authentically Regency than any other modern Regency I've read while maintaining the smooth, fast pace we expect from today's books.I adored Ariana and sighed right along with her as she got to know the daunting but surprisingly sweet Mr. Mornay. Each character was realistic and three-dimensional, the plot was classic but fresh, and the writing was fabulous. I had no desire to put Before the Season Ends down and so made no attempt to--I just kept it beyond the reach of baby hands and kept on reading while I spooned noodles into my toddler's mouth. The day I spent with this book was a much needed mini-vacation, and I left it so enamored with the story and the author that I still find myself thinking about it at odd moments throughout the day.Romantic hearts will not want to miss the book! It will have a place of honor on my shelf, and I'll be counting the days until its sequel can join it."},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"I love stories written about England and this time period. Before the Season Ends,is a story of lovely young lady who is not afraid to be herself and true to her values. This is so odd for the society that she is entering. Ariana, is not pretentious but refreshing. A young woman of character who can be so delightful and not compromise those things that have deep value in her life.A story that reveals that Mr. Mornay, the most sought after man, desires a woman who is real and has an inner beauty that draws him to her.I could not put the book down and read it a second time to be sure that I hadn't missed the details."},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"I have never written a review for anything but just had to for this novel. I am an avid Jane Austen fan and love everything Regency. If you feel the same way, you will adore this novel. I had to FORCE myself to put it down halfway through it because it was 1:00 a.m. and my poor husband was trying to sleep. I had told him at 10:30 that I was only going to read one more chapter. The story just grabs you and you want to read on and on. Not only are the characters wonderfully developed but the story is fast-paced, picturesque and completely engaging. And the icing on the cake is the fact Ariana, the heroine, is a Christian. It was so refreshing to find a novel set in Regency time that featured a Christian as one of the main characters. She is so dependent on God throughout the story and I enjoyed the emphasis that was made on the importance of prayer and reading the Word of God. As a Christian, I could completely relate with her as she faced various struggles and called on the Lord for help and guidance. I feel that this book could also be a great witnessing tool for those of us with unsaved, Regency novel-loving friends. At one point in the book, Ariana is explaining the difference between religion and having a true relationship with Christ to another character. It is one of the most accurate, well-explained descriptions of what it means to be a Christian that I have ever heard and the fact that it is embedded in a rivoting story is genius. Linore Rose Burkard is a gifted writer and I am thrilled to have found out about her and her work. I would highly recommend not only purchasing her novel but also checking out her website. You can even subscribe to her eNewsletter, which is delightful and full of all kinds of fun Regency information and tidbits. I am waiting with great anticipation for her sequel that will be coming out next year.

Graziano Wilmington, DE"},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"It is hard to believe that anyone familiar with historical romances could call this novel original. It is an almost exact imitation of the plot of \\"Arabella\\", one of Georgette Heyer's well-written, well-characterized novels. In that novel, Arabella achieves the conversion of the hero to goodness without rivers of tears and unbelieveable hours of prayer (as the soggy heroine of \\"Before the Season Ends\\" indulges in seemingly endlessly). I was annoyed by this book, and by its preachy premise. The laughable final surrender of the hero to God's Will through duelling with the country parson (who happened to be the most interesting character in this book)will leave you shaking your head over why you spent your time slogging through 400 pages of contrived, often depressing drivel."},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"I am a very devote Christian and while I enjoyed the story, the preaching in the last third of the book was a bit overwhelming. I believe that we instruct people in faith by example and pushing religion at people as was done here, usually does not bring about the desired result. For this reason and the hero's own personality, the likelihood of the heroine achieving the result she sought by the means she used were totally unrealistic."},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"I've never been drawn to Regency romances, but this book had me hooked from the first line. Full of unique, fully formed characters, Linore Rose Burkard has penned a novel that evokes thoughts of Jane Austen. I enjoyed reading about the customs of the time, the fun and pagentry of the Season, and the elaborate wardrobe it required. Most of all, I loved Ariana Forsythe and her earnest desire to seek God's will, even when she finds herself falling in love with a man who seems a questionable match. Bravo to Ms. Burkard for this charming novel. I'm looking forward to her next book, The House in Grosvenor Square, which just released this month."},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"I've finally finished reading her debut novel Before the Season Ends. Now for my review of my first Christian and Inspirational romance novel that I found out about through Jessica Coulter Smith's blog one day. I really loved the cover of her novel along with the title but when I read the blurb of her book it really hooked me so I went to her website. I found this little trailer she had of her novel and after I finished watching it I knew I had to get in touch with Linore so I can review her novel as well as have her here on my blog as a guest. Even though Linore's novel is considered a christian romance and I've never really read any christian based novels I still wanted to read it. I'm always telling everyone that I love reading new types of genres except non-fiction which I really don't like reading so I'm going to read this novel even though I've never read a Jane Austen book either. The novel starts in England in the year 1813 and the romantic woes at home send Ariana Forsythe to her wealthy Aunt Bentley's townhouse in fashionable Mayfair, London. Ariana and her family are very religious so Ariana felt that it was her destiny to marry a man of God. Even though the man of God she wants to marry is almost 30 years older than her and isn't the man her mother wants her to marry at all.She's been sent to London for her own good and under her aunt's calculating eye, Ariana is thrust into the high society she doesn't understand fully and a worse intrigue than that which prompted her flight from home has happened. Then a scandalous rumor involving her with London's current darling rogue, the handsome, Mr. Phillip Mornay, is launched on society in a malicious act of meanness by a Lady of society that changes Ariana's life forever. Her faith, her future, and her heart are all at stake as she strives to clear her name and resist Phillip Mornay, the man who does not share her faith as deeply as her. Will Ariana's beliefs survive? I think it will though she will definitely be suffering a bit because of what she is feeling for Phillip. And what about her heart? She has developed deep feelings for Phillip since she met him and that is conflicting with her religious belief that she can only love and marry a man as deeply religious as her.For her belief is the part of her which most threatens to betray the truths she has always believed in and when she finds herself backed against a wall, betrothed to the supposedly wrong man, how will it ever turn out right? That is a question that had me wondering as I was reading this novel which at first I felt started out kind of slow but really picked up for me after chapter two. From the country village of Chesterton, where Ariana was born and raised, to the ballroom of the Prince Regent's London palace, where she begins to fall in love with Phillip Mornay. Before the Season Ends will take you to Regency England where you'll find a world so elegant and comfortable, you'll want to stay for a long, long time. I'm not that religious so I really could relate more to Phillip's character than Ariana because his family is Christian but he's not the deep faith religious like Ariana.Though I can't particularly relate to Ariana's character much I really loved her in this novel and I can understand a bit her dilemma with trying to do what felt right and would be the right thing for her to do. Phillip is a wonderful character that I think really is good for Ariana because they are complete opposites but find a way to make their romantic relationship work. There were some secondary characters in this novel that I also enjoyed very much reading about such as Ariana's aunt and her aunt's gentleman friend who really spiced things up. After finishing this novel I will say that though I'm not sure I will start reading more Christian romance but I will be reading more of Linore Rose Burkard's Christian romance. I'm very much looking forward to the sequel to Before the Season Ends that is called The House in Grosvenor Square, which comes out in April 2009. I can't wait for April to get here so I can read more about Ariana and Phillip's love lives after the wonderful ending of the first novel."},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"This is the first Christian Regency Romance I have even seen. I simply loved it! It was brilliantly written with believable characters that I fell in love with. Ariana was so loveable for being so honest and real and she prays feverishly for guidance in her unexpected first season in London. I loved the romance and was sad to see the adventures of her first season come to a close. You will love this unique tale of Christian values and scripture as not only Ariana finds love but also helps those closest to her find faith."},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"The back cover of this book tells you exactly what it is - \\"the first Christian Inspirational Regency on the market today\\", and the Christian element, although not over-intrusive, is a significant aspect of this book.We follow the story of Ariana Forsythe, a young lady of a firm Christian faith who goes to London to stay with her aunt and experience a season. Almost immediately she bumps into Mr Mornay, the rich but aloof gentleman who never has anything to do with women and whose rude manners and disinterest can 'ruin' their reputation. Although treating Ariana badly in one way, he shortly after comes to her rescue, and from that point onward their paths cross.I won't give the story away, although it's pretty obvious how it will all end, but there are various difficulties along the way and these are written in a light and pleasing style. The period detail is good, there are some interesting vignettes into the Regency period, including Ariana meeting the Prince Regent at Carlton House, and many of the traditional pitfalls of the American author of a Regency England novel are avoided.I'm not sure if the spelling was meant to be English in this book. Some was - \\"Saviour\\", for example - but most wasn't (jewelry, specialties, favor, labor etc). There were also a couple of occurrences of the wretched American \\"gotten\\" which appear to be de rigueur in books with authors from the USA. However the overall standard of writing - and particularly dialogue - was excellent. It didn't feel like people were speaking modern language in a 200 year old setting, they seemed to be speaking in a way which was reasonably true to the period - as were their actions. The importance of giving the right impression, of correct social behaviour, was all well described.Ariana as a heroine was interesting. She is quite passive throughout the book - things generally happen to her, rather than her doing specific actions; although initially her clumsiness causes the introduction to Mr Mornay and also causes her to make an enemy within her social world, after this point things just seem to happen and she goes along with it. She comes across as a graceful, friendly girl but we are given insights into her thoughts - she is obeying her aunt and following the advice of many people, and yet inside she has many doubts about her actions and whether they are right in God's eyes but she mostly keeps these hidden from those around her.God shows up a lot in this book. It's billed as Christian Regency and it is most certainly that. I haven't previously read a novel which has the Christian element so much to the fore, and I suspect this is something more familiar to American readers than British readers, but it mostly worked well. A British person with no religious affiliation might find it a bit hard-going but the religious element doesn't really take over the story, with the possible exception of the ending which for me was a little too preachy but would probably sit fine with most Christian readers.Mr Mornay is well-written although I didn't feel I entirely understood why he was so in love with Ariana and able to put up with her vacillations over their marriage! We were given an insight into his history, the event that took place in his youth which formed his rather caustic manner. He was probably the most un-rakish hero I've read about in a while, but still an interesting character at that.Despite some of these small reservations, overall I very much enjoyed the book. It reminded me of Georgette Heyer's \\"Arabella\\", another book where the confirmed bachelor changes his ways when meeting a fresh, unspoiled girl from the country. There are differences, of course, but the comparison is a positive one - this book leaves you with that feelgood factor which makes me look forward to the next book from Linore Burkard."},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"I really enjoyed reading Before the Season Ends and I hope that there will be a sequel. It's a great \\"escape book\\" which brought me straight to the Regency in England. I felt as if I were with these characters and I wanted to linger with them! Ms. Burkard opens a door through her writing which allows the reader to enter a time that no longer exists. I recommend this book for people of all ages. The character of Ariana sets a wonderful example as a woman who makes wise choices. She stands firm when it comes to her faith and is not swayed or impressed by the society surrounding her. The smoothness of writing simply flowed and the story had me captivated until the very end. If you want to read a book that is beautifully written, touches your heart AND keeps you entertained - I recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"I can't write an objective review for this book. I'm sure that the book deserves all the praise and high ratings it's got if it was meant to be strictly read by the 'Inspirational Christian Novels' community.Its era details are well researched and well described, especially the clothes. But then the author gets down to the business of making the book 'inspirational' and what had promised to be a good read - not Jane Austen, but a maybe some shadow of Georgette Heyer - turned into an annoying treatise on the 'favoured children of God' and the 'Will of God' and how the heroine must spread the 'Kingdom of God'.I don't think there is anything inspirational about the smug superiority displayed by authors of this sub-genre. I say this with the realization that it is the upbringing that instills this smugness in these authors and that - as seems in this particular case (gleaned from the author's biography) - the person's nature itself maybe a humble and earnest one.I don't mind a heroine who prays constantly throughout a book so long as the author doesn't use her to preach to the readers or somehow convey that without the constant praying none of her problems would have been solved. There are classics that have portrayed characters with strong beliefs and faith in a way in which I can understand their minds better. I might not agree but at least the beliefs were never thrust at me. Anne of Green Gables or Little Women come to mind.Anyway, I think the author's obvious skill (still in its early developmental stage) is wasted here. If the preaching was not so important to her I might actually have enjoyed the book. I did like the beginning but by 39% I was itching to slap Ariana silly.Did the author even consider that she might have non-christian or agnostic (or even less enthusiastic Christian) readers who might not appreciate her patronizing narrative?:sigh:I just think she cruelly killed what could have been a good read for me. It's so rare to find an author who can grasp how to write a piece that actually echoes the classic romantic writers of that time.:End of rant: :)"},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"This story was pretty well-written, and the author seems to have been strongly influenced by Austen's works as well as works such as Louisa May Alcott. A love story with a Christian undertone, the story shows the young heroine maturing almost inexplicably fast. She goes from mooning over an inappropriate middle aged suitor to capturing the attention of the most sought after bachelor ever! Still worth a read."},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"Ariana Forsythe has despaired of ever finding the perfect man, so instead she has decided that a true man of God will suffice; someone with whom she can share her faith. She's surprised when her family insists on a trip to London, known for its sinful ways, in order for her to have a season amongst the ton, and hopefully select a suitable husband.Phillip Mornay is known amongst the ton for his cutting remarks, disdain for young debutantes, and rather cruel comments. He has made it his life's mission to push everyone away from him, especially the marriageable young women. The young girls who set upon him with marriage in mind are view with disdain and soon sent running in the opposite direction.Upon Ariana's arrival in London, she warned against speaking with Mr. Mornay; however, she is thrust into his presence again and again. Before long, the two begin to realize they like each other; a rather stunning realization for Mr. Mornay. But can Ariana commit herself to a man who is so obviously lost? A man who doesn't know what it truly means to have faith in God?I enjoyed Before the Season Ends so much that I read it cover to cover - twice! Not only is the work well-written, with an excellent plot, well-rounded characters, and a powerful message, but the real struggles that Ariana faces will touch your heart. Ms. Burkard has not only succeeded in writing a spectacular novel, but through every word you can see her love of God, her belief in Him and all of the things that He can make possible. While I don't want to give away the ending, I will say that it is sure to bring tears to your eyes - tears of joy, and more importantly, hope.Before the Season Ends will renew your faith in love, hope, and in God."},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"This was a fun story to read. It was well written and in a style unlike the other \\"regency\\" books in the Christian genre. One truly felt as though they were reading a Jane Austin novel.The chemistry between the 2 characters was wonderful, their banter enjoyable. I won't give a synopsis of the story as that has been done. I simply want to give praise for this book.I started reading this while I was on my treadmill... the first chapter was funny. In that dry British sort of way. I was running and I just burst out laughing.My only criticism with this is I really felt that Ariana in those first 2 chapters was NOT the same character in the rest of the book. Aside from those first chapters (before she went to London) her character was fluid. In the first chapters she was stubborn and a little dumb. But as soon as she went to London she morphed into a wise young woman.Other than that this book was DELIGHTFUL. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"I really enjoyed this sweet historical romance. I found the storyline to be engaging and the main characters were delightful. I tend to find the requisite \\"conversion\\" scenes in Christian romances to be a tad overdone but Burkhard did a good job of keeping this one rather less annoying than some. I found Burkhard's descriptive scenes easy to imagine and I felt drawn into the story. This is an easy read and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good Christian romance."},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"AMAZING.thats all i can say about this book.Linore Burkard , if you see this review, please write more books, because this one is amazing."},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"Everything about this book begs to be compared to Jane Austen, and everything about this book falls short of that high standard.Ariana Forsythe is a deeply religious woman living in the English countryside, who is sent to London to stay with her aunt. While there, she meets Philip Mornay, an unpleasant man who is clearly intended to remind the reader of Mr Darcy. A scandalous rumour about Ariana means Phillip is the only person who can help her, and as she spends more time with him, she realises they can never be together, because he doesn't share her faith.The author has never heard of the phrase \\"Show, don't tell,\\" or she considers the reader to need everything spelled out in minute detail. Ariana is not the eldest in her family, but she is having her debut before her older sister. The older sister makes a lighthearted joke about Ariana's journey to London. The author then feels the need to explain that this joke means the sister is alright with Ariana going to London before her.This happens throughout the book, a character says or does something, then the author explains what this means, even when it is blindingly obvious. It's incredibly annoying and really takes from the story.It is obvious that a lot of research went into this book, which is fabulous. The only problem is, the author then feels the need to let the reader know just how much work went into the book by filling it with irrelevant and boring details, mostly about clothing.The book largely follows the same outline as Pride and Prejudice, with Ariana's faith and Phillip's lack thereof being the largest source of tension.Phillip is a great, believable character, with a great backstory which explains why he's so disdainful of pretty much everyone. Even when he is softened by Ariana, he is not entirely changed, and remains disdainful towards some people.Ariana, on the otherhand, seems a little inconsistent. While in the English countryside, she is willing to marry a much older, wholly unsuitable man, simply because he is a priest, which is why her father agrees to send her to London. Then, there is practically no mention of her faith until Phillip, when she remembers she incredibly devout.This book is incredibly preachy. I knew it was a Christian book, but this was my first one, and it has put me off the entire genre. I'm an atheist, but I would read a Christian book if it was a good story. However, if they're all like this, I'm done with them. Ariana described her aunt- who believes in God, but enjoys socialising, and doesn't going to church every Sunday- as a heathen. More than once. I'm not entirely sure if she was joking, but if she wasn't, I'd love to know what Ariana would think of me, a devout atheist who hasn't been inside a church in years, and even then it's only for funerals and weddings.It is instantly apparent that the author is American; there are far too many Britishisms, more than any British person would actually use, and then towards the end of the book, the phrase \\"write him,\\" pops in, whereas pretty much everyone except the Americans uses the phrase \\"write to him.\\" (This is actually a pet hate of mine!)I can't say I'd recommend this book, but pretty much every other review I've read of it was positive, so clearly I'm in the minority. Perhaps it is a great book, it just doesn't do anything for me."},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"As a non-religious reader, this is actually a good romance. The religion doesn't become overbearing til probably two thirds of the way through. Once the hero of the story decides to marry the girl, the story could have ended. However the author brings in the religion in so overbearingly heavy that it takes up another third of the book. So if you don't mind such heavy-handed religious propaganda, kudos to you. But if your like a non-religious reader like me, the first two thirds of the book is great. Just remember to stop after the hero proposes. ;)"},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"To say the least I was pleased I did not pay for this book. It had inconstancy such as she worried that Plil was so much older when she was willing to marry a old perverted preacher! Another thing I disliked was all he needed to do to be save was say the \\"sinner prayer.\\" Tell me where in the Bible it tells you you will be saved by a \\"sinners prayer\\"? The writting was not that impressive. The character's were forced into their situations. I thought he liked her to fast and was stupid acting. Like I said glad it was a free read. It wasn't even funny. The girl acted like a helpless ten year old."},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"I have read much that was written during the Regency time period in England -- and thas has been written about it in later years -- and was delighted when I learned that Burkhard had used it for the setting of a story about a woman of faith. Unfortunately, this delight quickly turned to frustration as I read her book. It seems to me that the writing is ill-paced, reflecting nothing of how speech was delivered in those days, and that the characters could have lived at any time. There is little here that truly reflects the thought and practice of life during the Regency, other than superficials like clothing details.This book needs a good editor, both for the above and because of the grammar problems. Sloppiness like this is uncalled for: \\"Mrs. Bentley finished her list....'We will shop directly,' she informed her niece, who nodded from where she sat, in a lacy cambric morning dress and cap.\\" I'm assuming that the niece was wearing the dress and cap but it doesn't say so. And on the same page (42): \\"Although Ariana was wary of the enormousnous....\\" -- what happened to the word enormity? And on page 50: \\"Mornay is ever discretionary\\" - the word should be discreet. I could go on, and on.All that said, I would be very glad if Burkard would correct these problems and deliver to us a really well-written book about faith issues during the Regency. I think it could be fascinating."},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"Once I overlooked that the deluded girl who stubbornly believes it is God's will for her to marry a 60 year old vicar because he happens to be the only \\"man of God\\" handy is the same girl we (and the hero) are supposed to find so charming and engaging, the book seemed to show promise. That is, until about halfway through when all the characters changed again. The stern aunt becomes a silly old woman delighted because she made a rhyme with her niece's name, the \\"worthy\\" suitor becomes a bit of a stalker, and Ariana becomes a self-righteous prig.And then there are teasers of sub-plots that never go anywhere and/or are resolved in a few paragraphs: the disappearing letters, the \\"new best friend\\" who keeps tempting Ariana away and throwing her together with the stalker, the sightly off couple who accompany the hero and heroine to Vauxhall Gardens but are never heard of once they get in their boat and, the worse, the revealing of the hero's deep, dark secret by some man who has barely made an appearance but is now presented as some sort of rival. This major plot development is quickly resolved with the hero off screen by Ariana going to visit his aunt..with a paragraph or two set aside to describe her outfit as she stands outside the aunt's door mentally preparing herself.And, yes, if a heroine spends 2 pages standing up in small boat making a passionate speech, no one is surprised when she falls overboard...that heavy-handed plot device was probably the turning point downwards.Finally, what in the world is meant by \\"swirling eyes\\"? It made me think of those people who can make their pupils jiggle, which doesn't really enhance the hero's desirability.thatAs a Christian, I hope to find Christian authors that can incorporate faith realistically into their writing with a story that is well-crafted enough to stand on its own. Sadly, I did not find either in this book."},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"This is the only book so far that I almost couldn't finish. It was awful! Not bad enough that she not only shoved ('crammed' might be a better word) her religious....techniques (not just faith) on someone else, but waited until he fell in love with her to do it. This was not only long and unendurable, but completely unbelievable as a story."},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"The only reason I read this book was because I got it for free. Even then, I felt that my time was wasted reading this book. The book started out okay at first and then half way through, the heroine got really annoying insisting that the man she loves truly turned to God before she could marry him. Don't waste your time!!!"},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"After you finish \\"Before the Season Ends\\" you will find a bribe from the author Linore Rose Burkard stating that a free book will be offered to those who give the book a 4 or 5 star review on Amazon. This is blatant hypocrisy especially as the author writes as if she is truly a Christian, not a cheat.The book itself was interesting, I enjoy the Regency period & am a fan of Georgette Heyer who wrote much better Regency novels.Burkard lacks the sense of humor that influenced Heyer, although she did try to be amusing at times. The ending - a foregone conclusion - was way too long and drawn-out.I would probably have given a 3 star review if it hadn't been for the author's offer of a \\"free book\\" bribe."},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"The book is not a keeper, but the time reading it is not lost. I have felt that the book did not flow. The writer created situations that kept my interest and other situations that did not. I loved the book, but sometimes I have felt disappointments. A heroine was not stable with her thoughts to make sense.The thing that stood out was the heroine's faith and beliefs.It was a sweet story. It was a very clean book.The hero possessed his coldness and seemed to look down on others at the beginning of the book, but hero grew to be a lovable man to match his handsome looks.The writer has created a few scenes that occupied my mind that I loved.SPOILERS worth reading:The heroine when she climbed the tree and her running towards people....The writer had sense of humor. I have loved it!The scene when she has fallen from a boat....That scene revealed a big deal how the hero felt. ( Very romantic and sweet scenes followed afterwards.)The two men praying on the grass -- a more powerful scene that I have felt Holy Spirit presentSome things that I did not like:The hero managing wardrobe for a heroine. He was obsessive with clothes. I would never want a man who would control what I wear. The hero was telling a heroine how to dress.Heroine did not make sense about the age differences about her possible matches.The book at times was too sweet for my taste.The writer used a small mystery with disappearing letters, but I hoped for a bit more of suspense or a bigger mystery that would keep readers more at the edge of their seats.For things that I would wish writer would do:I wish for the heroine to be more intriguing, and plots to be more twisted and not so simply solved.I wish for the writer to create more scenes of humor by creating more mischievous scenes, since I did discover that the author has a great mind for it.I would like the book to flow more easily.That sums it up."},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"I loved \\"Before the Season Ends\\". It was an intriguing, 'can't put the book down' read. Looking forward to reading more by this author."},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"I've read this book eight times and enjoyed it every time. Ariana is warned not to raise the ire of a man who has earned his reputation giving ladies, who set their cap for him, a good set down. Ariana doesn't want to be among them, but as you know, if you get too close to the fire you might get burned. She doesn't look for problems -- they find her. Saving her from disaster comes more than once from a least likely source. You'll find this book a good source for laughter while presenting undaunted faith and find that prayer will prove all things work together for good to them who are the called according to His purpose."},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed reading Before the Season Ends. I didn't want to put it down, was disappointed when it came to an end, and then delighted when I found out there is a sequel!

It's a book I wouldn't mind letting my teen daughters read!"},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"I loved every minute of these books. I fell in love with the characters in this series and wish I could keep reading more and more about them. I highly recommend all three books."},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"I got this book free on Kindle. I found this to be a charming romance with enough twists in the story line to keep me interested, even though I knew pretty much what was coming next. Reminded me of one of my favorite books, Jane Eyre. Loved learning new words specific to the time period. The main character's love interest is intriguing, passionate and just what you want in a leading man. I was still ready for more when the book ended."},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"This is a really wonderful story! I liked it very much even though I knew how Ariana's story with Mr. Mornay would end. I loved reading how they met and how their relationship blossomed, struggled, and conquered the difficulties it encountered. It was very inspiring to read about Ariana's convictions about faith and how important that would be for her future marriage. The romance is sweet and clean, too. This is highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"I am a picky reader. It is very difficult for me to find an author that can rate with my favorite authors. (I only have a few.) The writing in this book is wonderful. I received the first in the series as a temporary free selection through Kindle. I'm glad I did. When I saw books two and three at my local bookstore, I grabbed them immediately. So I guess I could say I have another favorite author."},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"You may feel like a better person for having read this book. It had an immediately positive effect on my mood and I was surprised to find an inspirational period romance full of substance and real-life dilemmas still relevant in today's times. The author effortlessly evokes vivid images of another era and her style is very easy to follow and enjoy. Not the sort of romance I THOUGHT I was going to read, but I was not disappointed to be taken on such a surprising and thought-provoking journey. I will be reading the others in this series. I want more!"},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"This is one of the best regency books I have read ina while. Loved the colorful characters and the Christian theme. I will definitely be reading more of what this author has to offer."},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"I got this awesome book on amazon in their top free 100 books list and Im soo happy I did. I have since bought the other 2 stories in this saga and cant wait till they come in. I have read a lot of Christian fiction and now exclusively read only books that are of this caliber. I cant tell you how great this story is. Before the Season Ends by Linore Rose Burkard, Is a true gem of a story. Its very hard to find a Christian Romance that offers not only a great love story but is also filled in really great Christian teaching.A lot of the books I read sometimes just touch on Christian beliefs and scripture, you get a lot of story and little inspiration. Before the Season Ends, has a really great balance of story ,romance and inspiration.This is the story of a Christian young lady who has been sent to her Aunt in London in the 1800s to have a season and find a husband. She is determined to find a Christian husband and feels sure God will answer her prayer ,even though she has no real fortune. Her aunt is funding the cost of the dresses and finery to present her to society in the hopes of making a acceptable match.What follows is a set of circumstances that shows, truly, that all things work for the good for those who have faith that the Lord knows whats best for us even if we cant really see that at first. I really loved this book , it was a joy to read and the Best Christian book I have read that has both story and faith based inspiration.The really great thing is that the story continues in her next book which I bought on amazon in hard copy because I wanted to be sure I had it on my book shelves forever. This is the kind of book you can read and read again. As I said I got this copy on my kindle for free last week, Im not sure if its still available for free but if it is, I encourage you to download it.If you are looking for a great Christian story that has plenty of romance and atmosphere than look no more, this is it!I am thankful that the Lord has made it possible for me to find an author who not only knows how to write a fantastic Regency romance but one who is able to incorporate sound Christian beliefs and situations that we can all learn from . Thank you Linore Rose Burkard ! PLEASE keep writing !"},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"Elements of Burkard's story certainly ring a familiar bell. An alternately dashing then meek heroine with sparkling, witty eyes; an antagonistic, wealthy debonair gentleman - yes we can certainly find common threads here with Austen's novels. Burkard's writing includes Regency turns of phrase, vocabulary and slang, and - being written from an outsider's point of view - details cultural practices in greater depth than those novels written during this period ever do. In fact a glossary of Regency terms is included for those just dipping their toe into the waters of this English era.All that I have mentioned above is not surprising in and of itself. The component of this novel that blindsided me was the instantaneous addiction I experienced when I cracked the pages of Before the Season Ends. I have spent many late nights reading but I have never, ever read until such a late hour as I have with Burkard's first novel. Indeed - if I hadn't noticed the shocking hour (which I will not admit to in print) I believe I would have kept reading until I finished the novel or my family awoke. I will concede that it wouldn't have been long until either of these occurrences took place. After noticing the time I forced myself to set the book aside and finished it later that day.I can't help but wonder if Linore Rose Burkard has somehow created the formula for inspirational romance crack-cocaine, or if her novel was just what I needed that long night. I suppose I will have to wait until her second Regency inspirational romance, The House in Grosvenor Square, is released in April 2009. If her second novel is as shockingly compelling as her first I imagine she can look forward to the creation of her very own inspirational romance empire."},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"\\"Before The Season Ends\\" by Linore Rose Burkard is truly like stepping back into time and picking up a volume of classic literature! These characters have multiple dimensions and the settings a completely built to the point where the reader feels as if she is sitting in a fine chair in the parlor watching the scene unfold before her eyes! This is an incomparable novel!Ariana Forsythe feels called to marry a minister.

If so, you'll love this story, Before the Season Ends, by Linore Rose Burkard.Miss Ariana Forsythe, a nineteen-year-old beauty, is being packed off to her wealthy aunt's home in London to escape an unsuitable match in her little hamlet of Chesterton. Ariana, excited about this new adventure, is also wary of the lack of morality she's afraid of meeting with in fashionable London. She must guard herself against all the blackguards and rakes, especially the infamous Mr. Phillip Mornay.Ariana is a delightful heroine, artless and funny and worthy of her sparring partner, Mr. Mornay. The two of them are so good together, I couldn't help being reminded of Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth Bennett. The story zips along and never fails to entertain and delight. The author, moreover, has obviously done her research, and the whole thing is full of authentic speech and clothing and descriptions, enough to make you feel you are right there in Regency England.I thoroughly enjoyed this Regency romance from beginning to end. It's exactly the kind of story I like to read but rarely ever find. Funny, touching, romantic--I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"Before the Season Ends is a delightful story in the fashion of Jane Austen. The story engrossed me so that I couldn't put the book down. I loved the historical attention to detail in setting and in characters.Linore Rose Burkhard is a master at weaving a love story fraught with pit falls, not the least is the main characters refusal to consider anyone who is not Christian. Usually, when I read \\"Christian\\" stories the author puts up my hackles by preaching at me. Ms. Burkhard manages to make Christianity so much a part of Ariana's character that I barely notice it. In fact, when I finished reading the story I felt extremely good and in tune with the universe.I highly recommend Before the Season. If you missed the first run, which was self-published, it is being re-released by Harvest House Publishers in December 2008. I am looking forward to the sequel \\"The House in Grosvenor Square,\\" coming in 2009."},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"I just finished reading Before the Season Ends by Linore Rose Burkhard.

I picked it up simply to peruse the book and could not put it down. I found the storyline fresh and smart. Burkard crafts her characters masterfully. Even those peripheral to the story seem to come to life and step off the page. She immerses us so convincingly into the era that Regency becomes reality upon opening the book. The language is fantastic. Burkard effectively places the reader right in the center of the excitement and intrigue of a season in London. Finding a book of this quality with a Christian theme woven throughout the story is refreshing and inspiring. I highly recommend the book and am watching for more from this author. I hope I don't have to wait long!"},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"My wife read this self-published book and really liked it.

I hope we can look forward to seeing more wonderfully crafted works from her. (R.

But it is her devotion to her faith and her fierce allegiance to truth that set her apart from the other debutantes as they vie for the eyes of wealthy young men.Linore Rose Burkard does Regency London with exquisite detail, bringing us right into the drawing rooms and palaces, drawing a portrait of the fashions and manners of the ton. The glitter and extravagance of the period lose a bit of their charm when seen through the refreshingly honest viewpoint of her young Christian heroine. The pressures of society and the benefits of making a good match cannot shake Ariana's determination to marry a man of God, even when she falls painfully in love with a man who is very much of the world.An easy-going story, rich with detail."},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"Linore Rose Burkard has created an entertaining historical novel laced with humor, thorough research, romance and powerful principles... a winning combination.

I enjoyed the beginning, getting to know the characters, the adventures in \\"ton\\", but a little more than halfway through the Christian theme overtook the enjoyment of the book. While I agree with what was written, it came across more as a sermon than a work of fiction. I also did not feel much spark between the two main characters.

Phillip is notorious for not marrying, nor for singling out any one woman. When Ariana inadvertently offends a high society matron, rumors are started which could ruin her chances for a successful London season. Phillip then steps in with a ruse that could certainly put all the rumors to rest.Phillip isn't a practicing Christian like Ariana, and she fears losing her heart to him.

I am probably one of those rare people who actually enjoyed the first edition more than the second. But both are essentially the same story. Some more \\"polished\\" editing in the second edition with, i believe, an extra chapter. (Haven't finished reading the second edition yet.)With that said, it is a wonderful story written in a Jane Austin style. There is a strong flavor of Jane Austin in some scenes and the Hero will remind you at times of Mr. Darcy. But thankfully this author is not taking a story already told and retelling it. She has taken some of Jane Austin's example and made her own story.I am happy to have read it. It does have a strong Christian theme of which I am also grateful. But the author does not 'preach' at her audience neither does she hide her christian faith and values."},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"I was really surprised this was the author's first novel because I thought it was extremely well written. It is a great example of the regency style, and the Christian themes were tastefully woven into the story. Readers who like to read stories with faith as a distinct element will very much enjoy this, and those who just like to read a good regency will still get their money's worth!My only caveat (and the reason that it is 4 stars instead of 5) is that I felt that ultimately we weren't shown enough of how the hero changed his approach to faith at the very end. It felt a tiny bit forced and unrealistic, and I would have preferred to see a more gradual and realistic reformation.

I cannot honestly say there is one thing about this book that I didn't like! (And I am rather picky about books) This book is a MUST read, especially for those who enjoy Jane Austen's works. This book reminded me of Pride & Prejudice, though there were many differences.

Burkard does indeed fill the gap left by Jane Austen. This Christian regency read takes you to England, 1813. Ariana Forsythe has the fortunate chance to come out into society because of a rich childless aunt. Arinna hasn't been raised like most of the young girls having their season. Gossip make her uncomfortable as does putting yourself as more important than others.Arianna Forysythe is someone you would desire as a best friend. You root for her throughout the book. She has several misadventures, which throws her into the path of Mr. Monray.Mr. Monray is the new Mr. Darcy! He is of course most desirable and uncatchable by any of the girls having their season; he has even managed to escape others in previous season. Then Ariana falls into his world and everything begins to tilt for him.This book had many moments of well-written humor.The faith aspect of this book is well done as well.

Set in 1813, Before The Season Ends, is a wonderful period novel.We meet Ariana who is being sent to London for the Season for her own good. Her family believes it's for the best and her Aunt Bentley has been requesting her nieces to be sent for a number of years. Before Ariana is sent, she is warned not to get involved with any men who don't hold to their faith.Ariana's first interaction with an eligible man is with the confirmed bachelor, Mr. Mornay. Mornay's reputation for putting off women is legendary. So, when he meets a woman who has no interest in him whatsoever, his interest is actually piqued.Their time spent with each other becomes more frequent, although the reason behind it leaves Ariana no room to wonder why. Ariana has no reason to be anything other than herself and Mornay finds this to be refreshing.This book is a fantastic period novel. Linore Rose Burkard uses scenery, language and atmosphere to bring it all to life. She has created characters who hold true to their beliefs and ways of thinking.

This is the first Christian Regency Romance Novel I have heard of and it is definitely a niche to be filled. I was swept away to England in the early 1800s. I love the characters and their interactions. The beginning was a little slow but it picked up pace quickly. The author did an excellent job at describing without bogging the story down. I was on pins and needles turning the page. It is not a Jane Austen redo at all but a wonderful novel on its own. I highly recommend this book that is going on my 2008 favorites list. :)"},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"Darn you Linore Rose Burkard! I started reading Before the Season Ends around eight o'clock on a Saturday night. I intended to read a few chapters before bed. Instead I didn't get to sleep until 1:30 am! I couldn't put this book down! Ariana Forsythe is the perfect Regency romance heroine. She's innocent with a good heart and a strong will. Her parents send her for a season in London with her wealthy aunt to evade an inappropriate suitor. Her aunt quickly warns her to give a wide berth to the Paragon of the beau monde: Phillip Mornay who is known for shattering the hopes of any woman who gives him a second look and yet is beloved by everyone who is anyone. Of course, Ariana and Mornay meet cute and then are forced to spend time together due to the machinations of an angry hostess. In the hands of a lesser author, this plot could have quickly fallen into stereotypes, but Burkard has created wonderful characters, fascinating secondary characters, and lots of twists and turns guaranteed to keep this series thrilling. Ariana's faith truly defines who she is, and everyone around her is touched by lightness that surrounds her. I really love that Burkard didn't make the antagonists caricatures or super-evil. They are simply people motivated by their own self-interests who have regrets and insecurities. I simply cannot wait for the sequel, The House in Grosvenor Square, to come out in April!"},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"Before the Season Ends (A Regency Inspirational Romance)I have been reading good Regency romances since I was about 16 years old. That's 40 years. You do the math. This is one of the most delightful, well written book in this genre I've read in a long time. It had humor that made me laugh out loud, I enjoyed the descriptions of every piece of clothing, painting on the wall, room decorations and outdoor scenes. It made me feel like I was there, right in the story, walking beside the characters. The characters were developed well and I loved hearing about the change that God made in their lives as he was revealed through the truth of the scriptures. I recommend this to anyone wanting all of the above experience and more. I am looking forward to reading what is coming next from this author."},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"Before the Season Ends is a book that pulled me in and made the characters, story and scenery come alive. This historical novel is beautifully written and keeps readers engaged from beginning to end. I love that it is written purely in a historical style, not trying to incorporate modern social issues into it.Linore Rose Burkard is an outstanding author and I sincerely look forward to reading much more of her work!"},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"First book I've read by this author and I finished it the day after it came. It was wonderful! A real page turner. Can hardly wait for the sequel next spring."},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"This was a great read! Endearing characters, interesting storyline, historically accurate details & descriptions. In fact, the plot and writing style had many parallels to Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice."},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"I haven't read a book that I just couldn't put down in a while, but this was one of those! I must admit, I'm only half way through and I can't wait to curl up in my bed tonight and find out what comes next! I have read many of the free books on Amazon, and most of them are just ok, but this one is a keeper!"},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"I think the part I enjoyed the most about Before the Season Ends was how the book interwove a love story and salvation through faith, not by works, so intricately. The hero was gentlemanly and honest without being soft and the heroine combined ladylike qualities with a refreshingly spunky spirit. I am looking forward to reading more books by Linore Rose Burkard. I really appreciated the glossary at the end of the book. Is was helpful in understanding some of the British terms and locations mentioned throughout the book providing a bit of history about the Regency period along with being informative."},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"I can't say enough about how enjoyable and intriguing the characters and plots are! Paced beautifully without unending descriptions of trivial things! I also purchased The House in Grovsvenor Square, and The Country House Courtship because I was so impressed with her first book in the trilogy. I most definitely was NOT disappointed. Her Christian approach and style of writing a romance series is refreshing and to be commended. There is no lack of humor, romance and passion (which does not have to be explicitly explained to the reader- you can FEEL the tension and passion through Ms. Burkard's talented writing). As for intrigue- it keeps you turning the pages! What I loved most about Ms. Burkard's writing is that the stories are blessedly UNPREDICTABLE, and that the stories are thought provoking- especially when we examine our own relationship with God and others. Five stars and I CAN'T WAIT FOR HER NEXT BOOK! WHAT TALENT! Bravo, Ms. Burkard; we need more writers like you. Everything I've read since I've completed reading your books, which is considerable, has dulled by comparison."},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"I am so glad I got the chance to read this book and it's two sequels. It is a joy to see the Christian element in a romance so well written. The characters are delightful, especially Philip Mornay, my favorite character! He is so down to earth but so dreamy! I love the main character, Ariana, too! What fun this series has been. I look forward to more from this amazingly talented author!"},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"I love regency books and this one was quite good. Burkard has captured the Regency period quite well.Once I finished the book, it made me analyze my relationship with God, I wish I had gotten on my knees to pray a little more, which Ariana did frequently throughout the book.Hope to read more from this author. Would recommend this Christian book"},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"This book kept my interest from first page to last - it has certainly become one of my new favorites!!"},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"Before the Season Ends, by Linore Rose Burkard, was given to me as a Christmas gift this year (along with its sequel, The House in Grosvenor Square) and I spent most of Christmas Day and half of the next day reading it. I couldn't put it down at any point. It's being billed as \\"Inspirational Romance for the Jane Austen Soul\\" which made me particularly intrigued, as I love both the Victorian and Regency Time Periods (Jane Austen is one of my favorite authors), and Inspirational Romance is often what I write.Before the Season Ends begins with Ariana Forsythe's family sending her to London to escape a suitor they consider unsuitable (for good reason), hoping some culture (museums, theatres, the ballet) will help round out Ariana's education and take her mind off her suitor. But, her aunt (and now her chaperone and guardian in London), Agatha Bentley, has another idea: marrying Ariana off to a rich and elegant bachelor of the highest rank. When Ariana first hears of Phillip Mornay, she decides he is perhaps the least likely candidate for a husband because he is ill-tempered and too rich to associate with anyone beneath his own station, besides being incredibly handsome. However, Before the Season Ends, Aunt Bentley is determined to make the match possible. What ensues can be scandalous, comical and laugh-out-loud delightful, especially considering Ariana, while endowed with the ability to be graceful and charming, has a tendency to let her temper flare and her outdoor manners run wild.One of the important facets of Before the Season Ends is Ariana's devotion to God, and the role He plays in her every day life. Of course, she wants her future husband to feel as close to God as she does, but Phillip Mornay is not known for any pious inclinations, which makes his suitability, in her eyes, impossible.If you have any leanings toward Jane Austen, the Regency Era, or just plain fun reading, you've got to read Linore Rose Burkard's book. I thoroughly enjoyed Before the Season Ends, and recommend it heartily."},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"The first few pages of Before the Season Ends sounded rather silly. But once I got into it I was delighted at this story in early eighteenth century London. Someone said it was reminiscent of Jane Austen but I've never read Jane Austen. To me it was more like Anne of Green Gables. I like the Christian theme. The main character is caring and encourages the reader to be Christlike. It's also a good tool to use to help an unsaved person hear the Gospel of Christ in a nonthreatening way.I did like this book enough to award it 4 stars.This is the first book I've read by Mrs. Burkard. I liked it so much I've bought the 2nd book in the series and look forward to the release of the third."},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"I really enjoyed this unique perspective on the traditional Regency Romance, where the marriage mart occurs during the Season, but there is rarely a mention of any faith beyond \\"family values\\", honor, the church or the vicar. How refreshing to read a tale of this era and hear about God in a meaningful way, including extended prayer times. I highly recommend this book, if you like this time period for romantic novels. It is a sweet love story. I had a hard time putting it down since I was so engrossed in how the author would deal with the story and still fit it into the standard outline of boy meets girl, dates, and gets married at the end.It does remind me of the books by Julie Klassen who also writes love stories in this timeframe, as well as Lawana Blackwell, though both write with a different template than traditional Regency Romances. They are also very worthwhile reading. I commend the author for her wonderful story and for proving that a Christian Regency Romance can be written well."},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"I loved this book! It had me caught from the first few pages and continued to reel me in page after page. Not only a great entertaining book but an educational one -- I learned many new words and customs of the Regent time period in such an enjoyable way! Am looking forward to the next book!"},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"Ended up getting all 3 books in the series. Great reading and all the books worked multiple characters quite well so you even cared about Prinnie, at least a little."},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"Before the Season Ends is a light, inspirational romance written in the Austen style. I enjoyed the first 3/4 of the book much more than I did the ending. I liked the build-up to the declaration of love but then things seemed to drag. My only other complaint was the lack of description when they first kissed. I don't want too much detail or explicitness but a little emotion would be nice rather than just \\"...and then he kissed her...\\" Overall, I enjoyed the book and the lead characters."},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"This book was just \\"okay\\"...it kept my interest until about half-way through. Then it went down hill to the end. It was NOT inspirational and far-from-real!!"},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"Nineteen year old Ariana Forsythe is convinced that God has called her to marry a man of the church, and she sets her sights on the elderly vicar of her family's country parish. Not wishing her to marry a much older man, her parents send her off to London to stay with her father's wealthy sister. Ariana looks forward to seeing the sights of London but her aunt has grand plans for the beautiful girl and they include being the toast of the ton and marrying a wealthy peer. On a visit to a country estate, Ariana literally runs into one of the patronesses of Almacks and innocently offends her. Next, Ariana invokes the ire and the interest of The Paragon, Phillip Mornay. When Lady Worthington tries to cause a scandal involving Ariana and Mr. Mornay, he rises to the occasion to rescue the innocent young girl. Ariana gets caught up in a whirl of high society and even catches the eye of the Prince Regent. Even though she's enjoying herself, Ariana knows Mr. Mornay would not make a good husband, even if he were interested in her, for he is not a true Christian. Ariana prays for his soul and prays God will direct her to the right husband, one of true faith and good character. Mr. Mornay seems to fit the character requirement but a Mr. O'Brien fulfills the faith requirement. Ariana prays a lot more for guidance and help coming to a decision while preaching to the ones she loves and badgering them to become true Christians. I absolutely hate preachy books, preachy characters and people who try to beat others into believing what they believe and this book has them all. At first Ariana is charming and funny with lots of country innocence but the author ruins the book by making Ariana turn wishy-washy. Ariana prays constantly and quotes Scripture as she tries to figure out what to do. I can't relate to that. The story would have been a lot better if she had accepted that it was God's will to marry a kind and generous man who loves her and whom she loves back. It also would have made the story shorter. Mr. Mornay isn't all that likable either. The story never gets inside his head and the reader only learns about the events that shaped his life second hand, as Ariana learns them from someone else! He is also overbearing at times, wanting to protect Ariana but also demanding that he choose her clothes, forever! It's hard to like a character without knowing what he's thinking. Ariana's aunt is a stereotypical dowager of the ton, scheming matchmaker and demanding aunt who never listens to Ariana or cares what the girl thinks or feels. This story starts off well but deteriorates towards the last quarter of the novel. I wouldn't recommend this one except maybe to Christians. As far as Christian Regency romances go, I much prefer All the Tea in China by Jane Orcutt."},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"I have nothing about Christian romances but this book is strictly for hard core fundamentalists. Having formerly been involved in that sphere of Christianity, I had no problems initially with this book and considered it a good read. However, about midway through the book it became tiresome and annoying. The heroine seems more suited to a life as a nun than as someone's wife, constantly praying over every... single... event in her life, so much so that I was skipping numerous pages at a time. Calling it preachy would be an understatement.To the author's credit, it is very well written and much more akin to Jane Austin books than today's romance novels. Societal decorum is followed to a much higher degree and it is squeaky clean in all aspects.If you are looking for a sermon, look no further but if you want a regency romance without a constant religious tome, keeping looking."},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"This novel centers around Ariana Forsythe, a country girl from a religious family who believes she has a \\"calling\\" to marry someone who serves God. This leads her to pursue a 60 year old man in her hometown. When the old rector does in fact ask for her hand in marriage, her equally religious parents panic and send her to London for a season. The family isn't rich but Ariana has a childless aunt who has been offering to host her older sister and pay all of the bills. Although dismayed, Ariana goes along with her family's wishes and is pleasantly surprised to realize that she loves the atmosphere of London. Unfortunately, gossip soon ties her to a well-known bachelor, Mr.Mornay. Mornay proves himself to be a wonderful gentleman and the two soon fall in love. But despite their love, Ariana does not believe God would approve of her marrying a man who is not as religious as herself (which is hard to find considering she should be a nun!).As you probably noticed, the last sentence was a bit bitter. I really enjoyed the first half of the book but the second half was so preachy I could barely keep reading. I am nineteen, the same age as Ariana, but I am not religious. I have a few extremely religious friends but none so narrow-minded as Ariana. She is the kind of person who would smile at you but all the while is secretly praying you find God so you do not go to hell. She brought up (not just mentioned) God and prayer 20 times in under 100 pages.I'm a little confused how Mornay fell in love with Ariana. They met during her first ton event when she decided to climb and sit in a tree. She was missing so long that her aunt sent out a search party. She also almost chose another gentleman whose only asset was that he is joining the church over her love for Mornay. Ariana was stubborn and juvenile. Besides her beauty, there was little to attract him. Looking at a lot of other reviews, I realize I'm going to get a lot of unhelpful votes. And yet the closure will be worth it."},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"I've read Christian romances before but the preachiness of this book is the strongest I've read.I enjoyed reading the first half of the book, I felt the Christian references worked perfectly. The heroine did not talk of her faith much in the first part, she prayed for finding the match God wants for her & read scriptures. However, when her prayers were answered, she was not content & it appeared to me that she doubted that the man who fell in love with her, whom she was also in love with, was who God chose for her. Then she turned into a religious fanatic. Wha-?! What happened? The heroine changed overnight. She was consumed with faith, all of a sudden. It was suggested to her that perhaps God chose the hero for her so she can bring him to faith, but she didn't believe it.I agree with another reviewer who said the hero was Mr. Darcy-like. I liked him, actually, his devotion to this religious fanatic was going beyond whipped, I thought :DThe heroine wanted he hero to change his faith but she wasn't willing to change or lighten up a bit for him. And she's 19 & he's almost 30! Definitely immature. I found it difficult to finish the book, have been skipping most of the parts. What a pity, it would have been a really beautiful story."},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"I loved this novel by Burkard!! Any Jane Austen fans will love it! It deals with religion a lot which I was not expecting, but had thoughtful insights to add to the novel and well developed characters! I recomend this to anyone who wants an accurate account and great Regency Romance novel!! Thanks for a Great enjoyable read Burkard!!"},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"\\"Before the Season Ends\\", a character driven, Regency Romance, is a book which deals with a time in England when high society was profligate and Christian in name only. Into this moral cesspool, Ariana is thrown by her secularly motivated, ladder-climbing Aunt. A headstrong, fanciful, poor-aristocratic, girl, Ariana immediately finds herself at odds with the values of her peers. Throughout the novel, the tension builds as she writes letters to her Father for advice and wonders why she has had no answers. A 'helpful' maid, Molly, even offers to mail one for her -- a bit of information that prepares the reader for a surprise at the end.This is one of the best books I have read recently, even though at the beginning the plot moves at the pace of the era itself. Everything within this novel, from plot pacing and tension, to language, morality, dialog, and the deep Christian witness (displayed by the heroine), rings true to its period. It is well done, even the bit about her letters that got slammed by the reviewer in Publisher's Weekly. At the end, this reviewer was left wanting more -- which opens the way for her sequels, \\"The House in Grosvenor Square\\" and \\"The Country House Courtship.\\"I also found this e-book to be a bold allegory for our own times. Likewise, for the modern Christian, it provides a template for dealing with our own society's moral debauchery. Well done, Linore Rose Burkard, this reviewer looks forward to reading more via Kindle."},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"Hi: I really liked this book. It was so romantic, and Ariana was soo cute. I think that the plot was very well thought-out and the descriptions of Ariana's feelings were pretty accurate and adorable. I really enjoyed this book, and it's the first book I've enjoyed for a while. The male protagonist was very alluring as well. Their romance really made my heart sing because it was so innocent and pure. I felt the interactions of the British ton were very accurate and true to the human nature, and the descriptions of the gowns and things were to die for! I would very much like to live in that era, at least for a day. More, please! ^_^"},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"It is nice to read Regency romance with clean writing and inspirational message. The descriptions are well done, and the plot moves along quickly without being rushed. While the storyline will seem impossible to some readers, the author does a good job of providing a heroine who stands for what she believes in spite of internal struggles and doubt. The ending was a satisfying conclusion but definitely left me ready to read the sequel."},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"This book was pure pleasure to read, on many levels - attention to historical detail and custom, engaging characters, and an entertaining plot, to name a few. But the aspect I found most intriguing was the author's ability to fill the book from beginning to end with weighty spiritual matters, and yet give it such a delicate and natural feel. I've never read a fiction book that handled so much theology so very well. I look forward to reading the sequel."},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"I have always enjoyed Regency Romance and being a Christian, a properly executed inspirational angle is sublime. However, many attempts to conjoin romance and inspirational fiction comes across as cloying and insincere. So, I selected this book with a mix of apprehension and excitement.This book is neither cloying nor insincere. It tells the story of a young woman intent on marrying a man who shares her faith, even if that means the local vicar who is many times her age. To save her from this fate, her parents reluctantly send her into the arms of her all-too-fashionable aunt and into the very heart of Regency England, London. From this comical beginning comes an earnest, warm account of a young woman caught between her faith and the norms of her age.I loved how the author shed light on the state of Christianity at that time in England, when Methodism was growing within the arms of the Anglican faith, and how these two initially related to each other. It gave the story an interesting Christian history angle which complemented well with the overall romantic arc.I would absolutely recommend this to any Christian who enjoys romance and maybe anyone who enjoys romance and is intrigued by the idea of a Christian regency romance."},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book. In particular the first half of it. There were some corny parts but it mostly worked well. I think it would have worked better if he'd done the visit to her father before she'd agreed to the engagement."},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"I thought this was an interesting book to read. It had the things I look for in book, romance, history. You don't want to put it down."},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"The book well written. The character were easily imagined and were brought to life by the author. I loved the fact that she used her God given talent for writing and used it for evangelism. Her knowledge of her topic, Regency England as well as the Bible, was refreshing to read. Sometimes one is given over to the other. I truly enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"Written well, nice story and characters, good portrayal of human shortcomings and emotions, appreciate the bible quotes, can't put it down and I'll be looking for another one by this author.

Can't wait to get it."},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"I read this when I went to sleep, I fell asleep reading this book, and I woke up and grabbed this book... That's how good it is!

There appears to be at least one more book in this series and I am super excited to read it!I cannot say enough good things about this book! When they say for the Jane Austen Soul they are not exaggerating. If you have been reading my blog you know I loveeeee Jane Austen and always get excited when I find books that are reminiscent of her writing and style.Linore definitely captures it!I don't remember ever reading anything by Linore before but you can be assured I will now be looking for more things by her after reading this book.And Linore if you read this..I commend you on superior writing and such great names for your characters!

Absolutely loved it and highly recommend it to all!*Note* I received this book for free from Harvest House in exchange for a review about it. I am not required to post a positive review. Any opinions expressed are my own and they are sincere."},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"Before The Season Ends is a charming romance set in 1813 Regency England with a strong Christian theme which, while a constant thread in this book, is not overwhelming. The author draws the readers into the time period with feisty characters and an entertaining story.Ariana Forsythe is a strong-minded, impish 19-year-old living in small village with her close-knit religious family. However, she is causing her family concern as she has decided that her \\"calling\\" is to marry a man of the cloth. Given that the only man meeting her criteria in their village is 60 years old, the family has a dilemma. Ariana is certain and unyielding in her decision, and so a solution must be reached quickly.Each season their wealthy aunt, a London socialite, has begged the family to allow her to sponsor their daughters as they came of age. It was not at all unusual for a girl to be sent to London for the season. Although Ariana's family thinks they are the best judge of who is right for her, they feel that they must send her.In London she is quickly entangled with London society's most formidable bachelor, Mr. Mornay, whose reputation is his delight in ruining any young girl's season should she dare approach him. Everyone looks to his approval--and simply by ignoring the girl who crosses his path, it can destroy her in society's eyes. Her aunt has warned her to avoid him at all costs. She tried, but she literally runs smack into him during her first society affair.Ariana also meets a young man who is just what she is looking for. Why is it that despite this seemingly perfect match, her thoughts are constantly coming back to Mr. Mornay?Well-written, interesting, captivating, romantic, inspirational, and addictive, I highly recommend this book. It shows how the Lord can influence every part of your life without being overly preachy. To be honest, this was my first \\"inspirational\\" Regency romance, and I was not expecting much. However, to my surprise, I could not put it down, and I am now recommending it to all my friends.Armchair Interviews agrees."},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"I just adored the characters in \\"Before the Season Ends\\" Ms. Burkard has a gift for bringing her characters to life with humor and faith. I laughed out loud and was also brought to tears while reading this beatifully written book. I love reading stories that show the impishness of a heroine, while never concealing the lady underneath, and Ms. Burkard captured that brilliantly. She also brought to life a period that we can only dream about, when men were gentlemen and women were ladies and young women were respected for their virtue. I can't wait to go back in time again with another Inspirational Regency by Linore Rose Burkard.Alice TjiongHolland, Michigan"},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"A really nice surprise! This is definitely an original regency romance and more in the style of Georgette Heyer rather than Amanda Quick.I was impressed that Burkard made good efforts to get a Regency Tone rather than relying on (as is often done) bad use of slang to imply this tone. Her whole structure and manner was very well done.This is a Christian Regency and the christian theme is predominant in this. This was my only niggle with it but I don't think it was a drawback to it - or shouldn't be for other readers. It is definitely a unique feature in her writing to use this as an underlying theme. It is also interesting to use this theme in a Regency where standards of conduct were judged by whether you did it in public or private. The times were certainly changing and a greater emphasis on good christian conduct was entering society - a precursor to the more devout Victorian era.It is always nice to read new Regency authors, and I will be reading more of Burkard, as her tone and originality were refreshing."},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"Throughout the beginning and middle of novel it was clear that the main character is fervent in her faith, however the way it was incorporated didn't detract from the story. If the author had wrapped up the story at about 75% through, I would have given it a significantly better rating, but the last quarter of the book really drags. At this point it stops being a historical romance and the story revolves around the heroine coming to terms with her faith and how/if she can accept the man she loves since he isn't as Christian as she is. The hero is Christian, is charitable, and doesn't lie, but isn't a \\"true\\" Christian in her opinion. Its just boring to read, and the author's eventual solution seems ridiculous. The hero doesn't feign his faith to win her over, which I credited him for. But in the end all he has to do is say the sinner's prayer and all of her concerns fly out the window. Moreover he doesn't even say the prayer because he chooses to, he loses a bet. I'm sorry, but if that was the solution I wish the author had written it a few chapters earlier and just gotten it overwith. I won't be reading the sequels."},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"I discovered this book because, periodically, I download most of the books on the \\"Top 100 Free\\" list and give them what I call the \\"20-page rule,\\" meaning if the book doesn't catch my interest in 20 pages, I don't bother finishing it. I really enjoy (clean) historical romances and Christian/Inspirational Fiction, and this fell into both categories neatly. I was pleasantly surprised by the book and was definitely hooked before I had read 20 pages. At first I was doubtful that I would like the main character, Ariana Forsythe (is that a romance novel name or what?), and thought she might be kind of wishy-washy or prone to tears, which bores me. However, my first impression was unfounded, and she really grew on me until I was emotionally invested in her story.I would describe this novel as what may result if Jane Austen, Georgette Heyer, and Janette Oke collaborated on a project, so if you like any or all of these authors, you'll really enjoy this book. I don't want to give the whole plot away, but I will say that parts of it reminded me of \\"Pride and Prejudice,\\" because of the characters' making snap judgments about one another without having all the facts and Phillip's tendency to come off as rude and arrogant, among other things. I was also reminded of \\"The Corinthian,\\" by Georgette Heyer (one of my favorite books ever!) because of the humor in this book and Phillip's ability to be fastidious about his dress and appearance without coming off as anything but masculine. I would even say, to a lesser degree, that I was reminded of \\"Jane Eyre,\\" by Charlotte Bronte, because Phillip has some dark events in his past that the reader is largely unaware of until late in the story, which have colored his personality, and Ariana is sort of a \\"balm to his spirit.\\"I don't mean to say that this novel has been done before, though. These slight similarities are just another feature to enjoy to the reader who has also appreciated the books I've mentioned. The plot is original and surprising, in a genre where you pretty much know how everything is going to end, but read it anyway. Just when I thought there would be no more twists, there's one or two more, and I really liked that.Last but not least, as a Christian, I truly appreciated the way in which the author handled the matters of faith. Ariana's faith is genuine, and she is quick to recognize the (vast!) difference between fashionable religious lip-service and a real relationship with God. This and the all-important matter of salvation and forgiveness are included in such a way as to never sound preachy or out of place in the story. I will definitely read the sequel!"},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"Excellent book. I couldn't put it down after a few chapters because I was curious as to what would happen between Ariana and Phillip. This book had the perfect mix of suspense and romance. I looked forward to the ending and then was glad to find out there was another book with these characters. I am looking forward to reading it soon."},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"Jane Austen fans beware. You will not be able to put this book down. Before the Season Ends is one of those books with a permanent place on my bookshelf that I intend to read over again.Ms. Burkard is a talented author. Her writing style is that which pulls you in and doesn't let go until you've reached the end. And even then you wish there to be more. Thank goodness there's a sequel. Indeed, I was quite astounded at the aptitude of the author not that I discounted Ms. Burkard before reading, but that she is just so very good at writing Regency. You might even believe you're reading a period novel. Her writing stays in tune with the time period to the extent as to even match the spelling of certain words like-connexion- for connection. The same way Jane Austen spelled it.The writing does resemble that of Jane Austen if not in style than in technicalities. Just like Jane the POV (point of view) does switch from head to head in certain places within a scene while primarily staying with the heroine. There is even a hint of the narrator just like Jane at times. For those certain comments could not come from the heroine but an all-knowing narrator.The author's description of Regency England and especially London is so detailed that you would have thought she slipped back in time to take down notes. There are also such stunning descriptions of places and homes and the things within the home. Being a historian myself, I appreciated this side of her book as well. Very well researched. As one who loves classic literature of the Regency and Victorian era, I thought her book fit right in with the likes of Jane Austen, Elizabeth Gaskell and Charles Dickens.The heroine, Ariana Forsythe, starts out seeming quite young and naive at the onset of the book. As we aren't allowed into her POV much in the 1st 3 chapters, I wasn't quite sure of want kind of character she would turn out to be. She is a young woman of great moral fiber who loves God and in following His commandments receives the desires of her heart. Ariana is such an endearing character. I enjoyed her very much. What an example she is to all young women even today in their Christian walks. The reasons that the unattainable Mr. Mornay falls in love with her are the very same reasons you will find her delightful.Mr. Philip Mornay is called the Paragon. Every lady wishes to attract him and every man tends to emulate him. From fashion, wealth, and society he is at the peak of the swell. He's very proud and at times seems angry. He can be brusque and rude and everyone allows it because he is the Paragon. Then he meets Arianna and his heart and behavior begin to change. For every action there is a reaction and Ariana soon learns the reasons for the behaviors in the man she has come to love.My one qualm with the book is that I wish there had been more time spent in the POV of the hero, Mornay. Of course, the same could be said of Jane Austen which of course has resulted in all those modern written spin off novels.Before the Season Ends was simply enchanting from the first page to the last. It is very romantic and yes even passionate at times. Such a sweet romance and one that got my heart to pounding to see these characters get together. The Christian message is quite transparent from the very first chapter. No watered down Christianity here. It was wonderful to see the plan God had in the lives of these two people. I look forward to reading the sequel."},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"I have read Before the Season Ends twice already and what a great book! Both times I got so caught up in the story that I stayed up late into the night, not willing to put it down! The characters are real and delightful, and Linore really helps to paint a picture of that time period; you feel as if you are there with them! You never know how the book is going to turn out, and I would love to see this turned into a movie. The main character also reminded me that prayer is not some last-ditch effort; it is a lifestyle of conversing with the Friend who is always with you and loves to work His miracles in your life. It is a must-read, a story that will lift you up and stay in your thoughts long after you've finished the last chapter."},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"I realized right off that Ms. Burkard was totally familiar with the Regency period. Having recently read Pride and Prejudice and Emma, both by Jane Austen, I immediately felt the pull of this time period. The dress, the language, the actions (what is proper and what is not), the interiors of the homes, the mode of travel, the personalities of people in different social clases all combined to transport me to the early 1800s.The author did a marvelous job of setting up the tension of Ariana and Mr. Mornay's meeting even before it happened. All of the characters in this novel were fleshed out no matter how minor they were.I enjoyed the humorous incidents involving Ariana and Mr. Mornay. They served to bring these two characters closer together. In fact, I detected the magnetism right off between them, despite their spiritual differences.I was refreshed by Ariana's refusal to compromise her faith just to be with the most desirable bachelor around. I'm reminded of the character of Moses having been brought up in Pharoah's household. Later Pharoah tried to get Moses to compromise and Moses refused. So it was with Ariana who refused to be influenced to go the easy route and thus compromise her spiritual foundation. It was an admirable trait of Ariana to remain firm in her convictions.Ms. Burkard provided a glossary of terms in the back of her book which was helpful. However, her knack for weaving these terms into the context of the novel made it unnecessary to constantly consult that glossary.I rate this story five stars and am looking forward to her future books."},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"Review by Jill WilliamsonEngland, 1813. A time when a young lady's life was all about finding the best husband. Country girl Ariana Forsythe's parents do not approve of the man she has set her sights on and send her to London to live with her rich Aunt Bentley. Ariana can hardly wait to see the city, a place filled with history, museums, and art. Aunt Bentley has different ideas of how Ariana will spend her time, however, and drags Ariana on countless shopping trips to prepare for her debut into society.But Aunt Bentley over exaggerates. Arianna is not the eldest daughter nor does she have a large inheritance, though no man could doubt it the way Aunt Bentley presents her niece. Ariana feels as though she is deceiving everyone she meets. She does not wish for a rich husband. She only wants one who loves God as much as she does.Ariana seems to attract disaster. A misunderstanding with a rich and powerful woman results in a vicious rumor about Ariana and London's current rich and rouge bachelor, Philip Mornay. Despite Philip's indifference toward young women seeking a husband, he offers to help Ariana dispel these rumors by pretending to court her. Ariana's faith and future are on the line. Will Philip's intentions help to clear her name? And can she resist giving her heart to a man who does not share her love of God?What a delightful read! I love books based on this period in history. Ms. Burkard has written a wonderful story of the complications of high society life in regency England. Her characters were both charming and deep. I longed for Ariana to find what she really wanted and get away from her manipulating aunt. But Ms. Burkard found clever ways to overcome each worrisome development Ariana managed to get herself into. I highly recommend this novel for those who love Jane Austen and romance stories."},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"This was an OK regency. If it were not for the thorough integration of born-again Christianity throughout the book, I don't think it would make much of a stir. Although a decent story, it is nowhere near the entertainment or characterizations presented in Georgette Heyer's or Jane Austen's novel. The heroine is certainly all that is good, very likable, engaging, and devout. Quite a bit of detail is presented on fabrics and dresses. The author does a good job of offering her a choice between two appealing heros---appealing in very different ways. One is an attractive, reliable, spiritually devoted, handsome man fervently following his deep Christian beliefs which dovetail with the heroine's in a beautiful, admirable manner. The other male lead is more like Mr. Darcy, brooding, yet a gentleman, with high social standing, good \\"ton\\", wealthy in worldly riches (including a beautiful wardrobe), but has not welcomed Jesus Christ into his life and has no intention of doing so.I knew that Christianity was an important theme in this book, yet for me, the novel contained too much focus on this issue, too many scenes of the main character praying, reading the Bible, and too many pages on the importance of declaring your identity through God, rather than gaining your Christian identity through \\"good works\\". This, however, was a central struggle for the main character in choosing how to live her life in the \\"ton\\" and in how to choose her husband---but for me, it was too much of a focus for too long in the novel. To me this was not a Regency novel with a Christianity theme but a Christianity novel that happened to be set in the Regency period."},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"I loved this book! I am a huge Jane Austen fan, and since she only completed 6 full novels, it's hard to find more books like hers. But this was great and I love the style!!! I've already ordered the 2nd one in the series!"},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"The little gem was recommended to me- and I was pleasantly surprised by what I found. This is a regency period romance written in 2008, but it reads much like a Georgette Heyer novel. In fact, my mind automatically compares Burkard's Philip Mornay (the Paragon) to Heyer's Beau Brummel. This is a fun, memorable book, and I look forward to seeing more of this type of writing from this author."},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"I couldn't put this book down I enjoyed it so much...Burkard did an excellent job intertwining christian values and historical fiction. I can't wait to read more."},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"I absolutely loved this book! It kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time! I laughed out loud! I cried! I devoured this book in a matter of days! You'll fall in love with each and every single one of these characters! I couldn't put this book down!!! I want to get this on BBC's hands!!! Absolutley the best book I ever read. And it keeps getting better and better with each series and chapter. Each page and chapter kept me in suspense!An absolutely MUST read!!"},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"Delightful read!The cover itself begs to be compared to Jane Austen and there's no missing the similarities. From the setting to the characters, there are parallels to be had--parallels that the Jane Austen fan will adore. Houses and dresses described in detail, heroine's to cherish, gentlemen aloof and worthy. There is much to be appreciated here.There are also several differences. While Austen certainly didn't shy away from references to the church in her novels, Burkard has embraced its role in the lives of her characters. There are still colorful ministers to be found, but it is Christ Himself who takes a larger role in her story. From the heroine's prayer life to her utter dependence on the Lord for direction, Burkard has given literature a character with a solid foundation of Christianity and a heart to do what is right. The treatment is delightful and her heroine honest and contrite.Another welcome difference was the prominence of the love interest, Phillip Mornay. With obvious references to Mr. Darcy, Phillip is at first haughty and rude. Burkard indulges the reader and allows us, by comparison, considerably more insight into Mornay's life. In this way, we get to know him more intimately than Austen's Mr. Darcy for example. As an Austen fan, this has long been a happy frustration of mine, and I found myself giddy that Burkard favored the reader with information we were bound to want.Needless to say, I am looking forward to the second book in this series. Interesting characters, a fun plot, a bright and airy read--I'd recommend this book to all the Austen fans out there, especially those with a Christian heritage."},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"This is a wonderful piece of historical fiction. You really feel yourself drawn into the characters and the plot. Although it is a Christian book (which is a plus), it doesn't sound preach-y. I couldn't put it down and highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"Spoiler warningThe first half of the book is very interesting and goes at a reasonable pace. The Christian theme is subtle and adds quite nicely to the story. However, the second half is far too preachy for me and I lost all sympathy with the protagonist as a result. It was also so drawn out that by the end I didn't even care whether she got married or not.The ending was also too predictable and not very believable. Like another reviewer, I had the feeling that one person wrote the first half and another person wrote the second half.Personally, during the second half I began to doubt whether I would ever really want to associate with the protagonist as her sermons on religion (and general attitude) became very distasteful to me.But anyway, in terms of the actual mechanics of the book, the second half dragged on for too long and the ending was both not very credible and very predictable.I won't be reading the sequel."},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"If you enjoy reading Jane Austen you will likely enjoy this book. The characters were well developed and for the most part the story flowed well. My complaint is that there was too much time spent in Ariana's head. I grew tired of hearing her internal dialogue about the same issue. Easily fixed, skipped many sections when it felt tiresome and enjoyed the heart of the story.I felt the last part of the book needed more work. Imagine Mr. Darcy wagering his salvation in a fencing match. This was such a silly unessential part of the story which left me rolling my eyes.Still, I can easily recommend reading this book as I did enjoy it overall."},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"i dont usually enjoy storied of this era, but this stuck me with such awe right from the beginning and could not put it down for days ! very detailed, very romantic with specific references to the Word of God, . funny at times, tearful at times of very romantic! very inspirational!"},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"Ariana Forsythe is a nineteen year old, intelligent, beautiful and spiritual young woman, who believes that the Lord is calling her to marry a clergyman. So when the rector of her church takes an interest in her, she welcomes his attentions. Mrs. Forsythe cautions her husband on what her second daughter is planning, but when Mr. Forsythe confronts the sixty-some-year-old clergyman, it leads to a fight. To prevent an unwelcome attachment, they accept Mr. Forsythe's sister offer of bringing one of their daughters out for a season. And so Ariana is immediately thrown into London society, a place where fashionable dresses are a must, invitations are \\"everything\\" and the only thing that occupies a single young woman's thoughts is making a fortunate match. While Ariana plays along with her Aunt Bentley's every command, she doesn't succumb to the vindictiveness of that the other young ladies suffer from. Through out the book, she retains her innocence despite the world that surrounds her.She soon makes the acquaintance of Mr. Phillip Mornay, a single, eligible, rich young man known as the \\"Paragon.\\" While he sets the standard for society's men, he doesn't actually conform to society. In fact he rarely attends social functions, offends where he goes and actually wields the power of leading others to shun those who do not meet his standards. Ariana is one of those who innocently crosses him, but he is more drawn to her than he is offended. A rumor spreads that they have an understanding and instead of leaving her to fight on her own, Phillip comes to her defense. Despite their differences, gradually they fall in love but her faith in Christ divides them.Without giving away too much of the plot, I'll end my outline there. To me, \\"Before the Season Ends\\" was reminiscent of \\"Pride and Prejudice,\\" except that the hero and heroine generally like each other. The characters are unique; Ariana is young and innocent, a very believable and realistic character. I think it's every young woman's dream to have a kind of fairy godmother kind of relative that purchases you a whole new wardrobe and gives you the experience of a lifetime. Really, this is a Cinderella sort of story. What I liked most about Ariana (aside from her beautiful name) is that as the story progressed, her faith in Christ deepens as well. She refused to allow anyone to sway her to do anything contrary to her faith. Phillip is another favorite too. Although he is disagreeable and controlling at times, you can't help but like him and once you hear of his past, you sympathize with him.While \\"Before the Season Ends\\" is cute and imaginative, I wouldn't call it life altering. But I would recommend it for anyone who is looking for a lighthearted read.I, for one, can't wait until \\"The House in Grosvenor Square,\\" which comes out in April of 2009.[...]"},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"The author had me from the opening lines:\\"Something would have to be done about Ariana.All winter Miss Ariana Forsythe, aged nineteen, had been going about the house sighing.\\"Jane Austen fans, this one's for you! I thoroughly enjoyed this \\"regency romance\\" told from a Christian perspective. It included all the glitz and glamor of what I think of as a typical \\"season in London\\" but the heroine comes from a rather conservative Christian home in the country, so she is able to see beyond the shallowness of the nobility. In spite of that, it doesn't come off as preachy. Fun read!"},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"Before the Season Ends is a romantic tale (my favorite!) set in the early 1800's. Ariana, the heroine of this story, believes that through devine intervention she is to be wed to the towns rector, Mr. Hathaway who is nearly 60 years her senior.Her parents would have none of this! Having been offered many times before by Aunt Bentley to come to London for a Season, Ariana's parents send her away in hopes of clearing her mind of Mr. Hathaway.Arianna is a bit scared and excited to stay with her aunt. She knows in her heart that no matter who would be interested in her during her \\"season\\" that it must be a man of God or she will have no interest.Before the Season Ends is a historical romance that will whisk you away to London in a time in history where young ladies had \\"seasons\\" and things were done the proper way for those with wealth.I found this story to be a delightful read. Once I picked up the book it was hard to put it down. It was well written and gave a clear description of early London in an interesting way.And if you like a good romantic tale then you will quite enjoy this story!"},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"It was a pleasant change to read a Regency romance without a lot of sexual tension and innuendos. Burkard has the era down pat and it was easy to visualize the scenes as well as sympathize with the heroine. I also found her characteristics true to a 19 year old rather than a wishy-washy attempt to provide the character with teen emotions that weren't of the time and adult emotions that were beyond her age as so many authors do with girls of that age in different time periods.Ariane is a determined 19 year old second daughter who has decided that her lot in life is to marry someone in the church. Her family is well educated in the meaning behind the Bible verses and she has the intelligence to engage in theoretical theology while at the same time the faith in what she believes to be correct. She knows the difference between being a real Christian and being a church Christian. Because the only church man in her village is over 60 her parents decide to send her to live with her aunt in London who has offered to sponser their oldest daughter to a London season. The aunt is not prepared for a young girl who knows her mind and isn't influenced nor really interested in the social circles and Ariane isn't prepared for an aunt whose only interest is the social life of the ton. It makes for some interesting personality clashes and character development.Burkard has spent the last couple of chapters detailing the thoughts behind the idea that becoming a Christian and developing a Christian lifestyle has nothing to do with deeds and all to do with inviting God into your heart. She has done this in a manner true to the story and not preachy, it doesn't seem out of place at all and I really don't think that someone not schooled in the idea would find it out of place with the story.I give this book 4 stars."},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"I am a HUGE Jane Austen fan, so when I heard about Linore's book, I had to read it! She really has the language of Jane down pat. She even has Jane's humor, which is tougher to do than the language. I laughed and giggled with and at her characters throughout the book. This is an inspirational Regency book, so it has a lot more God stuff than Jane did, but all in all, it was the closest thing to Jane Austen I've ever read. I give it four out of five stars! I will be sure to read all of the books that Linore writes. SUCH FUN!"},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"What a delightful book capturing the spirit of Jane Austin! Linore Rose Burkard has delivered a well researched book that transports the reader into the world of regency England and the lives of the lovely and innocent but strong willed Ariana and the brooding handsome Phillip Mornay. This is a beautiful love story with rich character development and wit. Because of the magnificent attention to accurate detail both in dialogue and settings, the story unfolds as if watching a wonderful BBC production period piece. The author deftly draws the reader into 1813 England along with the characters by engaging the reader's senses with well crafted words. The main characters are very likeable and even the minor players are so well developed that you feel as if you know them...I loved the wit and wisdom of Mr. Pellham! Out of the many books I preview for a book club, this one stood far above others in the same genre and is now on our group's upcoming schedule. \\"Before the Season Ends\\" takes a good look at choices, motivations, feelings, and prejudices through the filter of Biblical truth and provides many areas for group discussion or just self reflection. So do yourself a favor by pouring a good cup of English tea and settling down with this book for a charming literary escape. And to the author...well done indeed! I look forward to more of your work in the future."},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"Linore Rose Burkard has written a book that entertains, educates and keeps you guessing until the last page. The story about a Christian girl interested in marriage and a family who wants to help her find a suitable partner takes off on an age-old theme: What happens when an innocent damsel meets an irascible man? Will she follow her head or her heart as she gets to know this flagrant unbeliever?This is the kind of book that opens your eyes to what you don't know. I learned much about society in 19th century England. I had no idea women carried \\"reticules,\\" fabric bags that eliminated bulk from pockets. To carry one's personal effects outside of one's clothing seemed \\"ridiculous,\\" hence the term. I learned about a \\"social season\\" with keen competition to attend \\"assemblies.\\"The short glossary at the end of the book was most helpful and the book also includes a discussion guide for book clubs. The story was believable and intriguing with plenty of interesting little twists along the way."},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"This book was a big disappointment. I purchased it for my Kindle after reading the great reviews. The main character seemed childish and I couldn't relate to her decisions, especially to her insistence upon marrying the rector who was her father's age. Philip Mornay seemed like a pathetic Mr. Darcy wannabe. He was misunderstood until he met Ariana and he tried to deny his growing attraction to her. I didn't like him and found it irritating how much emphasis he put on picking out Ariana's wardrobe. The entire book was extremely predictable and the few last-minute attempts at plot twists were over-dramatic."},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"I don't really understand how this book has received so many 5 stars. This first half of the book I was really satisfied with; it was page turning--I couldn't wait for an other interaction between Ariana and Phillip and loved Aunt Bentley's little quirks; however, once you get about 70% into the book everything changes. It becomes about a quest for Mr. Moranay's salvation--so dire to Ariana, yet is not really pressed upon until this point in the novel. The first half of the book and the second half are arguably two different books."},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"I just loved the characters in \\"Before the Season Ends\\" Linore has a gift for bringing her characters to life with humor and faith.I couldn't put it down after a few chapters because I was curious as to what would happen between Ariana and Phillip. This book had the perfect mix of suspense and romance.Linore really helps to paint a picture of that time period; you feel as if you are there with them! You never know how the book is going to turn out."},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"This was the first time I have read this author. She did an excellent job at making the characters believable and real. It was a slow start for the first three chapters, but after that it read smooth and draws you into the story. I read this book in one day! It was hard to put down. The story line was close to Pride and Prejudice, the wording put you into the time frame and it gives you a happy feeling, in reading about true love overcomes all! There is a glossary at the back at the book for those unfamiliar with regency terms. I can't wait to read the sequel!"},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"I have long been a fan of Regency romance, but this one is an inspirational Regency and what a joy it was to read it! Burkhard knows her Regency era to a 't' and it is a Christ centered book to be sure. This author is wonderful and I loved the book so much. This is book 1 in a series, so don't miss out!"},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"Every year in Regency England there is a season among the privileged when the social calendar is full of parties and events, where young ladies wear their finest and hope to become betrothed by season's end. Ariana Forsythe never expected to be part of that high society scene. She has already accepted her fate to serve the Lord married to a rector with whom she is not in love in a small town far away for London. But God has other plans, and she is whisked away from her May/December betrothal by her God-fearing parents. She is sent to her wealthy aunt's home in London where she will be made over and presented to society, becoming a delightful project for her lonely aunt.Ariana's story is not overwhelmed by historic facts in this Regency romance, but rather enriched by them. The lovely fabrics, dresses, and hats - the carriages, horses, and servants, all create a Pride and Prejudice meets Anne of Green Gables experience, with the awkward predicaments Ariana falls into while getting used to high society's ways.She tries to see the Lord's purpose in her venture, and her eyes are opened to not only the extreme wealth of London, but also the extreme poverty on the very same streets. While most of the ladies around her are vying for the richest eligible young men, Ariana wants nothing more than a husband who will serve God wholeheartedly by her side. As a result, she cannot cooperate with her aunt's designs for her.To have a true Christian plot thread woven inexorably into a regency plot, rather than being tacked on as an afterthought or obligation, is truly a treat. In fact the story is only more compelling, with the backbone of the plot the dilemma she faces - love for God vs love for the world's riches, and the importance of being equally yoked. Can Ariana see God's will for her when she is blinded by love for the stormy Mr. Mornay? And how will she react to the secret of his past, be it rumored or real?Burkard's writing is smooth, seamlessly holding our interest. Her Victorian style with some subtle tongue-in-cheek humor is a perfect fit for the time period. If the end was somewhat anti-climatic, the first half of the book was nothing less than a page turner.Before the Season Ends is a gripping love story between a man and a woman as well as between man and God. Replete with romance and intrigue, the message is clear that God's love conquers all. And the good news is that it looks like the sequel (The House in Grosvenor Square, April 1, 2009) will pick up where this one leaves off.--Reviewed by Carol Kurtz for TitleTrakk"},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"Most authors don't usually have a decent first book, but I stayed up well past my bedtime to finish this last night! I am eagerly anticipating the next book by Burkard! I have read MANY books and this will definitely go to my top 10 list! Characters are realistic yet intriguing. The faith theme throughout the book wasn't overdone either."},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"Catch up on your sleep later; once you start this one, you won't put it down! I truly enjoyed this romance and the charater's amazing faith. What a lovely book to illustrate how we cannot compromise our faith for love. As always, I learned so much about high society (or the \\"ton\\")during the Regency period and am reminded how true faith is so often misunderstood. Delightful!"},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"First of I have to say I have never read Pride and Prejudice or other Jane Austin books. I have been told this book is like those classics. To be honest I was never taken even with themovie. Now I have that said I want to talk about Linores debut book. Before the Season Ends is a regency romance around the same era as the afore mentioned books and I loved it. I would watch it as a movie. It is well written with wonderful characters. I love Ariana for being faithful and not afraid to be herself. Ariana is thrust into a scene shes not use to but holds her own nicely. I love her interaction with everyone she meets. I love her honesty. Reading this book took me back to a time of long ago. Some of he comments by the aristocracy are interesting about there views on the lower classes. I understand it was how they thought back then and its good to see Linore pick up on that. The attention to detail of the gowns and theplaces they visited was well done also.This is a wonderful book and I eagarly await book 2."},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"you'll love this one. Before the Season Ends is a regency romance written in the style of Jane Austen and Georgette Hyer; the real thing! The characters are likable and real. I also liked that the author did not try to load down this book with modern social issues as some regency authors have begun to do. Regency romance lovers just want to read about the time period for fun and enjoyment not get a lesson on social issues that the people of the time really didn't think about.The book was also very inspirational. God was a major theme. This is a book that any adult could read but you wouldn't hesitate to give it to a teen either. I love the glossary at the end for those that are unfamiliar with Regency terminology.I will be reading Ms. Burkard's next Regency. I hope this starts a trend."},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"Young and impressionable, Ariana Forsythe longs for marriage and to do God's will. When a most unsuitable suitor emerges and takes advantage of her naivet&eacute;, Ariana's parents see no other recourse than to pack her off to London for the season. Under the eager sponsorship of her wealthy aunt, Ariana is introduced to the cream of London society. There she must learn to navigate an intricate web of etiquette and expectations, where a word in the wrong ear can ruin a girl's reputation and marriage prospects in an instant. Bolstered by her faith, Ariana refuses to be cowed by the opinions of others, or to mold her character in the image of society's \\"ideal.\\" Her spirit catches the eye of London's most eligible bachelor, Phillip Mornay. Bestowed with the apparent favor of the \\"Paragon,\\" Ariana earns the enmity of several society women. When Mornay gallantly offers to rescue her reputation, Ariana soon finds herself falling for the brooding nobleman. But for a woman of deeply held religious beliefs, Phillip's lack of faith is a troubling obstacle...for how can a man who seems so wrong possibly be the one God intends for her?Before the Season Ends is an absolute joy to read, a little gem of a book that my Regency-loving soul absolutely savored. Burkard has obviously done her homework, and from where I sit she nails the time period - everything from the language and mannerisms to social customs and dress fabrics are authentically detailed. However, Burkard doesn't drown the narrative in details - the story is fast-paced, and the dialogue sparkles with the type of witty, cultured exchanges I love to see in Jane Austen and Georgette Heyer's books. Burkard's novel neatly fills a niche in the Christian fiction marketplace - she's delivered a novel dripping with Regency period detail, full of warmth and humor, interwoven with a deftly handled faith element. The Christian faith is a very real part of Ariana's and her family's lives, but thankfully they aren't \\"cookie cutter,\\" perfect believers. Burkard's characters are real, and though expertly placed in a time and setting far removed from our own technology-filled lives, their struggles make for an engaging read. I can't wait to discover the next chapter in Phillip and Ariana's story!"},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"This is a delightful book that will sweep you away to Regency England until you are caught up in a sweet romance that inspires your faith. The characters are believable with a multi-dimensional depth that brings them alive to the reader. The story is compelling and keeps you reading to see how the hero and heroine will overcome their differences. Linore Burkhard has an excellent command of the Regency period and brings her readers into the time period as if they are living it."},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"This was a really enjoyable read. I read it in about two days. I am already looking forward to the second book. It was so fun to go and visit this time period, as I am a Jane Austen fan. My favorite part of the book was Ariana's ball. I also loved how the author would give us the views from some of the other characters about situations that happened. I recommend this book wholeheartedly."},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"A delightful tale in a delightful time peroid. Not a dull moment is in this book. It will keep your interest.

Linore writes, especially well, about what true Faith and Salvation means, in such a heartwarming and honest way. She captures the style of Jane Austin's time and style so elegantly and beautifully! Writing in such an intelligent and exquisite way. Before the Season ends is a wonderful book and I can't wait to read the sequel. This book is filled with situations that you wouldn't really want to find yourself in unless you have a Mr. Mornay yourself! I know that he would have made being in some of the scenes Linore paints worth it to me! LOL! This book is a must read and I suspect that the whole series is as well!My songs for this book is: \\"Find You On My Knees\\" by Kari Jobe and \\"Leaning On The Everlasting Arms\\" by Alan JacksonJohn 3:15-16~ASC"},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"very good romance couldn&#8216;t stop once i startef. i would recommend this book to amy one that liles romance books.."},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"Absolutely wonderful!! I loved this book so much and the two books that followed. I could not wait to keep reading. Such a good and pure romance. Exactly the type of read I enjoy to the fullest! I would highly recommend this book to any young woman."},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"I really appreciated the well written, well paced, well-rounded characters of this book. I enjoyed every minute of it. It's really impressive this is a debut book, and I'm very happy to recommend it. It's inspiring to see someone be able to write so well and bring in Christianity is such a wonderful way."},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"I'm a guy and yep, a romantic--however, I don't usually read romance novels. I became acquainted with Lenore Rose Burkard through an online writing group. I wanted to see what kind of a writer she is so I picked out this novel not realizing it was her first. I was captured in the very beginning by the characters and the humor. I found it to be a very nice story and well-written. I'm attached to the characters and want to follow them. I will be reading her other books."},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"I found this as a free ebook on my Nook and as an avid Jane Austen fan, decided to give it a shot. I can't wait to see what else the author has in store for her readers! There are other authors that have tried writing Austen-eque novels, but I find them terribly lacking. I was genuinely impressed with this series."},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"SPOILERS!This is a fantastic story about a proper young woman who feels compelled by God to marry a fellow Christian. Seeing that she comes from a small country backwater and the only available man is the local parson who is significantly older than her she bemoans her fate thinking that God has in mind for her to marry a man old enough to be her father but dutifully follows the will of God. Her parents, however, become desperate when they cannot sway her from her decision and decide to take her paternal aunt's offer of sending their daughter to London for a season so her aunt can bring her out. When she is persuaded into this, she is swept up into the bustle of her formidable aunt's lifestyle and comes face to face with the ton's most sought after bachelor who has quite the reputation of fashionable aloofness towards the debutante set and when she is not given the set down that has been forthcoming in all of the other girls' cases, she becomes the talk of the ton and makes an enemy of one of he most influential patronesses of Almack's. Striving to clear her name, her aunt and the gentleman contrive to bring her back into acceptable ton by being seen on the Paragon's arm and in the process their feelings of affection for one another grow and she is torn between fulfilling her promise to God and breaking her own heart or turning against God and following her heart.While I enjoyed this story immensely for the period it was written about and the young woman's desire to remain true to her faith, I felt it was a bit far fetched to believe that a man of that period would turn over a new leaf and accept Christianity to keep the girl even if he was brought up in a \\"religion\\" and acts the way he does because of his \\"painful past\\". I was also rather bothered by the fact that another potential suitor who IS a man of God starts to act like a smitten swain and rather unbecomingly so. If he is truly a man of God then his behavior would not develop into one of desperation and forcefulness regardless of his attraction to her. The story becomes rather stilted when it is apparent that the hero and heroine have developed feelings for each other and it waffles back and forth between his decision to leave her or keep her and her decision to marry him or cast him off. For me there was far to much \\"will they or won't they\\" for me to rate this at a 5 but I applaud the author's ability to write a romance novel that is enjoyable and yet is not filled with scandal, sex, and swearing like so many other pieces set in this period are."},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"I found about about this book because it was listed in the \\"reads who bought...\\" section of another book calledThe Divine Spark (The Divine Journey)and I'm so glad I found it. The author states that is a \\"spirited romance for the Jane Austin Soul\\" and she couldn't be more correct. Her witty humor and inspirational message are a delight. This book is the perfect companion for a beach blanked in summer and a wool blanket in late fall. What a fun read. I can't wait to read more from this author!"},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"I read Before the Season Ends a couple months ago and really liked it! If you enjoy Christian period romance, you will like this one too. The story moves along at a good pace with a definite Christian message, although not too preachy, and the characters are endearing.Ariana is a young lady of a strong Christian faith and is sent off to her aunt among London's best society in order to create a physical separation to an older man of the cloth she had been determined to marry. She is admired for her beauty and her aunt is happy to sponsor Ariana, to pay for all her wardrobe - anything she needs - to make good connections for the girl this season. The connection was not one that her aunt expected - truly running into the infamous Mr. Mornay whom she was clearly told to stay away from if she had any hopes of success.I highly recommend this novel as a stand-alone. (I didn't like book two so much.) This story hits the spot if you're hungry for a sweet, inspirational regency Christian romance."},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"When Ariana comes face to face with Mr. Mornay, she finds there's more to this man than his handsome face, in fact, his demeanor matches his reputation--and that's not complimentary to him, at least not initially. But she soon finds her place in his heart, and in ours too.BEFORE THE SEASON ENDS is a delightful read and one I've highly recommended to all of my friends. It's well written, funny, and touching. I know I'll read this book again and again!"},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"I'm an die-hard Jane Austen fan, Pride and Prejudice being my most favorite. Burkard's \\"Before The Season Ends\\" is right at the top of my list now also. I enjoyed every page of this book, the content and historical facts were excellent and especially liked the way she presented the plan of salvation. If you have a friend who is an Austen fan but not a Christian, this book would be a wonderful gift for them - while they enjoy the story line they will also be reading about the best plan possible for their lives. I'm looking forward to obtaining the sequel to this volume and more of Burkard's works. Thanks Linore for writing a book with real redeeming qualities!!"},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"The author writes with rich detail similar in style to Georgette Heyer.Miss Ariana Forsythe is resolved to the fact that her lot in life is to marry a clergyman-even after the young rector moves away and is replaced by a man older than her father.Ariana seems a little silly as she pines for this older man who has no other redeeming qualities other than he is a rector. Her parents feel the only solution is to remove her from the situation by sending her away to her aunt's who is to sponsor her in her first season in society.She is told to stay away from one eligible bachelor, Mr. Phillip Morney, because he has been known to destroy the social chances of other young women by his indifference to them.A great story. Read what happens when she meets Mr. Morney at a picnic on his estate. Let's just say she doesn't end up marrying a Rector."},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"Well, I must say that this genre is not my typical style of book. I usually stick to mysteries and fantasies. But, since I love the book Pride & Prejudice, I thought I would give this book a try. I'll admit that it was better than my expectations and I can't wait to get my hands on any books to follow. Following Ariana's struggles with Mr. Mornay was an absolute delight!"},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"It was a blizzard outside today, right when spring was supposed to lift its head with daylight savings time. Oh, well. I wasn't pining because I took the opportunity to curl up with a book in the reminiscent writing and scenes of Jane Austin.It took me about two chapters to be hooked on this novel and once hooked, I had a difficult time setting it down, even to get my bowl of strawberries.I had never read anything by this author before, obviously because it's her debut novel. I was pleased with well-developed characters, the warmth of the English countryside, a clear Gospel message, and a storyline that kept me entranced. As I mentioned earlier, it did take a bit to get into. It didn't seem to have quite the initial hook that I'm accustomed to in historical fiction, although it was forgiveable by chapter three which is where an author will typically lose me if the beginning remains slow.The only thread I thought wasn't carried through very well was how adamant Ariana was at the beginning of the book that she was called to marry a man of the cloth and the how quickly she seemed to forget that conviction. There didn't seem to be an adequate reason why she was so quick to forgoe her conviction, although I will say the novel was great at having Ariana maintain her Godly foresight into romantic connections to a man of the same faith. That was the only \\"loose thread\\" I didn't feel the author connected to my satisfaction.Overall aesthetics of the book were wonderful. The author painted a beautiful picture of English society, dress, etiquette, and interaction. I felt transported back in time by mere colorful descripion enhanced by English spelling of words like \\"colour\\", \\"saviour\\", and so on.Mr Mornay was reminscent of Colin Firth's adaptation of Darcy in Pride and Prejudice. So much so, that I had a difficult time not envisioning Colin Firth as Mr Mornay. It was a pleasure to see Mr Mornay move from his aloof almost rude persona to his own seeming dismay at his softening and need to show tenderness. Ariana's character was one of innocent honesty but I appreciated the fact the author didn't create a naive innocence, but one born more of personality and faith rather than ignorance to the things around her. Ariana was charming novel personality, relatable, believable, and emotional.I purchased this book blindly, simply enticed by a cover designed with warm hues, warm expressions and thoughts of a warm afternoon beneath a quilt on my couch during a snowstorm. I will KEEP this purchase and not donate it or trade it - I'll certainly loan it out to friends and family though and heartily endorse this new author: Linore Rose Burkard. How many Jaime Stars? :) I'm throwing a heart 4 1/2 at this return to the days of Jane Austin!"},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"Before the Season Ends is a wonderful story. Ariana, the main character, sticks by her beliefs even when she thinks it will cost her true love. She constantly takes her problems to her knees. I also liked how the book has a mini-dictionary at the back of the book to define terms from that time period. So, not only did I enjoy the book, I learned new things!"},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"Readers who enjoy historical fiction and particularly Regency romance will certainly take pleasure in this Jane Austen-style novel.Nineteen-year-old Ariana Forsythe believes she is destined to wed her country village's 60-year-old rector, much to her parents' dismay. In an effort to dissuade their daughter from such a union, they send her off to wealthy Aunt Bentley's posh home in the exclusive neighborhood of Mayfair, London. The year is 1813, and beautiful, sweet Ariana, with her deep-rooted faith and convictions, is unprepared for her sudden role as a woman of high society. She has come to live with Aunt Bentley during \\"the season\\" --- a time when young, single women dress in their finest and attend functions for the sole purpose of finding an appropriate suitor. But Ariana has different plans.Aunt Bentley showers Ariana with elaborate fashions and accessories, determined to ensure that she receives an offer from a wealthy and respectable man of society before the season ends. Ariana, however, desires only to enjoy her stay in London, make some new friends and take in the city's museums, galleries and architecture. Finding a husband is simply not her heart's desire, until she looks into the dark, brooding eyes of Mr. Phillip Mornay, \\"the Paragon.\\" Men copy his style, and women swoon over him. He is the popular rogue who cannot be caught, until he finds himself drawn to the young, outspoken Miss Forsythe. She will challenge him in ways he never anticipated and eventually lead him to some heartfelt soul-searching.In the meantime, Mr. Mornay's attraction to Ariana angers one of the society mothers, who hoped her own daughter might snatch the debonair gentleman and elevate their family's social stature. The woman's wrath leads her to fabricate a scandal in hopes of damaging Ariana's reputation, but Mr. Mornay steps in and beats her at her own game. Ariana can't stop thinking about this man who, she discovers, is far more upright and kind-hearted than his reputation dictates. But Ariana is resolved to marry only a fellow Christian, and Mr. Mornay is not a true believer. Will she follow her heart and go against her faith? Is it possible to have it all, or must she sacrifice one for the other? When Mr. Mornay asks for Ariana's hand in marriage, he never imagines the woman he loves will hesitate based on his lack of faith.Linore Rose Burkard has created a novel as beautiful and elegant as the book's cover. Any reader can't help but be transported to the posh parlors and elegant ballrooms of Regency London, where high society means lavish parties, strict rules of etiquette, clear-cut lines between the haves and have-nots, and in some cases, petty hearts hiding beneath layers of silk and lace. An impressive amount of research went into writing this book, so rich in detail and historical references that flow seamlessly throughout the intriguing story. Burkard doesn't miss a beat in either the Regency-style language or elements. From fashion to furniture and everything in between, her extraordinary command of period detail stays consistent.--- Reviewed by Susan Miura"},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"Let me first say that I've never read a Jane Austin book and was totally taken by the story which was set in 1813, Chesterton, England, where nineteen year old Ariana was off to her Aunt's house for an opportunity of a life time. She's never met her Aunt so this was awkward to say the least. Aunt Bentley was excited about her mission to find Ariana the best husband her city had to offer. She is totally thrilled to set up her niece's social calendar for the season of her \\"coming out\\".I was totally floored by all the \\"Rules\\" upper society had. Amazed at how Mrs. Bentley knew all these rules along with just the right style of clothes to be worn at every occassion; to present a good impression for a successful coming out party. Ariana saw how thrilled her Aunt was with this whole process. She wasn't as excited, as a matter of fact this process was making her head spin (mine too) with all the rules, types of clothes to be seen in and which accessories (like gloves) had to be worn at certain parties. All these rules just made me laugh out loud.Ariana was sure her parents didn't know how serious all this was? Ariana couldn't believe how much money her Aunt was spending on her -- it just didn't seem right. Would there be money left over for her sisters coming out party? Maybe some of this money could be given to the poor. She just didn't feel right about all the expense and attention.She was determined to honor her Aunt even though her parents said Mrs. Bentley was a high society heathen. Maybe in the process of obeying her Aunt she could show the love of Christ is a special way. Ariana wanted to tell her Aunt that having a personal relationship with Christ was so much more important than following a bunch of religious rules, like she does in these high society parties. She prayed for this opportunity.Ariana didn't think like woman her age. In Ariana's way of thinking, a personal relationship with Christ was the most important quality in a husband! Period. The end. She didn't want a man just to have one. Her Aunt thought this line of thinking was judgmental and ridiculous. I soon found myself cheering for Ariana.I was captivated, enchanted and educated all at the same time as I read this book. I even chuckled at societies silliness -- it was great! It fascinated me! I haven't read anything quite like it. I can't wait to see what Linore writes next!.Finding Hope Through Fictionwww.psalm516.blogspot.com"},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"Ariana Forsythe, the heroine of Linore Rose Burkard's inspirational Regency romance, Before the Season Ends, desires to follow God's plans for her life. At the beginning of the story, she believes that means marriage to a local rector. One problem. She's 19; he's 60. So, her parents send her to her aunt's, where small town Ariana learns about life in London during the Season.Enter the hero, Mr. Phillip Mornay, aka The Paragon. Ariana meets him in a delightful first encounter, and soon their lives are entwined when a scandal erupts. They have to battle a malicious rumor. Ariana ends up engaged to a man she's convinced she cannot marry. She wages a war between her wants and God's will and must come to a decision Before the Season Ends.This book surprised and delighted me. I'd heard wonderful things about the story and began reading with great expectations. After the first five chapters, though, I wondered if I were missing something. First, I'm not used to books written in the omniscient point of view. Most I read are told from the perspectives of the hero and heroine. Second, I wasn't swept away as I'd hoped to be.But all that changed when I got to chapter six and met the dashing, but initially disturbing, Mr. Mornay, a hero reminiscent of Jane Austen's Mr. Darcy. The story took off, and I was captivated. From then on, I read straight through. I was drawn to the characters, major and minor, and enjoyed getting glimpses of what each was thinking and feeling.It's refreshing to read a true inspirational Regency, where God and a saving faith are integral to the story. I recommend Before the Season Ends and have the sequel, The House in Grosvenor Square, on my wish list."},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"I really must say that I enjoyed this book. A reader of Jane Austen since twelve, this was quite in my catagory. It was a good romance, but also Christian too which is hard to find. I feel it was well written with ample suspense. I give this book 5 stars."},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"I was concerned that it would be a blatant copy of Pride and Prejudice, but I found it original. There were some similarities, but not enough to make it feel like a copy-cat book. I particularly like how the author explained some of the customs and there was a glossary of terms at the back to define the words of the period. I looked up a couple of words in my small (but new) Websters that I like to use while reading fiction on occasion, and the words were not in it. I did find that the very beginning of the book (the first chapter, maybe) did not seem to match the character of the heroine in the rest of the book, but I think that was supposed to be Austen-style humor."},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"Linore Rose Burkard has written a charming regency with a Jane Austen flavor and a Georgette Heyer feel. I have long loved to lose myself in just this sort of novel and Before the Season Ends did not disappoint.Often, because of time constraints, I sort of speed through a book, zipping past certain sections in order to finish. But not with this book. I read every line and enjoyed it immensely. It didn't go where I expected it to go, either. Delightful little twists here and there, a strong sense of place and time, and even a little mystery of misunderstanding helped this reader flip those pages til the end."},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"The Christian Regency was a non-existent genre until Linore Rose Burkard burst onto the scene with her debut novel, Before the Season Ends. If you are a fan of Jane Austen, you will love the story of Ariana Forsythe, a delightful, independent young woman who goes to London to live with her aunt during her debut season. Though the book has an inspirational flavor, it does not detract from the story or overwhelm the reader like is sometimes the case. Well-written, refreshing, and entertaining, fans of regency romances will not want to miss this one.Not much I can add that other reviewers haven't already covered. Like many readers I had to get used to the language and writing style, but it was an easy enough adjustment to make, and well worth the effort. Mrs. Burkard delightful prose and dialog captures the reader from the very beginning and holds them all the way through. Suffice it to say after reading Before the Season Ends, readers will be anticipating the next book in the series, The House of Grosvenor Square, which releases this month."},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"I had to get used to how this book was written - since it was literally written as Jane Austen wrote her books in that same era. (I LOVE Austen, I just don't usually see this style of writing nowadays). I have also read many books by Georgette Heyer, so I understood the regency world in the book from cover to cover... and for those who have never read a regency era book, the author provided a very nice glossary to help with unfamiliar words. It is very similar to a Heyer book named Arabella, but I enjoyed it nevertheless. Burkard wrote it in a very different fashion than Heyer + added much to the story by bringing the heroine's Christian faith into the story. I have to admit, my FAVORITE part of this book was the middle; from the moment she met her hero to the moment his love was declared. I had a hard time staying interested in everything before and after that - but the heart of the story makes it worth reading. I plan on buying it for my collection... for I look forward to re-reading it again in years to come."},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"I bought this book yesterday and could not put it down. It is an entertaining, and inspiring at the same time. It weds faith with regency romance and I will buy the sequel due out on April 1st."},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"I enjoy Christian fiction and especially enjoy historical Christian fiction. This is the first Regency period Christian fiction that I've read (or probably seen, for that matter -- most take place in America that's I've seen).That said, I really loved the book and love that Burkard places a glossary in the back of the book for those of us unfamilar with Regency era vocabulary.The language is rich. I just abandoned a book recently where the plot had the potential of being wonderful, but the language was so wooden I dreaded picking it up to read each night. Burkard creates a mind-picture, without the details being too overburdensome to detract from the story.I stayed up reading it until 4 a.m. waiting to find a good stopping point point, and always deciding to read just one more chapter."},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"Everyone is smitten with Ariana Forsythe...including the elderly rector of her church in Chesterton, England. To prevent a dubious match for their vivacious but nave daughter, Mr. and Mrs. Forsythe place their daughter her in the clutches of Aunt Bentley, a childless widow whose dream is to successfully debut her niece in London's 1813 high society.Money alone can't buy the standing Aunt Bentley so craves for Ariana, and the lovely young woman becomes embroiled in a scandal with Phillip Mornay, London's \\"current darling rogue.\\" Shock waves ripple the blue bloods when Phillip too seems to have fallen for Ariana, and proves his affections by escorting her to Regent House.With the alliance of Phillip, Ariana gains back her good name--does she lose control when she considers giving her heart to a man who has not given his heart to God? Another suitor intervenes: is he God's chosen husband for Ariana?A season of prayer and trust in God's sovereign power rescue Ariana from a doomed betrothal...and transform a former rascal into the perfect husband.Before the Season Ends allows readers a lush glimpse into the glamorous manses of Regency, England. Linore's delightful prose and unexpected plot twists kept me turning the pages and wanting more. Linore accurately depicted the mores and culture of the early 19th century yet explored age-old struggles of mankind, including the nature of true religion, inappropriate sexual relationships, and concern for the impoverished.Don't miss this sensory feast!"},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"I really enjoyed this story. I've never read Austen so I can't say how similar the writing styles are. At first the omniscient POV all the time was hard for me to follow, but then I allowed myself to be pulled into that era and all of it's vanity and the story came alive. I had difficulty putting it down once I got past the initial hump of the writing style. While it wasn't bad, it was just very different from the typical point of view purist books you see nowadays.What hooked me was the scene in the tree. The same time Phillip Mornay fell in love I was pulled right in. I kept turning the pages as I felt the confusion Ariana experienced in response to Mr. Mornay's affection and how he would continually pull away. I suspect I knew when he cared for Ariana before she realized it herself. This was truly a delightful read. I loved the subtle tension between them and the dialogue. The terms used such as gel, paragon, reticule, ton, etc. all solidly planted me in the setting. While by no means edgy, for a regency period novel it was still yummy enough for me. I loved the way the spiritual theme played out and how the author used Scripture to illustrate her concerns. The spiritual awakening of previously lost characters truly touched my heart. I highly recommend this story for romance lovers who enjoy a strong faith element."},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"Before the Season Ends had me smiling like a cheshire cat. It is wonderfully light and witty! Yet absolutely intriguing. You will fall in love with the innocent Miss Ariana Forsythe and the fashionable Mr. Mornay. Their personalities clash and sizzle. Follow both hero and heroine as they grow in faith. You'll chuckle at their antics and hold your breath through their challenges. I promise you won't want to put the book down. It is a must read. Linore Rose Burkard has done a fabulous job."},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"I loved this story. I have to admit to never reading Jane Austen (that I can remember) but I love a good inspirational romance and this story captivated me. Although it was sometimes a bit predictable, I loved it none the less! When I finished this one, I immediately bought the next in the series and JUST finished that one!"},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"I've always been a fan of Jane Austen novels and this one is so very close to her style! I think I might even love it more than Jane Austen with all of the Christian elements mixed throughout. I couldn't put this down once I started reading!"},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"I read a great deal of Christian fiction. This book was very, very close to wonderful, but its flaws overwhelm it.Pros:- dialogue: truly wonderful, result of a gifted author- voice: spot on, Austenian voice- setting: well doneNeutral:- the preachiness level (in terms of quantity of doctrine) was higher than most new Christian fiction coming out, more like an old Jeanette Oke.Cons:- heroine: was she really that stupid? Her \\"innocence\\" was sometimes just \\"stupid,\\" and her characterization didn't stay consistent, but not in a way that implied growth but in a way that implied flakiness- hero: there's alpha male, and then there's \\"I'm a better dresser than you, I will choose the fabrics for your trousseau, remove your jewelry when you're dressed badly, and probably beat you when you get too fat to fit into the latest fashions\\" (okay, maybe that last bit is just a projection in my eyes...)- conflict: um... where was it again? Oh yes, 50% of the book was angsty unequal yoke moaning- resolution: send lover boy off to Conversion Camp with Perfect Father until he Sees The Light and they can live happily ever after. HUH?!?!I am prompted to write this review because it was SO CLOSE to being amazing. The author is far more talented than most of the faith fiction authors out there. She just missed the mark here, and so I was proportionately more disappointed. I will look for other of her works, but it's a shame this one didn't live up to its promise."},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"This book is well written and a delight to read.

I never got bored or lost interest. There was a little mystery, a little scandal, a little intrigue and romance. You fall in love with the characters and become immersed in the culture of the regency era. This book makes me want to go to a ball and deepen my Christian faith. I also liked the glossary and discussion questions at the end of the book. I wish there were many more books like this!"},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"Before the Season Ends was exceedingly refreshing, in that it was well balanced between story and Scripture. I am an avid reader of Christian fiction and it is nice when I chance upon a novel that is more than just a story. Ariana and Mr. Mornay's story was perfectly integrated with God's word, so much so, that I was truly touched! After I finished the book, I was very much inclined to drop to my knees and pray for forgiveness for all the times I put my wants above God's. I very much enjoyed reading this book and would highly recommend it to anyone wanting to grow closer to the Lord. I can't wait to read the sequel!"},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"This book was so good that when I finished the second in the series, I decided to read this one again slowly. The second time around was just as good as the first. This is one book that I shall recommend to others. I shall also keep a copy on my shelf to read again. Thank you for such a great book! (I would love to hear more about Ariana and Phillip. Maybe God will inspire you to write another one with them as the main characters.) Thank you for taking me back in time! It was such a nice escape with a great message!"},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"Perfect for : Personal reading, book club read (Contains Discussion Questions)In a nutshell: A wonderful Regency Romance, set in England in 1813, with the added benefit of a little faith added in. Ariana, the 19-year-old strong-willed daughter of the Forsythe's, has determined that she is going to marry the 60 year old village rector! In an act of desperation, her parents send her to her Aunt in London for a season. When she gets to London, at her first real outing, she bumps into Mornay, the man her Aunt has told her to avoid! This is a charming faith-focused Regency romance that is sure to be a favorite for Regency romance readers!Extended Review:Characters: We follow Ariana on her adventures in London where she is sent to stay with her Aunt . . . and where she makes the acquaintance of the season's confirmed bachelor, Mornay. I really enjoyed Mornay's character - as he actually took an interest in helping Ariana, and as he transformed into a better person throughout the book.Story-Line: The author has included many wonderful details from the era to help the reader easily visualize what is happening in the story. In true Regency-form, the main character Ariana goes to London to have a season, where she will participate in the rounds of dinners, balls and parties where many of the ton will try to make a successful marriage match.Readability: For me, the book was an easy read, even with over 330 pages. I've read many Regency romances, so I am very familiar with the words used during that time (ton, tendre, fustian, etc), but for those who aren't, the author has included a wonderful glossary at the end of the book!Overall: A delightful Regency with an emphasis on faith and values! I sure hope Ms. Burkard has another Inspirational Regency Romance on the way!"},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"I just finished my very first Regency era book ever. Since I've never read one before, everything was all new to me. Ms. Burkhard's descriptions were terrific and she has a gift for \\"show--don't tell\\". I felt like I was right there with the characters and enjoyed her blend of humor, drama, the all-important love story, and a peek at another place in time. I'm on my way to download the next book on my Kindle as I'm looking forward to what happens next!"},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"This ebook was thankfully free. I got it based on all the positive reviews and I absolutely loved the first half of the book. Then suddenly the lead character became totally preachy and in my opinion highly offensive in her mannerism of presenting the gospel. Please quote me the sinners prayer as it is found in the gospel. No reference? Hmmm, yeah, I've not found one there either. I found her sudden obsession with his conversion overwhelming and really? Your betrothed must spend time with your family & rector until the conversion takes place? And the conversion happens over a lost wager? Somewhat of an inconsistency here with her desire for genuine faith. Sounds like he lost a dual, then later figured hey,I really do feel different. The story started to get almost creepy for me at this point. Speaking of creepy, the Mr. O'Brian character was so very out of line, yet in the next moment he's accepting a proposal from her 11 year old sister. And no one seems to take issue that he was discussing the lead girl having his babies 2 minutes earlier. Oh! Yet the problem lies with the guy with notable integrity as he hadn't been converted yet. Umm. Hypocrisy much?The first half of the book was entirely of a different genre from the second. I could highly recommend the first half and by then I was hooked as the author really is excellent. However, the switch almost snuck up on me and I was confused, then frustrated and by the end fully creeped out at the turn this book took. Ugh. I think rather than just pick books based on 5 stars, I need to get some 1 star opinions because in this case, those are the ones I absolutely agree with."},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"I really enjoyed this book! I had never read anything by this author before and I really liked her writing style.Ariana is sent to stay with her wealthy aunt for \\"the season\\" and makes her debut into society. Although he is off limits, Ariana cannot deny her attraction and growing feelings for Mr. Mornay. In addition to their differences in social and financial standings, Mr. Mornay does not share her faith in God. As the season goes on, it seems that Mr. Mornay, who never shows interest in any female, is showing unusual attention to Ariana.I felt like the last part of the story drug out a little unnecessarily, but overall, I loved this book and have already ordered the sequel!"},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"i loved this book! it has everything. period details, wonderful romance, humour, real love, and most of all a very serious attitude towards God. i especially liked the way the heroine stood firm in her faith, despite the fear of losing a great romance. i can't say i know any \\"christian\\" girls now that would have done the same. i confess i was curious to see how believable the hero's conversion would be and of all the things i had thought of, the simple prayer he said from his heart, was the greatest surprise for me. it was so honest, so genuine, so childlike in its nearness to God, that i even cried a little. i also like the fact that he didn't hide it from Ariana that he wanted to follow Christ because he wanted to marry her, as i have seen many many men come to church for similar reasons, but with a total lack of sincerity about it.finally, i want to say that the author compares herself (or puts herself in a similar position) to Jane Austen, or maybe even other successful regency authors. what i wanted to say is that although it does her credit to have been influenced by authors such as Austen and Heyer, she has developped a style entirely her own, on top of which, her book is filled with God. and, although i have read Austen's and Heyer's books to shreds, i would any day prefer to read a so well written regency that also says about my Saviour, than any of those famous authors, who, however good they are, they do not have Him on every page (or indeed on any page).of course, it takes time for people to get to know a new auhtor, but i really think mrs Burkard has an original style and very original ideas for the plot and best of all, a very personal faith in God. i am so glad i found this author!"},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"I have been in a Jane Austen sort of mood lately. I'm currently listening to Pride and Prejudice in my car, have been watching several of the movies on DVD and the soundtrack to P&P; (2005) is going to be played in the prelude at my wedding. So this book fits perfectly with the way my mood has been. This book is written perfectly in the Regency tone of voice and style. I loved Ariana's character. It was fun to read about her stepping into high society at the benefit of a rich old aunt. The chemistry she had with Phillip was wonderful and very believable. It's very easy to swoon while reading this book. You wish you could live like this all the time! All the details in the book are wonderful, the description of the places and the clothes really make the story come to life. I enjoyed reading about the fashion and all the little customs of the time period. I even like the part where it's explained how Ariana could not be called by her first name in society because her older sister had not been married yet. I wish that happened today! The scene involving Ariana being stuck in a tree was my favorite. It was like something really out of a Jane Austen novel and I could picture it in a movie coming to life. Very funny and great way to make the characters interact with each other. Since this is a Regency Inspirational Romance, there is talk about religion and Christianity in the book but it's not preachy. Yes they are key elements to the story but even if they are not something that you agree with, honestly the setting and tone of writing are the main focus of the book.My only qualm is that there is a nice guy who gets hurt and gets no condolence. I always feel bad when the nice guy loses! However this book was a gem to read. I could practically see myself wearing the empire dresses and listening to classical music during the book. I have expected Darcy or Edward Ferras to pop up and make cameos! This is a wonderful time in British history and one I wish I could go back in time to visit. I am looking forward to reading the rest of Ariana and Phillip's adventures. If you are a Regency fan, you will adore this book!"},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"This was a wonderful book! I have read many similar books by Lori Wick or Janette Oke but this was by for the best! I read it in 3 days....I read every chance I got."},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"Before the Season Ends is an novel that enchanted me from the very first line, and the enchantment did not end there as I was drawn into the lives of the characters, sharing in both their joys and sorrows. I simply could not put the book down.It was as if an Austen-esque motion picture were playing as I read, so well-crafted are the scenes and the nuances of human interaction. The genuine struggle between desires of the heart and the journey to continually honor one's faith were very realistic and not contrived in the least.For those who love the plush grandeur and excesses of the Regency era, you will not be disappointed in any way. Additionally, I came away feeling that I could learn a few things from this delightful heroine, a rare quality in today's literature and a boon for lovers of Christian Fiction.I have never before reviewed a book but in this case could not wait to do so. I will be encouraging my friends to buy this book and, for my part, Mrs. Burkhard has won a most loyal reader. If you are a fan of Regency or Christian Fiction, do pick up this most satisfying and encouraging read."},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"I reviewed this book for You Gotta Read and I fell in love with this book. Here is my review.I was transported to the Regency era and it has been a journey like no other I have been on before. I have visited places that I had never experienced before and met some very intriguing characters. This was the first time that I have read a full length regency novel and I found myself in love and fascinated with this particular period of time.Before The Season Ends was an stunning and sensational book. I was amazed at how intricately detailed the entire story was. From the imagery to the clothing of this particular time period, there was not one detail that was ignored. I actually felt transported to a beautiful time and place and I didn't want to leave. It is very apparent that Linore Rose Burkard has thrown her body and soul into this particular book and I enjoyed every minute I spent with these characters. Ms. Burkard is an extremely talented writer who has obviously researched this time period extensively as it shows throughout the book. I am unquestionably going to add any future work of Ms. Burkard's to my automatic to be read list. I have obviously become a huge fan and can't wait to see where these characters are headed next. If I could possibly give this rating a higher than You Gotta Read, I would in a heart beat. If you are looking for an engrossing book that immerses you into the Regency era where things are so much sweeter, and brings romance to a higher level, then I would strongly suggest Before The Season Ends, you will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"I am not generally a Regency Inspirational Romance reader, but Linore Rose Burkard has single-handedly changed that with her delightful debut novel, Before the Season Ends. With the delicious flavor of Jane Austin, Ms. Burkard woos the reader with a captivating romance between Arianna Forsythe, a young woman catapulted from her quiet, middle-class existence into the wonderfully overwhelming whirl of her wealthy aunt's high-society world. Here the beguiling innocence of Arianna collides headlong with the cool and self-assured presence of handsome Phillip Mornay, the elusive and dangerous bachelor who wins the heart of every starry-eyed miss throughout London's magical season. What transpires is a deftly woven tale that not only transports the reader to an era brimming with the pomp and splendor of 1800 high society, but a gentle romance that simmers beneath the pages. Kudos to Ms. Burkard for a wonderful debut novel."},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"I resisted buying this book for awhile. I'm glad I gave in though. While this is certainly not Austen, it's not bad.Burkard set herself a hard task: blending Regency style romance with inspirational Christian instruction. The product is impressive, if not a perfect blend. A non-Christian will dislike the book. To them, the Christian instruction will be too dominant and preachy, distracting the reader from the plot. A Christian will likely be able to see past that though and appreciate the lesions which still have applicability in our present time period. I am concerned though that some Christian readers will find this as support for them to date non-Christians with the thought of saving them. While that certainly can happen for some (with God, all things are possible). I think it's dangerous for a young Christian to go with that as the aim. They may miss the point that our heroine tried to avoid falling in love with a non-Christian and just see the end result.On to more general topics: The book kept my attention for hours. I did not want to just read a chapter now and then but kept reading, unable to wait to see what happened next. The characters are also very likable. I also found myself wanting to be more like the heroine. Most importantly, this brings up real issues and assistance in dealing with them through an interesting novel. While the book could improve with a better blending, it was very well done and I look forward to the sequel."},{"Title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"I've never actually read a Jane Austin novel but this compels me to do so as I've heard they are similar in writing. Plus, this story reopened my eyes to God's unfailing love. I'm so grateful I've read it and recommended it to you."},{"Title":"Knots, splices and fancy work","review":"this was i beleive the third edition according to the preface of an very useful and practial guide on knot tying methords and i would like to thank Amazon for assisting me with my purchase as well as the excellent service provided by the seller."},{"Title":"Knots, splices and fancy work","review":"I recently ordered the book \\"Knots,splices and fancy work\\" written by \\"C.L.SPENCER\\" having previously owned a copy i was looking forward to doing so again as it was an excellent referance work to a particualy unusual method for one 9\\"part\\" turks head knot.Saddly what i ordered and what i recived (very promtly i acknowledge)were two diffrent things as my order arived i found NOT the proceeding but instead a book titled\\"Knots & splices\\" written by \\"P.W.Blandford\\" in itself a respectable book and one i am happy enough to now own but redundant as a referance source and very definitly NOT AS ORDERED."},{"Title":"Chilton Chrysler Service Manual: 2004 Edition","review":"I purchased this manual to work on my wifes 2004 chrysler crossfire.

A super easy read without any technical bologna. Good ideas for why we procrastinate and suggestions for attacking this problem- eh issue. I don't know if I'll no longer procrastinate but now I have some ideas as to why I am doing what I'm doing and some strategies to take procrastination on. Go ahead don't put it off- order the book. But you better read it once it arrives or someone may accuse you of procrastinating."},{"Title":"Procrastination: Why You Do It, What To Do About It","review":"'Procrastination' was one of my favorite books to read this past year. Why? I couldn't help but connect to everything the author was writing. The author *really* knows procrastination.The book is broken up into several sections, which are very interesting (especially when read in sequence). The book explains various types of procrastination, and uses examples along the way. The author goes through a pretty exhaustive list of different types of procrastination, and explains methods to make yourself more 'aware' of when you're procrastinating.After explaining the various forms of procrastination, the author discusses various ways to beat procrastination. The main concept through this part of the book to know that:In order to beat procrastination, you must first realize WHEN you are procrastinating, and WHY. Once you know those two things, you can mentally adjust your actions and quickly recover from your procrastination behavior.As I said before, this was a great book. It has really changed my behaviors over the past several months, and has been a great win in my personal life. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Procrastination: Why You Do It, What To Do About It","review":"Enjoyed the information. Gave good insites to procrastination. I enjoy reading self-help books in all different areas on a regular basis. Always learn something new and evey now and then recognize a little of me in some of them. I'd recommend this book to anyone who would be interested in the subject of procrastination or is looking for self help information in the area of procrastination."},{"Title":"Procrastination: Why You Do It, What To Do About It","review":"I don't know what else to say other than it has something for everyone. I didn't know there were so many types of procrastinators and the authors really give you a psychological explanation of why we do it. I'm still reading it but I'm sure it will turn out to be an invaluable resource."},{"Title":"Procrastination: Why You Do It, What To Do About It","review":"Maybe the author(s) aren't procrastinators, but they are lazy! I found this book to be worse than a waste of money. It was a waste of time, too.Take the time to develop some real material here worth publishing rather than just a rambling brain dump.There is little-to-no original thinking in this book.Maybe it is valuable to have common-knowledge anecdotes and heresy about procrastination repeated to you. if so, I'll save you the trouble with some examples:\\"I have heard of some companies restricting email use to just the last ten minutes of each hour. Try that out.\\"\\"I have a colleague who had two monitors. I asked why. He said that he 'can keep multiple applications open'. I have heard of productivity gains of as much as 50% from such methods. Try that out.\\"\\"The Now Habit\\" is a (much) better book."},{"Title":"Procrastination: Why You Do It, What To Do About It","review":"What I like most about this book, written over 30 years ago, is that the authors are on the level. They really want, I feel, to communicate, to get the ideas across, and aid readers. I really like this book a lot, it's honest and it's helpful."},{"Title":"Procrastination: Why You Do It, What To Do About It","review":"I've been a procastinator all my life. And I always wanna why I did it, and what to do about it.I bought this book a few weeks ago.

No more procastination."},{"Title":"Procrastination: Why You Do It, What To Do About It","review":"This book is a bit of a double edged sword. It's wonderful for its insight into the psychological aspects of procrastination, but it is often bogged down by those same explanations.

I read the first few pages, and then never got back to it.

I've cracked the cover but it was too much effort to read it.

Where's the nekkid pikatures or comics to hold my interest?"},{"Title":"Procrastination: Why You Do It, What To Do About It","review":"It does a nice job analyzing why people procrastinate. Lot of whining, no solutions... A waste of my time and money."},{"Title":"Procrastination: Why You Do It, What To Do About It","review":"This is a great book with something for everyone.I'm the founder of Successful Academic Coaching and when I work with graduate students struggling with their dissertations and faculty members trying to publish, I recommend this book frequently. Many of my clients have found this book useful; some swear by it.The book contains two sections: understanding why we procrastinate, and outlining how to overcome it. It's a quick but useful read; the writing is clear, and the descriptions precise. You will definitely find yourself reflected in the array of problems, excuses, insecurities, stumbling blocks, and workable solutions. Whether you're a graduate student putting off your lit review, or a junior professor agonizing over a grant proposal, you'll discover WHY you procrastinate, and WHAT STEPS you can take to start moving forward.Fear is the basis of all procrastination, say Burka and Yuen, including fear of failure, of success, and of \\"losing the battle\\" - some of us procrastinate to show that we're in control of the situation. \\"You can't MAKE me do this!\\" we say, silently, as we refuse to comply with a demanding advisor, a nagging spouse, or even (OK, some folks are REALLY stubborn) an empty gas tank!The authors include a chapter on delving into your past - family attitudes, school patterns, etc. -- to learn why you've come to use procrastination as your chief coping mechanism. I'm a clinical psychologist, so I believe in understanding the past to understand current patterns -- as long as the insights are followed with action. Fortunately, Burka and Yuen promote action in the second half of their book.The cures they suggest are realistic. You didn't start procrastinating overnight, and you're not going to quit like that either. Burka and Yuen explain how to develop better work habits methodically, one step at a time.The authors recommend starting a 2-week program using many techniques. Among their recommendations:- Make goals that are observable.- Be specific.- Take small steps.- Reward yourself!- Avoid PerfectionismHow do you stop procrastinating? You start one day at a time. Get this book to help you begin.(This review was co-written with my colleague, Liz Brown, who helps edit the dissertations and book proposals of some of my grad student and faculty clients.)"},{"Title":"Procrastination: Why You Do It, What To Do About It","review":"I bought this in conjunction with \\"The Now Habit\\". This is quite a different book, much more verbose (but in a good way) and tends to get a bit deeped, in my view, into the psychology of procrastination. Which is useful.If I absolutely had to choose, I would choose \\"The Now Habit\\". But I would strongly suggest that you read this book also. It does cover things that the Now Habit does not cover very well.Our society tends to take a very simple view of procrastination, which can have fairly complex causes. This book helped me understand many of the roots of my behavior and, painfully, I recognized many of my behavior patterns. That alone is \\"worth the price of admission\\". This book will help you deal with your procrastination."},{"Title":"Procrastination: Why You Do It, What To Do About It","review":"I have read many, many time management and organization books. This book was the one that really made a difference. Until you know why you procrastinate and can't get things done, numbering your priorities will not help. Read this book first, then the time management books. The authors point out that not everyone drags their feet in the same areas, nor to the same extent. The book would probably be helpful to ANYONE, because everyone has things they'd like to get done, but can't seem to. The authors have you put together an \\"unschedule\\", a chart of your time that is already taken, as a way to see how much time you really have left for your goals. Just doing that was an eye opener. The book has many helpful suggestions and questions that I have not seen in other books. I wish I had known about it when it was first published in 1983 - I would have gotten more done!!"},{"Title":"Procrastination: Why You Do It, What To Do About It","review":"\\"Procrastination\\" by Burka and Yuen is clearly the beginning of an answer to what's holding us back from doing things. It is a kind of behavior that masks many problems. It gives a name to the behavior, gives a plausible set of reasons why we do it, and gives us something to do about it.In a word, fear is the general cause of procrastination, but the authors do a fine job of unpacking that suitcase. With numerous examples to choose from, it is easy for us procrastinators to find some others who do it our way. And just as interesting, some people do it other ways that we haven't recognized before.Recognizing we are not alone is really a good first step to moving on.In the second half of the book, the authors begin to show us how to overcome the inertia of procrastination's gravity. I found the \\"taking stock\\" inventory of areas of procrastination very helpful. Following the inventory, they suggest a plan of action and ways to make progress.Procrastination is a more wide-spread problem than most of us want to admit. Perhaps that's because it hits too close to home. What these authors have done is to bring the problem out in the open and deal with it head-on.Highly recommended. (Don't put off buying it, now.)"},{"Title":"Procrastination: Why You Do It, What To Do About It","review":"I procrastinate only in certain areas, and I found from reading this book that this is normal. (Whew.) I found myself thinking I was terribly busy but didn't seem to get things done. I read this book and as other reviewers have stated, I felt that many section were directly addressing MY issues. I have since begun to implement some of the strategies and \\"tools\\" for dealing with procrastination. WOW! It is wonderful. Things that I have put off for months (like calling a plumber to fix the leaky toilet) are done. And it was so simple. I wonder why I ever put it off. I intend to read this book again in a month or so, as I am sure I will pick up more tips the second time around."},{"Title":"Procrastination: Why You Do It, What To Do About It","review":"I knew I was a procrastinator but I never understood it. I feel like passages of this book are describing me.The first few chapters discuss the problem of procrastination and the underlying causes. The later chapters provide strategies for overcoming procrastination.Because the strategies involve 2 week trials that only apply 1 strategy at a time, I have not yet completed the strategies and cannot speak to their effectiveness.Still just reading the first few chapters has added to my insight.The final chapter is about living with a procrastinator. Interestingly, my parents, spouse, and bosses have probably all been mishandling my procrastination."},{"Title":"Procrastination: Why You Do It, What To Do About It","review":"I have read many books by top authors on Procrastination. Most say write a goal, concentrate on your A1 task etc etc. But the point is-they miss on why you do it? Until unless you figure it out, you can't solve this problem completely, atleast on long term basis. We all procrastinate atleast on some areas. Authors list reasons why we do it in a proper manner. It could be your environment, your interaction with your school teacher/professor/parents, showing how great you are by doing nightout before exam and still passing etc etc. I feel to deal with it properly--one has to know the reason. I guess it is best in that sense and feel everyone should read it. (I would suggest everyone read the first chapter here in this site, especially the cycle of procastination)Thanks to authors for writing such a great book :)"},{"Title":"Procrastination: Why You Do It, What To Do About It","review":"Approaching unwelcome tasks with an \\"I'll do it tomorrow\\" mindset is not unusual behavior. The problem is, tomorrow quickly becomes today, so the procrastinator sets a new tomorrow goal. This tomorrow goal eventually becomes a next week goal, then a next month goal, then a next year goal - that is, a never goal. Time runs out for everyone, but it does so far more quickly for procrastinators. If you procrastinate, do you know why? Psychologists Jane B. Burka and Lenora M. Yuen outline the reasons and roots of procrastination. More importantly, they show you how to fix your vexing, life-sapping procrastination problem. getAbstract suggests that anyone who procrastinates should buy this book. Now would be fine."},{"Title":"Procrastination: Why You Do It, What To Do About It","review":"This book explains the complex psychological mechanics behind what we simply call 'procrastination'. It does it so well that we can see procrastination is just an outward symptom of much more complex subconscious processes that go on in our brains.Highly recommended to anyone who felt, at any time in their life, that they are not living their life to their potential. If not anything else, this will reduce your guilt (by making you understand why you do what you do)"},{"Title":"Procrastination: Why You Do It, What To Do About It","review":"The authors get into the psychology of procrastination, which no other book I have read does. This helps the reader get to the root of his or her problem. Although a few of the psychological explanations are tenuous at best, most of them are very good and will help many people understand their procrastination. The second part of the book gives actual methods to solve procrastination, which was explained psychologically in Part I. These methods are helpful and realistic (you are not expected to change overnight, and not even within weeks or months). The book was definitely worth the price."},{"Title":"Procrastination: Why You Do It, What To Do About It","review":"Like the name of the book suggests, this is a self help book about helping you get rid of procrastination. It was written by two psychologists, one would hope it was really good. And it almost was.......I notice a trend that some self help books take. Instead of going too simple, they go too complicating. This book is so complicating. Compiling information on top of information on top of(you get it)..........It would be one thing if the authors had given an easily understandable list to sift through, about what your problems likely are, then given you a system for finding out which ones you have if you don't already know. Then a process for fixing yourself based on the problems you have. That format would have been far better than what they did.So what did the authors do? They decided to run through hundreds of different possibilities all the while saying, maybe this is your problem, or maybe it's this one, or maybe it's a different one. This one on page, after page, after page.............. After a while I got lost, I couldn't figure out what I should be trying and what I shouldn't. This book tried the buck shot method, and in the end I felt like I could have gone without reading it. Let me tell you a simple system that this book only glazed on.......Learn to love what you do, find out what mental blocks are holding you back, then get rid of them. Practice to death, and get an understanding of will power.I liked Roy&Johns;'s \\"WillPower\\" much better. Also Kent's \\"Unstoppable Confidence\\". Read those two books first, then come back and tell me this one is better(it's not).Did this book have insights into the human mind? I don't think so. So much was said I assume the PHD's who wrote it had no clue, but had a bunch of information on the subject, so they decided to publish it without editing out the fluff/pure junk. I can't give credit for gold printed next to junk.To end, I give it one star, because in the end I was so lost I couldn't remember nor apply anything. The piling of useless and too much information made this one a worthless read."},{"Title":"Procrastination: Why You Do It, What To Do About It","review":"My go-to book for understanding and managing ADHD and procrastination problems.

I am sure I will one. day."},{"Title":"Procrastination: Why You Do It, What To Do About It","review":"It was a pretty easy read. The books also has steps on dealing with others that procrastinate like co-workers and business partners. As I got farther into book I recognized that I have been using some of the techniques that the authors had recommended to accomplish my daily exercise goal."},{"Title":"Procrastination: Why You Do It, What To Do About It","review":"Simply put, this book is what made me think about my past. Why I didn't do certain things, and what lead me to be where I am right now. I noticed procrastination as a HUGE pattern, something that I need to overcome.Since you're reading this, you are contemplating already. If that is the case, you probably have an issue (especially if you say things like &#34;Man, I don't have time to read this book now.. I'll get it later when I have more time&#34;. Hint: you won't)The book tells you a lot of things, from the psychology of why we do it and gives some hints on how to overcome it. It will tell you that you won't be able to do from a Monday to Tuesday, but that it is a gradual process.I loved it, I really did, and I give my absolute recommendation for the book!"},{"Title":"Procrastination: Why You Do It, What To Do About It","review":"While I have read the first half, (why you procrastinate) I have learned about the root of some of my life long actions! Here's hoping the second half (learning to not procrastinate) will offer some good reading."},{"Title":"Procrastination: Why You Do It, What To Do About It","review":"Like a vast majority of college students, I suffer from procrastination. Throughout my career, I was trapped in a perpetual cycle, where each \\"end\\" was another promise to myself to reform my ways and be cured of this disease. Yet after that brief catharsis between the end of a deadline and the approaching of another, I see myself again stuck in limbo, cursing myself in my inability to change. And of course, through this sickness, I can see myself suffer academically and physically, churning out sub-par grades that I hope that I have the capability of doing better. With this in mind, I see this book as much needed medicine.From the start, you are told that procrastination is something that can be solved (yay!) and has several psychological, cultural, and biological underlying factors than previously thought (I thought it was just my laziness..). The authors then proceed and tell how knowledge of these factors are crucial before you are able to help yourself (uh-oh...I don't like where this book is headed..). Thus the first part of the book is comprised of all the different ways that you procrastinate and finally the book is concluded by how you can overcome these obstacles. All in all, this book was extremely informative (super dense), yet I have a lot of issues with this book.With the first part of the book, I constantly felt as if I was being pried of my private life. It was as if this book was not a helpful guide, but instead a personal shrink finding the root of all the distress in my life. It then gives a ridiculous amount of examples in restating these different roots that we feel. I found some of it relevant to my life, but it eventually I felt as if it was a chore reading all these problems. Of course, to save my sanity I quickly skimmed the rest, hoping the book will give life-changing advice in the second part of the book.With the second part of the book, I found the information useful and practical. Yet, as I continued through this section, it again suffered from the faults of the first half. It was completely redundant, emphasizing certain key concepts to death. Again, I could not take this redundancy, so I skimmed the rest picking the most relevant and interesting parts to critically read.TL;DR All in all, I believe this book is fully informed on the topic of procrastination, yet it could better present itself in a manner that is more efficient."},{"Title":"Procrastination: Why You Do It, What To Do About It","review":"This is an old favorite that got lost in a basement flood a few years back.... I find that it is as good as I remembered. The early chapters help to describe and expain the varied sources of this problem and its differing manifestations; the second half is a practical workbook for \\"learning to tell time\\". Because of my nature- as well as lingering disorders of thinking- I need a refresher every so often. It may or may not be EXACTLY what you are looking for but it is both philosophical and practical- an uncommon combination."},{"Title":"Procrastination: Why You Do It, What To Do About It","review":"If you are reading this and there is something else you really should be doing.. go do it. This book does not help you get up and start doings things as much as it helps you to create more efficient workflow. When you aren't quick to get up and do your day-to-day work, that is usually a personal dilemma that can't be solved by the author of a book who hasn't met you or your individual life."},{"Title":"Procrastination: Why You Do It, What To Do About It","review":"This book is a good find. It explores procrastination in a little bit deeper sense as to combat causes instead of effects. Instead of focusing only on time-management, the book explores why an individual might be feeling so aversive to a task in the first place. It sums up the book with a quality set of techniques that will actually work (if you do them.)I've read quite a few other books on the subject, and nothing has quite been as meat-and-potatoes on the subject until this one.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Procrastination: Why You Do It, What To Do About It","review":"I can't say I'd ever rate anything a 5 since it implies perfect but this book is pretty close. Knowing why you do something is a HUGE help in figuring out how to overcome it and this book does an outstanding job of that."},{"Title":"Procrastination: Why You Do It, What To Do About It","review":"Drawing from professional and personal experience, the authors explore the vicious \\"Cycle of Procrastination,\\" and delve into the underlying roots (environmental causes and deeper psychological dynamics driven by fear). But primarily, the aim of the book is to help give the reader some freedom of choice about procrastinating so that he/she will worry less and feel more in control of his/her life."},{"Title":"Procrastination: Why You Do It, What To Do About It","review":"This book is long on fluff and short on concrete advice. What useful advice it does contain is largely the same as inThe Now Habit: A Strategic Program for Overcoming Procrastination and Enjoying Guilt-Free Play, a book half as long. I believe that the authors of this book worked at the UC Berkeley counseling center at the same time as Neil Fiore, who wrote the latter book. If that's a coincidence it's a pretty unlikely one.The authors are also obsessed with procrastination caused by being the first in your family or community to go to college. I don't doubt that this is a real phenomenon, but it applies to maybe one one-hundredth of one percent of the potential readership."},{"Title":"Procrastination: Why You Do It, What To Do About It","review":"I agree with the review by DeLonzor - I couldn't bear reading this book because I found the text very \\"bogged down\\" myself. Not that it isn't an excellent workbook for the procrastinator. I decided that it's so wordy because one of the goals of the authors must be to lull (i.e., hypnotize) their readers into being more proactive, and to do that you have to use lots of words and examples of situations, to penetrate all the types of mental/emotional blocks readers will put up as they read this book. Obviously this style works because it certainly put me to sleep! Being a fan of REBT (Albert Ellis) myself, I prefer something a lot more to the point, like \\"Living Without Procrastination\\" by Susan Roberts, which briefly lays out the research about who does it and why and simply and succinctly describes what each person can do to nudge themselves toward action. So, I'm not knocking the book here, just want readers to know there are other options. No matter which style one prefers, reading a book on procrastination, especially in these overstimulating times, is good for anyone's soul, and for simply increasing one's enjoyment of the world."},{"Title":"Procrastination: Why You Do It, What To Do About It","review":"As a \\"I was born late, been late ever since\\" kind of gal I know a thing or two about procrastination. But I never really knew why I procrastinated.I have read tons of productivity books such asGetting Things Done: The Art of Stress-Free Productivity(my favorite of all of them),The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People, etc. And although most are great at helping you set up a system, they don't really help you get and STAY motivated. Of course, I always get a boost after reading a wonderful get up and go book, I just find myself after a month or even a week losing my way.That is until I read this book.I have been so, so, so much more productive the last few months. I was trying to figure out why and it donned on me it was this book! For the first time in my life, I find myself stopping to see why I'm procrastinating on something. It may not sound like a big thing but that one act of figuring out what it is that is preventing me from doing what I need/want to do enables me to actually do it!Even the fact that I'm actually filling out a review just shows you that I'm not procrastinating any more (I always say I'm going to leave a review for any product I buy on Amazon since its the reviews that help me in purchasing products - you know - give back).I didn't follow the 2 step program in the back of the book so I can't attest to the efficacy of that program. But considering how impactful just reading the book is, I'm sure its great."},{"Title":"Procrastination: Why You Do It, What To Do About It","review":"I am a chronic procrastinator. Procrastination: Why You Do It, What to Do About It Now, is a manual that helps people like me understand why we always put things off till the last minute, and how we can overcome the stress and worry that accompanies such behavior.Key notes from my reading included:Your brain is always changing, so you can change procrastination.Procrastinator are often high achievers who appear to be doing fine (to others), but who are internally riddled with self-doubt.Not everything you do has to be perfect.Break up activities into manageable chunks of time as soon as you know your deadlines - plan it out.I'm a maladaptive perfectionist - I have high standards, which I never meet due to self-criticism.Stop and take time to acknowledge the small steps along the way to a big goal, instead of worrying about the end product. This will help actually get to the end product/state.There are hundreds of tips that I found useful - the above are only a few. Bottom line is that I am now better equipped to rationally approach time. I have a few new tools for managing my deadlines, both self-imposed and inflicted by others. I'd definitely buy the book again despite the fact that a few chapters were not useful to me - the ones that were contained numerous nuggets of wisdom and a few moments where I thought - oh, so that's why I do that.Knowing is half the battle. I had a major term paper due while reading this book, and I started it earlier than I would have otherwise because of my new awareness. I finished a few hours early - maybe not exciting to others - however, I have a long history of asking for extensions because I waited till the last minute.If you are late for everything and have trouble finishing projects, this book is worth ten bucks, and probably a lot more. Don't put off buying it!"},{"Title":"How You Survive in the Middle Ages (How Would You Survive?)","review":"Fiona Macdonald is famous for writing beutiful books about the past. She explains in a very friendly, clear and fascinating way how our ancestors lived. Children who dislike history and who think that the past is boring change their mind when they see the magnificintly illustrated books Fiona makes. This book pulls you into the Middle ages and gets you as close to the past as possible without a time-machine. On the first page you see a picture of a medieval town, people are working, there ia a market and there is more than enough to see. On several place throughout the city you find small questions like 'Would you be afraid of these soldiers?'. You see three scary looking soldiers playing a game on a tower. If you would like to know what game they are playing you can go to another page. It works almost as a internetsite with several links. The book is almost ineractive. The Chapters are clear and very beuatifyllt illustrated. The author tells us how life would be for people in the middle ages. You can follow 'a-day-in-the-life-of, you can see battles, castles, cities and farmers. It is a book that you will pick up again and again. Children will love it, it is very handy for making school projects. As always Fiona Macdonald has succeeded in making another brilliant book about the past. Bringing the past closer and educating the young. The Illustrators have done a perfect job, every single picture is a pleasure to look at."},{"Title":"How You Survive in the Middle Ages (How Would You Survive?)","review":"With the rather facile title of the series, I had no great expectations--but WOW! what a wonderful book to counter all the misconceptions about the middle ages that are promulgated even in many adults' books! I adore it. If you only get one book that touches on the social history of the middle ages, this should be it!"},{"Title":"How You Survive in the Middle Ages (How Would You Survive?)","review":"I offer a dissenting view of this book. No doubt that the team of Fiona MacDonald and David Salariya is one of the strongest partnerships in children's history books. They are leaders in the field and have published many great books. My problem is with the structure of the book. The Middle Ages is a huge topic and MacDonald does a decent job of presenting the story for young children. But what drove me crazy about this book is that along with the main narrative, each two page chapter also includes numerous smaller illustrations and sub stories. As someone trying to read this book to their child, I had to really squint to be able to read these smaller side bars. I found these side bars to be confusing and a digresion from the main narrative. There are many other books that do a more coherent job of telling this important story. I would recommend any books from the \\"Inside Story\\" series or Giovanni Caselli's \\"The Everyday Life Series\\". Philip Steele's \\"The Medieval World\\" and \\"Castles\\" are much better books."},{"Title":"How You Survive in the Middle Ages (How Would You Survive?)","review":"This is so much better than the other general information books available. I had to pay the cost of new for a rather worn and discolored version. It was still worth it. This is a superior approach to making general information about the middle ages interesting to children. The other books now look like a hodge-podge."},{"Title":"How You Survive in the Middle Ages (How Would You Survive?)","review":"This is a fun little book. I use it with my high school students when we study literature from this era."},{"Title":"Pro Apache Ant (Expert's Voice in Java)","review":"Ant is one of those \\"Swiss Army Knife\\" tools that can take care of a stunning amount of work when it comes to automating your build process. Matthew Moodie does a good job mixing reference and practical information about Ant in his book Pro Apache Ant.Contents: Introducing Ant; Installing Ant; Using Ant; Examining Ant's Types; Building a Project; Deploying an Application; Running an Application; Testing an Application; Using Ant in Large Projects; Writing Custom Tasks; Extending Ant; Using the Ant API; IndexIn Pro Apache Ant, Moodie does a quick intro to the package and shows you how to install it. Once that's done, then you're off on a tour that touches on a wide array of functionality that Ant brings to your development project. The book seems to be a smooth blend of reference material covered in a format that is more geared towards practicality. For instance, the Building A Project chapter sets up an example scenario that would commonly be seen in a programming environment. The structure of the development system is put forth, and then the Ant code is built to show how an Ant script can automate the many manual tasks that would normally be part of the build process. Interspersed throughout the chapter are tables that show the particular command being used, as well as an explanation of all the particular attributes and parameters that can be used with the command. As such, you learn *how* to do something as well as having the tools to extend your use beyond the example. Having the blend of styles makes the book one that will last beyond your learning period.If you've never worked through build processes in your environment, or if this is your first exposure to a scripting tool like Ant, you may end up proceeding a bit slower than you'd like. While you can learn everything you need from this book, it seemed to me that the reader would probably do better if they had at least a passing familiarity with scripting tools and a Java build process. The intro is quick, but if you're willing to do what's necessary to get the basics down, the book will be invaluable going forward. And if you're looking for something to round out your knowledge of Ant because you use it on a regular basis, then this is a very viable option. Nice job..."},{"Title":"Pro Apache Ant (Expert's Voice in Java)","review":"I needed something that would help me master Ant in as little time as possible. This is the book. The book gives fundamentals as well as cook book examples. You could click thru the free Ant doc online, but this book will get you up and running in the least amount of time.It also has a section on extending Ant. From my searching, this book is the only good resource on extending and customizing Ant. Both a good starter book and a good reference book."},{"Title":"Pro Apache Ant (Expert's Voice in Java)","review":"Ant is one of those technologies that has an excellent manual and API online . This sets a higher standard for a book so as not too just duplicate the Internet content. \\"Pro Apache Ant\\" meets this challenge.The author walks you through a good number of the Ant tasks with examples and tips. The attributes are provided for common tasks, so you have a physical reference. The author refers you to the manual for some of the less common tasks. A summary of ant-contrib is provided since it is such a standard library. The author points to the Internet for a list of optional tasks.This book assumes you know Java and the packaging process. In other words, you should know what a jar and war are to understand the sample application.After walking through the common tasks and incrementally building a sample build.xml, the author delves into some more advanced topics. Included are how to refactor a build file, accommodate large projects, custom tasks, mappers and how to use the Ant API from a Java program.The book doesn't have any fluff. It starts with an introduction to Ant and Ant's benefits. After a detailed explanation of how to install Ant, you see the first Ant task.

ANSI 117 is a building code and most jurisdictions follow it, so omitting it from the book is a major oversight.2)While The Codes Guidebook for Interiors does a good job of bringing together disparate code requirements into a single paragraph summary, it still needs to tell a designer WHERE in the codebook to find the actual language. If I design a door the way the Codes Guidebook says, I cannot tell the inspector,\\"Well that's the way the Codes Guidebook says to do it\\"--I have to show him the actual code sections that support my design.

This book wraps you up and takes you on a journey that will both richly entertain and challenge you at the same time. Being a reader who will always choose an &quot;entertaining novel&quot; over a &quot;personal growth&quot; book, I happily had my cake and ate it too!"},{"Title":"The Traveler's Gift","review":"\\"The Traveler's Gift\\" is a life-changing treasure. The fact that it's entertaining, informative and inspiring is a fantastic bonus.Most of us will see a personal reflection in the main character, David Ponder. All the cards seemed to be stacked against him and just when you think it can't get any worse ... the adventure begins. While meeting seven extraordinary people from different times in history, Ponder gets to see what each person was thinking during intense moments of decision that helped shape the world. (Luckily, you get to learn from their unbelievable minds as well.)Of the seven visits, my personal favorite is a man of lesser fame, Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, who played a vital role in the North's victory in the Civil War. (I get the chills just thinking about it.)Andy Andrews has got to be one of the most brilliant inspirational storytellers of this generation. \\"The Traveler's Gift\\" is a definite \`must' read."},{"Title":"The Traveler's Gift","review":"Well you can see how many copies I purchased. They are all for Christmas gifts and I am anticipating a moment of truth for all the recipients. Lovely book!"},{"Title":"The Traveler's Gift","review":"I enjoy reading a lot of books and honestly don't have a very high standard. Even if a book is unintelligent I can still enjoy a good page turning plot. If the plot is slow I can still relish in thought provoking ideas and thematic exploration. This book has neither a compelling plot or an intelligent premise. The plot is terrifyingly laughable especially given that the author uses it to wallow in self-aggrandizement. Likewise, the themes are stagnant and the writing is awful.This book is about a floundering man who is chosen by a God figure to learn some lessons and then returns to reality/earth to save mankind by imparting (as a motivational speaker) all the wisdom he learned. Stadiums full of people reverence him. Parks and hospitals are named after him and his family. Of course, he is fabulously wealthy. The mere mention of his name brings people to tears and testimonials. Now having said that, it is important to note that the author is a motivational speaker. The author turned himself into a hero. He makes himself God's gift to mankind...literally! This book makes me sad for all the wrong reasons.Sure, you can say: \\"but what does that matter compared to all that you learn from the seven gifts\\". Well, there are certainly some nice ideas. Not new ideas, just nice ideas. These nice ideas are truly the only redeeming quality of the book. It is just too bad that none of these ideas are unique.Beyond that concession I find no other. Through the course of the man's journey he meets several key figures from a variety of times and places. Yet, each of their voices are identical. No variety. No imagination. Amazingly, they all sounded exactly like the motivational speaker. Far more disconcerting are the blatant historical inaccuracies. I always figured that an author would want to research their ideas so that the text would not expose them as an ignoramus. Not this motivational speaker. He is just fine knowing that anyone who reads his book can see him trying to pass off creative story telling as truth. Worse still are the cliches. And, by cliches I mean cliche after cliche after cliche...after cliche.I wish I hadn't read this book. The title was hopeful and I actually liked the book more before I read it.

All this extravagant praise seems overboard to me. It's a pleasant read, but Andrews plows no new ground. His seven decisions have been covered by Og Mandino, Napoleon Hill, Dale Carnegie, Norman Vincent Peale and other prophets of The Rules to Live By.For example, his decisions 2,3,4 and 6 are similar to habits 5,1,2 and 7 of Stephen Covey's The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People. The use of a journey as a vehicle to convey a message is good, but goes back at least to Homer's Odyssey (750 BC). James Redfield used it in The Celestine Prophecy. Michael Gelb used voices from historical figures in Discover Your Genius.The book is worth your time to read, and I don't doubt the value of the seven decisions. The problem with all these books lies not with The Rules, but with ourselves: poor, weak, back sliding, easily distracted creatures that we are. I hope that you do better at living by The Rules than I do."},{"Title":"The Traveler's Gift","review":"I'd never heard of this man until I happened to see him on FOX, giving advice to a man and a woman who'd just lost their jobs. They had mortgages to pay, children in college and the shock of suddenly being unemployed after a lifetime of work. And the author's advice? 'You don't really have a problem. You have money. You have food on the table.' (Really? How does he know that?) 'Look for something you're passionate about. Find twenty five people who don't need you.'It was terrible to see the look of shock and disappointment on the faces of the man and woman who had obviously been led to believe that the author would offer them advice that would help them. Instead they were in the position of a drowning man who hopes someone is about to throw him a rope.But instead of a rope,the 'rescuer' instructs them to stop worrying about drowning and concentrate on the opportunity to observe exotic fish on the way down. (All this while the author is safely on shore and collecting a cheque as a swimming coach.)I can't add anything to the reviews that point out the authors inability to write above a fifth grade level, or his banal rehash of every self-help book ever written. Instead I'll suggest something that might actually help in the job market.1) Acquire skills that someone might need (math, engineering, chemistry, etc)2) Make friends with people who might offer you a job or at least recommend you to an employer. (It's still true that it's not what you know, but who you know)3) Hope for a bit of luck. Unfortunately chance plays a bigger part in life than we want to admit.I think self help books are a waste of time and money buta few books that might be useful or at least not as useless as the authors:What Color Is Your Parachute? by Richard Nelson BollesGuerrilla Marketing for Job Hunters by Jay Conrad Levinson"},{"Title":"The Traveler's Gift","review":"I'm always amazed when mediocrity somehow finds mass appeal. A song heard on the radio has a stock melody and banal, cliched lyrics and still becomes a hit. Obviously, after reading the overwhelming majority of positive reviews, I'll have to admit that Andy Andrews' \\"The Traveler's Gift\\" has resonated with a lot of people. It hasn't with me. I found the writing to be over-simplistic, juvenile, cliched, contrived and predictable. But beyond the literary merits or lack thereof, what about the moral message. It seems that the 7 rules for enhancing life are mostly concerned with financial success and that this is nothing more than a quick-fix-it manual for attaining personal wealth in the guise of a Christian leap of faith. I would find it difficult to pattern my life after Christopher Columbus who, according to many historical sources, tortured and murdered native Americans.Moreover, why select historical figures involved in acts of war (Truman, Lincoln, and Chamberlain)? Why not people like Ghandi, Mother Theresa, and Martin Luther King?Philosophically, I have problems with \\"The buck stops here\\" being a life-affirming bromide. The notion that we take responsibility for everything that happens to us in life is absurd. Surely a person who dies from a mugging attack or a serious disease does not bear sole responsibility for being victimized. Yes, the person who was mugged may have chosen to walk alone at night through a bad neighborhood and the person suffering from the disease may have eaten the wrong foods but there were certainly other factors involved.In the hands of a talented writer, this could have been avery moving story with powerful messages delivered. In my opinion, it was anything but."},{"Title":"The Traveler's Gift","review":"Don't waste your money.

When his car skids out of control on an icy road, he is thrown into another reality...travelling through time and visiting seven key people who each present him with a Decision for Success.Written in the unmistakable style of Og Mandino, each Decision for Success is a powerful, concise affirmation statement. A master story-teller, author Andy Andrews paints vivid word pictures to bring each scene to life, wrapping them up with the distilled wisdom of ages.Andrews has risked a great deal with this book, since the structure of the story is obviously borrowed from Mandino, and a handful of the nuggets of wisdom are recycled contemporary quotes.

None of it is too Earth shattering.The story is about a man, David Ponder, who loses his job, has a daughter with medical problems, is broke, etc. He has pretty much given up on life.

At the moment he hits the bottom he gets in an accident. Instead of finding himself in the hospital, he finds that he has \\"traveled\\" through time and space. He visits seven people that made a difference in history. Each person on his journey gives him a piece of advice that influences him, and the rest of his life. The advice focuses on the characteristics that make a person successful. These seven pieces of advice, or attitudes, are known in the book as \\"the seven decisions that determine personal success.\\" After David finishes his journey he finds himself in the hospital. None of his circumstances changed, but because of the experiences he had, he then approaches life with renewed hope and optimism. The lessons he learned changed his life and taught him how to harness the potential he has within him.This book is written in a way that is straight forward and easy to understand. Every characteristic can be applied to nearly any aspect of anyone's life. Andy Andrews writes in a way that will motivate you to be the best person you can be. The characters' attitudes are an incredible example of being the best person you can become. Their simple influence is inspirational that will change the way you think. The chapters are outlined so that if you only wanted to read about the specific attributes, you easily could. That being said, the story line is very basic and has no unexpected twists and turns. It is still a page turner, because every page is filled with inspirational quotes, comments and insights.It is a self-improvement book disguised as a fictional novel. I thought that it was a little cheesy, but I believe it was a creative approach to writing. The simplicity of this book makes it one that I will turn to for motivation when I am feeling discouraged. Every decision of success was explained clearly and promotes positive thinking. I really enjoyed reading this book because it made me want to be a better person. Each attribute was written in a way that made them seem obtainable, and realistic.

So I then I picked up The Traveler's Gift, also by Andy Andrews:David Ponder's life has been falling apart at an astounding pace and just as he thinks it may be over, in his darkest hour he is chosen to travel on a journey back in time. He visits many famous people/events including Anne Frank, Abraham Lincoln and Joshua Chamberlain. On this journey the Mr. Ponder appears before each of these people during a very challenging time in their own lives. He speaks with them, witnesses their events and surroundings and receives a letter to read before moving on to the next. The letters represent one of the \\"7 decisions to determining personal success\\". While each \\"decision\\" may seem simple enough in principle - the imagery and emotion behind the stories within he learns each lesson is what really drives them home.1. The Buck Stops Here - Taking personal responsibility2. Seek Wisdom - Search for understanding and discernment3. Be a Person of Action - Being a courageous leader4. Have a Decided Heart - Overcoming double-mindedness5. Choose Happiness - Possessing a grateful spirit6. Forgive others - The power of grace and mercy7.

I do agree that the message near the end about finding financial success is not very humble, since Jesus says clearly to his disciples in the parable about the landowner, \\"So the last shall be first and the first shall be last.\\" I think this is a terrible book for new Christians who need to learn to be humble, but good for seasoned Christians who know how to take such books with a grain of salt. And there are some good Christian messages in the book. What about when Truman says, \\"Until a person takes responsibility for where he is, there is no basis for moving on.\\" Isn't this what is needed for confession of sins? Or the obvious message from King Solomon to \\"seek wisdom,\\" a frequent God-inspired message from him throughout the Bible.If readers are seeking a book to find sound Christian advice about living a successful life, start with the Bible, God's help book for Christians. The very idea of \\"self-help\\" goes against what Christ asks of us anyway. But if you're looking for a good read that plays around with the neat idea of meeting some of the most memorable historical figures, peppered with some really good advice about the power of attitude, then this book is a good read."},{"Title":"The Traveler's Gift","review":"If you are a history buff you'll enjoy Andy Andrews take on History as he gleans a piece of wisdom that may have carried them through the key moments of their lives.

You can't NOT be helped by this book. It will either help you reset your course, or help you to be be more resolute that choosing the path of compassion and love for others, or forgiveness, is the best one, and the one by which you can best help others. It also reminded me that if you want to be great person, there are examples out there of great people whom we can still read about today by reading their biographies.

Andrews does just that by taking the reader on a historic journey into the minds of great people from the past. The first few of 7 insights regarding leadership were standard fare - take responsibility, seek wisdom, take action, be dedicated to the task. I was taken by the willingness of Colombus to set out on the unlikely & uncertain quest to prove the world is round. Not just a powerful quest for Colombus, but also for the crew who sailed with him! Anne Frank's admonition is profound, that life is a privilege, but living life to the fullest is a choice. But the 5th, spoken through Abraham Lincoln, gave me pause. Lincoln advocates gathering power as a way to influence many others & to change the world. Inspiring. Second, it is an incredible testament to the power of (& need for) forgiveness.The final stopover is with the archangel Gabriel, at the place of what could have been but never was, because people gave up too soon.

I had been allowing my mood to let circumstances stop my progress toward my dreams. Then I picked up this book my brother had highly recommended well over a year ago. I had bought it immediately on Amazon.com and then put it on my shelf. Last night I read it. Andy Andrews, thanks for the research on 7 great human beings. Thanks for taking the time to inspire me and I'm sure countless others. You did a great job of waking me up. The buck DOES stop here. No matter how dire our circumstances, we still have the choice of what to do right now, in the midst of it, and that decision will affect our future and the future of others. This book gives 7 secrets to living the life you always dreamed of but kept missing out on. We all have a purpose. Isn't it time we lived it and stopped letting other people and other things give us excuses for anything less than greatness?"},{"Title":"The Traveler's Gift","review":"I really enjoyed The Traveller's Gift which was recommended to me by one of my very successful friends. I am a huge student/trainer of Personal Development information, and what I liked most about this book was it's freshness.The lessons in the book were not just your average Personal Development stuff. They were well thought out, and presented in way that I certainly got alot out them.You can get a free seminar on The Law of Attraction, which was missing from the book, at wealth-ambition.com/lawofattractionI think that the book, being a novel and yet being a self-help book at the same time was effective, and this book is much more accessible than Og Mandino's to today's reader.(I attribute learning the lesson of persistence to Og Mandino's \\"The Greatest Salesman In The World.\\")But even though the book was easy to read and powerful, I felt that the writing was not perfect. The strength of the book is the message, not the lyricism of the scenes. And I felt that David Ponder, the main character, was a bit of a crybaby in the beginning of the book.However, I loved the book, and highlighted several passages that were among the best of any I have read.This book would be a perfect solution for someone who has trouble reading straightforward self-help books. And a side benefit, is that I believe the messages sink in more if couched in a story rather than just presented as theories.Pick up this book today!"},{"Title":"The Traveler's Gift","review":"Not normally a fan of self-improvement \\"stuff\\", I was referred to Andy Andrews as a way to help coach my staff.

Andy Andrews is the first author I'm aware of to capture the style embodied in Og Mandino's masterwork, The Greatest Salesman in the World, and apply it to being a relevant human contributor in modern-day life.Mandino's work was about selling in the mid-20th century. This book is about how we use the days which constitute our lives.

It's a powerful modern parable."},{"Title":"The Traveler's Gift","review":"I am traditionally more apt to be interested in a strait forward motivational or principle teaching book.

I'm naturally a somewhat negative, perfectionist that's always looking to criticize. I hate that about me. The only thing I could criticize about this book was the over-use of the word, &quot;frowned&quot; as most every character did at one time in the book. Other than that, this book was amazing...I mean, literally amazing. I really and truly couldn't put it down. The descriptions of events made me feel as if I was standing there with the main character. Very much an engaging story with excellent choices for the historical characters.

In the spirit of Og Mandino, Andy Andrews outlines seven principles for successful living:1. The Buck Stops Here - Taking personal responsiblity2. Seek Wisdom - Search for understanding and discernment3. Be a Person of Action - Being a courageous leader4. Have a Decided Heart - Overcoming double-mindedness5. Choose Happiness - Possessing a grateful spirit6. Forgive others - The power of grace and mercy7. Persist - Perservering with faith until the endUsing historical personalities (Lincoln, Anne Frank, Truman) and events (Civil War, Holocaust, World War II), Andrews draws powerful lessons from the past to inspire today's reader. This is not a particularly \\"Christian\\" book. Believers and non-believers alike will see the wisdom and usefulness of the seven decisions and their related stories. While there is an undertone of faith, the book is not certainly not a \\"religious\\" book in the traditional sense.If you liked the Og Mandino collection, you'll really love this. An inspirational book with some meat to it. Hope you enjoy it!"},{"Title":"The Traveler's Gift","review":"Andy Andrews absolutely practices what he preaches. His little 'novel' cum self-help book has become widely popular since its introduction to the mass market in 2002. And there is a reason why. Aside from the personal biographical data that the author lived as a street person for a period in his life before he took charge and made changes in his philosophy that led to his rather startling success as a comedian, an advisor, an inspirational speaker and an author, Andrews knows how to capture the attention of his audience, lead them through his concepts of the Seven Decisions the Determine Personal Success in the guise of a novel, and follows up his service to mankind with variations of his original platform. Not only is Andy Andrews an inspirational writer, but he is also a successful marketer!The original book THE TRAVELER'S BOOK is so well known that repeating a summary is unnecessary. Very succinctly, David Ponder is at the end of his rope financially, emotionally, and physically when he happens to have an auto accident, an event which triggers a time travel where he meets and gathers advice from King Solomon, Harry Truman, Anne Frank, Abraham Lincoln, Colonel Joshua Chamberlain, Christopher Columbus, and the angel Gabriel, each of whom delivers him a message of how to enhance life. Those seven decisions are 1)The buck stops here: Adversity is preparation for greatness, 2) I will seek wisdom: I will choose my friends with care, 3) I am a person of action: I can make a decision and I can make it now, 4) I have a decided heart: My destiny is assured, 5) Today I will choose to be happy; I am the possessor of a grateful heart, 6) I will greet this day with a forgiving spirit: I will forgive myself, and 7) I will persist without exception: I will find way where there is no way.After his 'time travel' learning experience David Ponder wakes up and sees his world change because of the decisions he has made. Andrews wisely does not make his issues a hard sell. He simply tells a story, one that may be a little on the fantasy side, and allows the reader to absorb and relate to the transformation that takes place. It is very much to his credit that he does not preach in this book: Andrews shares in a warm and familiar friend manner and that makes a big difference! Andy Andrews believes in these decisions and after reading his book, it is difficult not to buy into his smilingly warm philosophy. Grady Harp, February 08"},{"Title":"The Traveler's Gift","review":"The Traveler's Gift is a book of success principles told as a parable. It has several points in common with many other books in the self-help genre. On the plus side, if you study and follow the principles, you will probably benefit. On the downside, it is not especially original and it's not a book you would read for its literary qualities. This book also has a certain spiritual and political slant that will appeal to many readers but will alienate others. The hero of the story is David Ponder, a man down on his luck who, after an accident, finds himself hurled through history meeting many famous (and a couple of not so famous) leaders and other heroic figures. This includes two American presidents, Lincoln and Truman, Christopher Columbus, Ann Frank and King Solomon. The spiritual slant is definitely Judeo-Christian, with the archangel Gabriel even making an appearance. I suppose this aspect of the book can be appreciated as a parable even for those who don't share the author's religious perspective. The political slant I found a bit more problematic. Anyone who has qualms about the conventional American interpretation of historical events such as the dropping of the atomic bomb on Japan, the noble motives of Christopher Columbus or the pure idealism of Lincoln and the Union during the Civil War might be distracted from the self-help aspect of the book and question some of the author's assumptions and historical sources. It may be that he is aiming his message at a very specific type of reader and is not concerned with such possible objections. This bias, no doubt, is reflected in the success principles themselves, which are mostly very macho and gung-ho (one notable exception is the section on forgiveness), with many military analogies . Still, the principles, which are called &quot;seven decisions that determine personal success&quot; are sound and well explained. If people follow the advice to be decisive, accept responsibility for their actions, and have faith in the future, they will almost certainly have good results. I was not especially enamored with the style of this book, but I know that it has touched and helped many people and I'm sure it will help many more in the future."},{"Title":"The Traveler's Gift","review":"Andy Andrews has written a thought-provoking book that will challenge you to be your best. The Traveler's Gift is written in story form which makes it fun to read and hard to put down. The incredible journey of the main character, David Ponder, is gripping and enlightening.

I would encourage you to read this book and give it to everyone you care about."},{"Title":"The Traveler's Gift","review":"I feel overly-qualified to exclaim this about The Traveler's Gift because I have kids, I was a kid, and I allow my inner kid to come out and play as often as she likes. When I first read The Traveler's Gift, I couldn't put it down until I had finished. I just had to know what happened to David Ponder. But when I finished it, my inner-kid pouted because she didn't want the story to end! So, we read it again! The Traveler's Gift gave us hope and my inner-kid declared, &quot;I never knew those people my history teacher talked about in school were really real people.&quot; And I realized that the people David Ponder visited were indeed, very real people. Real people with the same hopes and dreams and fears and doubts that I have. What they did with these hopes, dreams, fears, and doubt is what put them in the history books for us to study. The seven decisions that determine personal success that David Ponder receives from these real people are decisions that I can apply in my life. I just have to make the decision to do so. Reading The Traveler's Gift has encouraged me to do so."},{"Title":"The Traveler's Gift","review":"\\"The Traveler's Gift\\" is a life-changing treasure. The fact that it's entertaining, informative and inspiring is a fantastic bonus.Most of us will see a personal reflection in the main character, David Ponder.

While meeting seven extraordinary people from different times in history, Ponder gets to see what each person was thinking during intense moments of decision that helped shape the world. (Luckily, you get to learn from their unbelievable minds as well.)Of the seven visits, my personal favorite is a man of lesser fame, Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, who played a vital role in the North's victory in the Civil War.

The message seemed to be written just for me, although I'm sure everyone going through trying times will feel exactly the same way.I felt the author's choice of the historical figures was well thought-out and done well, and David Ponder's journey is one that anyone can relate to at any point in their lives.

However, at the time of check-out, I didn't realize what a jewel I had really found. Once I started reading this book, I couldn't stop until I had finished it. I laughed, I cried and I took to heart the motivating decisions for success that we all know and so often forget when pit against the everyday perils of life. This book is so inspiring that I have circulated copies for everyone in my family to read, especially when they're feeling down. It's not about one man becoming a success and, as one reader put it \\"building fancy buildings\\". What the book really emphasizes is believing in yourself and pursuing your goals despite facing adversity.

I found that the seven decisions very helpful for use in my own life and think that any troubled person could do the same.

They help teach him not to blame others for his problems, among other things. It is a great book that makes everyone think about things in a different way. I recommend everyone read this book, it's worth the buy."},{"Title":"The Traveler's Gift","review":"I purchased this audio cd & was completely taken away.

I don't want any of my goals to end up in an room where they never come to life. Overall, a very good audio book. I love audio cd's. You just get in your car & the road isn't so bad after all besides, radio sucks right now (smile)Sincerely,(...)"},{"Title":"The Traveler's Gift","review":"This book was entirely too predictable!! (Lost your job? Crash your car and go into a coma, everthing will be revealed, and your troubles will be over!). It hard to believe that Andy Andrews knows anything about or has ever experienced hard times. I was disappointed with the ending - after all the inspirational, quaisi-christian rah-rah, feel good 'decisions', finding out that David Ponder winds up as a successful business man is quite a letdown! (I guess money is the only true measure of a man in some circles). Also, the dialoge was very contrived and silly. As my 14 year old nephew said - that book sounds like it was written by Gildoroy Lockhart! If you really want to read a story about hard times (and real people) read 'Nickeled and Dimed in America'."},{"Title":"The Traveler's Gift","review":"Wish I would have had this understanding many years ago. This book was highly recommended to us and I can see why. My 12 year old also read it and loved it. This would make a great gift to a graduate. A book that would be beneficial to re-read every year."},{"Title":"The Traveler's Gift","review":"I love how Andy Andrews weaves historical stories into his book. It's also great to hear the book in his voice as he is a true storyteller. The Traveler's Gift follows David Ponder as he is transported through history to learn 7 decisions that determine personal success. It's an amazing story and one that, if applied, has the power to change things in your life.The 7 decisions are:The buck stops here. I accept responsibility for my past. I am responsible for my success. I will not let my history control my destiny.I will seek wisdom.I am a person of action.I have a decided heart. Criticism, condemnation, and complaint have no power over me.Today I will choose to be happy.I will greet this day with a forgiving spirit.I will persist without exception.Each decision is passed on to him by a historical figure and it's captivating to see how they play together.This is a book that I have read over and over again when I need the reminder, it's great to have the audio to listen to in the car. It's also one I have frequently given as a gift because I believe the message is so powerful."},{"Title":"The Traveler's Gift","review":"Both of my book clubs have enjoyed reading this book.

Especially if there going thru one of those many crossroads in life."},{"Title":"The Traveler's Gift","review":"\\"The Traveler's Gift\\" by Andy Andrews is a true spiritual fiction book. If your definition of spirituality does not need to include God, Jesus or any form of organized religion, you will enjoy this book. Although God is mentioned (and one of the characters in the story is an archangel), it is not absolutely crucial that you believe in Him in order to gain something from reading this. In fact, the \\"Seven Decisions That Determine Personal Success\\" do not even mention God or religion. They are short, simple one sentence edicts that are very self-explanatory when you take a moment to reflect on them.This book is about a man named David Ponder. At the beginning of the story David is in way over his head financially. The company that he works for has been struggling and things finally come to a head when David loses his job. Although his wife works and he does find a low paying job, his mortgage is past due, he has no savings and his credit cards are maxed out. On top of this, his daughter gets sick and needs an operation yet they have no health coverage. The last straw is when he is fired from his job after learning of his daughter's illness and he feels he has nowhere left to turn. As he gets into his car to leave the hardware store he had been working at, his thoughts are grim as he desperately racks his brain for a way out. He can't approach his parents or his in-laws as both had already helped out as much as they could. In his frustration, he chooses not to go directly home and face his family with the news. As he accelerates almost subconsciously, he begins to think that his family would be better off without him. His life insurance policy is still in force and that would allow his wife some time to find a good provider for her and their daughter. As he continues to accelerate, he hits a bridge covered with black ice, loses control and \\"With his remaining conscious thought, David removed his hands from the steering wheel and raised them as fists to the sky. \\"Please God!\\" he cried. \\"Why me?\\" And then...nothing.\\" His car has spun out of control and crashed.From this point on, David travels to seven different points of time in the past. These are not points in his past, they are from the past of mankind. At each destination, he meets one individual from history who leaves him with one of the \\"Seven Decisions\\" in writing. Each of them also gives him a valuable lesson to illustrate the importance of the decision in not only their own lives but also in the lives of others. The author uses well known historic incidents (the American Civil War, the Nazi Holocaust, World War II, etc.) and the well known characters associated with these events (Sir Winston Churchill, Abraham Lincoln, Anne Frank, etc.) in his fiction tale which allows you to relate with the difficult decisions man has had to make in the past.As happens in most fiction novels where the main character has a spiritual experience after an accident or incident (the concept isn't original), David returns to earth and sees how his life would have played out had he survived the accident. After he is given a glimpse of what his future could be like, he wakes up in the hospital injured but still alive. At this point he begins to wonder if his unearthly experiences were just a dream. As he is trying to remember everything that had happened and the seven decisions he had been taught, he finds something that proves it was no dream. Once this object is found, he knows that his life will be a success as long as he follows the guidance of the \\"Seven Decisions That Determine Personal Success\\".It would be a simple matter to list the \\"Seven Decisions\\" (in total they comprise only 41 words) and write a brief interpretation of each. The purpose of a review, and the reason for reading in the first place, is to convince the reader that the book is (or isn't) worth reading. It is possible to skim through the book and pick out the \\"Seven Decisions\\" and read the page or two devoted to each one, however the enjoyment of the story itself would be lost. More importantly, the lessons that each past leader from history had to learn also need to be learned and reinforced for the reader.I would strongly recommend \\"The Traveler's Gift\\" for anyone interested in spirituality and self-improvement. It is not a difficult book to read, and each of the \\"Seven Decisions\\" can be highlighted for easy reference. They are also short enough to be written on a piece of paper and carried in your wallet or purse if you wanted to keep them with you. Andy Andrews (I'm sure his first name MUST be Andrew) has done a great job of illustrating some fairly simple concepts that can be quite easily applied to anyone's day to day life. There is also a free reading guide that can be downloaded from the publisher for individual or group use which will strengthen his teachings. Please enjoy the book if you choose to read it, and you may want to read some of Andy Andrews' other books - \\"The Lost Choice\\", \\"The Heart Mender\\", \\"The Butterfly Effect\\" or \\"The Young Traveler's Gift\\" among others.Laughter and love,Rick Fess"},{"Title":"The Traveler's Gift","review":"Over the past few weeks, I've delved into Andy Andrews' writings: The Traveler's Gift, The Noticer, and The Final Summit. Andy wrote them in that order but I read them in the order of Noticer, Summit then Gift. Would I recommend following my reading plan? No, I would begin with Gift then read Summit.The Noticer has nothing to do with the other two so you could read it at anytime. In my opinion, it's the weakest of the three.But this is a book review of The Traveler's Gift, so let's get on with it.The book jacket proclaims: \\"Seven decisions that determine personal success,\\" a pretty big promise to the reader. And the statement intrigues enough for you to pick up the book and start reading. Then Andy delivers on the promise which encourages you to not only start but read to the finish line. When I read Gift, in racing parlance, I sprinted to the end.David Ponder, the traveler, faces troubles--he loses job, daughter needs surgery, money's not in the bank--and adds to his problems when he drives and his car hits an icy patch, slides off the highway, and plows into a large oak. The accident provides the impetus for his journey through time.In his travels, he meets seven historical figures including the archangel Gabriel. David Ponder converses with and receives a letter from each of the seven characters. Each letter gives a one-sentence description of a decision then elaborates on the theme.Andy does a marvelous job of using history and the lives of real people to illustrate his overall advice for living a life of purpose and significance. He elevates the human condition and energizes the human spirit by offering to the reader sound counsel for life's decisions.For me, the takeaway can be printed out on a single sheet of paper and posted on the bathroom mirror. I've typed out the decisions, seven concise statements to help focus a person's life. They'll hold a place of prominence to remind me daily of the choices I can make to shape a better future. The seven decisions are worth memorizing and then practicing.I find The Traveler's Gift a book worth having and sharing. Definitely a book I would give to others with great delight.God bless and good reading.--TomThe Traveler's Gift: Seven Decisions that Determine Personal Success"},{"Title":"The Traveler's Gift","review":"I was going through a slump when I first listened to an audio copy of Andy Andrew's best selling book, \\"The Traveler's Gift.\\" I threw it in to listen to on a road trip and after a few hours was totally caught up in this amazing story, (a series of actual historical events weaved around the life of a desperate businessman on the edge). The story yanked me out of the slump and poured fresh jet fuel into my imagination to dream big again!It captures you right from the start and keeps you engaged in a reamarkably entertaining and encouraging story of hope and positive power. Andy is a master story teller and after listening to the audio, or after reading it, you really will not be the same.Tip: I've given many copies of this audio book away as gifts to executives going through tough times and they have all shared that it was life changing as well. One fellow even said that the story saved his life... and I would agree. It's that good."},{"Title":"The Traveler's Gift","review":"I'll keep it short. I was given this book as a gift for my decision to make a big change and start a new career path by the school I'll be attending. I'm 32 years old, was in line to take over the family business but with the economy the business is failing so I needed to make a decision to stay with a sinking ship in hopes it recovers, or jump overboard. I decided to jump and start anew because my family is more important at this point in my life.Maybe the reaction to the book is really dependent on the readers personal situation. Were I given this book before I decided to switch career paths I might have looked at it a bit differently.I have to agree, the travels were amateurish, the messages while important, and true were portrayed poorly and in a corny manner. But it wasn't a bad read. It kept me interested almost the entire book. It was his meeting with Gabriel that really got to me, the conversation between the two was poorly written, and again pretty corny.That being said, I got the book free, so it was worth the read, but I don't think I would have gone out to buy it from the store, maybe I would have checked it out from the library.It was also a very easy read. I read maybe one book a year, and this book I read in three evenings."},{"Title":"The Traveler's Gift","review":"I absolutely love this book!!!I purchased this book years ago after hearing Andy Andrews on a radio talk show. Mr. Andrews was discussing his own struggles with personal success and why he wrote the book.

Everyone one I have ever given this book to has been impacted by it and passed it on to others.This book has the potential to really change peoples lives.

I thoroughly enjoyed The Traveler's Gift and am now working through Mastering The 7 Decisions. I found the history in the book educational as my history background is weak.

I high recommend The Traveler's Gift and am using it in my own work with people and writings, including my blog [...] Join the journey, read the Traveler's Gift and write how it helps you too. It is easy to connect our basic needs and how the folks in the story meet each of the needs too.

And this is definitely a self-help book, even though it's cloaked in a fictional tale.The protagonist is a middle-aged man whose life is in shambles. He's an executive who lost his position in a hostile takeover, and now he's scraping along at a minimum-wage job. He's overextended on all his credit. His wife is cleaning houses to make ends meet.Then his daughter gets sick, and he has no idea how he's going to pay for treatment. He's desperate. When his car skids out of control one night, he's almost hoping he doesn't survive the crash.But . . . he doesn't wake up in the hospital. He finds out that he's traveling through time.And in his time travels, he realizes he is destined to meet seven famous people throughout history, each of whom will impart to him a principle that will help him better live his life. He starts with Harry Truman. Then on to with King Solomon, and Christopher Columbus.The historical characters are wonderful and surprising. The principles are inspiring.It was a great, quick read - I even liked the principles. And usually I find that stuff pretty preachy.Now, there's one part at the end that's a little over the top.

Well-done Andy Andrews!!The story of David is so compelling. Andrews has a pretty nice writing style too, and I love the creativity here, meeting the figures from history and learning from their wisdom, but in a way that was truly inspiring. I blog in the self-development and motivational space and I get a lot of readers that just think this \\"inspiration\\" and \\"positive thinking\\" 'stuff' is not for them.... and they are simply wrong. They CHOOSE to believe they have no power, no will, no choice, and I love the no-nonsense way that Andrews clears that up!I took out a highlighter and marked several several passages, and my favorite was probably the episode with little Anne Frank.

He had no purpose.\\"Driving to nowhere in a patched up used car after losing his part-time job loading trucks at a hardware store, David Ponder stops and attempts to pray. With what he considers no result from his prayer, he starts to drive again with the thought of suicide in his mind, culminating in a head-on collision with a tree by the roadside.Though a half-dozen years older than Ponder, the protagonist of Andy Andrews' \\"The Traveler's Gift\\", I had instant empathy with Ponder and his predicament, having recently closed my business of twenty plus years due to the recession and taking an hourly position at a local factory to put food on the table. I thought to myself - that could be me he is describing.In a comma, Ponder visits seven historical figures that each impart a life lesson to him.

It was engaging, but not one of those \\"I can't bear to put it down\\" type of books. I do recommend the book, especially if you enjoy history and seeing what can be learned from various historical figures.

I was tempted many times to go right to the end and read the last chapter. There are two chapters that I will never ever forget. One is when the Traveler was speaking one of the Wise people about \\"the buck stops here\\" I think he said something like God does not always make us right choices, but he always allows us to make the choice right. Amazing to say the least. The second one is when the Traveler is with the angel Gaberial. Wow, cures to cancer, and everything else that is present, were simply a decision away. Never quit!!!

There are a fair shair of motivational words that are thought-provoking, but nothing with substance. The book is very \\"wordy\\" and the end is beyond cheesy and disappointing.

I read it because someone whose opinion I respect liked it. I found it to be the puerile fantasy of someone whose highest ambition is apparently to make a mark for himself by building big fancy buildings. The seven secrets of \\"success\\" are nothing new. If you find \\"the buck stops here\\" to be an inspiring revelation, you might want to read the book; that is one of the seven secrets. Success, to the author, apparently means worldly, materialistic success. After positing that David P. was to be the last person privileged to travel through time to gather wisdom for humanity, I expected something of a more spiritual nature. Not only is the message devoid of any originality, but the writing style is pedantic and plodding. If you have trouble sleeping, give this book a try."},{"Title":"The Traveler's Gift","review":"Sorely lacking in depth and complexity, The Traveler's Gift is an ambitious idea that falls short of satisfaction. Each visit had great potential, but fell flat from sparse handling.

(\\"the buck stops here\\" is a nugget of wisdom? please.)3. after plowing through endless silly dialogue and contrived situations, the ending was at least worthy of a good laugh. (it wasn't meant to be funny, it just was.) here's the punchline: after david ponder learns The Seven Clich&eacute;s...uh, i mean Decisions...by traveling back in time, we skip forward a couple of decades and discover that he becomes \\"successful\\" -- he's a filthy rich, egomaniacal, clich&eacute;-spouting motivational speaker!4. we're to deduce from this book that fine and good Christians should make lots of money, rigidly accept nothing but perfection from themselves and others, make lots of money, put on a happy face, and did i mention make lots of money? oh, and name everything after yourself or someone in your family.i'm amazed and saddened that there are obviously many who hold in highest regard this less-than-mediocre writing. a not-so-deep book for a not-so-deep audience."},{"Title":"The Traveler's Gift","review":"This is one of the worst books I have ever read.it's simply one cliche after another.teaching us who to admire, and who to be.i suppose the author meant well,but what the man goes through at the beginning of the book (such as being fired right as his neglected daughter needs her tonsils removed) is all a bit too contrived and predictable, really.and, besides. these seven messages don't really mean anything until you've experienced something that can help you understand them.your life improved with experience.and mistakes aren't a bad thing.i mean after all, as mr. 'harry truman' put it .. we aren't given the ability to make the right choice all the time, but we have been given the ability to fix our mistakes.so. learn from life, not this book.i hated it.i'd like to live my life without cliches. :)"},{"Title":"The Traveler's Gift","review":"While some of his seven decisions will lead one to spiritual peace, four of them will lead only to acquisitiveness, needing to succeed financially, and thinking that if you only think positively the world will be your oyster and if you don't become wealthy, you're a failure. Yet one of the mentors in the book is Anne Frank; where did positive thinking get her? This is the kind of New Age/ Christian motivational nonsense that leads to greed, disapointment, and self-blame if you don't \\"make it\\". The conclusion shows the protagonist watching a possible version of himself as an incredibly wealthy MOTIVATIONAL SPEAKER!! Talk about unintentional irony and self-mockery. This book adds nothing to the host of motivational, self-delusional, acquisitive clap-trap already on the shelves, written by people who make big bucks selling and reselling old myths that work only in a prospering first-world economy for financially driven people.If you're from a third-world nation, reading this nonsense will make you sick. If you're interested in personal growth, reading this nonsense will make you sick. If you're interested in improving the world, reading this nonsense will make you sick. If you're a spiritual seeker, look elsewhere, or better yet, practice simplicity, being present, and living a harmonious life. If you want to contribute to Andy Andrews's personal fortune, buy this book."},{"Title":"The Traveler's Gift","review":"I had to read this book for a positive psychology class, and I can't believe it has received so much praise. Not only is Andy Andrew's writing style like that of a third grader, but the main character travels back in time to learn lessons from famous people. Ignoring the fact that time travelling is already hard to swallow, the historical figures he meets are totally inaccurate. For example, David meets Columbus, who is portrayed as a child-like daydreamer, excited to discover \\"a New world!\\" Not only did Columbus slaughter the Indians, but every child knows he was initially looking for a route to the West Indies. Andy Andrews apparently never completed elementary school or he would have also known this. This is not the only historical problem, but one of many. You would think when writing a book he would research things first. Lastly, ignoring all problems with the story and focusing simply on the advice you still find problems. Some of the advice has been proven in studies NOT to work and at times the advice or David's actions contradicts things that have already been said. This book is a waste of time. Flip to any page and see that."},{"Title":"The Traveler's Gift","review":"I tried to read this book twice thinking that the first time I didn't give it a chance. I couldn't read anymore after the second decision. It's poorly written and there is nothing revolutionary about it. It's the same old self-help stuff regurgitated and the storyline is even worse. I feel cheated that I paid $1.29 for it at the thrift store."},{"Title":"The Traveler's Gift","review":"I don't know why I bothered to read this book. I could tell from the outset that it was yet another unimaginative self-help tome, but I perservered. Andrews makes the same pithy, unimaginative observations as those who preceded him: Dale Carnegie, Norman Vincent Peale, Deepak Chopra, Leo Buscaglia, Laura Schlessinger, etc., etc., etc.Don't waste your time and heaven's sake, don't waste your money!"},{"Title":"The Traveler's Gift","review":"All of a sudden Harry Truman is supposed to be the authority on truth?It's interesting that his claims are never questioned - sort of like religious faith.Lot's of religious undertones and unrealistic claims such as \\"every decision you make carves out your destiny\\".Yeah, what about the decisions your parents made?This book is full of the old nice, idealistic but unrealistic addages of work hard and you'll reap the rewards.Someone is not living in the real world."},{"Title":"The Traveler's Gift","review":"The Traveler's Gift: Seven Decisions that Determine Personal SuccessSeven Suggestions for writing meaningful books:1) Be original: It's a Wonderful Life and A Christmas Carol did it better. Andy Anderson is no Frank Capa or Charles Dickens.2) Make characters that are real, not cardboard.3) Get your facts straight. Christopher Columbus (Colombo) was an Italian who lived in Portugal and in Spain and probably did speak all three languages, but why would he speak Portuguese to an American on a Spanish ship? And why would Columbus claim to have special insight about the world being round when it was a pretty commonly accepted by the Renaissance? Fact checking is so easy with lots of good sites online.4) Don't underestimate your audience.5) Pick a genre, any genre. It is not good science fiction when there are too many logical fallacies. For example, the hero is wearing jeans into which he manages to stuff a scroll from Solomon, a leather pouch, various notes and pieces of paper. Fantasy? Then let's magically shrink these items. Inspirational? Not particularly, especially not this writing style.6) Life is unpredictible. The ending of any book should not be this predictible.7) Don't be preachy. The Ten Commandments pretty much covered the whole thing already, succinctly, without being preachy. Find a new franchise."},{"Title":"The Traveler's Gift","review":"First, let's get the seven decisions out of the way:1. The buck stops here.2. I will seek wisdom.3. I am a person of action.4. I have a decided heart.5. Today I will choose to be happy.6. I will greet this day with a forgiving spirit.7. I will persist without exception.These are certainly reasonable principles for living, and this book teaches you so. I don't have a problem with any of that. What I DO have a problem with is how the book teaches it, and what else goes along with it.The book is the story of David Ponder (uh, get, it, like he's supposed to PONDER something important), a typical middle-aged guy who puts his priorities wrong, loses all his money, and decides to kill himself. So far, just a touch melodramatic. But then, instead of dying, he finds himself being whisked away to visit six historic figures, from Solomon to Abraham Lincoln to Anne Frank, who each pass on to him one of the seven life-transforming decisions. They each not only co-operate with this bizarre process, but each pen a letter to him, each about the same length and sprinkled with the same type of late 20th century self-talk & affirmations that none of those people would have actually written.So far, you just have a overly stretched sentimental & incredulous metaphor, but one that is fairly innocuous and sometimes even moving. But things start getting weird with the last of David's trips: he meets the archangel Gabriel, who not only passes along the last principle but also says he is the last \\"traveler\\" that God has ordained to take this message and share it with others. He says that David is last in a line that has included Joan of Arc, George Washington, & Martin Luther King, Jr. Okay, that's just too much for me. But it gets worse: Gabriel then starts talking about a pre-Adamic ancient race that fell apart, and implies that the principles that David now has will save the human race from a similar fate.Okay, time out, boys & girls. Does the author really believe that there was a culture 30,000 years ago that was technologically superior to our own? Does the author really believe that these seven decisions are the key to the whole human race? It almost sounds like he is putting these principles above Scripture itself, that he is claiming divine revelation in them. The final blow is that David is given a view of his future, where these principles have not only made him fabulously rich, but hailed by tens of thousands as their spiritual benefactor.Bottom line: good principles, but WAY too much nuttiness in between for me."},{"Title":"The Traveler's Gift","review":"I bought this book based on the blurbs, and the fact that I enjoy an occasional Steven Covey - type read.This sure wasn't one of them.I started the book once and put it down after reaching the third point, thinking that maybe this wasn't simplistic pap written in an incredibly juvenile fashion, but that maybe for whatever reason my head wasn't into it.I took it on a recent vacation, thinking that with my mind unfettered, etc., perhaps I might be more open to what the book had to say.Wrong.This is a terribly written book, with a hokey, herky-jerky style by an author in need of some creative writing classes, spouting the most basic of tenants as if they are something new.For Pete's sake, basically this fellow took Zig Ziglar and put in a clever twist of the 'Time Bandits' style confrontations with famous characters. I noted with amusement that all of the characters basically had the same sort of dialogue. When Anne Frank has the same speech patterns as Solomon and Harry Truman, I know I'm reading a really bad book.Comparing this to Og Mandino is an insult to Og.This book is to motivational literature what 'Bridges of Madison County' was to fiction."},{"Title":"The Traveler's Gift","review":"Before seeing Andy Andrews at a seminar, I knew nothing about him. Having witnessed his lighthearted and soulful approach, I'm now a fan of his work. After reading 'The Traveler's Gift', I expect that you will be, too.The premise of the book goes something like this: David Ponder, a 46-year old formerly successful executive, is out of work and in dire financial straits - so bad that he can't even afford to pay for his daughter's urgent medical care.In a moment of despair, he has a car accident. But right before impact, he's transported to a dreamlike state in which he visits seven great individuals in moments of crisis - two US Presidents, an ancient king, a Civil War general,a European explorer, a family in hiding from the Nazis, and an archangel (what's a good story without an archangel?).Through these vignettes (which, incidentally, taught me some interesting factoids about U.S. history), Andy lays out the Seven Decisions. They are:1. The buck stops here. Adversity is preparation for greatness.2. I will seek wisdom. I will choose my friends with care.3. I am a person of action. I can make a decision and I can make it now.4. I have a decided heart. My destiny is assured.5. Today I will choose to be happy. I am the possessor of a grateful heart.6. I will greet this day with a forgiving spirit. I will forgive myself.7. I will persist without exception. I will find a way where there is no way.I don't want to give too much away, since part of the driving force of the book is the surprise of each subsequent historical encounter, and what the mentor has in store for the protagonist.Each story is well-illustrated with historical detail and quite poignant. Whoever you are, you're bound to see some aspect of your life reflected in the mentors' crises and decisions.Because of the novel's engaging nature, you don't feel as if you're reading a self-help book. I believe stories are far more effective learning tools than straight didactic media, and they stay with you far longer.Andy also has a more didactic book calledMastering the Seven Decisions That Determine Personal Success: An Owner's Manual to the New York Times Bestseller, The Traveler's Gift(which I've only skimmed), in case you learn better that way.With the consequences of the economic downturn on the minds of so many people, this novel is particularly timely.First of all, the crises the characters are involved in are on such a scale to make most of our challenges seem minuscule in comparison. This alone empowers the reader.Second, the Seven Decisions are just solid through and through. Just one of them - \\"I will persistwithout exception\\" - is enough to transform your life.The book's a quick and pleasant read - shouldn't take more than a Sunday afternoon to polish it off. The feeling after reading this book is one of liberation, peace and empowerment - that \\"you know, I can do this beyond a shadow of a doubt\\" feeling.I recommend it to anyone who could use a little boost of the spirit and a little oomph to get you moving. It's also beautifully designed and makes for a nice gift.-- Ali Binazir MD MPhil, author of 'The Tao of Dating: The Smart Woman's Guide to Being Absolutely Irresistible', the #1-rated dating self-help book on Amazon (4.9/5.0 stars)"},{"Title":"The Traveler's Gift","review":"\\"The Traveler's Gift: Seven Decisions that Determine Personal Success\\" is an interesting and engaging book that should be read with a grain of salt. Written with the shape and movement of a novel, yet pulled together as a \\"how to\\" book on personal success, Andy Andrews offers a set of \\"decisions\\" related to personal success in the wrapping of a story.In terms of reading this with a grain of salt, this book makes some sweeping statements that approach hyperbole in terms of personal decisions impacting hundreds of thousands of people for generations to come. While these scenarios are indeed possible and do happen, the reader is advised to contextualize such advice as possible future states as opposed to guaranteed outcomes.In addition, the foundation of this book incorporates a great deal of faith-based principles. This may be an attractor...or a detractor...for certain readers. I raise this observation in the interest of informing readers so that they approach \\"The Traveler's Gift: Seven Decisions that Determine Personal Success\\" with this base of knowledge about the content and context of this book."},{"Title":"The Traveler's Gift","review":"Many core truths woven into a fictional piece. An excellent read. The truths are timeless, as evidenced by the historic periods in which written."},{"Title":"The Traveler's Gift","review":"I had heard about this book and had it on my \\"to read\\" list for sometime but was in no hurry to purchase it. One of my friends had read it and told me how highly he thought of it, so I moved it up the priority list.I don't normally read fictional books, but this one was very good and I appreciated it when using it from a \\"self-help\\" growth book as the lessons the book provided I feel are extremely beneficial.The lessons, which are seemingly simple that we should all know and apply, I feel were made stronger and possibly more 'memorable' by having them applied in the form of the story that was told. The use of historical figures to deliver the individual lessons appealed to me as well.The book was a quick read and I found myself highlighting many pages for comments that really hit home. Statements such as \\"...while public opinion might sway back and forth, right and wrong do not\\" really stood out to me and I don't think it was necessarily because I filtered the line through the current political election mindset we're in.In the end, I feel that this should be part of everyone's \\"to read\\" list of books."},{"Title":"The Traveler's Gift","review":"The Traveler's Gift is excellent. Andy Andrews uses historical figures to demonstate the seven laws of success. The historical people that Andrews uses to teach the seven laws are for the most part common people who had been thrust into critical periods in history. One was a college professor whose courage in battle turned the tide of a war. Two were ordinary men who, against great odds, became President's of the United States. These two men were faced with the most critical decisions in the history of the Presidency.To find out how these ordinary people used the seven laws of success to make a mark on history, read this book. You will be thankful you did."},{"Title":"The Traveler's Gift","review":"This book, even though it is fiction, with true history mixed in for good measure was very inspiring! Everyone I had listen to it, loved it! I would like to thank the author and say it was well written, and the narrator read the words beautifully! Thanks again!"},{"Title":"The Traveler's Gift","review":"This book is characterized by some bold choices: what to leave out as well as what to leave in. The author tells the story simply, engagingly, mixing history and advice. And he also leaves out nuance and complication, but in this case that turns out to be a wise choice. Andy Andrews makes some strong assertions, staking out clear positions, and if he had muddied the waters, he would have ended up equivocating. And if he had done that, then the advice wouldn't have amounted to much. No, he's clear. And it's up to the reader to decide whether this account rings true or not. For me, it did. It's helpful advice that really hit home. My only complaint is that I didn't read this book years ago. But Andy would not let me get away with that complaint. Practice forgiveness, he'd say, starting with you! And happily greet the future--a bit wiser. And he'd be glad that when I finished this book I had a grateful heart."},{"Title":"The Traveler's Gift","review":"I love this book and the way Andy Andrews reads it because he's full of passion and also a great storyteller. My eyes filled with water as each decision which determines success was read. It's spiritually motivating and I highly recommend for everyone!"},{"Title":"The Traveler's Gift","review":"Seven powerfully simply lessons to make each day better. Each lesson is presented as part of a compelling piece of history, by an equally compelling historical character - easy to recall, easy to practice."},{"Title":"The Traveler's Gift","review":"This little book is brilliant, not only in its message but also in how it is presented. Andy Andrews combines history with inspiration and succeeds!The story is fairly simple: a man, dissatisfied with his life, finds himself in an accident and unconscious. During this period of immobility the dissatisfied man meets several people from history who relate the laws of success in various forms. The first rule of success is \\"The Buck Stops Here\\" (Harry Truman), second \\"I Will Seek Wisdom\\" (King Solomon), third \\"I Am A Person of Action\\" (Colonel Chamberlain, Civil War Hero), fourth \\"I Have A Decided Heart\\" (Christopher Columbus), Fifth \\"Today I Will Choose To Be Happy\\" (Anne Frank), sixth \\"I Will Greet This Day With A Forgiving Spirit\\" (Abraham Lincoln) and seventh \\"I Will Persist Without Exception\\" (Archangel Gabriel).The concept behind this book is unique and highly evolved. Andy Andrews has accomplished something here and after reading this book you may as well. Imagine the impact on one's life if we all had an opportunity to learn from the historical masters our life lessons. While such an experience will never happen in our actual lifetimes it is never too late to pick up a book and learn something new each and everyday. This is one of those books and it even includes a bibliography for further advice from those wise old owls not quite forgotten in the shuffle by a few who care."},{"Title":"The Traveler's Gift","review":"Andy Andrews stopped by Ramstein AB November 2003 and put on a free show for the troops.

I just recieved his new book in the mail &quot;The Lost Journey&quot;, and cannot wait to read it!"},{"Title":"The Traveler's Gift","review":"The Traveler's Gift is a gift of self-help combined with fiction, creating a unique novel in which we can learn to face the challenges of today through the people of the past who have had similar, though never identical, experiences.When David Ponder loses his job, his security, his confidence and his faith he is transported through time and space to learn one lesson from each of seven admired historical figures. Each lesson is part of the Seven Lessons for Success that promise to change his life if he learns and uses these lessons in his daily life.Although, the advice given is similar to anything you can read in many of the available self-help books, the presentation is unique in that we are able to imagine how each lesson was used in the life of the highly respected person teaching it.I would recommend this book to anyone who would appreciate some entertaining enlightenment after having asked the question we've all asked at one time or another...&quot;Why me?&quot;"},{"Title":"The Traveler's Gift","review":"It's fascinating how people so greatly differ in their evaluation of books, movies, etc. There are people smarter than I am who probably love this book, but I didn't.

I attempted to get past the writing to see if the author has anything interesting to say, but came up with nothing but cliches.

It was decided on for our women's book group, and even though I had a great deal of trouble stomaching even the first \\"decision for success\\" (i.e., the buck stops here, which basically states that you alone are responsible for where you are and what has happened to you in your life), I decided to plow ahead. But when I reached the chapter regaling Christopher Columbus as a hero and role model, I simply couldn't take it anymore. I don't know which is worse: using a thief/murderer/slavemongerer as an example of a successful human being; or basically implying that, well gee, even if you've lost a loved one to a random act of violence, it's basically their fault because they took all the steps necessary to put themselves in the place they were when that act occurred.Oh, and I forgot to mention: he counsels us not to associate with anyone who ever verbalizes a negative thought or to tolerate mediocrity or laziness in anyone, ever. Good luck with that! I believe we love our families and friends (and hopefully ourselves as well) despite the fact that we have occasional periods of imperfection. In this world of intolerance, it is simply unacceptable for a so-called \\"self-help\\" book to be preaching that very thing.

From the bad history (Uh, dude, Columbus wasn't the only one who thought the world was round. It was pretty common knowledge by that time) to the cliche'd storyline to the completely undeveloped characters... just bad writing all around. I'm just glad I checked it out of the library and didn't waste any money on it."},{"Title":"The Traveler's Gift","review":"Andy Andrews' book is a fast read. When you get the book, consider when you will start reading it. Once you start reading you may not want to put it down. Andy's Seven Decisions that determine personal success are great insights.

The story is engaging yet before you know it nuggets of wisdom have been imparted in your spirit and your mind set has changed. It helped me begin to see things differently during a time of encroaching depression."},{"Title":"The Traveler's Gift","review":"This book is a very easy read, it has great life lessons and is delivered very well i would recommend this book to anybody that want to improve their life!"},{"Title":"The Traveler's Gift","review":"I enjoyed reading the book very much. Easily read in one day.The best parts of the book are each of the 7 encounters with various characters who explain each decision to the traveller. The dialogue with each character is a very useful instructional method.The awkward parts of the book are the transitions between chapters - David reflects on the principle just received and POOF he's somewhere else in history. After the first time or two, you just read past it and get on with the next chapter.The ending is great - left to your imagination to fill in the spaces."},{"Title":"The Traveler's Gift","review":"Once again, a Christian author is out for the buck. Andrews has taken the route of writing a self-help book on getting people to take responsibility/control of their lives. Well, only several hundred have been written that are far superior to this one. The book is, as others have pointed out, very lite weight in depth and guidance. I was left with the impression that Andrews was down to his last few dollars and spat this book out ASAP to collect rent money. Using historical figures as examples of his 7 decisions, he produces a nice approach; the details are weak in nature and difficult to tie-in with each individuals current dilemna that we face each day. It would have been better to take examples from ordinary people today so that a frame of reference could be used and people could identify with and even try to finds patterns/correlations with their own lives.Alas, this will not happen. Christian self-help books like this are a mulitmillion dollar industry where a little thought brings the mighty shilling into the coffers of the publishers and authors with little effort, or original thought, on their part."},{"Title":"The Traveler's Gift","review":"If this is one of those books that some physcology teacher \\"assigns\\" you to read for a later book report, forget it. Put the book back and drop the class. It's just doesnt fall into that kind of catagory. This book is an extension of that old saying \\"You make you're own bed, so sleep in it\\". If you're not a deep thinker and don't consider spirituality (I don't neccessarily mean religion, so chill) anything more than a magic act, then don't bother picking Andys book up. Its not you or for you. Having said all that, I liked it. It had some solid words (the 7 decisions thing) to live by that are not anything more than you already know in your own gut. He just brings it all to the surface a bit so you can digest the meaning and perhaps try it yourself. I cant call it a self help book. I've read several of those and most of them get thrown out with last nites pizza box. This is a simple, short page turner that you could knock out in a couple of evenings. No big words or long speeches. But dont read it that quick. Do a couple of chapters then put it down for a day or two.He uses the \\"time travel\\" vehicle as nothing more than an example for you to hold on to while the message is getting told. Yes, we all know time travel likely doesnt exist. Thanks for the reminder. So many of the early reviewers must have just got through reading The Davinci Code or something. Exactly what were you expecting, a bottle of fix-it pills with each copy?? If you're looking for a little refill of your already learned life lessons and what they should mean to you and others, this book is great. Its not about what you did wrong. Its about what happens now and later. This is not a review of YOU birth-to-presentday. Its not a textbook, or like I said, a self help book. Its not religious or anything like that. No thee's thou's or thou arts. You're not getting brainwashed and they dont ask you to send money to a P.O. Box in Florida at the end of the book... Its written for those of us living in the western world who can't seem to believe in ANYTHING without seeing it, smelling it or touching it or having an unretouched digital internet image as proof of existence. Its just a little bit of walk-around enlightenment for your every day use. So go deep. You can't lose here. The book only costs 10 bucks and I got mine on sale."},{"Title":"The Traveler's Gift","review":"Don't listen to the negative comments. You will find at least one gem from this book to propel you into a more positive and powerful direction in your life. Although it's a very quick and easy read, don't underestimate the profoundly powerful lessons. After you read the book and you still feel it adds no value to your life, then you were just not ready to receive the messages. As the old saying goes, \\"When the student is ready, the teacher will come\\". Just reading about the room filled with things and people that never will be is worth ten times the price of the book. This book coupled with Steven Pressfield's \\"The War of Art\\" make a dangerous combination to battling mediocrity."},{"Title":"The Traveler's Gift","review":"What an enjoyable and easy book to read.

This is one book that I will purchase for all 4 of my kids; it is that good! It is written in novel form but with a strong message. I also purchased the audio version and what I like is that I can select a specific track and listen just to the 7 different decision messages which are written in the form of affirmations. This book confirms my strong opinion that out minds are just like computers, you put garbage in and you get garbage out. This book gives the reader the opportunity to put quality in and get quality out! The messages are so powerful to me that I created a wall chart with all seven decisions on it and it is posted prominently over my desk where I can review it every day!

I look at it in the same light as an insprirational &quot;Seven Habits of Highly Effective People&quot;. Andy ties each principle with a character that you can readily identify with. He masterfully ties the character and the principle together. I plan to give this book to many of my friends."},{"Title":"The Traveler's Gift","review":"After reading reviews on the book, I went out and bought it. I was able to put the book down, in fact, I was able to to it three times. While I am sure many will get take away some useful tidbit, overall, I found the book lightweight in its seven decisions - no real life changing motivation. The one part I did enjoy was learning the story of the Civil War hero, if only from the historical point of view.I found myself comparing the book to Og Mandino's book, The Greatest Miracle In The World&quot; which I found to be a wonderful read. The Traveler's Gift style resembles what Og Mandino often did in his books - tell a story and incorporate life lessons. I'm wondering if anyone else feels the same way.A nice book but not worthy of all the hype it has been receiving."},{"Title":"The Traveler's Gift","review":"It's a boring little fable with a stale, over-used theme. There have been thousands of other books just like it and there's no defining quality that makes Traveler's Gift stand out among others of its ilk.David Fonder is standing at the edge of the cliff, ready to snap. He's ditched from his job, his daughter's sick, no money, he's mad at God... (Hmm... Bruce Almighty...) He's (wow) hit by a truck. God sends him on a journey to meet several historical figures. They each have a piece of wisdom to hand to him. The trouble is, with better writing even this over-used method of 'revealing wisdom' could have worked better, but the writing is just about standard. Nothing to really complain about, but nothing that makes you want to read more.I especially didn't like the way these 'advices for success' were put. Like most other self-help books, the author doesn't choose to explain, proove, and engage his readers intelligently; instead, he sounds like an Old Testament God, booming &quot;Thou shalt do this.&quot; He could have used some subtlety. Of course, if you like the genre of ever-growing self-help books, you'll probably like this one too.Oh, and if you're not Christian you might be troubled with this book because it's written from the viewpoint of a Christian author. You might be troubled even if you're Christian. I didn't like the way the author was all proclaiming and declaring God's will. God's complex and should be taken as such, but the way he puts it you'd think He's a business corporate CEO.In an age where wisdom is rare and hard to find, I can understand why this book became so popular. It promises wisdom, success and courage in exchange for a few bucks and a few hours. The thing is, though, one book can't and won't change your life. People are slowly and constantly changed by what they read and watch, and one book may modify the reader's thinking process significantly in one area, but it will not grant wisdom to a fool and courage to a coward. A book that tries to do so is trying for too much. And a reader who wishes for a wonder-book of that kind is hoping for too much in exchange for too little effort. Wisdom can be found in small quantities in almost anywhere; novels of great authors, well-made movies, the words of a friend.... Look wide and deep, don't end your search with just one self-help book."},{"Title":"The Traveler's Gift","review":"This book was given to me as a birthday gift, so it's not my normal reading fare, even though I do like self-help books. The story here is hokey: a guy (David Ponder, can you begin to see the symbolism yet?) is down on his luck, just lost his job; he has no money, a beater for a car, and sick kid; he just wants to end it all. (Can you feel the cliches coming?) Well, as his car spins out of control on a slippery bridge, he goes on adventure in which different (real) historical figures (like Abraham Lincoln or Anne Frank) each give him a message about living successfully.Why do self-help books always have 7 messages? Anyway, the messages are helpful reminders of living the good life, stuff that probably wouldn't hurt anyone to be reminded of: Remember the buck stops with you; be a person of action, happiness is a choice, that sort of thing. There are no startling revelations, and the book and its messages struck me as self-evident and simplistic. One of the real advantages of the book is that it is short. So, if you are ever stuck in an airport, doctor's office, or somewhere else with poor reading material and you need to kill a little time, you might even enjoy it.

It is a very quick and easy read, and connected with my soul so intensely that I wept more than once; aware that God was speaking to me through it. I have never had such an experience in reading any other book, other than the Bible; and trust me; I've read a few.

It is a short read( 1-2 hours), but it has profoundly deep insights and a cast of characters that would seem almost would be seen as almost too good to be true (Presidents, explorers, an archangel, etc)if the plot and conversations were not done exceedingly well. Incredible book with simple, but highly relatable storyline delivering a powerful message in a way that inspires, convicts, and drives you to excellence. I recommend this book to everyone, no matter who they are, who enjoys a good story.

I can hardly wait for Andy Andrews next book! *****"},{"Title":"The Traveler's Gift","review":"The Traveler's Gift is a fascinating combination of self-development principles and captivating fiction. How great is it to be able to learn wisdom from King Solomon and forgiveness from Abraham Lincoln? The author takes us on not only a historical journey but also one of self-discovery.Do you enjoy reading about self-development, history, time travel and/or a just want to escape into a good book? The Traveler's Gift; The Seven Decisions That Determine Personal Success by Andy Andrews has all that and more. There are great lessons for personal success, insights into significant historical events and a look into what it may have been like talking with inspirational figures. All this is blended with a well written \\"I can't put this book down\\" story.I found this book by accident and was very pleasantly surprised. I literally couldn't stop reading. The Traveler's Gift is a unique twist on the usual self-development lessons. The seven lessons of personal success became vivid and \\"real\\" in my imagination. Stories are a perfect way to learn how to apply abstract concepts to real life. I found myself saying, \\"You know he's right, I really should do that / be conscious of that more often.\\"The central character, David Ponder was at a personal and professional crossroads in his life. An auto accident takes him back in time to converse with the likes of Christopher Columbus, Anne Frank and Harry Truman. Each inspirational historical figure has a life lesson to impart and success advice to share. It's a history lesson and self-discovery journey all rolled into one. When David awakes from the accident the world is changed and life has more purpose and greater meaning. The basics: When the going gets tough, the tough get going. David Ponder is just like all of us - searching to live a fulfilled and meaningful life.I was fascinated by this inspiring story. It wasn't preachy - it was entertaining. I've never read any quite like this, a self-development book that teaches so much more. I was literally transported back in history each time I read about one of the seven personal decisions. It was evident that the author did his history homework and historical research.If you are a fan of Og Mandino, as I am, you'll enjoy this book. It is written with an Og Mandino flavor.I read the paperback book although I understand the audio is exceptional. Andy Andrew's newest book is Mastering The Seven Decisions.Five stars from me - highly recommended. Sit back, relax and prepare to learn more about yourself with a little history thrown in for good measure. If I'm gushing I apologize but I really enjoyed The Traveler's Gift!"},{"Title":"The Traveler's Gift","review":"I have been a professional motivationl speaker and have taught leadership and character skills to thousands of people. I have read and re-read hundreds of &quot;life skill&quot; and &quot;inspirational&quot; books. Andy's book kept my attention and inspired me to tell as many people as know about it because of his refreshing and creative method of relating age-old, classic themes. The majority of my work is with young people and I appreciate Andy for this book because of his use of historical figures and stories written in a way young people can relate to and extract more from than just their political, religious or historical implications. Don't just buy this book - invest in it, digest it, weave its messages into your daily life and share it with others!"},{"Title":"The Traveler's Gift","review":"From the description of the book, I thought I'd enjoy reading it and it actually started out well. However, as I continued, it started losing credibility quickly. To choose to bestow the unique gift of time travel on a weak, insipid and poor planner took away any enjoyment of the \\"travel\\" for me. What did David Ponder do that Abraham Lincoln would be honored to meet him?In addition, it's easy to list out any number of self-help statements...I could list a couple dozen in a jiffy...it's how one uses them in their particular situations to meet the challenges of life. In this regard, the author completely failed to relate the seven decisions to actual circumstances of David Ponder's life in becoming the big \\"boulevard-named\\" success he portrays in the end. All I could think of was this image of a televangelist bilking money out of people repeating the same old story of the seven decisions in front of a gullible crowd. I am sure the author intended to write a powerful story that would move people into incorporating the essence of his words into their everyday lives. However, I think he came across as an uninspired simpleton writing for the uneducated masses. I gave it two-stars because I like the overall concept of the book."},{"Title":"The Traveler's Gift","review":"My boss at work knows that I devour books, and dropped this one off at my desk a short time back... The Traveler's Gift: Seven Decisions that Determine Personal Success by Andy Andrews. I read it straight through yesterday (it's short), and the first thing I'm doing after this review is ordering my own copy. This is a book I'll not quickly forget...\\"Gift\\" is a personal improvement book that's written in story form, similar in nature to a parable. The main character, David Ponder, is 46 and has hit rock bottom (or so he thinks). Deep in debt, fired from a menial job, and concerned over a sick child, he considers taking his own life so that the family can collect on the insurance policy. As he comes to after the car wreck, he finds himself transported back in time, into the office of Harry S. Truman during the Potsdam conference. Truman is the only person who can see him, and Ponder's appearance was expected. Truman's job is to present Ponder with a written \\"decision\\", a statement that David must internalize and live out. Once the paper is read, Ponder is moved on to the next person and time. This time travel happens seven times, giving David 7 pieces of wisdom that will change his life if he lets them. Before he's brought back to reality, he's offered a glimpse of the future of his home town, a future that was possible with the seven decisions that Ponder internalized then shared with the world.The cynical reader will likely see this as a bunch of happy talk fluff that isn't realistic. But I would counter that it's more realistic than most other philosophies and self-help books you'll ever read. The people used in the story are perfect matches for each of the learning points, and you realize that a single decision *can* have consequences that reverberate down through history and time. And the people who make the decisions are often ordinary individuals like you and me. The only difference is that they *made* the decision rather than accept the status quo.The path to success isn't easy, but it's a matter of decisions you make on a day-to-day basis. Andrews captures this truth in a style reminiscent of Og Mandino's writings. I loved this book, and will be revisiting it on a regular basis..."},{"Title":"The Traveler's Gift","review":"I wanted to like this one. Really. All my life I've been fascinated by science fiction--especially time travel stories. Not only that. It promises to deliver a Christian message as well.David Ponder, age 46, has just been laid off from his high-powered, well-paid executive position. A part-time, minimum wage job is all he can find. Not only that, his young daughter falls seriously ill and he cannot afford the necessary medical care. Feeling like a total failure, he attempts to commit suicide in his car.So begins his adventure. Transported back in time, he meets prominent people from the past whom he encounters at critical points in their lives. Such personalities as King Solomon, Abraham Lincoln and Harry Truman--to mention only three of the seven--give David Ponder seven principles, referred to as \\"seven decisions that determine personal success.\\"The format of the story is somewhat reminiscent of the old TV series from the 1990s, Quantum Leap. In this novel, like the series, the \\"hero\\" is moved from one place in time to another, against his will and out of his control.I don't fault the story, however, because of this similarity. The same could be said of many novels and movies. And I like the fact that, unlike secular time travel stories, this one attempts to deliver a positive, Christian message. After all, isn't that what makes them \\"Christian Fiction?\\"So, what's not to like?While I found the story to be predictable in both action and message, that's not my primary criticism. It's the \\"Christian\\" element with which I find fault.For many years before reaffirming my faith in Jesus Christ, I was an avid reader of \\"self help\\" books--fiction and non-fiction. And that's what I found this to be. I can't recount the number of times I've read books that tell the reader to \\"pull yourself up by your own bootstraps\\" and \\"take control of your life.\\"Some of the \\"seven decisions\\" in this book are \\"Today I will choose to be happy,\\" I will persist without exception,\\" and \\"I am a person of action.\\" Excuse me, but I've \\"been there; done that\\" or, rather, I've tried that and failed.To me, the focus is entirely upon what WE should do to control our futures rather than depending on the Holy Spirit. Rather than depend on my own strength and on repeating affirmations, shouldn't I admit my total inability to run my own life, surrender every aspect of that life to our Heavenly Father, seek His presence, and ask Him to lead me?Consider the apostle Peter. He was always making dramatic pronouncements about serving the Lord yet denied knowing Him after His crucifixion. Yet, when empowered by the Holy Spirit, this same man became a powerful advocate and follower.You may well disagree with my conclusions. Many others have done so, considering the prominent people who have given glowing praise to this novel. But you should not depend on their opinions, nor on mine.Read it for yourself and come to your own conclusions.Brother Bill writes for [...]"},{"Title":"The Traveler's Gift","review":"This is a business parable, but really more of a life parable.

Rather than letting your circumstances provide you with reasons for reacting to life and letting difficulties turning into personal failure, Andy Andrews preaches what some call an internal locus of control. No matter what happens to you, it is up to you to take charge and do something about it. Book is about David Ponder. He is a middle-aged guy with a great wife and a daughter. Like so many people who have been in a comfortable job for decades and then lost it, he finds his life spinning out of control. Unable to get a job anywhere close to the one he had before, without health insurance, and getting fired for merely using the phone to talk with his wife about his sick daughter, he wonders if his family wouldn't be better off with his life insurance than him. Driving recklessly fast, he spins out on some ice and wakes up talking to Harry Truman, then Solomon, and so on until he wakes up with his wife and daughter worrying over him in a hospital.The seven lessons are very good affirmations to meditate on every day of your life:1) The buck stops here. I am responsible for my past and my future.2) I will seek wisdom. I will be a servant to others.3) I am a person of action. I seize this moment. I choose now.4) I have a decided heart. My destiny is assured.5) Today I will choose to be happy. I am the possessor of a grateful spirit.6) I will greet this day with a forgiving spirit. I will forgive myself.7) I will persist without exception. I am a person of great faith.After each of his encounters in history, David reads a short essay on each of these lessons and, of course, we read it, too.My own take is that this is a superb book for teenagers just deciding who they want to be in life, young adults who want to sharpen their path, and adults who want to get on a different and better path to getting control of their life.No, this is not profound art. However, the lessons can have a profound affect on your life and help you enjoy more, achieve more, and bless the lives of others more.Reviewed by Craig Matteson, Ann Arbor, MI"},{"Title":"The Traveler's Gift","review":"Its rare I ever read fiction, but when this was sent to me I set it aside and then one night I started reading it while in bed and I was hooked.Perhaps because we are in a time when so many people are losing their homes, getting hours cut back at work, dealing with the stress of everyday life, or as in my case, dealing with the death of my husband.This is why I will recommend the book to anyone, especially men who are dealing with job issues, home issues, housing concerns and thinking they have no where to turn.The author does an excellent job of using a story to show how in the darkest hour when we think we are lost for good and things seem to be getting worse no matter how hard we try, that help does arrive.Lives are healed and made whole. And we can have a better life."},{"Title":"The Traveler's Gift","review":"Read THE TRAVELER'S GIFT by Andy Andrews, a self-helpbook that effectively uses fiction to hold your interest . . . it isthe story of a typical guy--David Ponder--whose troubles beginwhen he loses his job.When his car crashes, he then begins a journey that willremind you of the movie, IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE . . . but whatmakes this tale different is that along with way, Ponders encountersvarious historical figures who each teach him a different rule of success.The first is \\"The Buck Stops Here\\" (Harry Truman), followed by \\"I Will SeekWisdom\\" (King Solomon), \\"I Am A Person of Action\\" (Colonel Chamberlain,Civil War hero), \\"I Have A Decided Heart\\" (Christopher Columbus), \\"Today IWill Choose To Be Happy\\" (Anne Frank), \\"I Will Greet This Day With AForgiving Spirit\\" (Abraham Lincoln), and \\"I Will Persist Without Exception\\"(Archangel Gabriel).By the time Ponder is ready to return to the real world, you will havefeel that you will have learned something from his travels . . . and thoughyou just know that all will turn out well, the ending will still warmyour heart.There were several memorable passages; among them:* David put his energy and focus into providing a home and lifestylein which his family would prosper. But his work at the plant, whileit did provide a living, never seemed to provide a life. As Davidtold a friend one day, \\"I'm working so hard to live where we wantto live that I don't actually get to live there.\\"* Truman paused. He pulled out his handkerchief and wiped his brow.David's head was hanging, his chin on his chest. \\"David, look at me,\\"the president said. David's eyes met his. \\"The words It's not my fault!should never again come from your mouth. The words It's not myfault!

I believe it is a great starting ground for those who feel they are at a point in their lives where change is indefinite. Through my experiences with the book I have learned that in our lives we will all make choices, both good and bad. These choices lead to actions and actions lead to results. And it is the results part that so many people find difficulty dealing with. I learned that I control my life and all my results, both good and bad. If you want better, well then go out and find ways to make it happen. Each charachter that you are introduced too is there with a definitive message that can mean so many things to different people, but always comes down to one overall meaning. You are in control of your life and we all have the ability to be leaders and start creating what it is we desire and deserve.Fortunatley for me this way of thinking has lead me to a unique lifestyle business where I apply these principals to my everyday journey.One is only defeated if he chooses to quit.http://www.swcapitalholdings.net"},{"Title":"The Traveler's Gift","review":"This was stimulating at a level that was not very profound, but probably good enough for most people who have not had the benefit of analytical thinking."},{"Title":"The Traveler's Gift","review":"This book covers all the ingredients for one to be successful.

The novel focuses on David Ponder's journey to wisdom and insight following the loss of his career and his desire to live. After a car crash he has a transforming experience of \\"meeting\\" Abraham Lincoln, Anne Frank, King Solomon, Harry Truman and Chirstopher Columbus at the major crisis points in their lives. Each of these historical giants impart their wisdom to David, who returns with the courage to take responsibility for his own choices, seek wisdom, take action, and choose to be happy by developing an attitude of forgiveness and persistence in the face of difficulties. This light reading allegory provides much prescient insight for coping in the fearful world we face each day. Andy, a popular comedian who has come from homelessness to touring with the rich and famous ( from Garth Brooks to Cher) and entertaining four presidents has been quite successful with this his first book. Good reading for any trip!"},{"Title":"The Traveler's Gift","review":"This review addresses the cd-audio edition of the Traveler's Gift. This work is probably better appreciated in the print form, as sometimes the story was a bit slow-moving, and other times, one wants to linger over some of the points (specifically, the seven decisions).Also, the narrator often sounded like he had just a little bit of excess moisture in his mouth. I kept wishing he would pause and swallow before continuing!All in all, a very sweet, thought-provoking little story with a nod to \\"It's a Wonderful Life.\\""},{"Title":"The Traveler's Gift","review":"I'm not typically a reader of motivational books, but I enjoyed this book, eagerly turning pages to find out who the protagonist would meet next and what wisdom would be imparted. I previously knew of Andy Andrews primarily as a comedian, but The Traveler's Gift shows that there's substance behind his smile.

We've all been told these or very similar things since before grade school.Andy uses an old and quite effective teaching technique. He wraps the information in a story.

The fact that it's entertaining, informative and inspiring is a fantastic bonus.Most of us will see a personal reflection in the main character, David Ponder. All the cards seemed to be stacked against him and just when you think it can't get any worse ... the adventure begins. While meeting seven extraordinary people from different times in history, Ponder gets to see what each person was thinking during intense moments of decision that helped shape the world. (Luckily, you get to learn from their unbelievable minds as well.)Of the seven visits, my personal favorite is a man of lesser fame, Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, who played a vital role in the North's victory in the Civil War. (I get the chills just thinking about it.)Andy Andrews has got to be one of the most brilliant inspirational storytellers of this generation. \\"The Traveler's Gift\\" is a definite \`must' read."},{"Title":"The Traveler's Gift","review":"The Travelers Gift is not just a novel, it is also a self- help book.

The myths used to illustrate the principles he was seeking to teach don't accomplish the goal. Take for example his visit with Lincoln and the discussion with Grant. Grant was an alcoholic. Lincoln is portrayed in this scene as a &quot;win whatever it takes&quot; man, i.e., all the other generals had let him down and Grant could do no wrong. Historical ambiguities are lost in this &quot;dream state&quot; we're given in this broad sweep of people, places, and events. It's shallow! I was annoyed by little things throughout the whole book. The &quot;teacher&quot; who turned the whole of history around by one action in the civil war....is another example. Bogus! This guy is the only one who was right and took the right course of action? According to this author. I think more research and a few more rough drafts are in order."},{"Title":"The Traveler's Gift","review":"I hate to pan books. I really wanted and tried to like this book.

It is painfully so which is why I titled this Ouch. Please pass this book and get something better if you want motivational try The Four Agreements or Touching Spirit Bear."},{"Title":"The Traveler's Gift","review":"While this book occasionally delves into the occult, it is all presented so well and as a metaphor that nothing about it seems absurd. David Ponder is a man with many problems. Despite all his hard work and dedication, his company has been the target of a successful hostile takeover and he was immediately dismissed with no compensation. The years of working long hours that took him away from his wife and daughter now appear to have been wasted.For years, he has been the victim of a slow financial drain and they have reached the end. He takes a job at a hardware store at low pay and when his wife calls him to let him know that their daughter needs an immediate tonsillectomy, he is fired for spending too much time on the phone. They have no health insurance and no money to pay for the surgery. At that point, David gets in his car and speeds down the highway contemplating suicide. He receives an assist from a patch of black ice and skids off the road and collides with a giant oak.The next thing David knows is that he is in a room in Potsdam, Germany in 1945 and he is speaking to a man wearing thick glasses. After a brief conversation, he learns that the man is Harry Truman and Truman has just made the decision to drop the atomic bombs on Japan in an attempt to end the war quickly. This is but the first of seven visits with prominent people throughout history that David engages in. When he is \\"on location\\", while David can interact with objects, only the prominent person can see and communicate with him. From his conversations and a paper that he receives from each person, David gets a new and significant insight regarding his situation and how he should live his life. It takes some time, but David finally understands that his life is still worth living and he has the potential to do great things.Although the Archangel Gabriel is the last \\"person\\" that David visits, this is not in any way a religious book. Gabriel appears so that there is a context for David seeing the great potential for the future of humanity in general and David in particular. This lack of religious overtones is one of the strongest aspects of the book, as it is about what the individual can do for themselves as there is no reliance on prayer or divine intervention.My wife is a counselor of people with substance abuse problems and she uses the messages in this book in her conversations with clients. She considers it one of the best books in the positive messages area and I have to agree."},{"Title":"The Traveler's Gift","review":"The Travelers Gift is not just a novel, it is also a self help book by Andy Andrews.

Persistence pays off, however, when you finally run across a book that has the potential to change people's lives. Such a book is THE TRAVELER'S GIFT by Andy Andrews. I stress the word \\"potential\\" because there will always be some who will never glean knowledge when it is presented to them all gift wrapped in glitter paper with a flowering satin bow.This is indeed not the first book along this same or similar theme. In fact, there are many that come to mind, all of which possess a certain richness to them and all of which give the reader pearls. What the reader chooses to do with them is another question entirely. There will always be readers, and subsequently, reviewers, who will say things like, \\"there's nothing new here\\", and these are the unfortunate ones of which I speak. Perhaps they have read similar volumes before, the sad truth is, they could read a hundred more and never get the gist of a single one. They search for some magical formula that will transform their lives simply by ingesting the words, but all the success books in the world will accomplish nothing if not applied. This one is surely no exception, but the message is definitely here if the reader is ready to receive it.While the basic premise may have similarity to a Stephen Covey or even Napoleon Hill, Andrews' book is presented in a very unique way. The story features a man struggling to make ends meet, keeping his head above water, when suddenly life comes crashing down upon him. With the weight of the world upon his shoulders, in a moment of desperation, our main character even contemplates ending his life, thinking his family to better off without his failures dragging them down.An instant before a crash, our subject embarks on an incredible journey. A journey that forces him to examine what can be done to put his life, not just back on track, but on a new course that will transcend even all that he ever dreamed of.This is a quick and easy study of changing your life by changing your mind. The information is here to make anyone a success. What readers do with that information is up to them. Follow these seven steps and the sky is the limit. Read the book and complain that there is nothing new here and you will be right. There will be nothing new here for you."},{"Title":"The Traveler's Gift","review":"This is a must read book!

I learned about different people in history in a really inspiring way.

That was one that I didn't even have to think about whether to get rid of or not... it was staying in my library. I plan to read it again, which I have a hard time doing. Being riddled with ADD....

The way the story is told keeps you reading...I couldn't put the book down once I started it!"},{"Title":"The Notorious Rake","review":"I loved this book. I generally don't read romances but have recently become addicted to Regencys, especially Mary Balough. This is my favourite so far. Lord Edmond Waite is completely surprised when he and Mary, Lady Mornington are thrown into each other company during an evening at Vauxhall Gardens. Forced to take shelter during a thunderstorm, Lord Edmond is overtaken by Mary's passionate lovemaking; he would never have expected such a thing from the very prim and proper bluestocking. He so awed he decides to make her his mistress. He's even more shocked when a week later he's fallen in love with her. Despite Mary's protests Lord Edmond pursues her voraciously even though she looks at him and his rakehell lifestyle with disgust, the only things she likes about him are his lovemaking (which isn't enough) and his aunt.When they find themselves in each others' company at the aunt's houseparty Edmond attempts to make himself completely disgusting to Mary but finds he needs her emotional support when confronted by the family after fifteen years.This novel has great sweetness, humour and sadness at its core as well as Balough's wonderfully descriptive storytelling."},{"Title":"The Notorious Rake","review":"Probably my all time favorite Balogh novel (and I've read just about all of them). The hero broke my heart.Left to bear his family's grief and guilt over a horrible tragedy in his youth (think along the lines of the movie &quot;Ordinary People&quot;), the hero set out to prove he was every bit as terrible as they said he was. He is a rake who despises himself for being a rake. When he meets a lovely and passionate widow he sees the dream of love and family again within his grasp. . . but he cannot allow himself to reach out and take it. Only by healing his past (and having his father and brother accept their share of the responsibility) can the hero hope to have a future."},{"Title":"The Notorious Rake","review":"The Notorious Rake starts quite surprisingly with what looks like the climax of a story: Mary Gregg, Lady Mornington, blames herself for letting her terror of thunderstorms push her into Lord Edmond Waite's arms one night in a secluded shelter at Vauxhall. Mary hates everything about Lord Edmond: he is a luscious, lewd, mocking and spiteful libertine, a rake of the worst kind, whose reputation makes him the black sheep among the ton. He's still accepted among his noble peers only because of his wealth and title, but everyone in London despises him, most of all Lady Mornington. She, on the other hand, evolves around the high ton; she's famous for the literary salons she organises every week, and she managed to keep her reputation intact despite the rumours of a liaison she might have had with a married male friend.But on the night of Vauxhall, everything changes for Mary. Her unexplainable but nonetheless very real physical attraction to Edmond revolts her. And at first, when Edmond pursues her for days without taking no for an answer, the reader is bound to hate Lord Edmond Waite and his tactics that not any better than those of a stalker's.And therein lies the strength of this story: the hero is a truly tortured character, who first offers to us the image he gives to the world, and whose true self is progressively uncovered both by the heroine and the reader, one step at a time. For Lord Edmond is a very tortured and loveable character, who put love to a far corner of his being long ago and decided not to bother with the painful emotion any more.Lord Edmond's character is no doubt fascinating. He's mocking, vulgar and obnoxious most of the time, but the mask is progressively pulled off his face as he keeps pursuing his quest for Lady Mornington's body (but despite what he claims, is it just her body he's pining for?) and she valiantly fights her attraction to him.This story is one of two heroes that everything seems to keep apart, but shows us that reputation are deceitful and that every character is a lot more complicated than what they appear.Yet another Mary Balogh keeper!"},{"Title":"The Notorious Rake","review":"Cleaning out my closet this week, I came upon an old paperback copy of the Notorious Rake by Mary Balogh. I thumbed through it and ended up sitting down and re-reading it (for the fourth or fifth time) It really is, I think, one of her best novels. The book's romance and conflict isn't contrived between the two main characters. You can understand and believe the attraction between the two and also understand why they both would resist such an attraction.The resolution was particularly sweet with Mary helping to bridge the gap between Edmond and his family. Very good book!"},{"Title":"The Notorious Rake","review":"Lady Mary Gregg is what is normally called a bluestocking: she dresses plainly, doesn't care for balls and parties, and prefers to spend her time discussing literature, philosophy and so on. She's far from the type of woman whom the known rake, Lord Edmond Waite, would be interested in - and yet, stranded alone together in Vauxhall Gardens in the middle of a thunderstorm, they discover each other in the most intimate way possible.How could this have happened? This is exactly what Mary asks herself once she's home again. She hates men of Lord Edmond's type; he was a rake in the worst possible sense, and she was well aware that only a few months earlier he'd been involved in a scandal with another woman, who had apparently almost run off with him while engaged to another man. But Mary is terrified of thunderstorms due to a childhood trauma, and she knows that she can't exactly blame Lord Edmond for making love to her; in her terror, she had pleaded with him to do it. But it will never happen again. He is not her type. He is everything she despises... and yet. And yet she is powerfully attracted to him, as she has never been to any other man. Not even Marcus, the Earl of Clifton (hero of A Counterfeit Betrothal), who was her close friend for so many years.As for Edmond, still stinging from Felicity's rejection, he is equally determined that Mary is not his type. Despite the fact that being with her haunts his dreams, he knows very well that he doesn't belong in her world, and he can't imagine her wanting to belong in his. And yet he is still attracted to her: Mary, the mousy bluestocking, a type of woman he tells himself is beneath his notice. He can't seem to stop himself coming up with excuses for them to meet, and when they do, he can't prevent himself baiting her just to see her shaken out of her studied politeness.No, Edmond and Mary are worlds apart... or are they?

Slowly, fifteen years pass and Edmond Waite's soul continues to decay. He survives his endless days by living life as a womanizer, a gamester, and a drunkard. Only his wealth and rank ensure his limited acceptance by the ton.Lady Mornington, Mary Gregg, is a lady in every sense of the word. She is a widow and has arranged a comfortable life surrounded by class, both, in her choice of friends and her lifestyle. Mary Gregg, also, has laid with Edmond Waite much to her chagrin.This expos&eacute; is how Mary Balogh opens \\"The Notorious Rake\\" and in doing so, the author wins her reader's full attention. Now, Mary Gregg tries in vain to rid herself of Lord Edmond Waite's recognition; thus, Balogh releases her story's target.Lord Edmond Waite first made his appearance in Balogh's \\"The Trysting Place.\\" Here the author has taken his character and examined his obnoxious behavior -- behavior shaped from guilt, rejection and grief.The character of Mary Gregg appeared in \\"The Counterfeit Betrothal.\\" Balogh's fans know these three books as the Waite Series: \\"The Trysting Place,\\" \\"The Counterfeit Betrothal,\\" and finally \\"The Notorious Rake.\\" They are Signet Regency Romance books, out of print, difficult to find, and are pricey.\\"The Notorious Rake\\" is very good, demonstrating Mary Balogh's growth as a writer with each release. Here she is in complete control, her writing, her character development, and her storyline are top notch causing her reader to crave for more. Hunt down these little treasures; they are well worth the effort.Grace Atkinson, Ontario - Canada."},{"Title":"The Notorious Rake","review":"Back before authors began writing multiple-novel 'family series' romances, Balogh occupied the throne formerly held by the great Georgette Heyer as Queen of Regency romances, relatively short (by today's standards) novels. She eventually emerged as the best of the post-GH authors (although Elsie Lee gave her a real run for the money with \\"The Nabob's Widow\\", an amazingly good and funny novel if you can ever find a copy).Although \\"The Notorious Rake\\" is perhaps a hair below her best work \\"The Temporary Wife\\", mostly because Lord Edmund Waite is more repellant a character, in the space of a few pages Balogh skillfully flips your emotions in reverse. Suddenly you find yourself rooting for Edmund and even liking him - a trick that few authors can pull off well, even in these days of overly lengthy tomes and endless panting sex scenes.This is Balogh at her best. It is much more difficult to write a short novel or story than a long one. She hit a peak with \\"Rake\\" and \\"Wife\\" that she didn't reach again until the creation of the Bedwyn family novels. If you can find either of these two early stories at a reasonable price, get them! I believe, BTW, \\"Temporary Wife\\" is being reissued in 2011, but I haven't heard that \\"Notorious Rake\\" is due the same treatment. I wish they would; it deserves a new audience."},{"Title":"The Notorious Rake","review":"This is a fabulous short Regency by Mary Balogh and it is right up there with my favorites by her! Boy, can she ever write great dialogue and create complex, three-dimensional characters!Lord Edmond Waite and Mary Gregg, Lady Mornington, disliked each other without ever having met, solely based on each other's reputations. Edmond is a notorious libertine--a vulgar, mocking rake who is only barely accepted by the members of the ton despite his wealth and noble birth, and Mary is a respectable widow famous for her literary and political salons and intelligent conversation. When chance strands them alone together in the Vauxhall gardens during a sudden storm, Mary's pathologic fear of thunder and lightning leads to intense intimacy and the two become lovers for the evening.The next morning, Mary, more than a little appalled by her own behavior during and after the storm, wishes to forget the whole incident, but Edmond finds himself unaccountably intrigued by the passionate woman he has discovered beneath her prim facade and begins a relentless pursuit (to Mary and her friends's horror!)Both Mary and Edmond are *excellent* characters--complex, conflicted and so real. I particularly loved the way that they are swept along by a passion that they fight against and cannot intellectually explain to themselves. Edmond's history is so well done and brilliantly fleshes out his character--transforming a seemingly heartless rake into a very deep, vulnerable man. The secondary characters, particularly Edmond's aunt, Lady Eleanor, and his sister-in-law, Anne, are great.Bravo (once again) Mary Balogh and thank you for a wonderful book!Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Notorious Rake","review":"This is a memorable regency romance by one of the contemporary masters in the genre. The publisher really needs to re-release it! Balogh, once again, takes the reader on a journey into the soul of a troubled man who has finally met a woman he can't psychologically or emotionally dismiss.Although Balogh employs many regency plot staples in this book (an outrageous, unrepented rake who is not what he appears to be; a respectable widow unacquainted with the delights of passionate sex; a Brit-twit family estranged by tragedy) she, as always, infuses them with a freshness and vitality that make you feel you're encountering it all for the first time. Balogh's amazing when she's at the top of her form and in this one, she's there. Well worth the out-of-print price--and then some!"},{"Title":"The Notorious Rake","review":"I was a little disappointed at first with this book that I had heard such great things about. It's on so many \\"best rakes\\" list. Why I ask? I did not see it. First of all, the hero's sex appeal was hampered by all the woman that did not want him. The heroine despised him after using him for sex in a thunderstorm, he was used a then jilted for another man by the heroine of the former book that he was still pining for, and woman did not even seem to enjoy sex with this rake. I thought rakes were supposed to know how to do the deed? The main reason why he became so obsessed with the heroine in the first place was because he was so surprised at how much she enjoyed sex because women usually don't. He's a rake of the highest order and he's never met a woman that enjoyed sex? He's obviously not doing it right, lol.The heroine's animosity towards him did not help matters either. He relentlessly chased her like a stalker while she relentlessly abused him with lines like these;\\"You make me sick\\" she said. \\"Physically sick. Nauseated. Are you so perverted that you like to pursue woman who can vomit just at the thought of you?\\".I can't remember a time where I felt sorry for the rake. feeling pity for a rake is never a good sign. Your supposed to want to bash them over the head with something...remember? Maybe, just maybe if he didn't stalk the other heroine inThe Trysting PlaceI would have had a little more respect for him but it seems he did the same thing to that young lady without success, and now since Mary's milkshake brings all the boys to the yard he's after her too. The one good thing I can say about the book is that the hero was very witty, which I loved, and MB's refined writing style was prominent, so it wasn't all a waste. Anyway I knew pretty early on that this book was not going to go on any of my \\"best rakes\\" list.I was in a fit of pique at how the hero was being treated by the heroine at the time I wrote the top part of this review and I wanted to give this book 2.5 stars and was ready to dnf it, but I found that I couldn't put it down because the writing itself was so well done, and the hero and heroine had some really great banter between them and it was fascinating to behold. Although I still wouldn't say the hero was the best portrayed rake ever, I cannot deny that this was an engrossing read. MB made me forget all the things that bothered me at the beginning of this review. I didn't want to erase it because it's honestly how I felt at the time, but I definitely had to change my 2.5 stars to 3.5 after finishing the book. Don't write reviews when you are peed off, lol."},{"Title":"The Notorious Rake","review":"I paid nearly $24 for this book used here on amazon and I don't regret a single penny. I loved it! As far as reformed rake books go, this is one of the very best. The five stars reviews are right on the mark, so I won't summarize. Balogh does a great job with this one, although I wasn't sure there for awhile. In fact, the first one hundred pages or so had me seeing red and ready to give a scathing review. Really, Edmund is a downright scoundrel and not very likable till this point and I wouldn't have blame Mary if she pulled out a gun and shot him -he's that bad. But eventually he does a turn around, well sort of. The beauty of this book is in the subtle details. Its the push and pull of emotions between the two characters. And I have to disagree with the previous review citing the ending. I am very satisfied with the resolution between Edmund and his family. I really don't know what more could have been expected, everyone was to blame and everyone is given forgiveness -just move on.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Notorious Rake","review":"As a Balogh lover, I really enjoyed this one. The action comes fast and furious early on. The rake is so despicable at times that one has to wonder how it's going to work out. A lot of fun!"},{"Title":"The Notorious Rake","review":"I can't really praise this book. I've enjoyed a number of Mary Balogh's short Regencies, but this one is sub-par.I thought the heroine was very under-written. Her main characteristic seems to consist of being afraid of thunderstorms, and, to keep telling the hero \\"No No No\\" (when in her heart & other body parts, she's \\"Yes Yes Yes\\"). Very shallow.The hero is drawn a little more interestingly, but I thought the reason for his estrangement from his family was very poor.(SPOILER ALERT - SPOILER BELOW:)The men in his family get the hero drunk on his 21st birthday. He goes riding, and his older brother breaks his neck trying to jump a fence after him. And the family calls the HERO a murderer, and have nothing to do with him for 15 YEARS? Crazy! Much later in the story, the hero's other brother and his father, FINALLY admit that they have some culpability in the oldest son's death, but that wasn't enough for me. Not for 15 years of their unjustified hatred of the hero, and given his pain over the situation (which is the main reason he becomes a careless rake).(END OF SPOILER)Finally, the connection between the hero & heroine doesn't seem logical. It is only based on physical attraction at first, and no later depth gets attached to it. While reading this story, I kept waiting for something richer to emerge --perhaps the heroine becoming a healing force in the hero's miserable life as a rake-- but this never came. The book was getting tiresomely repetitive by the end, despite an interesting beginning (which merits my 2-star rating).Only recommended for die-hard Balogh fans."},{"Title":"The Notorious Rake","review":"I too have read almost all of Mary Balogh's novels and am convinced that she will never be able to top this book. The hero broke my heart, in a good way. I cried through most of it, again in a good way. And the ending was enormously satisfying. I am now turning to her older novels in hopes of finding a similar gem. An Unacceptable Offer is almost as good so I would highly recommend that one too!"},{"Title":"The Notorious Rake","review":"Balogh at her best is absolutely brilliant; at her worst, she is still pretty damned good. This book, I feel, joins the ranks of her very best. At first the premise seems foolish: a respectable widow afraid of thunderstorms forgets herself and spends the night with a rake. But you have to trust Balogh to spin this into such a heartbreakingly lovely tale that it remains imprinted upon your consciousness weeks after you have finished reading the book.I leave you with the first few eloquent lines of this story and hope you are able to procure a copy of this not so very hard to find but rather expensive when you do book (nothing, I assure you, would induce me to part with my copy):\\"The thunderstorm was entirely to blame. Without it, all the problems that developed later just would not have happened. Without it she would never in a million years have taken him for a lover.But the thunderstorm did happen and it raged with great ferocity for all of two hours, seeming to circle London instead of moving across it and away. And so all the problems developed.Because she had spent the night with him.Because of the thunderstorm.\\""},{"Title":"The Notorious Rake","review":"Mary Balogh sells well. Some of her books I like. Many people like every thing she writes, but I find you have to expect to come across the odd rape, perhaps the hero and heroine indulging in premarital intercourse in the first few pages. A little too dramatic for my tastes. This one does have a father calling his son (the hero) a murderer following the death of his brother with a family reconcilation after x years and a hero who goes out of his way to be unpleasant to people."},{"Title":"Weston town common: A history","review":"I'm a law student in the United States, and I was looking for a good rundown of Japanese law.

Nathan opens the doors on what it feels like to be a young boy with no father or father figure around. He longs for a father and has no idea what a man's place in life is. He was raised by women. Strong women. He watches the actions of his friends fathers to learn.Nathan has a big heart. As I read his story from boy to man I couldn't help but feel love for this brother. He certainly went through some things.I liked that he studied the many religions out there. Nathan showed great strength fighting the system for his children when their mother would take off for days and not return. While she was out using drugs Nathan held it all down.With thoughts of abandonment and suicide, trying to find his place in life was no easy task. Lewis states that he struggled to write this book four times but had to stop because it became to painful. I'm glad he found the strength to finish it. Nathan is a survivor. His story has now become a useful tool for many young boys with no father. A great guide into a child's mind for single mothers. This book is all heart. Nathan's journey gives hope.

The perfectly placed poems and poetic wording throughout this book really allows the reader to feel what he was feeling, and see what he was seeing. It is not often that a book touches on so many different issues people can relate to, and this book does just that. Some subjects discussed are the struggles of being a single parent, being depressed and suicidal, having a troubled childhood, finding a religion, and finding love. Subjects discussed are deep and may seem dark, but the story is filled with constant hope and determination. I recommend this book to everyone I know who can appreciate a piece of art, such as this.

HEARING VOICES, A MEMOIR examines a young boy's life as he becomes a man. The reader witnesses how he overcomes the setbacks of his life and how he finally learns to listen to his own voice.As a young boy, Nathan Lewis lived in a household where his mother took care of the family, which included him, his younger sister and a stepfather. The stepfather, the only real father he knew, was a victim of the voices in his head, schizophrenia. Nathan's strength came from his mother, grandmother, great-grandmother and his aunt. These women persevered through life's trials and tribulations and were able to live life to its fullest. However, their strength could not keep Nathan from following the wrong path of gangs, drugs and sex. As he transitions into a man, Nathan struggles to find himself, come to terms with his biological father abandoning him, and depression. He learns to use poetry and his search for religion as coping tools.In order for Nathan to grow, he had to learn how to be a man. After several failures and with the birth of his children, he recognizes his need to find his true self. Nathan begins relying on his own strength to survive and make a prosperous life for his children.HEARING VOICES, A MEMOIR is an interesting story of finding one's self. I was really engrossed in Nathan's search for a religion. He studied, he experienced and read about many different religions. His experiences led him to find that the Christian church was hypocritical. He eventually turns his back on the church, but he continued to study religion. Today, he has just ventured back into the church and is taking it one day at a time. Although the story was a quick read, I found the author only gave us a surface understanding of his life. I wanted him to delve deeper into the whys of his actions so the reader could have a better understanding of him as a person. I found the poetry interwoven throughout the story as the real tellers of the truth about his life. This was a good story that just needed a little more meat to help the reader to grasp an understanding of the author.Reviewed by Cashana Sealsof The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers"},{"Title":"Texas Heroes: A Dynasty of Courage","review":"Mona Sizer Personalizes Texas History and makes it especially captivating. She develops the personalities of ordinary, and some famous, men who all performed extra-ordinary feats of courage, as she describes the events and circumstances that formed the History of Texas. Each chapter is dedicated to a brave man who made a real impact on the events of his time. She progresses from the 1700's in the Land of Tejas (Texas Indians) as part of the Spanish colony of Mexico to the involvement of Texans in World War II. The diversity of the heritage of the gallant men she accounts is impressive; French, English, Black, Irish, Mexican and German. This book is not only a lesson in courage and History, but also a pleasure to read.We have all heard of the Alamo, the Texas Rangers, the Civil War, WWII, etc. Ms. Sizer brings to life twelve men, some you probably know and others you never heard of, but who you will come to know. One thing is for certain, all of their stories will bring you excitement and inspiration.This quote summarizes Mona Sizer's admiration for these men. \\"The need for a hero arises when civilization is in jeopardy. A special man of steel and sterling silver must step forward from the ranks of softer, gentler golden men who have become too civilized to fight for themselves.\\" She also emphasizes the very name 'Texas' impies a tradition and example of unusual courage.This world is currently in a war against radical Islam. This is really a conflict between civilizations, where some Muslims feel History has unfairly passed them by. They want to even the score by elliminating those (killing all if they could) involved in Western society through acts of terrorism. They are not associated with a particular nation state, and therefore, a different kind of enemy than we have faced in the past. There are also many in our government, and other governments around the world, who definitely typify the softer, gentler golden men of our time. Is it any wonder that George W.

It was produced by the \\"Missions Advanced Research and Communications Center\\" a ministry of \\"World Vision International.\\" Usually one encounters a small booklet written by some Christian missionary who discusses his efforts in some small community for 25 or so years; usually, not much depth besides reproducing many quotations from the Bible. Unlike that, here, about 150 Christian missionary leaders got together to scratch their heads and pondered how to improve the ways as to how Christianity could be spread amongst Muslims. Paper topics: The Gospel and culture; the Cross-cultural communication of the Gospel to Muslims; the Muslim convert and his culture; Dynamic equivalence churches in Muslim society; Power encounter in conversion from Islam; New theological approaches in Muslim evangelism; Resistance/response analysis of Muslim people; Islamic theology; Popular Islam; the comparative status of Christianity and Islam in Sub-Sahara Africa ...in North Africa...in the Middle east...in Turkey..in Iran...in the Sub-continent...in Southeast Asia....in China....in Russia; the current status of Bible translations in Muslim languages; an overview of missions to Muslims; a selected bibliography for Christian Muslim workers; the development of new tools to aid in Muslim evangelism; tentmaking ministries in Muslim countries; food and health as partners of Muslim evangelism; the Christian approach to the Muslim woman and family; glossary.

I can say the school, people who founded it and the education I got there were all excellent. I feel fortunate to have attended this school!But, me and my family never believed in Sai Baba as God or Avatar. We always thought of him as a fraud and scam artist.His devotees were excellent people and served others with love. They tried to follow many of his teachings in their lives and to worked to propogated good values etc. Especially, his message of universal truth in all religions.After almost fifteen years I stumbled upon this book and couple of other books on him. These were written by initially skeptic people who started believing in Sai Baba after some personal experiences. I bought and read them eagerly as I was trying to see what I would feel now after all these years. For three days all I did was read these books. I was so curious and excited, I almost wanted to believe everything I read.This feeling did not last long as I found some very interesting sources on Web giving a different account or explanation of some of the miracles and events described in the book.If you are curious and want to know about Baba please not only read this book but also the other sources to get a complete picture and then judge for your self.Sai Baba's Miracles: An Overview Edited by Dale BeyersteinYou can read this book online athttp://psg.com/~ted/bcskeptics/sbmir/db-book.htmlGood Luck with your journey!!I gave three stars to this book for excellent description of Sai Baba from a devotee's point of view."},{"Title":"Sai Baba: man of miracles","review":"Apparently the standards of what constitutes 'godhood' have slipped a bit since the good old days.

He claimed, for example, that Hitler was persuaded when he made the final decision to invade the USSR by the influence of Sri Aurobindo of India! But Hitler had planned this for many years, and the invasion plans had been in full operation since the end of the Battle of Britain. A man who claims such absurd things cannot be trusted not to have been duped by his own desires to experience miracles and more.

If readers are interested in knowing more about Sai Baba and understanding his purpose, this is one of the great books which must be read.

It shows you how to find the missing link of your life and it helps you smile even in the face of trouble. It is a very remarkably touching book.

The many for whom the mysterious, marvelous and miracles of life hold interest and appeal. 2. Searchers after spiritual light who have not yet found what they seek 3. For most ardent and experienced Sai devotees , who can know more about him.SAI BABA : MAN OF MIRACLES: Author: Howard MurphetI was glancing in B&amp;N over the Eastern thoughts. Then as I was going through I found this book.I was interested in this book because I have had some interest in ESP and miracles. I have wondered how some people rise above the natural laws and perform miracles.It is not that I had not heard about SAI BABA. I had heard about him now and then.But I had never thought much about him and I let it pass.Since past few months I started hearing more about SAI BABA and his miracles. So I picked up this book and I am glad I did it.The author starts with this book. He had gone to INDIA and before that he had not heard about BABA. This was in 60s. At that time some Indians he met had told him that yogis in INDIA existed at earlier times but now the country was into materialism and not much into spiritualism. But as he was travelling India and questioning to himself if there were really any good yogis still around. - He somehow was guided to SAI BABA.Now this author was skeptic and did not just believe what others said. So he thought he would observe BABA carefully and figure out the truth.At the beginning the author describes SAI BABA and his early childhood and what he was as a child.And then how he became know n as BABA and how he is the incarnation of Shridi SAI BABA.The author himself is puzzled when BABA performs miracles in front of him and he cannot believe it. He witnesses this again and again numerous times. The most common being his Vibhuti, which he brought out many times.Still the author is puzzled and finally he comes to get personal visits with BABA and comes to know him Better. Then he realizes that a mere magician could not be performing such feats and that he was not being hypnotized.He suggests a couple of reasons for this thing. First of all BABA does not do this thing for popularity but he does it for his disciples, to help them.He always gives discourses in spiritual topic and does bhajans etc. And his miracles are not like producing commercial stuff. But mostly he materializes Vibhuti for disciple, lockets with gods pictures etc.If I go one describing his miracles there is a lot to say.But it ranges from simple things to surgical operations and even saving lives.The author also interviewed many of his disciples and there are people from all walks of life in that .He talked with few Indian scientists of that time and some top diplomats and heard their comments and heard the miracles that they had witnessed.Then the author in one chapter mentions the te4aching of SAI BABA. Actually his life actually is his mission his work and his love for disciples and humankind.And finally the author talks about SAI BABA as an Avatar, as a Reincarnate of Vishnu.As Krishna had mentioned in Gita&quot; THAT at the time when the world needs me I will come/&quot;Did he come as SAI BABA this time? I found this book very interesting, touching and uplifting.Maybe some of you have heard about SAI BABA and maybe some of you have even had the opportunity to meet him.I have had faith on him from before but lately my faith has increased in him.If you do not believe in miracles and don't believe in SAI BABA this is a nice book to read and judge for yourself. Of course judgement is a personal opinion.But I would like to hear from anybody who has some interest in SAI BABA and I would really enjoy to hear from someone who has personally met him.Nirmal GhimireMy email is Go_java@yahoo.com orNirmalnature@yahoo.com"},{"Title":"Sai Baba: man of miracles","review":"This book has a lot of personal experiences about Sai Baba, and focuses a lot on the many 'miracles' he has performed.

As such, this is a good book to start with.I spent ten days at his Ashram in India and saw him produce Vibbuthi, a holy ash, the most common of his 'miracles,' many times.

If you are in this situation, this book is perfect for you. You will have the opportunity to know what is so special in this Man, which millions of people consider as God.Sai Baba claims that he is omnipresent (i.e. present everywhere at the same time, all the time), omniscient (knows everything which happens in this world and beyond, past, present and future) and omnipotent(capable of doing anything; things happen at his will). He claims that he is God. Is He an arrogant fellow who is extraordinarily intelligent and has managed to fool and take advantage of all his followers, or is He the Creator, God Himself?You will be able to answer this question when you have finished reading the book.

To fund his quest for beauty, he uses his invention to perform illegal cosmetic surgery on aging starlets, models and other celebrities.His life is changed when he meets a young woman and realizes that she can become the basis for his masterwork. Manipulating her into agreeing to the necessary surgery, he begins to work on her, ultimately creating a look so stunning that it creates an instant media sensation. Her celebrity is a personal triumph for Jaime, a confirmation of his artistic genius. The only problem is that he hasn't been as careful as he should have been, and his work is starting to come undone...D'Amato's novel is a stunning indictment of modern society's obsession with beauty, a horror novel that confronts readers with their own prejudices and forces them to question what Naomi Wolfe has labled \\"The Beauty Myth.\\" The commentary on our culture that American Psycho could only pretend to be, Beauty points out how impossible society's standards of beauty are to meet and reveals how hollow these standards are when examined closely.

It is as strong as steel by weight and has incredible strength under tension.Villegas has a deep understanding for the special type of bamboo he used, Guadua Angustifolia, which is native to his Colombia. He treats each project organically and executes them flawlessly.He helped build the largest bamboo structure in the world which was tested by German Engineers for the WORLD EXPO in Hannover in 2000.

After this incident where we are introduced he has encounters with his father, mother, and sister, who make him want to go to school out of fear that he will end up like them. Charles then decides that he will go to school and make a life. The rest of the book is about his journey through becoming a man, the good and the hard times, and the life he intends to lead.The author, Elisabeth Kyle, is a great writer. She told the story of Charles Dickens in a way that just seemed to sweep you up into the past as though you were living in that time and just watching Charles.

The book has all the elements of a good book in it, including sex.Without giving any of the plot of the book away, I can say that McMurtry makes some compelling, touching and prolific statements about what it feels like to operate on the fringe, as an observer.

The main character, Danny, was fabulous and exciting. McMurtry always has you flipping to the next page. Danny is looking for his life and it takes many road trips to find it. On one of these road trips many crazy things happen and you will be hooked after the first ten pages. My favorite thing about this book is how McMurtry let's you see what Danny's thinking; I always want to hear what he is going to think next. Another highlight is how he can't keep his pant's zipped up with every woman that he meets. There are other great characters in the story such as the first woman that steps into his life named Sally. Sally is a real jerk and uses Danny for just about every thing a man has. Then you find out the rest. Don't be expecting the happiest of endings either. This is no ordinary McMurtry book. He out did himself with this one. If you like McMurtry's writing I highly recommend this book. If you like realistic books with a little adventure this is the book for you."},{"Title":"All my Friends Are Going to Be Strangers / Terms of Endearment","review":"i have absolutely no idea why this book is rated 4 stars.

I won't go into the details of the book, but rather give an overall impression. The book starts out with some fairly racy scenes but is well written so the reader doesn't feel too self indulgent. The book would be a major hit with any 18-26 year old male. The book is written from the viewpoint of a writer in his 20's. Sex, drugs, aimless wandering all included. The women portrayed are stereotypical and one dimensional but entertaining just the same. The reader must keep in mind that these women are being written from the viewpoint of a 20 year old depressed man. The writing is clear and concise- very well written. However the ending leaves you hanging."},{"Title":"All my Friends Are Going to Be Strangers / Terms of Endearment","review":"I loved this novel, and I'm overjoyed, on reading the other related novels about Danny's bunch of friends, that Danny did not actually drown himself as I was afraid he had done at the end. None of his relationships with women work, mainly because his gentle heart has no boundaries, and he is pretty much chronically depressed like many other great artists--and poets. If Mr. McMurtry ever got tired of writing novels, he could always become a poet. The last chapter somehow reminds me of the best music of Counting Crows and Steely Dan, and the poetry of Antonio Machado. The prose is breathtaking.Also in this new edition, the afterword by Raymond Neinstein alone is worth buying the book for. He himself has written a book of criticism of Larry McMurtry's novels. Not to be missed!"},{"Title":"All my Friends Are Going to Be Strangers / Terms of Endearment","review":"This is my favorite book of all time.

He doesn't nourish his body with the right foods (just candy bars and junk food), trys to stay drunk most of the time, doesn't bathe, doesn't honor his friendships, sleeps with his friends wives. For awhile he tries to be a writer and actually sells a book. Doesn't know what to do with the money ... could buy his way out of his disintegrating life but doesn't. Gradually loses his way completely. Doesn't know why and, other than being lonely, doesn't seem to care. Somehow he has come this far in life with no core values to help him ... and, consequently, ends up alone and without hope. He may or may not accidentally die in the river ... wouldn't matter to him one way or the other. Or to anyone else either.I have always loved McMurtry's \\"The Desert Rose\\", a story which is the antithesis of this one. Harmony (a Las Vegas showgirl) - in spite of many bad choices in life - has a set of core values and the courage to continue to be hopeful.

As tasty as a very watered down broth. One throw away line after another - such as \\"three very wet dogs swimming\\". The story is oh so empty and oh so predictable - nothing follows - not zany, not comedic, not insightful, not sad nor funny - etc. A total waste of time - the only solice is that you can read through this book in an hour and not be provoked into any thought or emotion at all - I for one would suggest taking a nap instead - even the potential of dreaming holds more interest than this wet noodle of a novel."},{"Title":"All my Friends Are Going to Be Strangers / Terms of Endearment","review":"Is writing dangerous to one's health and well being? That's one of the themes explored in this novel. Danny Deck, a graduate student in a writing program in Texas, meets Sally Bynum at a party and impulsively marries her a week later. Sally only wants to be a mother, and she does become pregnant. After Deck's first book is accepted for publication, their marriage falls apart, and Danny's life is set spiraling down a long tunnel of despair involving many quick affairs, visitation problems with his child, and even a failed book-signing party when no one shows up. He does meet someone (Jill) who excites him intellectually, but is a very unstable character emotionally and they split up. The book ends with him walking out into the Rio Grande River, high on booze and drugs, as if he might commit suicide while he thinks about the lost chance with Jill. (He obviously doesn't because he reappears in a sequel, but at the time McMurtry didn't know what to do with him.)Danny's writing does not seem as if it's going to help him deal with his problems much, and might even contribute to them, but McMurtry would not want Danny (or anyone) to stop writing because of that. It's frustrating at times reading about Deck and his aimless wanderings because he's the kind of guy who tends to make the same mistakes over and over. Although not as fine as some his other books (a few of which are absolutely great), this book is still pretty good."},{"Title":"All my Friends Are Going to Be Strangers / Terms of Endearment","review":"I purchased this book because I'm a Larry McMurtry fan. I wish I had read Terms of Endearment and Moving On before this book. Perhaps I would have had a better mental context for the characters. To me, the plot simply rambles without sufficient motivation or purpose and ends in pointless frustration. Perhaps fiction mimics life, but I'm expecting more from fiction than mimicry. As a story, it simply meanders past memorable characters. I was continually frustrated by what seemed to be incompleteness."},{"Title":"All my Friends Are Going to Be Strangers / Terms of Endearment","review":"This is one of Larry McMurtry's best modern novels (as opposed to his superlative historical fictions).

He wanders from bed to bed, even sleeping with his best friend's wife. I did enjoy the scene when Danny visits old Uncle Laredo, an onery, almost decrepit man who slices the throats of goats without a second thought. But much of the book was hum-drum and even quite depressing, especially toward the end of the book. Danny wanders from place to place, trying, struggling, to find happiness, but never does. If you want a lesson on how to be unhappy, read this book."},{"Title":"All my Friends Are Going to Be Strangers / Terms of Endearment","review":"This novel, McMurtry's fourth, is his most tender and charming. Danny Deck is a young, perpetually perplexed writer to whom things seem to inexplicably happen, yet Danny, who narrates the novel, never presents himself as a victim, and McMurtry successfully keeps the novel from becoming sentimental. McMurtry's finest achievement in this novel, however, is his evocation of a Texas no one else has ever written about--the young, academic, urban, sixties generation of Texans. If you didn't believe such a thing existed, this novel will convince you otherwise. That world gives this novel a funky charm (its frank sexual content was somewhat controversial in some circles when it was published.) Look for the usual McMurtry themes and characteristics, including well-drawn women characters and a perverse spin on the &quot;old cattleman&quot; in the character of mean-as-hell, 92 year old Uncle Laredo, who &quot;was obsessed with last things.&quot; Chapter Thirteen, which concerns Danny's visit to Uncle Laredo out in Van Horn on his way back from San Francisco, is one of the funniest pieces of writing I've ever read, one of the very few times I've actually laughed out loud reading a book. The book is the first of a trilogy (which years later became a tetralogy, then a quinology, etc.) written in the late sixties and early seventies along with &quot;Moving On&quot; and &quot;Terms of Endearment.&quot; It's my favorite of all of McMurtry's novels"},{"Title":"All my Friends Are Going to Be Strangers / Terms of Endearment","review":"One of the best books ever written. This is McMurtry at his finest. I have missed Danny Deck (main character) since I read the last line of this novel. This is the first McMurtry book I ever read. I later read every fictional book he wrote just to hear his \\"voice\\" again. This says volumes seeing that I normally have no interest in western genre; but I'll read the western ones because I grow to care for his characters as they dance off of the pages. After reading this book you should also read Terms of Endearment, Evening Star and Moving On for some of the same characters. This book really should become a film. Thank you Mr. McMurtry!!!"},{"Title":"All my Friends Are Going to Be Strangers / Terms of Endearment","review":"I read this book when I was 23 and found it profounding, educational &amp; entertaining.

I think everybody has wanted to run away at times and Danny does. Danny let's us run away and enjoy the craziness of life and the twists and turns it brings us.

A brilliant novel, touching, clever, resonant. A MUST READ!!!!!"},{"Title":"All my Friends Are Going to Be Strangers / Terms of Endearment","review":"As is usually the case when I get excited about an author's work I tend to delve into all the work in order to see which way he or she is heading. That is the case here with Larry McMurtry. I have just finished reading his The Last Picture Show trilogy (The Last Picture Show; Texasville; and, Duane's Depressed) about coming of age in small town Texas, having one's mid-life crisis there and, in the end, struggling against the strains of mortality there, as well. The cumulative effect of this work was a five-star review. Here we step back to early McMurtry and while the promise is certainly there as well as his quirky look at modern life this is the work of a rising author star not of a master writer.Why? Well, for one thing the subject matter. All fictional writing in the final analysis may be autobiographical, consciously or unconsciously, but here the trials and tribulations of a young Texas writer who heads to California to find himself after the first budding of prominence with the publication of his first book and a movie offer is, well, just a little too precious. Moreover, the inevitable romantic problems of twenty-something males (and, by now in 2008, females) has been done to death. Nothing really jumps out here other than some cogent observations about the foibles of human nature as strained through the California blender. My advice to Danny, the protagonist writer here is -Go east, young man, go east back to Texas. That's where your pot of gold is, Larry, oops Danny. Do you need to read this book? If you have time. Do you need to read The Last Picture Show trilogy. Damn right. That's the different in a nutshell."},{"Title":"All my Friends Are Going to Be Strangers / Terms of Endearment","review":"This fine book, written in first person, chronicles a few months in the life of a young writer, including his joys, success, and ultimately his decline. The main character is at first a charming individual, with an innocence and confusion often found in intelligent free thinkers, and eager to make a difference in the world through his writing and his friends. Yet as the book progress, we find his innocence eroding as his confusion deepens. Unable to handle the success of his career coupled with the lack of success in his personal life, Danny Deck goes on a journey, searching for meaning through his former friends. In the end, he recognizes that he cannot return to his former life and finds himself in a psychological vacuum with no answer other than to blame his own success for his problems.Amidst the process and the search, we find many funny characters such as Uncle Laredo known as Uncle L, his wife Martha, a cantankerous lady who loves goats, and old man Lorenzo. Danny takes all these people in stride without much emotional response and continues his journey which ultimately is his own mental and social decline. While the book has an eerie sadness that seems to accompany each page, we still find ourselves rooting for Danny to get himself together and write another book.McMurtry's style of using events and characters to define the essence of the story and outline its purpose makes for a smooth and powerful approach to writing. In this case, the sorrow of Danny's life blends with poor judgment to create a memorable character with no future. A rather depressing book, with few redeeming human qualities demonstrated, All My Friends reminds us of the bleak emotions that often bubble beneath the surface of our human facade. While some of McMurtry's later books are a little cavalier in their presentation, this one is a gripping read difficult to put down. Short in plot development, but long in human experience, this book combines the naturalism of Dreiser with the confusion of Salinger, resulting in a captivating but often sad story. Definitely worth reading by all McMurtry fans."},{"Title":"All my Friends Are Going to Be Strangers / Terms of Endearment","review":"I bought this book after reading the first two pages in the bookstore... I was hooked. I thought I was in store for another hilarious, vivid, and relevent McMurtry great. Instead, after about fifty pages I realized that it was simply a silly sex fest. The main charachter's woes are not a result of the impossibility of having a normal life and relationship while being an artist -- no, his problems come from marrying stupidly and being a male slut. He even chooses child molesters as his friends. His final, rapid decline is a direct result of his sleeping with every woman who wanders into the story ... including his best friend's wife. This has nothing to do with being an artist. McMurtry has written much, much better. Try Texasville."},{"Title":"All my Friends Are Going to Be Strangers / Terms of Endearment","review":"I once read somewhere that, early in his career, Larry McMurtry use to wear a sweatshirt with \\"Minor Regional Novelist\\" printed on the front, a kind of self-imposed literary scarlet letter. But whereas Hester Prynne used her talents as a seamstress to transform her scarlet letter into an individual work of art, McMurtry decided to turn his back on regionalism, the basis of his first three novels, and to write about urban Texas and Texans. The resulting so called \\"Urban Trilogy\\" (of which this novel is the middle work) tells the story of several young Texans who try to balance school, sex, careers and wanderlust during the decade of the Sixties. The first of these urban novels (Moving On) was a huge rambling affair, ill conceived and poorly written, and although this novel is better, it is still weak when compared to McMurtry's first three novels.McMurtry's story of the young author, Danny Deck, deals with writing and the various pitfalls of becoming and remaining a writer. Clearly, the author sees himself in Danny and when the book deals with Danny's personal insights into the writing process it is successful. Unfortunately, too much of the book is given to unreal characters, unreal situations and tries to become a kind of Texan \\"On the Road\\". Danny Deck (and Larry McMurtry) is no Jack Kerouac. Even McMurtry's sense of place falls apart once he is outside his native Texas, and the scenes set in California are as artificial as some of the plastic grass that often serves as lawn out there.Throughout the book, McMurtry has Danny ponder the role of the Texan frontier in his own life as well as how it affects the creative process. It seems as if McMurtry (and Danny) knows that this is the important issue and that this is what he should be writing about, but instead falls prey to the lure of Sixties bohemianism, casual sex (I'm sure with a few more pages McMurtry would have gotten Danny and his eighty year old aunt into bed), and trite plot twists. Too bad. Because that part of the novel set at Uncle Laredo's ranch is very good, almost becoming a short story in its economy of words and bare as bone style. The scene of the two aging cowboys tending the watchfire for the possible return of Emiliano Zapata is haunting and is by far the more memorable thing about this book."},{"Title":"All my Friends Are Going to Be Strangers / Terms of Endearment","review":"This book is being deleted from my Kindle as a waste of time and space...not funny, not good writing...shame on Larry McMurtry...shame on me for buying it..."},{"Title":"All my Friends Are Going to Be Strangers / Terms of Endearment","review":"This is just a romance novel with a moral."},{"Title":"Kamala Das: A selection with essays on her work (CRNLE writers series)","review":"This is a very interesting selection of the work of one of India's key writers, Kamala Das. It includes some of her poetry, short stories, an excerpt from her autobiography 'My Story' and finally a selection of critical essays on Das and her writing.Das has been published since the 1960s, and has written in both English and Malayalam (under the name of Madhavikutty). It is interesting to see here (\\"Introduction\\") her articulation of the decision all writers face when English is a foreign language: in which language should one write? Does one use English, to write about subjects which might not otherwise be acceptable and risk losing the local audience; or conversely, does one choose to write in one's own language and possibly lose the outside audience?One of the themes in her work is sexuality, and the place of Indian women in regard to marriage, sex, and freedom, and the difficulties women writers can face. Some of her writing can be very confronting (the short story on child prostitution springs to mind): she writes quite starkly about issues which have not always been given voice by women in her society.The included critical essays are all interesting, and help to bring out some of the issues in reading and understanding her work. Personally I'm not a fan of Das' work, but I do recommend this collection if you're looking for a starting point into her writing, or even more generally as an example of Indian lit."},{"Title":"Getting Married in Buffalo Jump","review":"I picked up this book after watching the movie, and I've read it at least five times since then. The movie is great, but, when I have the time, I'd rather read the book. The characters are so rich, painted in full with both strengths and weaknesses, that they feel like real people. What makes me fall in love with them and keep returning to this book is the way the characters relate to one another, the way they just fit together and take care of one another. The whole perspective on life is just simple and good. Oh, and the plot is incredibly well-crafted. But I'm more into characters, so it took a few reads before I really started to appreciate the structure of the plot:)If you do like this book, Haley has a few other treasures out there that are well-worth the read. \\"Nest of Singing Birds\\" and \\"The Murder of Medicine Bear\\" are my shortlist."},{"Title":"Getting Married in Buffalo Jump","review":"I am very disappointed to see that this book is out of print.

The second edition of A History of the Urantia Papers is well written and was well researched by Mullins. The Urantia Papers he refers to were received over several years in the 1930's by a group of people known as the Contact Commission. The Papers were later combined with an index and published in 1955 as the Urantia Book.While Mullins' stated objective was to provide a history of the Papers and not of the persons involved with the Papers, it is obviously impossible to discuss the papers without mentioning the people involved. He covers not just the origin of the Urantia Papers and eventual printing of the Urantia Book, but also discusses some of the significant people connected with the Papers and some pivotal events that shaped that community right to the present day. One of the pivotal persons was Dr. William Sadler, one of the six people on the Contact Commission who received the papers. Another is Dr. Meredith Sprunger, who became influential in the community of Urantians soon after the publication of the book and provided much information for Mullins' book. Mullins also covers several major events in the history of the Urantian community such as the split between Urantia Foundation and Urantia Brotherhood, the Vern Grimsley affair, and Martin Gardner's book, Urantia-The Great Cult Mystery, where Gardner attempted to discredit the Urantia Book and the associated community.Mullins is obviously a believer in the veracity of the Papers and in their supermortal origin as is evident from his writing, so some may claim that his book is biased. But in the opinion of this reviewer, Mullins has been very objective about the events and people involved with the appearance and history of the Urantia Papers.The Urantia Book: Indexed Version with free Audio Book on DVD (Can only be played on a computer with a DVD drive.)"},{"Title":"A History of the Urantia Papers","review":"Very well written.

Even though I read it from front to back, I find myself picking up sections again to understand the circumstances of certain events in the history. Mr.Mullins and Dr.Sprunger made every effort, in my opinion, to be objective. I feel that whatever information has not been shared Mr.Mullins was not able to substantiate it with enough evidence, or it will simply not be known in this lifetime. I appreciate the straight-forward voice and narrative style in which it was written. When there was controversial material covered, the author made it clear ahead of time. What made it valuable to me, after this second reading, was the people involved lived normal lives. They weren't any popes. They weren't some \\"chosen people\\" as some critics of The Urantia Book would like to have you believe. These were ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances. And after reading this again, I have come to the conclusion that it was not possible for Dr.Sadler to author any of the papers...at all. Why anyone continues to believe this, I do not know.

It falls woefully short of anything that could be considered an objective historic account, and is nothing more (or less) than the latest attempt at damage control by spinning the old yarn of how the mighty words of the alleged celestial revelators were made book (i.e., The Urantia Book), for those who want to hear it. AHOTUP first tips us off regarding its slanted approach in an endnote on page 57: &quot;I developed the dialogue between the various individuals in the seminal contact with some artistic license. It . . . is a plausible dramatization that fits the known facts.&quot; Artistic license? Plausible dramatization? Are these disclaimers the cornerstones of objectivity, or are they the earmarks of subjectivity? And read how AHOTUP blatantly blows its cover by exposing its true purpose: &quot;Future readers, whether we prefer it or not, may learn of the origins before they have the opportunity to ponder the message. We should strive to see that a reader has enough information to establish informed conclusions. We should also aspire to a quality of analytical thinking about such questions that is consistent with the philosophy of the Urantia Papers&quot; (75). In other words, let's indoctrinate the novice readers before anybody else can get to them! AHOTUP reluctantly relies heavily on information provided by outcast Harold Sherman's How to Know What to Believe to give a first-hand account of the Forum days. (The only other available primary sources are scant reports provided by William Sadler, founder of the movement and self-ascribed &quot;custodian&quot; of the &quot;revelation.&quot;) And yet, when convenient, information Sherman provides that might lead the reader to draw conclusions that are not in concert with the revelatory paradigm is virtually ignored. Despite the fact that Martin Gardner's was the first book-length treatise to provide heretofore unpublished information regarding the Urantia movement, said reference is given scant mention.... Your copy of the &quot;inviolate&quot; fifth epochal revelation, supposedly indited by celestial minds, has been revised by mere mortals who apparently took issue with the angelic authors!

Besides an abstract picture of a tree trunk with a caterpillar and a purple, turquoise, and white/translucent dragonfly, the unnamed narrator informs us: \\"This tree was here when we moved in.\\" On the next half page insert, the caterpillar is further up the tree, and the narrator says, rather mysteriously, \\"Dad says it's a pie tree.\\" Turn the last half-page insert, and small red dots with tiny black eyes-ladybugs-join the caterpillar on the tree trunk. There's another engaging \\"hook\\" in large letters: \\"I've never seen pies growing on trees. Wouldn't that be something?\\"Except for the initial inserts, every page of author/illustrator Lois Ehlert's unusually compelling nature/mystery book is increasingly elaborated but similarly formatted: There's an eye-dazzling collage, a one or two-sentence narrative that hints at the tantalizing but puzzling prospect of a \\"pie tree,\\" and smaller-font prose poetry that references the collage and doubles as a vocabulary builder:I seegreen leaves,white blossoms,yellow pollen dust,blue eggsIn a brown nest,yellow honeybees,and black stripesOn a yellowButterfly.But no pie.Ehlert's collages use a variety of materials-including origami papers, wood veneers, vellum, sheet metal, cherry tree branches-to complement her acrylic, watercolor, colored pencil, oil pastel, and crayon drawn illustrations. The result is an incredibly textured group of collages that are among the best illustrations of 2004. Somehow, they're abstract and realistic, brilliantly colored, and gracefully beautiful without being precious or too delicate. The story is similarly well balanced: The paean to nature is evident (\\"Sweet spring is here at last\\" .... \\"But now a damp wind is blowing, and all the flower petals are falling down like rain\\"), but just when things threaten to become overwrought, the child's voice returns, and the mystery of the pie tree is solved: It's a cherry tree, and birds and butterflies and even a raccoon (\\"But, hey, raccoon, save some for us!\\") have already begun their \\"feast.\\" Now it's the child and his or her dad's turn, and the book concludes by showing the preparations for a very cherry-filled pie. It is, after all, a pie tree.An outstanding picture book, with an original story and excellent pedantic value as well (i.e., all that vocabulary building and object searching), this is one pie in the sky that delivers. Definitely recommended."},{"Title":"Pie in the Sky","review":"[This review was first published in the \\"Ephrata (Pa.) Review.\\"]All of Ehlert's productions are cornucopias of color, shapes and textures, and \\"Pie in the sky\\" is no exception. A girl and her father watch a cherry tree evolve from winter's bare branches to summer's wealth of \\"rubies,\\" (which they tuck between crusts). Assorted creatures come and go, from tiny ladybugs to a masked \\"thief.\\"Ehlert's bold collages use an assortment of materials. Corrugated cardboard, handmade papers from five countries, wood veneers, sheet metal, wires, balsa wood, wax paper, and cherry tree branches are among the items used in \\"Pie.\\" Quite a recipe!"},{"Title":"Pie in the Sky","review":"In this story, similar toGrowing Vegetable Soup, a child narrator traces the growing cycle of a cherry tree. It opens with a kind of riddle: \\"Dad says it's a pie tree/ I've never seen pies growing on trees.\\" The story then traces the tree's changes throughout the year, culminating as the family harvests cherries and transforms them into cherry pie (recipe included). The riddle is further developed in sidebar-type \\"I spy\\" type descriptions listing features of each scene, opening, \\"I see...\\" and concluding each page with a puzzled, \\"but no pie.\\" These descriptions, interspersed with the narrative text, do break up the rhythmic predictability of the story, but the repeated refrain at the end of each list does help the story maintain its continuity. And these soliloquies provide a greater opportunity for young children to engage the visual interest of the story as they enjoy finding the different objects named.Ehlert's unique collage style is augmented with tactile experience in this work. The pages are of varying widths, meaning that some parts of many scenes are included in the next. This highlights the fact that the tree remains essentially the same as its appearance changes through the growing season. The front cover features piecrust cutout holes opening onto a bright red page, just as a real piecrust hides its filling.This book is best suited for a preschool audience, although older children may also enjoy it, especially if they are artistically inclined or if they might have an opportunity to try out the recipe."},{"Title":"Pie in the Sky","review":"We check this book out from the library year after year, and finally we had to have our own copy.

Rogers books the most during a period of time when I was obsessed with blackness. As a black man in america, I don't think being obsessed with blackness is anything to be ashamed of however. It's simply a reaction to racism.In this second volume, Roger's focuses on the new world and shows that the inhabitants of the americas are far from being pure racially. As discussed in the previous volume, race mixing with blacks took place all over Europe. In the new world however, whites not only mixed with blacks but also with the indigenous peoples of the americas including the caribbean. Also, there is good reason to believe that some of the indigenous peoples of the americas were already somewhat mixed before the europeans arrived. The one thing which I really like about J.A. Rogers books is the fact that he is not afraid to confront certain issues which are embarrasing to most whites even today.Did you ever wonder why some black people from the caribbean and south and central america don't like being called black? Some will say because they aren't black, they are Spanish or Brazilian. Based on historical evidence Roger's points out that the blacks of the caribbean and south and central america are just as &quot;black&quot; as the blacks in america. It's just that some of them may look different because race mixing took place in different degrees in different areas.Unfortuantely, the issue of race mixing is a very touchy issue, so a lot that is in books like this cannot be talked about without angering people unless you're in some sort of &quot;radical&quot; black group. Therefore, much of what is contained in this book should be kept to oneself. Regardless of what country someone is from, they don't like being told that they are of black african ancestry.

[...] For the subject, the advantage of this projection is that it disposes of the affects and anxiety that otherwise inhibit his ability to follow a train of thought, and/or linguistic chain of association; the disadvantage is that this ability depends on maintaining critical blind spots.\\" ( p 233)Here we have an example of the way that psychology can assert itself into the realm of the political. Brennan certainly sees that there are cultural-historical influences that determine how masculinity and femininity are constructed in the society, but she does not go so far as to label these constructions as being also political.That does not mean that these projections onto the other of a state of \\"castration\\" -- which we can understand as mental and political helplessness -- are not facilitated by political mechanisms, making them profoundly political. Rather, Brennan is writing in 1992, and advancing a novel thesis about psychological intersubjectivity, that was hardly recognised at that time. Seventeen years later, we are more familiar with post-Kleinian theory, and we are able to draw more conclusions concerning the interlinking of the political sphere with our inherent psychological mechanisms.It becomes clearer after reading Brennan's book that the projection of \\"castration\\" onto an other -- which, as Brennan points out, can be one who is biologically male or female, but for psychoanalytical reasons, is generally a woman -- is a political feature of the psychological division of necessary labour.This is because, as humans, we are all physiologically complex -- which is to say, made up of both rational and irrational drives. So it is that if one is to politically represent and uphold exclusively the rational side of one's identity, it is necessary for one to somehow do away with the irrational side of one's self (both as representation and as, far as possible, as conscious experience).To maintain a rational self-image, the inherent irrational aspects of human psychology -- (those which intrude at times to seem to prevent the work of narrow rational thinking) -- will be denied, or sublimated of projected, depending on the level of the level of the psychological resources and skill of the subject.Brennan deals with the issue of projection in the last few pages of her book, and it is fortunate that she does so, since these days it is tacitly acceptable, within the Western socio-political complex, for projections to flow from male to female, but not for them to flow the other way around: That is, the political rhetoric that maintains ideologies imputes that \\"it is irrational to impute irrational characteristics to men.\\" It does not seem to be irrational to impute them to women, however. So it is that individual men are lifted above the possibility of criticism, by virtue of the tacit acceptability of the logic of projection.But projection isn't merely rhetorical: that is, there is more to it than expressing the idea that \\"it isn't me, its you!\\" as a way of putting women back into their (traditional) places. Rather, at a deep psychological level, the subject who projects also actually believes that it is not he, but her, who is responsible for a disruption of his chain of thought.Consider the nature of the political divide in terms of this tacit division of psychological labour: Phenomenologically, those positioned as \\"masculine\\" (which can be upper division women as well as men, in the managerial classes) experience only annoying interruptions to their rational train of thought, which seem to come from the outside of their own psyches, and need to be crushed or put down. Meanwhile, those positioned on the alternative side of the political divide, those allocated to do \\"feminine\\" work, will have a variety of experiences depending on their degree of psychological and political awareness.Those who find themselves positionally on the \\"feminine\\" side of power systems will not have the same view of the world and of established systems of morality as those who find themselves on the \\"masculine\\" side (due to factors dominated by psychological symbolisations of gender and social status). At the lowest level of consciousness, women who are projected upon will find a certain need fulfilled, in that an identity -- albeit a weak and shaky one -- is projected upon them. Their narcissistic sensibilities (whether weak or strong) are enhanced.At a higher level of consciousness, one encounters the male projection of \\"castration\\" as a constant assault on one's processes of thinking, as well as on one's capacity to maintain a sense of identity. The males who project are inclined to expect women to identify with all of their failed processes of thinking, as if they had originated from the women themselves. In the case of ongoing assaults of this projective sort (which I have experienced), which sometimes appear to be specifically designed to weaken one's resolve, I find the only solution is to get away from the situations that allow for these power dynamics, and to take refuge as a hermit. Otherwise, one will not be able to think very much, if at all.When one has no choice but to associate with those (including organisations and systems) which engage in this process of projection, it does feel masochistic, despite the fact that one is on red alert for combat, and is not masochistic at all. This is because these projective attacks work against one's inner ontological awareness -- the part of the self that governs a sense of identity."},{"Title":"Working Cures: Healing, Health, and Power on Southern Slave Plantations","review":"So many people attribute African American healing to other cultures, particularly European Americans or Native Americans.

This is a powerful psychological drama that both kids and adults can enjoy. The translation is a bit awkward in places, but you won't be bothered by it--the story is that strong."},{"Title":"I Am David","review":"It is a must to publish this manuscript, \\"I Am David\\", written by Anne Holm. This is about a boy named David who had spent his twelve years of live in a concentration camp. David did not know how he got into the camp, his religion and who his parents were. Things change when a guard gave David a chance to escape. This book shows that hope shines brightest in the darkness of times.Firstly, David has very high moral standards. For instance, he refuses to accept payment for a small service that he renders voluntarily to a stranger. Also, David refuses to hit a boy back after the boy beat him into a pulp and called him names. This is because he thinks that if he hit him back, he would be just as rotten and worthless as the boy, thus he would have no right to be able to escape. For him, to choose to observe high moral standards is a symbol of his newfound liberty.Secondly, David was very courageous. He sprang into a burning shed to save a little girl, Maria. It was through his courageous act that Maria did not die. Although David was courageous, he did not dash into the burning shed without thinking. He was smart enough to wrap wet clothes around his head to keep the smoke out, thus preventing him from being unconscious and being burnt to death too. He learnt this skill by seeing a man in the camp doing this when the man escaped from a burning building, thus he was applying past knowledge to new situations.Lastly, David was very determined to learn new things. When he first escaped from the camp, he did not really know how to read and write. After much practice, he finally managed to do it. Also, David did not know how to use words properly at first. For instance, instead of saying that a bathroom was \\"lovely\\", he said that it was \\"beautiful and good\\". Thus, he began to learn of more words, for example how to use the word \\"nice\\", \\"pretty\\" and \\"beautiful\\" differently.\\"I Am David\\" is a very touching book. Anne Holm uses him as a blank canvas on which can be drawn the first experiences of life - beauty, knowledge, trust, religion, love, everything. I hope that this finest novel ever will be published.[...]"},{"Title":"I Am David","review":"I am David is a book about a boy called David who escapes from a concentration camp in Eastern Europe. He was then asked to go to Salonika and board a boat bound for Italy when no one is looking. From Italy, he walked to Denmark where his mother lives. Along the way, the courageous David's determination and trust for other people helped him reach Denmark.When in Italy, Milan, David watched 2 boys and their sister playing in their father's barn. Out of a sudden, the barn is on fire. David quickly takes out a cloth and wets it. Then, he ties it over his mouth to prevent him form breathing in the smoke. Then, he courageously ran into the barn and saves the 2 boys' sister, Maria, from death. This example shows how courageous David is as he resisted the fire, regardless the risk of danger, not willing to let is take Maria \\"away\\" and brought her out of the barn. Also, at the end of the book, David showed courage as he knocked onto the door of his mother (which he did not know it was his mother) to seek instructions. I feel that was very courageous of David as he went to a stranger's private property and knocked on to the door.During his entire trip, David showed determination from the start when he escaped form the concentration camp and did not want to be captured that is what I felt was determination. Also, another incident is when David was thrown off board from the ship into the sea when going to Italy. He swan with determination, hoping to reach shore and he never gave up. Never the less, during the trip from Eastern Europe to Denmark, he kept on walking, never talked of giving up, kept on walking till Denmark. That is why I feel that David is courageous.In the concentration camp, David trusted the man, assuming that he was helping him to escape and trying to sabotage him. Also, when he stayed with Maria in Italy, David trusted that her parents would not report him to the police and kept him a secret. Moreover, David also trusted Johannes, his friend and teacher, when teaching him basic things of the \\"outside\\" world and never thought that Johannes was evil. Also, he trusted the Danish lady in Switzerland about the story of the boy called \\"David\\" and the story of his true parents.Overall, I feel that I Am David is an excellent book to read as it shows a lot of moral values that has a great impact on life. Also, there morals such as courage, trust and determination don't just come around everyday; it takes a lot of time to understand them, which this book does explain those values."},{"Title":"I Am David","review":"This book is one of the best books in the world.

If you are someone who loves happy endings then this would be a great book for you."},{"Title":"I Am David","review":"What shall I begin with the extremly bad story line, the unbeliveble characters,how slowly the books events went or the realy stupid ending? I'm 14 years old and our class just finished I Am David and I think it was one of the worst stories I've ever read. One of my many pet peeves about this book is that David seems tho think there are only 3 kinds of people the evil, the stupid and the buetiful he just can't seem to realize that people can change over time and be totally diffrent. I would only recomend this book to people who love drama."},{"Title":"I Am David","review":"well what can i say about this book i guess i didnt like the idea of it cause i had to read it for school.During to holidays too so what didnt make it any better i guess there is worse books but this one was really easy to right questions about as it is a simple story that i sware could be summed up in one page but other then that i guess it wasnt that bad it draged on a bit and it was really easy to tell what happened at the end!!!"},{"Title":"I Am David","review":"i havent read it but some people told me it is all shee"},{"Title":"I Am David","review":"The UnwantedI am David is about a boy who grows up in a concentration camp in Eastern Europe.

The book could have been better if it had a little more excitement than there was already.If you like books with adventure in them this is one you most likely would like to read.

I wanted to get in the habit of reading more often and this book was the only choice i had. I just finished reading the book and would never pick this book up again. Don't buy this book if you are over the age 13, since i am. If you are in the rage of 8-12, this book might be interesting to you. Teens, i do not recommend this book for you, it is boring."},{"Title":"I Am David","review":"This is a book about a boy who escapes from a concentration camp and learns many things during his journey in freedom, it emphasises on the many things that we humans take for granted in life. I have rated this book as 4 stars because though it is a beautiful novel the conclusion was quite abrupt leaving readers in wonder and suspense From this book we see that Anne Holm is a very detailed author!"},{"Title":"I Am David","review":"This book was read to me in grade 7 class. I enjoyed it a lot and always wanted to know what would happen next! The plot sounds weak but it is not. The only thing I can critisize is that some of the coincidences are not easy to believe but the beautiful writing style makes up for it. My advice is, READ THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"I Am David","review":"&#34;I am David &#34; I enjoyed this movie even if it does seem very unlikely.A twelve year old boy escapes from a prison camp with the help of a guard at the camp.The same guard fell in love with David's mother earlier in the story and helped her to escape.I guess that is why he helps young David escape.Then once he is out the poor boy is afraid to trust anyone. Finally a lady he meets convinces him to trust her.Then she is able to help him.I recommend for anyone who loves children and likes to see them being helped.

This is perhaps one of the best novels written for children. I think at least every 8th grader should read in connection with their social studies class. We watched the movie after finishing the book and again the entire class was riveted the entire time. Half a dozen were in tears at the end of the book and movie! A great experience with a group of fairly advanced 5th graders."},{"Title":"I Am David","review":"I am David is a book about a boy called David who escapes from a concentration camp in Eastern Europe. He was then asked to go to Salonika and board a boat bound for Italy when no one is looking. From Italy, he walked to Denmark where his mother lives. Along the way, the courageous David's determination and trust for other people helped him reach Denmark.When in Italy, Milan, David watched 2 boys and their sister playing in their father's barn. Out of a sudden, the barn is on fire. David quickly takes out a cloth and wets it. Then, he ties it over his mouth to prevent him form breathing in the smoke. Then, he courageously ran into the barn and saves the 2 boys' sister, Maria, from death. This example shows how courageous David is as he resisted the fire, regardless the risk of danger, not willing to let is take Maria \\"away\\" and brought her out of the barn. Also, at the end of the book, David showed courage as he knocked onto the door of his mother (which he did not know it was his mother) to seek instructions. I feel that was very courageous of David as he went to a stranger's private property and knocked on to the door.During his entire trip, David showed determination from the start when he escaped form the concentration camp and did not want to be captured that is what I felt was determination. Also, another incident is when David was thrown off board from the ship into the sea when going to Italy. He swan with determination, hoping to reach shore and he never gave up. Never the less, during the trip from Eastern Europe to Denmark, he kept on walking, never talked of giving up, kept on walking till Denmark. That is why I feel that David is courageous.In the concentration camp, David trusted the man, assuming that he was helping him to escape and trying to sabotage him. Also, when he stayed with Maria in Italy, David trusted that her parents would not report him to the police and kept him a secret. Moreover, David also trusted Johannes, his friend and teacher, when teaching him basic things of the \\"outside\\" world and never thought that Johannes was evil. Also, he trusted the Danish lady in Switzerland about the story of the boy called \\"David\\" and the story of his true parents.Overall, I feel that I Am David is an excellent book to read as it shows a lot of moral values that has a great impact on life. Also, there morals such as courage, trust and determination don't just come around everyday; it takes a lot of time to understand them, which this book does explain those values."},{"Title":"I Am David","review":"I am David is written by Anne Holm, it is realistic fiction and It takes place in Europe.The main character is David; David is a young boy that has lived in a concentration camp all his life. One night one of the guards tells him to escape and head north to Denmark and once he gets there he will be free. He escapes and he starts on his journey north to freedom.My favorite part is when David saves a girl from a fire. I like this because this shows how brave he really is and how much he cares about other people.I would give this book five stars because it is exciting and very detailed."},{"Title":"I Am David","review":"Excellent reading for adults and youngsters alike. Much better than the movie. My 12 year old son was very moved by the book and so impressed with David's incredible journey."},{"Title":"I Am David","review":"I remember reading this book when I was 12, my english teacher gave us it to read, to understand what it was like to survive as a child and as a war victim. My son is 12, and told his mom and I that he is not that bad off in this world with 2 loving parents. He explained that his teacher gave him a book to read about a young boy who was mistreated as a child. I then remembered the book my english teacher told me to read, so I gave my son the same book. He could not put it down. After reading it, he re-emphasised how lucky we are to live in this day and age."},{"Title":"I Am David","review":"Despite being brought up in a prison concentration camp surrounded only by adults who were deceptive or broken down, save for a few genuine inmates who seemed to be hiding a secret from him, twelve-year old David is a kind person by nature who feels a strong need to help people without asking for any returns, although he does not consciously know all the time that by doing so, he is performing acts of kindness.After escaping from the concentration camp, David proceeds with his arduous journey towards the free country of Denmark always insisting on remaining true to himself, and keeping a clear conscience - simply put, he is determined to remain as he is and who he has always been - David.The beauty of this story lies in the way that it does not directly tell of the courage of David, but simply portrays him as yet another human being who is confused about the happenings around him but who is nevertheless determined to attain complete freedom away from the evils of that concentration camp. In the process of describing the various events that he encounters, the author uses the contrast of the other characters' thoughts and feelings to fully reflect the implicit courage and beauty of David's noble character. This greatly increases the realism and credibility of David's character, and would in short, be one of the most remarkable strokes of bringing a character to life."},{"Title":"I Am David","review":"My 10 year old son and I read to one another and I chose \\"I am David\\" because it is being made into a movie. It is quite simply the best children's novel I have ever read.The story follows David from his life in a eastern European concentration camp to freedom in Denmark. Along the way David learns self reliance, finds faith in the God of \\"the still waters and green pastures,\\" discovers love, compasion and friendship. Through the book, David transforms from a victim to a human. I can't remember the last time I cried reading a book, but I did several times with this.If you want a book to teach a kid about self respect, love, forgiveness,and faith this is the book for you. If you don't want a book that teaches these things it is one heck of a story.This book is also published under the title \\"North to Freedom\\""},{"Title":"I Am David","review":"I loved the book I am David. The book tells you to appreciate what you have. Even the little things that we take for granted such as a supply of food, a family, love, a bath or shower when you need it, warmth, and even school! All the things we take for granted David was without and desperately wanted and needed. David thought and lived so differently then us it was always interesting to see what David would think or do next.David is a twelve-year-old boy who starts out living in a horrible concentration camp. He is sent there when he is a baby. David had no family except a fellow prisoner by the name of Johannes who was to act as a father to David, teaching him things he doesn't know. When Johannes drops dead, leaving David all alone, David is depressed and doesn't talk to anyone. Until one day when the guard who had always been ill to him, gave David a chance to escape. He tells David to go to Denmark where he would find freedom. On David's journey to Denmark he comes upon some interesting, but nice, people. One day he comes upon a Danish lady who shows David a picture of her friend.She said that the lady and her family were arrested and brought to a concentration camp. The man was killed, the lady spared, and the baby boy was token away and neither the lady nor herself ever saw David again.David knew she was talking about him and his Mom and Dad, but the Danish women did not. So David had a mission, to find his mother. The woman had said she was in Denmark. David finds that he is David, not a concentration camp prisoner. He learns how to love, to smile, and to play. David learns that life is good and worth living, that death is not good. David Learns to live with out the hope of dieing.This book was a little challenging and long but the story plot is what kept me reading. Adventure, suspense, hatred, love, and determination are in the book. You must like those things to red the book. David's thoughts and desperate actions will keep you holding on even when it is challenging."},{"Title":"I Am David","review":"This is a compelling story of a twelve year old boy who has spent his impressionable years in a concentration camp. No one knows why he's there, or what happened to his parents, except for the people who imprisoned him. David doesn't even really know why a guard who seems to hate him had suddenly helped him escape and told him to find his way to Denmark. David knows nothing of the outside world except for a few details he's overheard from the other prisoners. But he's quick to learn and has been exposed to many different languages inside the camp. He trusts no one, and has few interaction skills with other people. Strangers who meet him are often suspicious. David quickly realizes he must try to learn how to smile and fit in so he can make his long journey without being caught and returned to 'them' at the concentration camp.Though listed as juvenile fiction, this is a 'must read' for adults as well.Chrissy K. McVayauthor of 'Souls of the North Wind'"},{"Title":"I Am David","review":"Better by far than most children's books out there. In fact, it kind of wrecks other books! Slow, yes, but deep. So deep that you don't feel you're wasting your time reading it, nor your kids time in reading it aloud to them. I had to keep stopping on the last page and distracting myself--otherwise my tears wouldn't let me finish! A masterpiece. Take the time for it."},{"Title":"I Am David","review":"I read this book when I was about 12 years old and instantly fell in love with it. I have since given it as a gift to nieces and nephews of the same age and they, likewise have loved it. It has withstood the test of time, and should be required reading in schools, in my humble opinion."},{"Title":"I Am David","review":"This story has so many great literary elements: mystery, danger, adventure, moral themes (justice/human rights issues), emotional highs and lows, not to mention the educational value of understanding the effects of communism and the plight of refugees...but for me the most beautiful element was the process by which David learned to trust God.I saw the movie first, and was greatly moved, which led me to read the book. There is some difference between the two--part of the role of Jim Caviezel's character in the movie is accomplished in the book by another unlikely character towards the end. Also in the movie the identity of the person helping David escape is not revealed till the end, whereas in the book it's established from the beginning, but the mystery there (in the book) is \\"why\\" this person helped him. Besides the relatively few story changes from book to movie, the book places you \\"inside\\" David's head, whereas in the movie you are an outside observer of his circumstances.Being \\"inside\\" David's head allows you to share in more of his thoughts and feelings. The theme of understanding God's character and love for David was very powerfully accomplished in the book. When David loses his compass, he begins to feel hopeless and realizes his need for \\"outside\\" help, for which he turns to God. This is such an interesting and beautiful process because he has very limited knowledge of God. All he knows is a small bit of information given to him by Johannes, his late friend and mentor from the camp. Johannes had once told David that a long time ago there was another boy named David who wrote songs about his God and that his God led to green pastures and beside still waters. David made the decision to worship \\"that God\\" based on his need for \\"green pastures and still waters\\", and throughout the story he addresses God as such in his prayers to him (\\"God of green pastures and still waters\\").He begins relating to God on a somewhat \\"legalistic\\" basis--sort of an \\"if you do this favor for me, then I'll do this favor for you\\" type of system. There are times when he needs God's help, but refuses to call on Him for help because he doesn't feel he's yet \\"earned\\" it. There are actually some incredible moments within that though--the extent that David is willing to go to to make his life worthy of God's involvement and to please God. But by the end of the book, through various circumstances (and one particularly powerful, very symbolic circumstance towards the end of the story), God sovereignly reveals His grace to David--not based on what David can earn, but on God's love for him. The story also affirms to David his value and worth to God--that he (David) is worth sacrificing for.And without giving too much away...the story has a very happy, satisfying ending!"},{"Title":"I Am David","review":"This is an engaging historical fiction novel. Set in post World War II Europe, it is also published under the titles David, and North to Freedom. With the help of one of the prison gaurds, 12 year old David escapes from a communist labor camp in Bulgaria. He has lived there as long as he can remember, and has no idea of the outside world or what to do, except that he must get to Denmark. The story weaves in many important themes, such as freedom, beauty, truth, justice, and love. There are many intriguing characters, like Johannes his fellow prisoner, the Italian family he stayed with, a Danish lady in Switzerland, and a dog named King. As David crosses countries, borders, and lives, his understanding of himself, life, God, and the aforementioned themes grows. Through it all he is determined to remain true to himself.

He hops into the truck and know body sees him. The two guys drive away and David is closer to Denmark. He did not even have to wlak for around 2 miles. Its my favorite part because I thought david would be caught but he did'nt.#3.) I recomend this book to other people because its exciting and its about a horrible time.

It was a great novel that had a lot of cliff hangers in it. It really captured my attention and kept me reading. I didn't dislike many things in this book. One thing I did dislike was that the book didn't give much background information at the beginning of the book. They didn't explain why David was where he was or how he'd gotten there. Another thing I dislike was that the man in the beginning of the book hated David and David hated him, but yet the man wanted David to escape.

After having children of my own, I re-read the book and found it still to be gripping and so well told that you are drawn into the story and begin to see the world around you from a new perspective. Now I'm reading it to my children who find it just as enthralling. It may, however, frighten younger children who are sensitive as it is not a happy tale, but rather one of a lone boys' struggle to survive in a harsh world.

When he is given the opportunity to escape through the help of a prison guard, David seizes it. Knowing nothing about the outside world, David struggles to cope in this strange environment. Sensing that the prison guards are forever trying to track him down, he makes his journey alone armed with only a bundle containing a compass, a bottle of water, a knife, some crumbs of bread and some vague advice to get to Denmark. This is an inspiring story of a brave boy's search for freedom and survival.I feel that I Am David is a good book because it is easy for children to relate to. It also teaches children moral values. I feel that I Am David helps us to appreciate simple things that we take for granted such as family love, a constant supply of food and water, a warm bath and school.I Am David is written from the point of view of David himself, a child, so I found that it was very easy to relate to what he was thinking, and I feel most children should be able to do the same. Although he thinks differently from most of us, having gone through so much hardship, it is easy to put ourselves in his shoes.Throughout the book, David shows many examples of moral values and strength of character. Even though he was hardened through those years spent in the concentration camp, David showed tenderness and kindness to all he met. I felt very touched as David never gave up, even in the face of defeat. This book has taught me a lot about persistence and kindness.Lastly, I am David teaches us to appreciate simple things that we take for granted, as these are the very things that David needs! After reading this book, I began to treasure my daily necessities, knowing what it is like to not have them.All in all, I am David is an excellent book. I recommend it to readers of all ages, but especially to children, as it easy for them to relate to and has many moral values. Also, reading this book helps us appreciate things around us that we take for granted. It is a story of one boy's struggle for survival. This is one of the best books I have ever read!A.L.G.S"},{"Title":"I Am David","review":"Great book! It's sad in spots, happy in others.
