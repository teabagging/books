Christopher G. Moore's works, set in Thailand, are such novels, and do both.&quot;A Killing Smile&quot; is a compelling story that will introduce the reader to people and places that are fictional, but absolutely real in that Mr. Moore pulls no punches and spares no detail in telling his and therefore the characters' story.This book will not be enjoyed by everyone however. It contains a few real world topics, places and people undoubtedly some readers would rather not admit exist or read about. However, the novel is fascinating. The characters are compelling.Mr. Moore's fortunate readers (I have read ten of his books - I am a fan) get an honest portrait of human lives, no matter how distant from their own they may seem, filled with hope, love, pain, desire and despair - in short, the entire spectrum of the human condition. The characters are presented without judgment as to their lives' validity and worth. They are accepted and reflected as they are. One comes away with the true belief Mr. Moore finds respect and merit in all of his characters, and through them a respect for the Thai culture in its entirety, and all of mankind for that matter.Mr. Moore's work appears to be a true reflection, without editorial distortion, of what he sees after years of living in Bangkok. I, having spent some time in Bangkok, the Thermae, Nana Plaza, Patpong and throughout Thailand, as well as time with some of the residents and those just passing through, find Mr. Moore's books (dense with images as visceral and real as any documentary) serve as actual road maps for the reader through the vast, and initially incomprehensible, world that is Bangkok and Thailand.While Mr. Moore's books may not cure whatever ailments you may have, reading them will make living with those ailments a lot more bearable and interesting. His insights and philosophy help put life in its proper perspective. Start with \\"A Killing Smile\\" and work your way through the entire series set in Thailand. It will be a unique education and great reading."},{"Title":"A Killing Smile","review":"This is the first novel by Christopher G. Moore that I read. It hooked me. I have read all of Moore's books that explore Southeast Asia. I studied Slavic literature in Poland and Chinese literature in Japan. I must say that I enjoy Moore's novels just as much or more than many of the classics. I think it is they way he brings a character to life that keeps me glued to each page. He shares with the world his keen observations about Thailand and life in general through his characters and the narrative voice. It is a definite read for people who would like to experience some excitement, humor and wisdom, and of course sheer pleasure."},{"Title":"A Killing Smile","review":"It was a little over ten years ago that I purchased &quot;Spirit House&quot; and &quot;A Killing Smile&quot; at DK Books on Sukhumvit Rd and I immediately fell in love with Christopher G. Moore's writing style. I always hunt down and consume his latest books when I return to my &quot;second home&quot; of Chiang Mai.&quot;A Killing Smile&quot; is probably the best fictional version of a bible or guidebook to the Thermae that I have ever encountered and I highly reccomend it to anyone who would A.) love a wonderful story, B.)learn about the Thai/expat world and C.) go to visit Thermae for the first time. The characters are so much like the regular customers I've meet there since I first visited the original Thermae in 1995. If you haven't been to Thermae, Bangkok or Thailand itself, I'd say this is more-than-likely the best motivation for doing so.Moore's writing just grabs you and won't let you go until you hit The End and desperately wish you had another of his books to read.I went with a good British friend of mine down to Bangkok in February specifically to purchase &quot;Minor Wife&quot;, his latest Calvino novel that I couldn't find in Chiang Mai, and found it within minutes of us getting rooms at Asoke Place. That little trip also included watching two Russian prostitutes, street vendors killing a LARGE rat and my friend and I visiting Soi Cowboy, Thermae and the Grace Hotel Coffee Shop. During my hangover, I once again realized that Moore's books are so much sanuk because all the odd-ball &quot;normal events&quot; I'd gone through the night before are part of the &quot;usual routine&quot; in his outlook on Bangkok and you feel right at home as you read them. If you haven't already read this, buy it and read it and do likewise with his other novels. Christopher G. Moore is truly an artist beyond belief and also a friendly, helpful man."},{"Title":"A Killing Smile","review":"I first read Moore on my initial visit to Bangkok and found his books a sort of orientation to life in Thailand in that I began to feel a lot more comfortable with my stay there.Subsequently I have purchased all of his published works and anxiously await his next title.As a primer to the life of a &quot;farang&quot; in Thailand he captures all the characters you are likely to encounter in your visit and at the same time you will be a better tourist because of what you will pick up from your reading about the Thai thought process and how they view foreigners-which may make your visit safer and a lot more fun too. His Calvino books will satisfy the most demanding of mystery readers. Even if you never thought of visiting Thailand after a small helping of Moore you may find yourself booking a ticket."},{"Title":"A Killing Smile","review":"\\"A MUST READ\\" for any guy that has explored the nightlifeof Bangkok. All of C.G. Moore's books about expats living in Asia are entertaining, but this book that centers around the \\"HQ\\" (old Thermae Coffee Shot) is one of my favorites. In fact, I purchased one of the limited edition copies that he sells on his website. As an old timer to Asia I find his books like Lay's potato chips......you can't have just one."},{"Title":"A Killing Smile","review":"Before having read this book I never knew what literature can achieve. This marvellous piece of art is a superb combination of - a world class thriller with very affectionate drawings of its characters; - an unmatched illustration of &quot;the other Bangkok&quot;, presenting a facette of the real face of this amazing city and its nightlife - formerly invisible to all visitors of the realm, who walk on tourist's paths. - and a goldmine filled with pictures which enable us &quot;falangs&quot; to understand key elements of the Asian culture.This epos obviously was written with full dedication and unlimited passion, and it revives a four-dimensional picture of one of the most amazing cities of the world. Whoever reads this book with an open heart will most probably fall in love irreversably with &quot;the land of smiles&quot; and its myths. Don't miss it."},{"Title":"A Killing Smile","review":"Very much a book of its time A Killing Smile is both a work of fiction and a guidebook for those heading to the neon underworld of Bangkok's bar scene. Before the internet one had to turn to a novels like A Killing Smile to find out the juicy details about 'the scene'. The stuff that didn't make it into the guidebooks made it into works of fiction. The kind of information that may save a tourist from a broken heart, an empty bank account, or worse.Christopher G. Moore is the pioneer of Bangkok noir fiction. Isaan b-girls, cutters, pissers, the scammers, the actresses. And their customers; lost alcoholics, grifters, chancers. Brilliant observations on the Bangkok nightlife. This book is the benchmark that all other books on the Bangkok bar scene (including Christopher G. Moore's) have had to follow. It set the standard that of what has amounted to an artistic movement of sorts: Bangkok Noir.US lawyer Lawrence Barings' wife Sarah dies in an auto accident. Lawrence travels to Bangkok to find his old college pal Tuttle who was romantically involved with Sarah in her college years. There are no great plot twists. Little action. The novel is rich in character, description and dialogue and most of all setting. Moore includes the material that a formulaic fiction writer may consider cutting. The scenes are left in because they're part of the overall picture. There are pages and pages of dialogues between expats sitting in the HQ, or Thermae, which any old hand knows well as an afterhours pick-up joint. The cast is fantastic. Crosby the English trust fund kid who grew up on hookers and darkness. Snow who wants to go up north with a box of New York magic tricks to become a Lahu Godman. The tussle between Laerence's western lifestyle and Tuttle's expat existance frames the major conflict and theme of the book.The novel is mainly written in third person, yet switches to second person occasionally to add descriptive depth. It also employs journal articles and letters. In many ways the novel was and is a creative triumph."},{"Title":"A Killing Smile","review":"You begin the read and wonder where this train is taking you. Don't let tales of the dark side confuse you or the message. The characters are people and each has a story. By the end of the book you feel you know them personally. You feel the pain for the girls and their desperate plight. You want to save them, rescue them from this train wreck of a life. You want this because you are thinking as a westerner. As you learn even if you save them they are still lost. Thailand is a wonderful country and Tai's are a wonderful people. I am married to a thai woman. Her love is complete and a better wife you will never find. I can not begin to describe the Thai logic even after all these years. Perhaps because I am western. This book opens the door to some answers. Once you have read this book you may never view the bargirls in the same light. They are human but its so sad they place so little value upon thier own selfworth. You will want to save them even 1, but how do you save someone who rates their value based on purples?Well written and powerful, it will leave you gasping for air, for relief from the pain of the characters, and like the bargirls you just can't stop."},{"Title":"A Killing Smile","review":"I'd been in Thailand for a few years when I read Chris Moore's tragic noveland I and almost every fellow ex-pat loved this and most of his books , it wasa way for newbies to understand life on the Pong ,especially the beautiful smiles of the ladies!"},{"Title":"A Killing Smile","review":"If you've ever been to Bangkok, known someone who went or just want to get an education while being entertained about the mystique and pitfalls of living and/or visiting Thailand - the Land of Smiles as it is known - you will enjoy this book. This is the first in a trilogy and I plan to read the other two in 2010. Although written a few years ago it stands up perfectly well today. Moore paints pictures you might have seen before but with brush strokes beyond the pale of most people's imagination. The characters are well constructed and may remind you of people you know, if not yourself. The ending conjures up visions of an action packed and suspenseful screenplay with believable twists and turns along the way. If you like this writer you may also like books by Jake Needham, Stephen Leather and John Burdett."},{"Title":"8 Great Illustrated Classics (Set # A29-15)","review":"These books are great. They keep my 8 year old busy for hours. They are a really nice hard cover series."},{"Title":"The King of Pirates (Hesperus Classics)","review":"I am very pleased with the fast shipping of the item. It was also in very good condition. I plan to use this book for school and then keep it on my bookshelf, just because its in that good of shape."},{"Title":"The King of Pirates (Hesperus Classics)","review":"This book reads as though it was written by or for Captain Avery himself. It reads like a PR job. It has none of the style or character of Defoe. Some will find it fun but it is no good for a Defoe book.Ironically the excellent American Defoe scholar John Robert Moore attributed the book A General History of the Pyrates to Defoe, but later scholars dismissed this on the grounds that its style did not resemble that of the King of Pirates! The style of A General History of the Pyrates (Volume One at least) seems definitely Defoe's and that is the book to recommend to Defoe fans."},{"Title":"The King of Pirates (Hesperus Classics)","review":"I think the previous reviews miss the point of this book, and indeed, the crucial context of 18th century travel writing. Defoe was a master of dramatic narrative, and this book, though perhaps \\"dull\\" by modern standards, is a fascinating dramatization of one of the most infamous English pirates, Captain Avery. The book is not a novel at all, nor is it a work of fiction per se; rather, Defoe writes two \\"letters\\" supposedly written by Avery himself, defending his crimes and trying to dispel the myth spun out by numerous writers (ironically, people like Defoe himself!).Yet what Defoe does with Avery is remarkable, since he is using a real pirate to advance a very personal argument: the pirate as a nationalist agent of empire, striking blows against foreign commerce to enrich the coffers of England. While this is not at all true from what little we know of Avery, Defoe mythologizes him much in the way that other pirates, notably William Dampier, tried to cast their own piracies in a nationalist light. The voice Defoe creates in the narrative is very unique and believable, as Avery narrates what led him to raid the Great Khan's treasure ship, abduct (but not rape or harm!) his daughter, and eventually settle in Madagascar over a quasi-pirate empire. Though a great deal of time is spent making the narrative seem believable (which can be slow--descriptions of battles, sailing from here to there), Defoe never forgets he is creating a fictional persona, and gives us numerous scenes that let us study Avery as a thinking, plotting individual. The scenes with the Great Khan's daughter are particularly interesting, as are Avery's attempts to steal away from his crew and return to England.This is unmistakably a work by Defoe, very much in the vein of his longer, and somewhat less interesting Captain Singleton, and even his more popular work, Robinson Crusoe. Defoe makes the characters and situations come to life, and is careful to shape his narrative to follow specific artistic demands. In other words, it's not simply a story of Avery's life. To see the difference, read Captain Johnson's \\"A General History of the Most Notorious Pirates,\\" which is sometimes attributed to Defoe; the style is bland, unimaginative, and utterly disinterested in the pirates as people. If you can remind yourself when this was written and what Defoe's aims might have been, you have a good chance of enjoying this colorful, concise work. Very appreciative of Dover for reprinting it!"},{"Title":"The King of Pirates (Hesperus Classics)","review":"This book has very few substance. It relates superficially and coldly the wanderings, victories and booty of the king of pirates, Captain Avery ('good nature ... though I never had much.')As a loose enumeration of unconnected events, it has absolutely not the same standard as Defoe's masterpieces (Robinson Crusoe, Moll Flanders).Not recommended."},{"Title":"One Hand Typing and Keyboarding Manual : With Personal Motivational Messages From Others Who Have Overcome!","review":"Hello! I am Lilly Walters, the author of this manual.If the student has a severe disability regarding an upper limb, they receive a great deal of support from vocational, occupational and vocational therapists, who usually suggest alternative keyboards, and voice activated computers.However, the student with good use of one hand, usually does not receive much attention. They are able to make their way in the world, and don't seek professional advice. So, when it comes to learning to keyboard and type, they are often told, &quot;Oh, you'll learn something else.&quot; I know, I fall into this category. When I was hurt they told my parents, &quot;Oh she'll do other things.&quot; That was bad advice 30 years ago. It is horrible advice today! In today's world, keyboarding skills are vital.If you, or your student, has good use of at least one hand, a standard keyboard can easily be used. When alternative systems are used commonly in the mainstream, then the one-hand typist should commonly be encouraged to should use them. Until then, these people should be helped to use mainstream tools whenever possible.Unfortunately, most researchers suggest the keyboard layout system known as Dvoark. The Dvoark system has layouts for two hands, just the right, or just the left hand. Although it only takes 30 seconds to set up most computers to the Dvoark system, I am strongly against it. My experience is that Dvoark is pushed on the one-handed child by a two handed adult, who themselves does not use the two-handed Dvoark system! (Yes, this makes me crazy).One hundred years ago, typing was a new skill. The typists went so fast (crawling by today's standards) the keys would jam. So they created the QWERTY layout (see the keys on your keyboard starting at the top left) because it was so hard, it slowed us down! Dr. Dvoark came up with a layout that is faster, and easier for the typist, but it is not smarter for the person with one hand.Why use the standard QWERTY one hand typing method?One: Sellablity in the job market. The reality is, the easier it is to bring someone into the workplace, the more appealing they are as an employee. I am a one hand typist. I can step up to any standard keyboard, ask a two handed person to move over, and assist them with the challenges they are facing with the task at hand (no pun intended!). I am not disadvantaged by using me mainstream equipment, my employers are not disadvantaged by hiring me. The 30 seconds needed to change a keyboard over to Dvoark would separate me from the other workers.Two: MY main issue in alternatives to the standard keyboard, is these kids do not want one more reason to feel different. The number one toy today is the computer, hence, the keyboard. Imagine a child not being able to play with his friends because he does not know how to use their &quot;normal&quot; keyboard. Or, if he does play with them, he must struggle to figure out the keyboard they are using. That tiny 30 seconds needed to change a keyboard over to Dvoark is unthinkable to children at play.You can learn to type easily with hand!Arise and GO forth!Lilly Walters, International speaker, author, speakers bureau executive, and one hand typist.

First of all, the List of enemies in the back of the book is COMPLETELY unreliable, for example: Master Tonbery has 44,444 HP, not 8000, and he can be morped into a Ribbon. The little cactus men on Cactuar Island can be morphed into Tetra Elemantals, and ALL the enemies on the crashed Gelinka can be morphed into sorces. It also doesn't tell you where to get certain materias, or states it incorrecly. Final Attack is obtained by defeating the Boss Battle at the battle Square, not the Chocobo Races. Also, whats with the tissues, 1/35 sinra armored attack soldiers, autograpghs, Dio's Diaries, etc. The only good thing about this strategy Guide is that it has near perfect maps (some areas were missed, like the hidded romm in the Great Glaciers) IT ALSO RUINS THE STORY LINE, WHICH IS WHAT RPGS ARE ALL ABOUT.

You can tell that they tried to make it in the order that you'll encounter the enemies, but many of them can be found before and many of them aren't even listed at all. The weapons, items, and materials information at the end is not detailed enough. \\"Side Areas\\" lacks organizations and it isn't very helpful. Where is the help on Enemy Skills? On the walkthrough section, they don't even tell you the right buttons most of the time (not that you need it, though). The numbering/lettering system gets a little bit confusing. A lot of their \\"strategies\\" are based on the same party that they like to use. Not everyone likes to use Aeris, especially if they have played the game before. I could go on and on but I don't want to bore you. On a side note, the PC version (black and white, I can't find it anywhere anymore) by the same author was so much better.

Me, I will sometimes go out and buy the guide just to see what happens next because I get stuck easially. Even my brother, who lives, breathes, and thinks Final Fantasy, thought that this book was wonderful. This book has helped me out of several tough spots. I would not recommend this book to anyone who is a perfectionist, or who is going to go over the game and the guide with a fine toothed comb and complain about every little detail, or to peeople who are good enough that they can beat it in their sleep, but then, why would experts need it? But I would deffiniatly recommend it to everyone else.Overall: Good guide, slightly flawed but all stratagy guides are like that, this guy's boss stratagy's may work for him but they don't for me because my playing style is probly different from his, wonderful maps, good intro and info about characters, exelent written walkthrough, and it will only spoil things for you if you read ahead.9/10 stars"},{"Title":"Official Final Fantasy VII Strategy Guide, Playstation Version (v. 1)","review":"This guide is good, as it features chocobo guides, materia lists, and monsters, but it lacks some things that would have perfected it, such as when the best time to get certain Enemy Skills and reccommended levels.

Horrible. As for telling you where items are, it does a near-perfect job of that, and also the maps are good too. But by the time I got to Disc 3, I was relying on this book only for maps and using an online walkthrough for the rest of it. Only buy it if you're REALLY desperate."},{"Title":"Official Final Fantasy VII Strategy Guide, Playstation Version (v. 1)","review":"I own a strategy guide for every Final Fantasy game, and this one was sorely disappointing. I think the only guide that has been worse than this is the FF9 'PlayOnline' joke (that no longer exists online).The strategy guide leaves out several key elements of the game (such as how to find Aeris' limit break BEFORE disc 2), how you can reach certain areas, where to find items, who to have in your party in certain areas, etc. The information was blatantly inaccurate or extremely confusing. Some of the maps are mislabeled and look more like a random assortment of screenshots than a coherent guide.All in all, don't waste your money on this guide. You're better off buying the Brady version instead."},{"Title":"Official Final Fantasy VII Strategy Guide, Playstation Version (v. 1)","review":"This game is too EASY to need this.

But since it was assembled by Brady Games, I can't say that I'm surprised. It has just about everything you need to know. It gives you information about the heros and their limit breaks to start out. The walkthroughs are written out quite well with maps of each room along with every item you can find.This is also true for towns, such as Kalm. Not only will you see a list of every item, weapon, and materia available, but you will also see the prices for them as well! Talk about saving time. It also lists every enemy in the game (including Bosses!) as well as what item you can steal and/or morph the monster into if it's possible. Other enemy info includes how much money, gil, and AP you get from each one. You will also be able to see their locations as well.Other things you will see are: Level 4 limit breaks and where to find them, ultimate weapons, where to find Yuffie and Vincent. This guide even tells you how to fight against the Ruby, Emerald and Secret Weapon!The only thing I don't like about this guide, is that it doesn't give you a direct list of Enemy Skills for the Enemy Skill materia, you'll have to look at the enemy list for those. Don't worry, it tells you which enemy uses them. Other than that, it has everything you need to know.I recommend this guide for anyone who needs help with this game for any reason."},{"Title":"Official Final Fantasy VII Strategy Guide, Playstation Version (v. 1)","review":"This book was a bit of a challenge. There are some times when it helps and a lot more when it doesn't. I would like to know when the Limits increase, how to learn more Enemy Skills, and about Chocobo breeding. This book doesn't cover these things. It gives you a walkthrough, the plot and some battle tips, but not much else that you can use. (As soon as I figure out how to change the stars, I'm putting it down to a 2-star rating.)"},{"Title":"Official Final Fantasy VII Strategy Guide, Playstation Version (v. 1)","review":"There's usually this weird attitude with games where we need to beat it on our own sans cheat devices or strategy guides/FAQ's. Well when you're dealing with an RPG, it tends to help to have one. So one of the biggest RPG's ever has to have a strategy guide and the one for Final Fantasy VII is quite good although like others said some problems.The book of course has a walkthrough of the game start to finish including tips about bosses, items you may have missed and things to look out for. It's good but you kind of wish there was a full boss blowout since it just mentions the strategy involved. What about recommended party level? The book tends to spoil a lot too such as the big one at the end of Disc I and one of the characters finding himself in Disc 2.After the walkthrough is secrets and sidequests such as getting a Gold Chocobo, tips for the Battle Arena and getting everyone's Ultimate Weapons and Limit Breaks. An old magazine named EGM2(later renamed Expert Gamer) had a guide on the game and they explained the Gold Chocobo thing better than this did. Also a secret involving a library in Shinra Headquarters I'm reading and it's like \\"ok, what?\\"There is some grammatical errors and such but it's usually nothing to get upset about. It's not like he says one item is somewhere but then you find something else. After those there is a beastality(not that kind) where it details all the enemies in the game. Afterwards is a map of the world.It does help with the game if you're stuck but there will be times where the book spoils you or you're told something in a bit poor grammar but oh well."},{"Title":"Official Final Fantasy VII Strategy Guide, Playstation Version (v. 1)","review":"I've had the chance to play all FF games from IV to IX, and many of them are simply amazing (I also enjoy FF6 a full lot!), but I must say that, for me, FF7 is the one I've enjoyed the most.

Speaking as a person who has not mastered every materia or defeated ruby or emerald weapon. However, it is true that i have gone through FFVII a total of 15 times (thats a lot), and my best time is 14 hrs and 36 mins, so i have some good stratagies for beating this game. The first 3 times I beat final fantasy, I used this guide a lot, and after that I only referenced it for Chocobo breeding. Now there are a fer main things that this guide lacks that are essential to the game.1: There is no section on how to level up your limit breaks-for those who don't know, you use the first limit in a level ten times and then when you get the second you kill 80 enemies with anything ACCEPT SUMMONING SPELLS.(NOTE: for vicent you just have to kill 60 enemies at each level, and for cait sith, i think you have to kill 120 enemies before you get slots.)(Thanks to my cousins David and Ryan, without whom i would not know this)2: Enemy readouts are totally unreliable. I went to reference monsters countless times only to discover inaccurate HP numbers, items dropped, items morphed, weaknesses, etc. While bosses were for the most part accurate, the guides to boss fights were hardly definitive (you can come up with much better stratagies on your own).3: THIS BOOK IS FILLED TO THE MAX WITH SPOILERS. Being as I'm complaining about this I won't reveal anything, but trust me there are a lot of them.4: Bone village treasure hunting is almost entirly ignored. (nuff said).5: The Chocobo breeding section is mediocre, only facts not strategy.You could find much better unofficial guides, or better yet online FAQ guides! So, don't waste your money."},{"Title":"Official Final Fantasy VII Strategy Guide, Playstation Version (v. 1)","review":"I haven't seen the &quot;Perfect Guide&quot; by Versus, but I REALLY doubt it could be better than this one. I can't think of 1 thing this guide doesn't have except a list of Enemy Skills, which enemy you get them from, and what they do. However, they do list them in the Enemy List in the back. Other than that, this guide has everything, including all the Ultimate Weapons and Limit Breaks, every kind of Materia and useful combinations, a list of all the enemies, weapons, armors, and accessories, complete strategies to beating enemies, bosses, and mini-games, and anything else I might have missed...oh, yeah, and don't forget how to raise Chocobos and how to get the 4 special kinds. It really couldn't get better than this, and as far as the Enemy Skills go, if you don't like to keep looking in the back of the book, just go online and print a nice list out from a site. Even those skilled and experienced in the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series NEED to get a guide, preferably this one or the one by Versus (they make excellent guides, especially for the &quot;Zelda&quot; series), otherwise they'll miss all the secrets and things you would not be able to figure out by yourself. Trust me, GET THIS GUIDE and you'll be able to fully experience the fun of &quot;Final Fantasy VII.&quot;"},{"Title":"Official Final Fantasy VII Strategy Guide, Playstation Version (v. 1)","review":"I'll say that there are parts of the game that would be very difficult to clear without the book. I'll even say that it helps you play an *almost* perfect game. But it misses out on several points. First, the monster guide is in places incomplete or misprinted. My wife and I, through our own work, found out many things that the book just missed. Master Tonberry morphs into a ribbon. A very helpful fact that completely missed the editors. When I finally turn to the book, I'm looking for completeness, and this just fell short."},{"Title":"Official Final Fantasy VII Strategy Guide, Playstation Version (v. 1)","review":"I would recommend this book highly to anyone wanting a good walkthrough to conquer this game. fairly well laid out,paper in the book is of fairly cheap quality (smears if the book is 'fingered through' enough times). It has heaps of pictures and graphics in it, unlike any online walkthrough you'd find. It WAS lacking in some information that would've been useful in defeating bosses though, but nothing that can't be figured out with common sense."},{"Title":"Official Final Fantasy VII Strategy Guide, Playstation Version (v. 1)","review":"Final fantasy 7 is a great game but this guide won't help you. it has wayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy too many errors. One example is it doen't list the info on the ultimate weapons. Where the information should be it is blank. It also leaves out many secrets like the ultimate battle arena. It says to get final attack from chocobo racing but you need to get it from the ultimate battle arena. And lastly it gives away the story. Unfortunatly it is pretty much the only guide out there. So if you need help you might as well buy it."},{"Title":"Official Final Fantasy VII Strategy Guide, Playstation Version (v. 1)","review":"This Book was very helpfull, but I have several complaints about it. First of all, the List of enemies in the back of the book is COMPLETELY unreliable, for example: Master Tonbery has 44,444 HP, not 8000, and he can be morped into a Ribbon. The little cactus men on Cactuar Island can be morphed into Tetra Elemantals, and ALL the enemies on the crashed Gelinka can be morphed into sorces. It also doesn't tell you where to get certain materias, or states it incorrecly. Final Attack is obtained by defeating the Boss Battle at the battle Square, not the Chocobo Races. Also, whats with the tissues, 1/35 sinra armored attack soldiers, autograpghs, Dio's Diaries, etc. The only good thing about this strategy Guide is that it has near perfect maps (some areas were missed, like the hidded romm in the Great Glaciers) IT ALSO RUINS THE STORY LINE, WHICH IS WHAT RPGS ARE ALL ABOUT. Buy it only if you are completly stuck, or go online. There are much better guides online, plus their free. Ok, I think thats it. And OZZY RULES!"},{"Title":"Official Final Fantasy VII Strategy Guide, Playstation Version (v. 1)","review":"With the help of this guide I have obtained and done everything that is possible in FFVII. It would probably have been virtually impossible to complete this game in it's entirety without the help of this guide. All of the sidequests are outlined to perfection and there is a lot of detail included on how to finish it all. The highly informative strategies for the two hardest bosses in the game are also great if you really want to &quot;complete&quot; the game.

This paper back will keep you alive and then some!"},{"Title":"Official Final Fantasy VII Strategy Guide, Playstation Version (v. 1)","review":"This is hands-down the absolute worst game guide I have ever had the misfortune of attempting to use and David Cassady should be ashamed of himself. Please don't waste your money on this guide, if you'd really like to own it I'd recommend you contact me and I'll gladly sell you my version, in which I've made about a million painstaking corrections throughout the guide in pen.I recently did a run-through of Final Fantasy VII and realized I had this guide book lying around, so I thought to myself, \\"Hey, I'll use the guide and do some sidequests and that kind of thing\\". Little was I to know that any and all sidequests that may be included in Final Fantasy VII are completely missing from this guide (with the sole exception of the Turtle Flyers thing). Not only that, but even information important to progressing the storyline is completely missing or entirely incorrect. In some places, numbers used to link maps together go to the wrong place, leaving you hopelessly lost. In others, information directly contradicts information given on the next page, leaving you to figure it out yourself.As others have mentioned, the guide certainly isn't spoiler-free, and while I already knew who was going to die (and when), I was surprised to see it was spelled right out with large words and direct screencaps of the death sequence - and not after it would have logically also happened in-game. I was also shocked to see that, when visiting a peaceful and idyllic town for the first time, the guide told me, \\"You'll want to come back here after (Town Name) has been destroyed to [blah blah blah]\\". I thought, \\"Wait... this town gets destroyed?\\", instantly felt cheated, and began to wonder why I was even playing the game when the plot was being forcibly revealed to me by the guide. I expected to turn the page and read about Snape killing Dumbledore and Rosebud being the name of the sled by the time I was done, Mr. Cassady seemed so spoiler-happy.Here are a few more issues I had with this guide:* The snowboarding/glacier section, already stressful and irritating enough, was made even mores by Cassady's glaringly incorrect maps and turn-taking directions, which contradicted each other from page to page. I had to eventually look between two online guides before I could make any sense of Cassady's sadistic directions.* Important information was entirely missing from the book, including HOW to get Limit Breaks. Instead, an entire two pages per character are dedicated to showing pretty pictures of the limit breaks while explaining what the limit break does (in order to help us understand the graphics?). Believe me, I don't CARE if Cloud does a pirouette, a backflip, and a ten-point highdive before he drives his Buster Sword into the enemy. I'll eventually see it for myself. I'd rather know what I have to do in order to get the limit break. Eventually, I had to go onto the Final Fantasy Wiki online and look up each character's article so I could write down how to obtain each limit break in the book itself. Another important piece of information that could have saved me a lot of grief: your battle points disappear when you leave the Battle Arena. Oops!* Speaking of the Gold Saucer, the first time it's encountered, Cassady has a small note stating that a man outside will sell GP for gil, and he'll be waiting just outside a house partially hidden behind the rail car. Cassady stated he only appears sometimes, and that you have to come in and out of the entrance sometimes to see if he'll be there, so naturally, I did. I did this about twenty-five times before I realized there was literally no way my luck could be that bad and finally went online to look it up. It turns out that the GP-selling man doesn't come in until MUCH later in the game, but Cassady didn't feel it necessary to mention that to me.There are probably a million more things I could say here, but I won't bother, because writing about the whole experience of struggling to make sense out of this flawed piece of junk is just making me angry all over again. If you have even a lick of sense in your body, please do not waste your money on this drivel. You're much better looking for all the answers you need online, or using an online guide (although I had to use a combination of two online guides, both were miles better than Cassady's insult to my intelligence). The rage I hold towards this guide is so high that I'd very much like to upload a customer picture of the guide (specifically, my copy of the guide) on fire."},{"Title":"Official Final Fantasy VII Strategy Guide, Playstation Version (v. 1)","review":"Like all RPG's, if u don't have the strategy guide, it's very very hard &amp; unlikely u will find everything in the game.

For instance, in the Crater, you can morph a Tonberry into a Ribbon. This is extremely useful and it's not mentioned in the guide.

If you get stuck on a part of the game that the book doesn't cover you can email me at packard12@hotmail.com."},{"Title":"Official Final Fantasy VII Strategy Guide, Playstation Version (v. 1)","review":"Tha guide was great! I especially liked the secrets portion of the book. They covered everything from the Chocobos to Materia Locations. The only bad part, if you can even call it bad, was that it didn't give a recomended level for the current and up-coming missions. This also left me guessing whenever I encountered a boss. But overall the guide was great."},{"Title":"Official Final Fantasy VII Strategy Guide, Playstation Version (v. 1)","review":"Well I just recieved Final Fantasy VII for my birthday and I loved it from the start. When one of my friends came over he had the Official Strat. Guide and so I took a look at it.

I found, however, that the strategy guide is severely lacking in a lot of the game's secrets, one being the character Zack. This is the most important thing that is not covered. It sounds like a rumor, but it's not. There is a way to &quot;heal&quot; Zack (the man in the pipe) but the strategy guide makes absolutely not mention of it. It tells you that you can't do anything with the 1/35 soldiers and the Murasame Blade but you can. I think this is really fishy. Maybe squaresoft is hiding something. Hmmm.

The walkthrough is only good if you do not want to find everything the game has to offer. The only way you will get everything in the game is if you read the book first and then play the game, which should not be the case for a strategy guide. For one, the secrets/side quest area is in the back and there is no mention during the walkthrough if you might be missing something (or no reference to the side quests). A few of the side quests only give you one chance to perform that task and without warning, such as the case with this guide, you will definitely miss it (ex. Turtle Paradise posters in Shinra HQ). Another problem is the grammatical errors with which the guide is filled. I have perused the guide for FF8, which I believe is fantastic, and this guide does not even compare. You are better off downloading &amp; following the free walkthroughs online instead of wasting money on this guide."},{"Title":"Official Final Fantasy VII Strategy Guide, Playstation Version (v. 1)","review":"I bought this guide back when the game was new, so there may have been revisions since then. However, the guide currently decaying in a box in my basement deserves its fate and then some. Filled with inaccuracies, anyone who accomplishes anything using this guide must have some sort of guardian angel, either that or they're an idiot savant. With such strong feelings, I'm afraid I only remember a few specific examples: the entire bestiary seemed to have been formed by hitting the keyboard until they met their quota, and yet it remains incomplete; monsters with the wrong pictures, or no picture at all; misnamed materia listed with a multitude of inaccurate information. There are many more things that are wrong with this guide, but just writing about this thing is making me mad, so I think I'll stop."},{"Title":"Official Final Fantasy VII Strategy Guide, Playstation Version (v. 1)","review":"i own several guidebooks, most of them being FF guidebooks. This one is by far the worst i ever bought. the text is full of typos and grammar errors and much of the information is confusing because it is inaccurate. I had already beat FF7 several times and then i bought this guide to see if it would tell me anything more. Nope! It sucks. I tried to beat it following the guide and i was actually confused! And i'd already beat the game! That says something awful. The only thing that was even useful were the maps and the bestiary.

This walkthrough is a helpful guide through the complex world of Midgar, Shinra, Cloud and party, Chocobos and monsters. Loads of technical info help equip Materia and items, weapons and accessories properly.The relatively low resolution of the Playstation game is a difficulty present generation gamers need help with (like me). It is sometimes hard to tell just what is going on when the charachters look like they are Lego people shooting pixels.At times I found the walkthrough maps dense, too dark, and filled with letters and numbers not easy to relate to a legend.The sequence of your wanderings is essential for a coherent story. This walkthrough pays close attention to this need and has allowed me to experience the memorable encounters and hi-res scenes recently recreated in Advent Children so well.This walkthrough is already dog-eared and worn though I'm barely halfway through.

The walkthrough is great, but that's pretty much all this book features. A quick overview of limit breaks is good, but the fly-by of the side quests leaves a lot to be desired. The bestiary is kind of goofy too. They've improved on these guides for the more recent games, but in comparison this one just seems kind of flimsy. It's a nice tool the first time around,especially because this game can get pretty difficult to master, but afterwards it isn't all that useful."},{"Title":"Official Final Fantasy VII Strategy Guide, Playstation Version (v. 1)","review":"I've played this game many times. The guide has always been just that, a guide. There are several misspellings, diagrams can become unclear and confusing, and there are many items that should be included that are not.

I would recommend it to anyone needed a helping hand."},{"Title":"Official Final Fantasy VII Strategy Guide, Playstation Version (v. 1)","review":"Mr. Cassady provides the gamer with a complete front-to-back walkthru, all while preserving the delicate storyline and never unwrapping any unwanted spoilers in the process.As you'll also notice, everything is neatly organized on the pages; nothing is crammed. Pictures, enemy stats, and the walkthru text are all snug on the pages.The guide is also very versatile. For instance, if you want a better look at some of the monsters you face, turn to the Bestiary, an in depth study of the monsters, their weaknesses, and their strengths (and it even tells you where you'll see them).When you come across a puzzle in the game, and you cant figure it out, the guide will give you several hints before they reveal the 'final answer', in an attempt to keep the gamer guessing and playing without feeling cheated of the exploration process.I gave this strategy guide a 5.UPDATE: Upon further review, I did discover that this strategy guide overlooks particular elements. The chocobo breeding/racing section could benefit from a makeover, and some items are not mentioned. For a person seeking a perfect play-through, acquiring all items and collectibles, this guide lacks the necessary depth. On a more recent play-through, I found myself supplementing Cassady's guide with an online GameFAQs walkthrough. For this reason, I'm amending the original score; I give the book a 4 out of 5."},{"Title":"Official Final Fantasy VII Strategy Guide, Playstation Version (v. 1)","review":"This great game is HUGE and often very complex esp. with all the hidden stuff.This guide is excellent and helps you with everything;a definite must have if you plan to tackle this game!"},{"Title":"Official Final Fantasy VII Strategy Guide, Playstation Version (v. 1)","review":"A lot of people said that this guide have a lot of spoilers, well, yes it has a lot of spoilers but it only goin to ruin you the story if you keep reading.I only read what I want to now(example information of the boss)and play the game, after kill the boss or pass the puzzle, i read again what goes next, the people who said that has spoilers , they are just sain that, because they couldn\`t beat the curiosity.The Guide is excellent, the walkthroughs are very informative and the explanation is very good with a lot of details, the bestiary, materia lists, weapons and boss estrategies are excellent too.I recommend this guide to everyone who has this masterpiece,because the game is long and with this you going to take all the secrets that this game has to offer.

The stunning and amazing storyline is like no other, you are a 21 year old named Cloud, he wants to go and join the army group called SOLDIER, he wants to be like the amazing Sephiroth. He is leaving for the city of Midgar. He goes, and he ends up not making it to SOLDIER. He becomes a mercenary and he ends up working for the rebel assault team named AVALANCHE, they want to help to save the earth, they want to destroy all the mako reactors that suck all the energy out of the planet. At first he doesn't care about them trying to save the earth, he just wants to get paid and leave. He changes throughout the game and he ends up joining AVALANCHE and he wants to save the earth now from Sephiroth, and from the company of Shinra, Cloud takes . What started as a job for Cloud, suddenly became a race to save the earth from his mentor, and his idol. The rest of the storyline is amazing, I just don't want to spoil it for you, you should buy this game and play it. You won't be sorry.I suggest you buy this game it is the best game you will ever play in your life. Even if you don't like RPG's this one will change your mind forever about RPG's, it did it for me.Out of a possible 100% I would give this game a definate 100%. The music is brillant, the storyline is amazing, the characters are exeptional, and the battle system is absolutely the best battle system out of all the Final Fantasy's.

I recommend it to anyone..."},{"Title":"Official Final Fantasy VII Strategy Guide, Playstation Version (v. 1)","review":"Overall the guide has everything an new or even partially expirenced player will need to get through the game. The boss guides are excellent and the basic walkthrough gets you where you need to go, and explains of Materias Uses, so whats wrong with it?Vets, after paying attention to the gameplay and the guide will realize some things wrong with it quite quickly. for example, the guide explains how youll encounter Master Tonberries with 8,000 hp, when they have 44,444. The book has no infomation on Movers (Red Balls) which are a useful gil collecters (30.000 each) + ap gainers. They can be found where the Magic Pots are. It dosent even have a &quot;enemie skill&quot; list. It also explains nothing about morphing master tonnberries (ribbon) Unknowns (sources) Cactuars (Tetra Elemental)As you see the guide has many flaws, but is still a nice explanation of getting through the game, i honestly dont recommand it if you've past this great title before thoughLaterz"},{"Title":"Official Final Fantasy VII Strategy Guide, Playstation Version (v. 1)","review":"I bought this guide first of all as a Final Fantasy series fan and in second place to get all my game could provide.

So why 4 stars you ask, well for the simple fact that the book is flawed in some areas. Like for instance the map for the Gi cave. The map shows the entrance into the Gi cave to be on top with a #2 well this is #1 the entrance\\\\exit to cosmo canyon from the Gi cave not the entrance to the main cave at the bottom that goes to the real #2. I sat there for five minutes trying to figure out how to climb up, when in fact I was supposed to be climbing down. Yes this is a slap myself upside the head an say duh moment, but a book flaw none the less. Another minor flaw I noticed was that the Gi spector was listed twice in the monster list. The next one is not really a flaw but a left out secret I stumbled onto accidently. In the Gaea Cliffs the book leaves out what I think is the best accessory in the game, and that is the ribbon, which I found by accident while going through the caves of the Gaea Cliffs. And the only other ribbon you will be able to get in the game until the last cd, where you can morph a Master Tonberry into one. But for some reason this is totally missing from the book, even the hidden area in where to find it. Another thing I noticed were alot of the monster morphs were missing as well, especially morphs to get magic source, and mind source, and ribbons, etc etc... I have to say one thing \\"thank God for the internet\\". My suggestion is, get the book it'll show what you can't get in a written walkthrough on the net, which is pretty well made maps and item placement, and also tells you pratically everything you need to know, despite the flaws and a few missing items and details. And if your a really hard core gamer, and like maxing out your characters, and don't mind wasting your time doing so, or just plain don't have a life like myself, go on the internet and find a monster morph list, and a secret missing items list for a extra reference to the book, and play your heart out.hint: For monster morphs, use a monster morph list from the net, and then find the picture of the monster your looking for in the list in the back of this book, so you will know what the monster you want to morph looks like.Peace out."},{"Title":"Official Final Fantasy VII Strategy Guide, Playstation Version (v. 1)","review":"I find this guide EXTREMELY well put together.

Now I know that's part of the challenge is figuring out how to defeat them. But if Cassady's intentions were to put them into the guide in the first place, he should have at least gave more than what he wrote.In addition, the Chocobo raising guide is bleaker than a rainy Sunday. Sure it tells you how to achieve the infamous Golden Chocobo. Though does it tell you to race 9 times to reach class S? Does it tell you the possible great prizes to be won for dominating races?Another interesting thing is the amount of cool materia that is shown in the back, yet half of them aren't even expressed in the guide.It's pretty sad that I had to go online to find out where to obtain some of them.For those of you buying the guide, I'd advise against it. Invest ten dollars on bubble-gum."},{"Title":"Official Final Fantasy VII Strategy Guide, Playstation Version (v. 1)","review":"DONT BUY THIS ONE. If you read this guide the game will become boring.

The guide gives EVERYTHING (and I do mean absolutely everything, i.e.: end of Disc One) away, story-wise. Why? The only reason I could come up with is to pretty the pathetic content up. When you have so many screenshots of the game and the CG movies it distracts you from what is otherwise a lackluster excuse for a guide. As already mentioned, enemy stats are wrong, about 50% of the secrets are missing, fighting &quot;strategies&quot; are useless, and it lacks simple information one would expect out of a guide like this, like enemy skills.The biggest contrast is seen when this garbage is compared against the most excellent Versus Books guide by Casey Loe. It is like night and day. That guide spoiled nothing and actually gave you secrets and everything you needed to know. If you can find it, consider yourself lucky. So good that Cassady actually completely aped its style for FFVIII's &quot;official&quot; (read: money-driven trash) guide.Do yourself a favor and stay as far away from this guide as possible; avoid it like the plague and destroy one if you have the chance.

Such as bosses stats not being displayed in the walkthrough and even more incorrect stats(for example on pg.202 Helletic Hojo's Arms have &quot;Midgar&quot; written in where their HP should be!).

This Guidebook contains a MONUMENTAL amount of errors. Do not expect to obtain all of the goodies in the game using this book. This book is merely a recitation of the sequence of events in the game. I do not recommend this book unless all you care about is beating the game. This book WILL NOT, I repeat, WILL NOT help you get the games coolest items like the Sneak Attack Materia, Sprint Shoes, Superball, Flayer, and MANY others that the author so conveniently omited. Nearly every other item in this book is mispelled, incorrectly described, or completely erroneous. The only positive thing about the book are the maps, however the items are not all properly labeled for easy reference. I would only use this guidebook for maps, use gamefaqs.com for ALL other information. Since the maps are the ONLY good thing about this guide I give it a 1star/ 5."},{"Title":"Official Final Fantasy VII Strategy Guide, Playstation Version (v. 1)","review":"I found this book really easy to read and to understand, it DOES give you the enemy skills in the beistiary, underneath the monsters name.It clearly states what to do, gives you EXTREEMLY useful info on what mateiria to equip bafore a boss, and also good character bios telling you how to use characters to bring out there best abilities, which is very useful for 1st timers.Its secret section pages are useful.... I've been playing FF VIIfor 2 years and have never heard of some of the things in those pages ( I suppose you could call me an ignoramus but there are more ignoramuses out there other than me!)Ok, so its gives away the plot but if u didnt want the plot given away WHY THE HELL DID YOU WANT TO BUY A WALKTHROUGH!?!?!? This is one of the best walkthroughs I've seen and definatly the best on FF VII dont mis out! Buy it!"},{"Title":"Official Final Fantasy VII Strategy Guide, Playstation Version (v. 1)","review":"This book is very controversial. It has a good walkthrough, but the enemy listing is very unreliable, ex. The Master Tonberry can be morphed into a ribbon- it says it doesnt morph, and I think a ribbon is the best acc. there is. If you purchase this book, buy it the same time you buy the game-don't buy it very far into the 2nd disc- it quickly becomes useless. I gave it a 4 because it has a good walkthrough and a good listing of the materia,items,weapons-and the chocobo guide is quite descriptive. But this game is easily beatable without it. (I would know)"},{"Title":"Official Final Fantasy VII Strategy Guide, Playstation Version (v. 1)","review":"I think a lot of people over look the difference between a strategy guide and a walkthrough. If you want to be walked through the game step by step theres tons of free FAQ's on line. This guide is the same as every other official guide for a game. It's a GUIDE, its meant to help you along while you do most of the work. Thats what a guide is.One thing I heard a lot of people complain about is that this book is full of spoilers. While that may be true, its your own fault if you let it spoil you. Don't want to be spoiled? Then don't read ahead of the part of the game you're in.Another thing I heard a lot of complaints about is wrong info and typo's. While I haven't read through the entire book so far, I've yet to come across any wrong info. As far as typo's, I may have seen one or two but I wouldn't go as far as to say this book is \\"loaded\\" with them.Yet another bad thing I've heard about this book are the maps. I think the maps are fine. The world map is the last page, makes it real easy to be able to flip to it while holding the page you're on. Also, the towns and areas are lettered and in the order that you have to visit them. For instance, Midgar is lettered \\"A\\" and the second town is \\"B\\" and so on. As for the maps of the towns and dungeons, I'll have to admit they sometimes get a little hard to read. But if they confuse you and you can't figure them out, you should consider going back to school. I think the game itself is some times confusing, when you're on a certain screen sometimes it isn't clear right away which way you need to go (where entrances and exits are) and the maps match that. I'm going to stop referring to them as maps because they're actually screen shots of the game itself.This guide is perfect for some one who hasn't played through the game before. One thing I really liked about it was it gives you steal suggestions. For example, it suggests to steal a certain weapon outside of the first town instead of buying the weapon upgrade in the town. Not only do you save the money, but its a stronger weapon. Better yet, the weapon is available to buy in the next town so you saved on buying two items and had the stronger weapon all the while. Another example would be the guide suggesting to steal a certain armor while in a dungeon. Its stronger then what was currently available and better yet free.I don't give the guide 5 starts because I feel it could have been better, but this isn't a bad guide at all. It could have had a better explanation of materia to beginners, and might have been a little weak in some other explanations. But all the info you need for anything is in the game itself. This is how an RPG works, you have to talk to every one. If you're upset that this guide doesn't hold you hand and tell you how to do everything step by step then I don't know what you're doing playing an RPG game. Half the fun of an RPG game is discovery.If you're playing this game for the first time and you want something to help you when you get stuck, then this guide is for you. Its also nice to look over an area after you've completed it to see if you missed anything. I recommend it to anyone playing the game for the first time.Please remember the difference between a guide and a walkthrough ;)"},{"Title":"Official Final Fantasy VII Strategy Guide, Playstation Version (v. 1)","review":"This Guide is worth paying for 11.00.It tells all the imformation about limit breaks, bosses, and it makes the imformation easy to understand.Against bosses of beginning magic spells makes it easy to deafeat a boss,for example against the red dragon it tells its weaknesses and tells what to start out with using the first magic bio2 while casting barrier on the team.If it wasnt for this guide I would never have beaten Final Fantasy Vll."},{"Title":"Official Final Fantasy VII Strategy Guide, Playstation Version (v. 1)","review":"This is one of the worst game guides I have read in my life...and I've read a few.

I later got the guide from Versus Books and it blew this pathetic book out of the water. It spoiled nothing and had twice the amount of useful secrets (including materia combos). Don't waste your time (and money) with this joke. Thankfully, BRADYGames realized its idiocy, fixed it, and got it right for FFVIII's guide (which basically aped FFVII's Versus Books' guide's style).

This one is by far the worst strategy guide. Simply too many errors, too many mislabeling of entrance/exit and items in each area, missing labels, wrong information, etc. Language is also at times unclear, as if the author was only writing with Middle school level English. It is adequate to help you get through the game easily, but not worth the price. You might as well look for the online FAQ."},{"Title":"Official Final Fantasy VII Strategy Guide, Playstation Version (v. 1)","review":"The description said I was to receive the Playstation version of the strategy guide.

But honestly, I feel that at this point there are better ones online that are easier to find and follow. For example, if you like to actually 'play' a game and do not do everything step by step as in this walkthrough, it is hard to search for specific quests that you may have missed.Also, when this game first came out I had a guide that was MUCH better than this one. After searching online I realized it was the Versus guide (I remembered the cover). Unfortunately, to buy that guide you generally have to spend a significant amount of money since the company is out of business - maybe I will scour my parents' house next time I go home. Regardless, when I first ordered it I was hoping to get the same guide I had before which was obviously not the case.Bottom line (my advice): If you are in need of a guide, I would recommend looking for one online because I have the guide and rely almost primarily on an online FF7 guide rather than looking anything up in the book."},{"Title":"Official Final Fantasy VII Strategy Guide, Playstation Version (v. 1)","review":"this guide is great for final fantasy 7 it has clear photo and easy to read."},{"Title":"Official Final Fantasy VII Strategy Guide, Playstation Version (v. 1)","review":"Having ordered game guides from bookstores before, ordering from amazon was much easier and easier on my wallet"},{"Title":"Official Final Fantasy VII Strategy Guide, Playstation Version (v. 1)","review":"the product i recieved was in great comdition. i recieved the product in a timely manner, and i am very satisfied with the transaction."},{"Title":"Official Final Fantasy VII Strategy Guide, Playstation Version (v. 1)","review":"This ranks fairly high as perhaps one of the worst official game guides in the history of rpg's.Numerous Cons:Misleading and incorrect informationIneffective strategies for the game's most significant challengesMajor plot spoilers throughout the walkthrough, the guide reads like a storybookMissing information, many items and statistics are not listedThis guide will take a great deal out of your first experience with the game. Just about all of the game's most important plot points will be spoiled for you. Using this walkthrough is akin to bringing someone to the movie theatre that tells you exactly what is going to happen before it happens every time. He also gives you bad directions to the bathroom, and it turns out that yellow liquid he gave you for your popcorn wasn't butter. Oops! On top of that you had to pay his way. Does that sound like fun? If harmfull misinformation and irritating spoilers are your idea of fun, then I bet it does.Perhaps one of the poorest conceived game guides I've ever had the displeasure of using, the only value that can be found here is as a collector's item for the die hard Final Fantasy 7 fan. The only reason to score this higher than one star is if you want to keep it as a collector's item because you must own absolutely everything Final Fantasy. However, in terms of grading it for what it's intended purpose was this guide is worse than useless. The guide had some great art and screenshots, but it doesn't really do much to negate the glaring flaws. Two stars out of five is generous.If you need a guide to get you through Final Fantasy 7 there are superior free alternatives all over the web. Most of them won't tell you the whole story before you get to experience it either. Buyer beware, this guide is the true villain of Final Fantasy VII.

Also, this book doesn't contain all of the knitty-gritty secret stuff, but only things like Hidden Items. It says nothing about the Hidden Duel to get Final Attack or anything like that.

My CD shopping list is never ending now and I don't have money to spare for the things I 'need'.Thanks for that.It's okay though, you can't just listen to the 'Stripes ALL the time, or maybe you can, but you NEED the Dirtbombs. You NEED the Detroit Cobras. YOU NEED THE(e) HEADCOATS!!!(and Headcoatees).Anyway, the book is good.A lot of people seem to dislike True, thinking he's an arrogant, name-dropping, hanger-on looking to cash in on his favourite bands. I just think he's a pretty good writer who knows how to sell a band as well as slag one off, but all I really care about is the bands, the hangouts, the records and the stories, which is what you get here.And it is a pretty good 'Stripes biography, for the time-being at least.ESSENTIALL for anyone with an interest in Detroit garage rock."},{"Title":"Chevrolet performance handbook (Hot rod magazine technical library)","review":"Old school very nice automotive history.

Gandhi and the Rev'd Charles Freer Andrews","review":"CF (&quot;Charlie&quot;) Andrews was given the short shrift in the movie based on Gandhi's life. He was the only one to call Gandhi by the nickname, &quot;Mohan,&quot; and was considered by Gandhi himself to be the highest representative of Christianity. Andrews himself had already moved from a high Christology to a Christianity based on such things as the Epistle of James and many of the Kingdom of God statements before meeting Gandhi. In this wonderfully short but insightful book, one is taken from their earliest correspondence up to the death of Andrews. A very powerful image that remains in my mind is the picture of Andrews in the hospital with Gandhi standing next to him holding Andrew's hand in both of his. For anyone interested in history, there's much inside information from the two men but of primary importance is the value they expressed in religion and how it shaped their lives. In a day when we take multiple religious crossings for granted, Gandhi and Charlie were forerunners, pioneers in a day of strife and conflict."},{"Title":"Proposals","review":"I was in this play production at my local college!

I performed in this show as Clemma Diggins. She is an insightful character with a sharp tongue. Her moments as narrator come at the right time to add suspense and in some places a bit of comic relief. Her entrances allow the other characaters plights to be built up but not to go over the edge. For example, the bird funeral could get ridiculous, but fortunately Clemma shows up and like a chorus leads us through the action with out having to see it.

I give Ms. Steel all the thanks, this book really has an impact."},{"Title":"The Gift (Danielle Steel)","review":"I loved this book. It is the way I imagine things happened when my older sister, whom I never knew, passed away at the age of 2. I cried when I read this book, as I do with a lot of D.S. books. I like how she identifies her books with specific times in history and describes real events to paint the picture of the book's time period."},{"Title":"The Gift (Danielle Steel)","review":"This was my first book that I read by Danielle Steel and I loved the tenderness of the story. I found a used copy at a thrift shop and thought I would give it a try since the price was right and it seemed short. I was expecting very cheesy romance and lusty situations and got a beautifully written emotional adventure. This opened me up to wanting to read more of her books, which I am currently doing. I highly recommend it, especially for a first time DS reader."},{"Title":"The Gift (Danielle Steel)","review":"The Gift is a sweet book...classic Danielle Steel book.

I sincerely recommend this novel to anyone who has ever lost someone they love!"},{"Title":"The Gift (Danielle Steel)","review":"I had seen a few TV movie adaptations of Danielle Steel's novels but never got the time to reading any of her books. So I finally decide to get \`The Gift', seeing that it would be a short read, just to give her books a try. I must say that I loved reading this book, and have already bought other books of hers to add to my bookshelf.5 year old Annie Whittaker died of meningitis, the day after Christmas, leaving a bruise on the rest of the family: Tommy, her brother; Elizabeth, her mother; and John, her father. Each member of the family slowly secludes themselves from one another in their own way. What used to be a close knit family doesn't exist now. Meanwhile, we are introduced to Maribeth Robertson, a 16 year old girl who makes a mistake that would change her life. She runs away from her family and friends, and starts working in a restaurant as a waitress, where she meets Tommy. The two immediately hit it off, but there are a lot of problems standing in their way which they must face.The story is very sweet, and we get to read how Maribeth changes the Whittakers and makes them a family again. Though the ending is a little sad, you feel touched by the story overall. Danielle Steel, famous of writing matters of the heart, does an excellent job in depicting the love between two lovers, between a mother and a daughter, and the love within the family.Whether you are a fan of Danielle Steel or not, if you like reading romantic novels, then this book will be a perfect \`gift' for you."},{"Title":"The Gift (Danielle Steel)","review":"This story is short, but you wish it were longer. However, it is it's &quot;shortness&quot; that gives it so much life and the reader so much enjoyment. Good book"},{"Title":"The Gift (Danielle Steel)","review":"I am a senior in my English reading class. I enjoy reading romance novels, comedies and some mysteries. I've read a lot of Danielle Steele's books and I love all of them, she writes a lot of romance novels and those are my favorite to read that is why I was first attracted to The Gift.This is a book is about two families that have suffered tragedies and are trying to get there lives back. In the first part of the book you meet a perfect and happy family that loves each other very much, when there family is torn apart by an unexpected loss they struggle to stay close.After that happens the book switches settings and you meet a young teenager struggling to get an education that her father says she can't have. This girl is devastated to find out something that will change her life forever.

This is an exciting and sad book as you watch these two families cope and help each other with there tragedies.Overall, I really enjoyed this book. It was like an emotional rollercoaster, it made me laugh and it made me cry.

It has some adventures, comedies, and tear jerking parts. I got hooked on this book and couldn't stop reading it until I was finished. As the book opens, little Annie Whittaker is a happy little girl that her parents could not want more from. Whittaker's are a family of four: John, Liz, Tommy, and Annie. Tommy is Annie's older brother. He was an only child until he was ten. The parents, John and Liz, really wanted another child, but finally after three miscarriages they had Annie. Annie and Tommy got along so well and always loved to be around each other, unlike most siblings. It was near Christmas and the children were excited! At this time they were 5 and 15. One morning, two days before Christmas, they woke up to a town filled with snow. They went outside and made a snowman. That night, Tommy went to tell Annie good night and noticed her head was hot. Thinking nothing about it, he didn't tell his parents. In the morning, Christmas Eve, Annie woke up with a really high fever. They sent her to bed. It was Christmas, and Annie was still asleep. It was always a thing for Annie to wake up bright and early on Christmas. She woke up and barely moved. She fell back to sleep, and they took her to the doctor. There she was put into a hospital with Meningitis, a very futile disease. She died on Christmas and the Whittaker's lost they're only Christmas Gift. After this scene had ended it takes you to the home of Maribeth. She is going to a dance and her father won't let her wear the dress she wants to. At the dance, she gets pregnant. When she realizes that the father won't take care of the baby with her, her parents send her to a nun adoption home to have her baby. When Maribeth arrives there, she is horrified. She leaves there and goes to Omaha to get job. She is a waitress at a restaurant. One night, a guy who is always eating supper there, walks in and stats talking to Maribeth. His name is Tommy Whittaker. They get to know each other better and they become great friends and fall in love. While all of this happening, John and Liz are still very upset about Annie. They barely even talk to each other or Tommy. They never have meals together, and that's why Tommy is always at the restaurant. When Tommy founds out she is pregnant, he tells his parents, and with the parents wanting a child, they are willing to adopt the baby. Seven months later, John and Liz Whittaker are the parents of a baby girl, Kate. After the birth is over, Maribeth, not wanting to go back, goes to her home. She has to go back for school and her worrying family. She leaves Tommy behind but she will always love him and he her."},{"Title":"The Gift (Danielle Steel)","review":"This is the first Danielle Steel book I've read, but I simply loved it!! It's a great heart warming story. Although it leaves you wondering about the two main character's future, the book gives me hope... hope that there is a love two people can share, a true love that sees no judgment, just feeling... it gives me hope for the main characters... and it gives me hope that one day I'll just walk into some new place and who knows... lightning could strike... and my life will change for the better. Somewhat perdicable, although I would have preferred a different ending... some stories are wonderful to read even if you know how it unfolds. I hope there will be a sequel about Maribeth and Tommy... a made-for-tv-movie about this would be nice too."},{"Title":"The Gift (Danielle Steel)","review":"Set in the 1950s, The Gift by Danielle Steel is a touching novel about two separate families who meet and are changed by a special gift. It begins with the story of Tommy Whittaker and his family. They have a beautiful daughter named Annie, whose love changed the family into happiness and cheer. When her senseless death arises, the family is crushed; the loving marriage starts to unravel and Tommy begins to fend for himself, going out to eat by himself and rarely talking with his parents.Then the story switches over to a girl named Maribeth Robertson who has one meaningless experience with a boy, and ends up pregnant. Her father sends her to the nun's and tells her not to come home until she gets rid of it. When she arrives, she hates it there and decides to leave with the money her father gave her to pay the nuns. She takes the train to a city where she gets a job at a caf&eacute;. One day she was working, that is where the two families first intertwine.Tommy walks in to have dinner and Maribeth waits on him, eventually Tommy comes in everyday and he and Maribeth become very close. They share personal secrets about their lives, and become each other 's need that they were looking for. Maribeth becomes very close with the Whittakers and helps to bind the family back together. When the baby arrives, it is the gift to the Whittaker family of a new baby girl and a gift to Maribeth because she knows that the baby is in good care. When Mrs. Whittaker accepts her offer of adoption it is so emotional and uplifting.This is such a touching story that I think is aimed more at a younger audience. It is a lesson to young girls out there to be careful, and a message to the world that a kind person can change a life. I really enjoyed reading this and it is a short read definitely worth a try!"},{"Title":"The Gift (Danielle Steel)","review":"Danielle Steele did an excellent job when she wrote this book. It is a wonderful drama that puts a warmth in your heart, and a tear in your eye. This is a very touching book that covers a very touching subject. Everyone in the family can learn a lesson from this book, and it will bring them closer together. This touching drama deserves more, but I give it five stars."},{"Title":"The Gift (Danielle Steel)","review":"I really liked this book. I found it quite enjoyable, except I already knew what was going to happen a little while after starting it. Also, it left me wondering what happened to Tommy and Maribeth at the end. Did she come back to visit? Did they get married? I would reccomend it though, because it was a great story."},{"Title":"The Gift (Danielle Steel)","review":"The author, Danielle Steel, caught my eye right away and held it throghtout this book. As Elizabeth Wittaker (the main character) still believed in dreams, everything had started changing; dreams had definitely left her beliefs. To begin, a happy home was destroyed by a child's senseless death. Nothing had seemed to matter throughtout Elizabeth's life after that.Throughtout this story, I seemed to relate to Annie the most (Elizabeth's daughter). When she suddenly became sick and senseless, I could relate to that. Personally, throughtout reading this book, when Annie was rushed to the hospital, I felt as though something had been the matter with me and I needed a doctor. At that point in the story, Elizabeth had felt that her little girl would nver, once again, wake up; as probably my parents wold feel too.Before reading this book, I had expected to maked a personal connecton, and be able to feel what the actual characters were feeling. Indeed, this book definitely fulfilled my expectations.Throughout the explicit details told during the story between the characters and the true meaning of this book, I got the reality of the book right in fornt of me. I would most definitley read this book, if you had not already!"},{"Title":"The Gift (Danielle Steel)","review":"I listened to this book first on audio. But after I was finished listening, I had to go out and buy the book to read once more. It's definately my favourite Danielle Steel book I have read. The story about a young 15-year-old girl and how she found comfort in a new family is so heartwarming. I definately recommend this book to everyone. Especially mothers and those expecting!"},{"Title":"The Gift (Danielle Steel)","review":"My mom told me about this book so i decided to give it a chance since I am not a big fan of romance novels. I read this book in a couple days and when I got to the end I cried for a long time. I have told everyone I know to read this book. They all tell me how much they loved it and how it made them cry also. I would recommend this book to everyone."},{"Title":"The Gift (Danielle Steel)","review":"The Gift ***This is a very good book. The only reason I give it three stars is because I did not like the ending. I was really sad for the main character. Although, she did make a good choice by giving the gift to the one family who took care of her, I was stll saddened."},{"Title":"The Gift (Danielle Steel)","review":"I'm taking one star off only because this novel wasn't really a page turner. It wasn't the kind of book you just have to finish in one sitting, the way I'd expect to with one of the shorter Danielle Steel novels such as this one. It was very easy to put down, and took me quite a bit of time to finish because the story was so predictable that you already knew what was going to happen and were not necessarily compelled to turn pages.Nevertheless, what I did read, when I decided to pick it up, was somewhat poignant and tender in a very simple and childish way.This novel would be good for teens as it deals with high schoolers who are in love and one teenager in particular, who gets herself into unfortunate circumstances, and then meets up with a sympathetic family that is going through it's own trauma. I can't really go further in describing the plot without giving away the whole story.I think four stars is actually a bit generous. Still, the heartbreaking nature of the emotions the characters experience, even though Steel has a simplistic way of writing about them, provide enough warm and fuzzies which allow the reader to experience heartfelt emotion right along with the characters.Think Nicholas Sparks &quot;A Walk To Remember&quot;, even though in that novel, the teens experienced totally different issues. Steel's writing doesn't come close to the thought provoking and efficient nature of Sparks. But, the emotions and the fact that both novels deal with teens make both &quot;A Walk...&quot; and &quot;The Gift&quot; slightly similar."},{"Title":"The Gift (Danielle Steel)","review":"I don't remember the last time a book made me cry so, much. 'The Gift' is a wonderful book to read. You fall in love with Maribeth &amp; Tommy, as they're falling in love with each other."},{"Title":"The Gift (Danielle Steel)","review":"I read this book in one afternoon - I just could not stop reading. This book is about a teenage sweet girl that faces an unplanned pregnancy, and her plan to make the best of it.It is a very touching book that I strongly recommend to teenager girls, or any other woman who ever thought of abortion as an option."},{"Title":"The Gift (Danielle Steel)","review":"I must say, I loved this book. It was so heartfelt and sad at times, yet it picked up where it should and I was smiling through tears.Not really a typical tale here, this one is kinda different. It is based in the 50's, which is new for me. About a girl who gets pregnant by the highschool hero and is left to fend for herself and all the consequences that come with it, including a tyrantical father and meek, timid mother who won't speak up for her. She must go miles and miles from home to find hope and love. What she gets is far more than she could've dreamed. Actually there are two stories here and they get intertwined.~MaryBeth Robertson is alone and 16 and pregnant. Her father has kicked her out until she 'takes care of her problem'. The year is 1950. She has nowhere to go, so she boards a bus and lets it take her wherever. She ends up in a small town 250 miles from her own small hometown in Iowa. She runs into a boy her age who seems distraught and in need of hope and a friend.Tommy Whittaker is suffering from the recent loss of his little sister Annie. Annie died the day after Christmas the year before and the family was torn asunder from it. His parents no longer talked to each other and he was left to deal with his own grief, until he meets a young woman who brings light into his bleak world. Tommy and MaryBeth find hope and love in their short time together and his parents begin healing. Can MaryBeth give them the 'Gift' that will make them whole again? Is she an angel passing through their lives for but a moment?Very heartwarming tale that will make you weepy at times, but happy you indulged.Tracy Talley~@"},{"Title":"The Gift (Danielle Steel)","review":"Im a 15 year old sophmore and i LOVED this book! i though it was awesome! i think that this is deff. made for my age range and that some adults might not like the book because Danielle Steel usually writes about adult relationships.

I love Danielle Steel, but I guess I like reading more of her stories about adult relationships, whereas this was focused more on young teenage love, trials, and tribulations.

The grieving process of this family was very realistic. The parallel of a young mother who would also be going through her own grieving process (giving up her child) Mixed together with the hopes and dreams of young lovers. The gift is 'love' encompassing both the joys and the sadness it brings.

I'd recomened it to everyone who loves love stories and is a romance fool like me."},{"Title":"The Gift (Danielle Steel)","review":"The book is about the most basic longing of nearly every individual--the need to love &amp; be loved. I find it very simple and yet realistic. The values and moral lesson of the story isn't lost here between the pages.

The whole premise was unreal. These people were 16 years old, for heaven's sake, and Steel made them so mature as to be unbelievable. It was sappy. The ending was so unsatisfactory I have to wonder: Is there a sequel? If there is, I won't be reading it."},{"Title":"The Gift (Danielle Steel)","review":"I just finished this book, and as much as I liked the story, it dragged on too long, and was horribly predictable. It was not the brain candy many of us seek, built boring and common characters, and seemed to be repeating itself. As soon as you read the back, you already know that she's leaving the baby behind. And what ever happened when Maribeth left? I never found out. But with the predictability, I'd say she married that guy and had some kids. The book didn't really seem to be much about love, probably because the word showed up too many times. It's easy to read, not much thought required. Good for ages 10-16. Can be finished easily in a night."},{"Title":"The Gift (Danielle Steel)","review":"This is the type of book a person would read if they were utterly depressed about life. Unlike what someone said before, (which was not to read it if you are upset), I think it's the type of book to read if you don't want to hear about never ending horrors or the world gone bad. It's a sweet book. That's really all there is to it. Of course reading about anyone's death is horrible, but you feel at peace in the end like the characters did, because everyone loved the child, and she had the best life possible.Maybe her life was a little too wonderful. At times it was too idyllic, and life was too perfect. But I think it's enjoyable to read a book like that every now and then. Despite how predictable it was, I still finished it all in one night, and despite what most of the reviews stated, I was rather pleased by the ending. Not sad at all."},{"Title":"The Gift (Danielle Steel)","review":"This is the first Danielle Steel book I have read, and it will be the last. Aside from the sappy, predictable story and elementary use of the language, the book contains (for me, at least) an egregious editorial mistake - Tommy thinking about Maribeth, page 158 of the paperback: \\"But there was something he didn't like to think about, her going back to Iowa and her parents.\\" This would be the same Maribeth who took a bus from Onawa, Iowa to Omaha, Nebraska, then got off in Grinnell on the way to Chicago. The only Grinnell, with a college, on the way to Chicago from Omaha, happens to be the one in IOWA!!I suppose, to some people, this is a small point. However, in my opinion, if you're going to write fiction, make it up. Don't screw it up.And by the way, Grinnell is a very cool town."},{"Title":"The Gift (Danielle Steel)","review":"I loved the book but I would have liked to see it be a liffle longer.

I found myself drawn to it at every available moment."},{"Title":"The Gift (Danielle Steel)","review":"The book is truly good. It tells of what happens in real life. This book makes you cry and feel Maribeth's pain and sorrow, yet it makes you smile when there's still hope.I recommend this book to anyone who finds herself in a position similiar to Maribeth's. And to the ones who are not in Maribeth's position, read it! This book is a treasure for both young and old. And something both teenagers and parents can learn from."},{"Title":"The Gift (Danielle Steel)","review":"The gift is one of my favorite of all time but don't read it if you have a lot of emotional stuff going on in your life."},{"Title":"The Gift (Danielle Steel)","review":"I am 17 years old, and this was the first Danielle Steel novel I have ever read. I am certian it won't be my last. This was the most detailed and discriptive piece of writing I have encountered. I decided to read it one evening around 11:30pm I didn't put down the book until 4:30 the next morning, when I finished the book! Her writing has turned me into a book worm for the rest of my senior year. In this novel, you fall in love with the story, the characters, and the time in which they live. I now have a greater appreciation for writing and authors abroad, but especially for Ms. Danielle Steel."},{"Title":"The Gift (Danielle Steel)","review":"I'm 13 years old, and I think that this is the best book that I've ever read. I love all of Danielle Steels books, I'm in the middle of the long road home right now and i love this new book also."},{"Title":"The Gift (Danielle Steel)","review":"The title tells you everything. A young teenage woman faced with a pregnacy that she is to young to handle, who must face the ultimate decision of her life, does she keep the baby or give it up for adoption?This is a wonderfully told story of all the emotional conflicts and feelings a young woman goes through while trying to come up with a solution that will affect not only herself, but the life of the unborn child.This is a tender tale, well written, and full of emotions that pluck the heart strings."},{"Title":"The Gift (Danielle Steel)","review":"The Gift by Danielle Steel is one of the best books that I have read so far. I am not an avid novel reader and I have to say that I am hard to impress. This book is about a happy couple with two lovable chidren, Tommy and their little precious daughter Annie. There is nothing else they could ask for in this world. On a Christmas Eve, a terrible thing happened, their youngest daughter Annie died of acute mengingitis. The whole family was devastated and the happy family was shattered into pieces. After months of sorrow, a girl named Maribeth came to their life. She had managed to bring back the happy smiles into their faces. It was her who gave them the most precious gift of all, a baby just like Annie that could bring back the joy and love they once had. The Gift will make you want to read until the end, non-stop. It is a love story, not just about teenagers falling in love, but also a story about a family bringing back love into their life. Danielle Steel makes me want to read some of her other novels hoping to get the same interest that I had with this novel. So if you are like me who hardly reads and wants to read something that will interest them and something they could relate to, this is the perfect book for you. I am absolutely giving this book a rate of perfect 10!!!!!"},{"Title":"The Gift (Danielle Steel)","review":"Having grown up with a father who would have died had I become pregnant in high school, I could really relate to Maribeth.This book was extremely difficult for me to read due to my falling tears. I was crying by the second chapter and after that I do not believe there was a dry chapter.After reading the book, I attempted to listen to it in the car while driving on a long trip. I finally ended up pulling over and crying on the side of the road. I know passersby thought I was crazy, but the story is so heart-wrenching I couldn't bear to simply stop listening. To be so short, this book packs the emotion of a full-length novel.Excellent work of art"},{"Title":"The Gift (Danielle Steel)","review":"I decided to explore the literary work of Danielle Steele by choosing this short novel from my local library. Some may find it a bit mushy but I definitely was hooked all the way through.It was almost magical how the pain the Whittaker's loss of their daughter was mended by Maribeth's arrival in their world. It shows you that children no matter what they get themselves into can somehow still display innocent and trusting for one another. Love truly can conquer all as Tommy certainly looks past the problems of Maribeth and sees her emergence as a calming presence to the loss of his sister and the near destruction of his family. Slowly but surely and certainly happilly, Tommy, Liz and John manage to come together again.I guess one never knows where the missing puzzle to someone's happiness lies. Sometimes I guess one has to believe in magic and Danielle Steele certainly affirms this."},{"Title":"The Gift (Danielle Steel)","review":"This was the first of Danielle Steel's books that I read. It was very well written and she is a great story teller. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Gift (Danielle Steel)","review":"The Gift By: Danielle SteelThe Gift by Danielle Steel is a marvelous novel, which takes place in the 50's. The reason why I feel that this book is so wonderful is because it reflects to our young teens today. I feel that once you get this book in your hands you really can't let go. It's true when people say don't judge a book by its cover, even though it might not look interesting at all. Danielle Steel is one of the best selling authors, and this novel can just prove how creative her work is. It takes place at a happy home, when everything shatters by a child's senseless death. The Whittaker ends up losing her beautiful young child Annie of the sickness meningitis. The family, which includes Tommy Whittaker, Annie Whittaker, Elizabeth Whittaker, and John Whittaker, then is so affected by the startling tragedy that they stop communicating together and the loving marriage of Elizabeth Whittaker and John Whittaker starts to unravel. The story is then switched, introduced is, the gifted 15-year-old- Maribeth. A narrow-minded father who forces her into going to her prom with a repulsive navy blue dress demoralizes her. After one wrong incident that night, Maribeth's life turns upside down. She becomes pregnant and is sent to a convent by her severe father, where she is to lose her baby, if she wished to return home. She escapes the brutal convent and ends up in the little town of Omaha where she starts working as a waitress in a diner. Young unwed Maribeth, and young hopeless Tommy meet one day at the diner and end up falling in love. Their love, so innocent and full of hope, helps to restore a family's dreams. And all of their lives changed forever by the precious gift she lives behind, her beautiful baby girl Kate. I would definitely recommend this book to young teens around the world, who strongly believe in true love. This book teaches the readers that if two people are truly in love, they will pull through the toughest times together but at the end it would all be worth it. Even though it is a story that leaves you hanging at the end, some use their imagination to end it and some readers wait until the continuation of the story comes out. I would also recommend this book, because it reflects on our young teens today. All around the world young girls are having unprotected sex or are fooled by the guy and they all end up getting pregnant. They end up having adoration or a hard time taking care of the child. By reading this book, it takes you through a life of a typical teenager who happens to make a mistake that ruins her life forever. It shows how the life of a young girl distorted because of an unwanted pregnancy. It also shows the readers that things happen for a reason and just when you think your life is ruined, something special comes along. For Maribeth, she met the love of her life, the person that understood her problem and respected her. This fabulous book will keep you on the edge of your sit, just waiting to see what is going to happen next. It is such an emotion book it leaves its readers in tears. The story also gives the reader the idea that miracles do happen. The Gift is one of the best-written books by Danielle Steel because it is a book a lot of people can relate to. A book that is filled with sadness, and hopelessness and then changed into love and happiness. I defiantly recommend it to all the young adults.Critical Review By: Elizabeth Adzhemyan"},{"Title":"The Gift (Danielle Steel)","review":"The gift is the perfect example of telling, not showing. The Gift tells the story of carboard cutout characters. A good father and a bad father. A storybook loving family and a PC vision of an unhealthy one.Her cardboard cutout characters are perfect and oh so dramatic, and always, always, always! teary eyed. A cute little doll of a girl dies and no one, Steele tells us ad nauseum, &quot;can bare it.&quot; I couldn't, anyway.This children's story was tedious, clich&eacute;d and trite in the extreme, thus earning its five star rating by Steele's readers.

English novelist and critic J B Priestley's attempt in \\"Salt is Leaving\\" is good There are no weaknesses, but still somehow it is not really satisying.Physician Dr Salt is preparing to leave the small English city of Birkden to go to live overseas. He feels he has one piece of unfinished business to settle before his departure: to discover what has become of a patient of his, a young woman whose disease requires close monitoring and treatment.The story moves along leisurely. The plot is good although not particularly original. The characters are generic: Salt curmudgeonly but kind-hearted man of principle, Maggie (playing the part of Watson) mix of sophistication and naivete who has love/anger relationship with Salt, corrupt millionaire industrialist, sleazy club manager, and so forth.There are some very good scenes, for instance Salt explaining how a seemingly unfruitful interview revealed much information. However, so much seemed so familiar. To use one of those fancy words \\"Salt is Leaving\\" reads like a pastiche rather than a original story."},{"Title":"Joyous Sexuality: Healing from the Effects of Family Sexual Dysfunction","review":"Amazing reading... Joyous Sexuality has captured the essence of sexual dysfunction problems and how they relate to adult life. Mic Hunter has simply, but eloquently, shown how successful recovery can be achieved if one will only follow and adhere to the 12 step program outlined in the book. He has also provided workspace to allow the reader to participate which is necessary for successful recovery. I recommend this book to anyone with any form of sexual addiction or relationship difficulties."},{"Title":"Joyous Sexuality: Healing from the Effects of Family Sexual Dysfunction","review":"Mic Hunter's book, from 1992, is still relevant and excellent. As a clinician, I use this book with a wide variety of clients - even those who have not experienced sexual trauma. Since we live in such a sexually dysfunctional culture, Hunter's book offers an excellent way to process our beliefs and to help our society move toward healthy and vibrant sexuality/sensuality that is also in alignment with our true values.Hunter does an excellent job in not hoisting his beliefs upon the reader, but assisting the reader in exploring his/her experiences and teachings (covert and overt) about sex, relationships, sexuality and their body.Hopefully, this book will become available again. It will remain on my top 10 list!"},{"Title":"Joyous Sexuality: Healing from the Effects of Family Sexual Dysfunction","review":"Dr. Mic Hunter has a wealth of knowledge and experience in psychologically-treating individuals who have experienced sexual trauma, sexual abuse, sexual dysfunction, and addictions. He believes in the positive influence and effects of people practicing The Twelve Steps of Alcoholics Anonymous, as well as adapting them to psychologically-based issues in addition to alcoholism.In his book, \\"Joyous Sexuality: Healing from the Effects of Family Sexual Dysfunction,\\" Dr. Hunter has again applied The Twelve Steps, as well as many valuable, beneficial, and thoughtful workbook-style questions in the treatment and recognition of family sexual dysfunction and individual sexual dysfunction as a result of the former. Dr. Hunter identifies and describes family sexual dysfunction, including many different styles and characteristics of it that are helpful for readers to know, understand, and reflect upon.Dr. Hunter goes further by identifying and describing adult child issues related to family sexual dysfunction, unhealthy and healthy aspects of adult sexuality, and applying The Twelve Steps to family sexual dysfunction - as an individual - as a method of recovery. He not only identifies The Twelve Steps for use in conjunction with recovery from family sexual dysfunction, but also describes how they apply to recovery and provides personalized workbook questions for individuals to answer in an effort to identify, recognize, contemplate, and recover from past sexually dysfunctional experiences.Dysfunction prevents the fulfillment of needs in a reasonable manner, and may include extremes of behavior. This also applies to families. In a sexually dysfunction family, there are attitudes, behaviors, or other interactions and communications that have a negative affect on the family members' sexuality (p. 1). Rather than enjoying sexuality, \\"they end up being hurt by\\" it (p. 1).Dr. Hunter identifies and describes \\"three basic extremes [that] are common in sexually dysfunction families: the overvaluation of sex, negative attitudes about sex, and sexual shutdown\\" (p. 2). In families that overvalue sex, \\"sex is the most important thing in life\\" (p. 2). People in such families have \\"sexuality as the predominant focus of most interactions,\\" and \\"they sexualize their emotions\\" (p. 2).In sex-negative families, \\"sex is something to be feared, because it is seen to be dangerous, perhaps even evil\\" (p. 4). Dr. Hunter shares that such families may \\"enforce rigid rules about sexual behavior,\\" and when a person violates those rules, he or she feels unworthy and ashamed (p. 4). In the sexually shut-down family, \\"there is a nearly phobic response\\" to sex (p. 5). People in such families are hard at work in repressing their sexuality, ignoring children's sexual development, and pretending not to notice sexual develop changes (p. 5). There are also families that combine the dysfunctional styles.Members of the adult self-help group, Adult Children of Sexual Dysfunction (ACSD), identified ten main characteristics related to family sexual dysfunction when they were young, such characteristics affecting their behavior. Some of these characteristics include experiencing confusion or shame about sexuality, a lack of healthy or nourishing touch, and the experience of difficulty in establishing relationships that are intimate (p. 8).Dr. Hunter goes on to identify, describe, and discuss each of the ten characteristics pinpointed by ACSD and provide his helpful, reflective workbook questions that personally assist individual readers in remembering and recognizing past sexual attitudes and/or experiences within their families. A few of Dr. Hunter's questions in relation to these described characteristics include: \\"When you think about the other gender, how do you feel?\\" (p. 24); \\"How do you react now to being touched by others?\\" (p. 37); and \\"What relationship patterns have you noticed in your life\\" (p. 47).Importantly in regard to the tenth characteristic of confusing sex with emotions, Dr. Hunter identifies and describes different types of intimacy, including physical, sexual, mental, emotional, and spiritual. One of the results of the tenth characteristic may be that people \\"sometimes leave groups or end friendships when they start to grow close\\" (p. 71). Also, those who sexually abuse children may misunderstand sexuality and sexual boundaries by stating that they are being intimate with the children (p. 71).Dr. Hunter states that \\"perhaps the most destructive consequence of living as a child in a sexually dysfunctional family is the development of a shame-based identity\\" (p. 73). Even when the child grows into adulthood, he or she continues to be ashamed. Such identities stem from relationships that are abusive or neglectful (p. 73). In order to heal from the affects of such experiences, Dr. Hunter states that \\"safe, nurturing person-to-person interaction\\" is required (p. 73).Following this, Dr. Hunter introduces The Twelve Steps as a guide for recovery from family sexual dysfunction. He identifies and describes each of the Steps, as well as associating his helpful workbook-style questions with them. For examples, in the area of powerlessness, Dr. Hunter asks the reader if he or she could obtain nourishing touch as a child (p. 81). In relation to admitting our defects, Dr. Hunter asks the reader to write a list of his or her character defects and to give examples (p 109). Regarding the experience of a spiritual awakening, Dr. Hunter asks what the reader understands about his or her past, and it's effect on one's present lifestyle and experiences (p. 129).I recommend Dr. Hunter's book, \\"Joyous Sexuality: Healing from the Effects of Family Sexual Dysfunction,\\" to those readers who are interested in discovering and healing from their past that may include sexual dysfunction, individual sexual dysfunction, and/or family sexual dysfunction. I also recommend Dr. Hunter's book for reading by anyone who desires to increase their knowledge about the impact, influence, and effects of general attitudes and behaviors about sex.For the person who is seeking to recover and heal from past sexually dysfunctional experiences, Dr. Hunter's book is a treasure trove of understanding, knowledge, examples, questions, insights, and suggestions for recovery regarding it. For the reader who may simply be interested in increasing his or her knowledge related to sexuality, \\"Joyous Sexuality: Healing from the Effects of Family Sexual Dysfunction\\" is a valuable work on understanding different attitudes, interactions, communications, and behaviors regarding it.Therefore, again, Dr. Hunter has tackled an issue that likely causes discomfort and pain for many, though he also provides the power of healing psychological understanding, insight, and recovery to it. This is another of Dr. Hunter's valuable books on issues related to sex and sexuality, and how readers can increase their enjoyment of sex by working through past experiences that may have been negative or dysfunctional.Reviewer's Note: Quoted material is included in this review with written permission by Dr. Mic Hunter."},{"Title":"Encounters W/Chldr","review":"This is the most impressive volume on child development that I have read. It is a unique effort, presenting reader-friendly and comprehensive information regarding the development of children and adolescents. Although it is written for Pediatricians, the \\"Perspectives', \\"Quick Check\\" behavioral descriptions, and \\"Heads Up\\" indicators of difficulty, provide invaluable information for all who work with children. The format, describing clinical issues that may arise at various ages along with brief demonstrative vignettes, is simply outstanding. I highly recommend this book to medical personnel, mental health professionals, and child/adolescent educators because it will add to the competency of all readers. My compliments to the authors."},{"Title":"Encounters W/Chldr","review":"This book was recommended to us by the nurse practitioner at our pediatrician's office. We're new parents, and it's been really helpful, particularly for helping us learn what is &#34;normal&#34; for a new born. It's written as a text book for nurses and doctors, and this has been helpful to know what our pediatrician is looking for and thinking about when we take our daughter in for her doctor's appointments. It's definitely helped us develop good communication with her pediatrician."},{"Title":"Encounters W/Chldr","review":"This was a required book for graduate school for my Pediatric Nurse Practitioner Program. In my opinion, there are many more valuable pediatric Growth and Development books available (check Mandleco's book). I do not like the narrative approach of this book; it is vague."},{"Title":"Selected essays from Individualism reconsidered","review":"Parts of society move more quickly than others. Riesman likens the public to a snake. In the introduction he deals with the question of writing to a specific audience with shared assumptions and values. The process of education is inherently ambiguous.The author speaks of the pressure of 'groupism'. The dichotomy of money and power in liberal states is protection against totalitarianism. Many nineteenth century thinkers saw men as naturally cooperative.Erich Fromm distinguishes selfishness from self-love. A selfish person has no real self. What is feared as failure in American society is aloneness. Franz Kafka had the nerve of failure. He was virtually alone.Submission to experience is an intellectual's self-effacing response to his weakness. There is, however, the fact that such a response usually hides a strong desire for power and status. Market mentality means control of the economy is control of the ethical regime.Utopian, alas, has come to be regarded as a derogatory term. Positive goals of the world wars were oversold. One small group, the architects and planners, have continued to work in the utopian tradition. The gap between the thinking of clients and the advanced planners however may lead to the imposition of dictatorial measures.The essays collected here contain many devoted to an evalutation of Freud's ideas. The views expressed by David Riesman seem as fresh and new as they did when the work was issued. There is much to be praised in this volume."},{"Title":"Life Safety Code Handbook (Life Safety Code Handbook (National Fire Protection Association))","review":"The life safety code handbook is an extemely valuable resource.

(Hilda Doolittle) is a poet. Her novels all display a poet's sense of immediacy, but are sometimes confusing for their interior &quot;scapes&quot; which are frequently all too fluid. Her poetry, however, directs the &quot;flow&quot; deliberately and masterfully. &quot;Notes on Thought and Vision&quot; is a rare example (like Nikos Kazantzakis's &quot;The Saviors of God&quot;) wherein the distinction between poetry and prose evaporates. These &quot;Notes&quot; are intimate and compelling, watery and feminine, mystical and yet (strangely) earthy--composed of octopus, seaweed, and salt. Her language is delicate, but not brittle, her point of view keenly sensitive but never timid. &quot;Notes&quot; is an intelligent reflection on the sub- or un-conscious, and on the source(s) of poetic inspiration, from the only person, male or female, who ever wrote openly of her experience as Sigmund Freud's patient (see H.D.'s &quot;Tribute to Freud&quot;). &quot;Notes on Thought and Vision&quot; is a short book (and a small one), which contains a very large message that celebrates the feminine and the divine as one and the same. A must-read for any woman who seeks to explore her creativity and for any man who seeks his own &quot;anima&quot;."},{"Title":"Notes on Thought & Vision & the Wise Sappho","review":"I have a love/hate relationship with H.D. - I lack her enthusiasm for Greek and Egyptian mythology (I'd rather move a bit further to the Southeast) but I appreciate what she does with the mythology. Thus I am never quite sure to what audience I can recommend her.The second piece in this book, &quot;The Wise Sappho&quot; is a meditation on the poetry of Sappho - a poetic meditation. If you have read Sappho, this is a must read piece as both Sappho and H.D. are talismen of the feminist strand of poets.The first piece &quot;Notes on Thought and Vision&quot; needs to be placed in time. H.D. speaks of her discovery of a higher level of consciousness, a level she refers to as jelly-fish mind as she imagines it as a jelly-fish above us (for brain consciousness) or beside us (for womb consciousness) with tenacles into our body. Her examples come primarily from art, Greek mythology or &quot;the Galilean&quot; (Jesus). She specifically includes scientists among those dependent upon this jelly-fish consciousness. However, she cautions that body and mind are not to be neglected. Her description of her experience serves as an important insight into her poetry and prose and as one ray into understanding the literary circle in which she roamed e.g. Ezra Pound."},{"Title":"Black Men: In Their Own Words","review":"Two female editors of Essence magazine, a publication for black women, produce this anthology of writings from black men. Because of this, I get the sense that the book is intended for readers of various genders. (And let's face it, women are more interested in studying how men think and what makes men tick than men are.) The book is a photographic spread, an inspirational text, and a veritable \\"Who's Who?\\" of famous African-American men. The book is similar in art to the Latino book \\"Suave\\" and its text is very similar to Tavis Smiley's \\"How to Make Black America Better\\" (Smiley having an entry here as well). Approximately 100 famous black men relate biographical vignettes about their struggles and triumphs. Each entry includes a small bio of the author, so the book feels like an encyclopedia in ways. The chapters are divided into such topic areas as family, success, art, etc. Unlike most texts on black men which bemoan high rates of incarceration, systemic racism, police brutality, etc. (recent books by Kunjufu and Cose are examples), most of the entries in this text discuss the men's relations with their wives, children (especially sons), fathers, and mentors. Thus, black manhood is displayed as relational to how one supports black individuals and the black community. The authors are diverse; they include older brothers, mixed-race brothers, gay brothers, brothers from the Continent, etc. This is a feel-good text; controversial topics are avoided. The dark sides of some of the entrants' histories are not mentioned. (For example, there is no mention of Jim Brown's history of misogynist attacks, or Damon Wayans' and Amiri Baraka's continual homophobic performance pieces.) Still, this book was a great concept and sincerely motivating. Plus, I like having photos of hotties like Sinbad, Forrest Whitaker, and Omar Wasow. I would recommend this book for black men, women, and families."},{"Title":"The ABCs of Duets for Violin","review":"I played the piano for 6 years before taking up the violin a year and a half ago. I've been trying these duets out with a friend who is also an amateur violinist like myself and we're having so much fun! For those who don't know the difference between a method book and a duet book: this is a duet book for 2 violins! A duet has one melody line and one harmony line, both to be played at the same time. A method book is an instruction book showing you how to play the violin. I suggest you get the ABCs of Violin for the Absolute Beginner for your 1st violin method book--there are 5 books in this series by the same author--I'm at the end of Book 3 which shows you how to play 3rd position. My teacher said Book 4 shows 2nd position. Book 3 has been very thorough--I really feel like I know the fingerboard in 3rd position.**In this duet book there is a lot of variety in styles of music you can play together. Here are some songs we really like to play together: The Devil's Dream--an Irish fiddle tune, Rock of Ages, Joy to the World, Oh Susanna, 2 Beethoven melodies and Brahms Cradle song--about 30 duets in total, we haven't had a chance to play through all of them, but can't wait! Meeting every week to play duets has kept us going on violin full speed ahead and improved our reading skills a lot! We're thinking of joining our community orchestra someday, but thought we'd develop our confidence by playing duets first.I'm very very happy with my purchase!!"},{"Title":"The ABCs of Duets for Violin","review":"I am a violin teacher who teaches three children and their mother. They are hard working students inspite of their young ages: Ages 4, 6 and 8 years old. Like other children, they are interested in video games, animated movies, etc. But what makes them practice their violins so hard is a joy to play music with each other. They are 2 brothers, a sister and mother.This duet book &quot;The ABCs of Duets for Violin, Book 1&quot; is written very nicely. There are many duets in this book which coincide with the pieces learned in Violin Book 1, &quot;The ABCs of Violin for the Absolute Beginner.&quot; I recommend getting both books.To sum it up, this duet book brings great happiness to violin players who play this lovely music together. I highly recommend this book to beginners and intermediate level learners!"},{"Title":"The ABCs of Duets for Violin","review":"I'm a violin beginner and have been playing duets with friends over the last number of months.

So, my students of all levels benefit from using it.

Also, as a teacher I find it satisfying because I can play harmonies in 3rd position while my students play the easier line in first position."},{"Title":"The ABCs of Duets for Violin","review":"I have been playing guitar for over thirty years and I've never seen such a ripoff. This book does not teach how to play a violin. It is a book of very simple songs. This type of song book is readly available in music shops at a much cheaper price. I am very disappointed in this book and suggest you not waste your money as I did. If you need a book, go to Mel Bay....On a scale of 1 to 5 I give this book a &quot;zero.&quot;"},{"Title":"To Spin is Miracle Cat","review":"Released in 1981 in a Edition of 720 books. 20 were marked presentation, and 200 were signed and numbered.A excellent introduction by Author Ursala Le Guin starts off the book.Roger Zelazny had a wonderful command of words.This book features alot of his early poems, and his more recent poems.My favorite short poem from this volume is very representative of this volume.Chorus MysticusBeginning with a snort and ending with a sigh,time cannot raze nor confusion alterthis monument we rear against the gods.If you're a fan of Roger Zelazny, but you've never read any of his Poetry then search this volume out.

Although it contains much biographical material, it is not a true biography. It does tell much about the stage on which William McKinley played.McKinley rose to national prominence by becoming an expert on the tariff. In congress he was known as the technical master of customs duties. How he used this expertise to propel himself to the post of Governor of Ohio is a puzzlement, but it does reflect the immense importance of tariff policy in an era when elections were fought over protection and when most federal revenue was derived from the tariff.Much of the book tells the story of aspects of public life in which McKinley participated. A major portion of the book deals with the Spanish American War. Here one sees McKinley among those presidents whose administrations were transformed by events from a domestic focus into one dominated by martial exploits. I have studied much about the Spanish American War (see my Listmania, \\"Remember The Maine, To Hell With Spain\\" and my Amazon Reviews, A Ship To Remember, Colonel Roosevelt, The Rough Riders, An Army For Empire and Little Brown Brothers) but this book provides a unique perspective on the war. Here the focus is on the role of the president in the decision to go to war and its subsequent prosecution. On these pages we see the veteran who had learned to hate war being drawn into a war despite all of his efforts to avoid it. In some parts the narration of the war almost makes the reader forget that McKinley was involved. Even so, it places some aspects of the war, such as the exploits of the Rough Riders, into a perspective of the greater conflict which is lacking in some works. With war a reality, the president became actively involved in the need to equip the army, decide on the targets of attack and the peace negotiations. All of these aspects receive ample attention from the author.With the conclusion of the war, the controversy over the disposition of the captured islands became a focus of public debate and a major issue in the 1900 election. William Jennings Bryan's \\"mixed messages\\" to use a recent term, are contrasted to McKinley's consistency. The decision to \\"Take whatever we can and to keep whatever we want\\" would have profound implications for the U. S. and the world. McKinley's self image as God's chosen instrument would be echoed in some of his successors.In an era when vice-presidents were rarely heard, McKinley's first Veep. Garrett Hobart, was a close friend who played a surprisingly important role in the administration, leading its programs through the Senate and carrying out special assignments. With Hobarts' death the selection of a second term running mate became a major event in McKinley's career and, with the nomination of Theodore Roosevelt, in the life of the nation.Through the chapters of this book, author Margaret Leech gives the reader an excellent study of themes in the history of McKinley's days. In so doing she does not neglect McKinley himself. She shows how he was and remained a product of Nineteenth Century Ohio where he was born and lived his life. She tells of McKinley's service in the Union Army, during which he reached the rank of Major before returning to Ohio to undertake legal studies. Settling in Canton, he rose steadily in his career and in public esteem.Leech tells the tender love story of McKinley and his wife, Ida, whose neurological disorder would be a constant concern throughout their married life. He learned to cope with her frequent seizures without interrupting the routine of the day, while always placing Ida first in his heart. It is amazing that he accomplished what he did with the limitations imposed by Ida's infirmity. He comes across as a highly successful man who kept his priorities in order.This book has been described as a first rate book about a second rate president. While you read it you will understand why it made Margaret Leech the first woman to win two Pulitzer prizes. From it I acquired a respect for McKinley as a president who successfully confronted a variety of complex issues. I think that he successfully advanced the interests of his country and followed practices which serve as good models for others. Read it and formulate your own rating of McKinley."},{"Title":"In the days of McKinley","review":"Less than 50 pages are dedicated to Mckinley's childhood, schooling, Civil War days, and his rise in Ohio from a struggling attorney to a Congressman then state gov. The remaining 550 pages deal with the detailed issues of his presidency and some portions (such as several long chapters about Cuba &amp; the Philippines) do not even mention him. Fortunately, his presidency with the various wars, his wife's condition, thru his assination makes this detailed account worthwhile. However, if you are like me &amp; find the struggles of the person before the presidency (especially those with war experience) interesting, you will be somewhat dissappointed in the lack of info. here."},{"Title":"In the days of McKinley","review":"This book won the Pulitzer Prize.In the Days of McKinleyis the best book about William McKinley and his times. You get a great sense of America that emerged from a frontier country and colonies into an industrial power during his Congressional years and then entered the world stage in foreign policy during his presidency. McKinley was a pro-business and pro-tariff northern Republican. His election campaign against William Jennings Bryant was famous. He was assassinated. The writing is excellent, and the book captures the people, McKinley and the times marvelously. McKinley moved along with the issues of the day and was a pro-business Republican, but he was more moderate in his actions than some would have you believe. He executed the Spanish American War but was not enthusiastic about it. He began early anti-trust actions. He made the mistake of sponsoring sharply higher tariffs in Congress -- key word is sharply -- that led to a Depression, but as president learned from that and was moderate and steady with tariffs. (Key lesson: moderate and steady tariffs seemed to be successful for a long time but not tariffs suddenly raised sharply higher.)It's all here: the Spanish American War, the tariffs, the Depression of 1893, industrialization, etc. If you are reading through the presidents, interested in McKinley, or interested in the particular issues of that day, such as the Spanish American War, then this enjoyable history of McKinley and his era is for you. Highly recommended!I have read many books about American presidents and American history. This is the book to read about William McKinley. I also highly recommend the fascinatingPivotal Decades: The United States, 1900-1920as an excellent follow-up book.The Chicago Sun Times said, \\"When you finish this book you feel that you have had a memorable experience. Because of the author's narrative skill and pictorial sensibility, you have come to know William McKinley well, have moved through great scenes of our history in the last half of the nineteenth century, and lived the life of the horse and buggy days in the middle west and Washington.\\"Book of the Month Club said, \\"Leech is as thorough and illuminating in leading us through the maze of bimetallism and tariff fights and McKinley's public career as she is in handling his private life. Her political panoramas are as excellent as her battle accounts of the Spanish-American war or as her re-creation of McKinley's assassination.\\""},{"Title":"In the days of McKinley","review":"Leech does a great job of adding flesh to the historical memory of an overlooked President. McKinley. McKinley is an overlooked President because he was followed by the iconoclast TDR. Thus a work that provides insight into this President who as occupied the historical shadows is a welcomed treat. What Leech;s effort excels in is providing a look at McKinley as an individual. This is great because the other treatments of the man simply look at his record as a president. This book does not and shows how his personal experiences helped to determine the type of politician he would become, and why he was a successful politician. It is not overly scholarly in its approach however, which makes it more accessible for all audiences."},{"Title":"Rain and Hail (Let's-Read-and-Find-Out Books)","review":"Rain & Hail (Let's Read-And-Find-Out Science)Well this book is about a lot more than just rain and hail. It is about cloud types and how clouds are made, water vapor, evaporation and condensation. How can there be hail on hot summer day? Sleet and hail what's the difference? It has charming colorful illustrations and the text is clear and interesting. We love this series of science for kids books.

The rhyming cadences charm, and encourage expressive reading. Any reader who experiments with the beat of a drum to accompany the tale of Eyr will be in for a treat. This tale works on several levels; here we have history, adventure, character building, anthropology, and respect for the environment. Margaret Searcy has created an engaging hero, one whom we can cheer through his ordeal and eventual triumph."},{"Title":"Across the Universe With John Lennon","review":"Despite what the previous reviewer wrote, this story truly touched me and made me think about the afterlife. Is it possible to communicate with those who have passed on before us? I have never done so myself but that does not make it NOT possible! I applaud Linda Keen for her courage to write this book. The death of John Lennon was tramatic for those who loved and admired him. Why not believe Linda's accounts? What do you have to lose? Maybe that part of you that has secretly mourned the death John for almost 20 years. If you believe in the theory of reincarnation, you can believe John &quot;agreed&quot; to have his life end the way it did so he could learn&quot;life lesson&quot; from that. Everything Linda wrote made complete sense to me. From spirit guides to Hell, Linda's style of writing is very clear and flowing.Open your minds! Just because you cannot channel a spirit does not mean someone else can't. If you are a fan of John Lennon, you will be happy to know John is truly at peace."},{"Title":"Across the Universe With John Lennon","review":"Forget the premise that this book is John Lennon speaking. Suspend any judgements you may have about what is reality and what is fantasy. There is more here than meets the eye, by a longshot. The information in this book reflects a separate reality that Linda Keen was not privy to prior to having &quot;John Lennon&quot; disclose it to her. Most people reading this book will not be aware of the &quot;tradition&quot; in esoteric knowledge of the &quot;underground stream&quot; of &quot;Arcadia&quot;. There is one whole section in this book about a celestial realm called Arcadia. This tradition began almost 3500 years ago in the central Peloponnesia of Greece! The underground stream declares that there is a paradise where those who are in tune with the natural laws of the Universe go to. A principal aspect of this paradise are the &quot;Tones&quot; of the Celestial Spheres. A rather fitting place for John to retire to, one might say. The underground stream's most recent &quot;awakening&quot; began about 1430 AD in the small province of Lorrain in France. From that time on it has figured prominently in almost ALL of the music we have received from artists since that epoch. This is not common knowledge but knowledge readily available through other written resources. The fact that an author, a gifted teacher of intuitive development, (her and her husband ran a school in the Netherlands for pupils interested in researching this)has received this information from one of the greatest rock and roll personages of our age speaks volumes for an incredible &quot;possibility&quot;. That is, the fact of Arcadia. I encourage any reader of this book to dig a little deeper in the knowledge being shared within it's pages. There is one more little &quot;syncronicity&quot;. In this book, John mentions that we should follow the &quot;blueprint rituals&quot;. HE does not say what these are. The week this book was released there was a website I heard about describing what the blueprint rituals are! The author of the website had no knowledge whatsoever of Linda Keen's book.... This book will begin an incredible journey for those who can see beyond the surface premise of John Lennon speaking directly to Linda. In fact, do not even think much about this, study the information and become &quot;initiated&quot;."},{"Title":"Across the Universe With John Lennon","review":"This is one of the best books that i have read about life after death. and if you are a John Lennon fan, you will love it!

I couldn't understand why he was taken away in the prime of his life. After reading this book, I now celebrate his life instead of thinking so heavily of his death. Linda Keen has been blessed with the gift of communicating with the spirit world and I am so greatful she has the courage to share this amazing book with us. I now understand John choose his life as John Lennon to learn certain lessons. Thru Linda, John explains why a person chooses a certain life and how we all can become closer to our spirit guides. I can honestly say this book has changed my insight on reincarnation and of Heaven.Thank you Linda for letting us know John is in peace. May his spirit touch us all."},{"Title":"Across the Universe With John Lennon","review":"By writing this enlightening, thought-provoking book, Linda Keen has opened up a necessary dialogue about life-after-death and the probability of the continued existence of the spirit of the man who was known as &quot;John Lennon.&quot; Why would such a brilliant light as Lennon be extinguished upon leaving the body in which he accomplished such wondrous things in the world? Lennon's own documented ideas about spirit and the hereafter resonate clearly with Keen's descriptions of his &quot;afterlife&quot; spiritual communications with her and their mutual exploration of love and light. It matters not whether you believe, but if you love and respect the memory of John Lennon, take this beautiful journey into the unknown in honor of one of the greatest visionaries of all time.

From cover to cover, I loved this book!Linda Keen draws readers in immeditely as she shares with the rest of us the incredible story of her vivid and intimate spiritual journey with John Lennon. As a life-long Beatles fan and someone who admired Lennon's creative brilliance, I have to say that I found this book to be captivating and one that truly touched me. The author employs her considerable skills as a writer, and her unique gift as a psychic medium, to instill in us a sense that there is indeed life beyond this plane of existence, and that, in the final analysis, death is an illusion.As I say, I'm a long-time fan of Lennon and the Beatles, and I found Keen's telling of her journey to be thought-provoking, fascinating and credible as she captures the humor, cynicism and intensity that was so prevalent in Lennon during his brief life. In short, Keen has penned a memoir that bottles the essence of who John Lennon was, and more importantly, who he remains.Many people fear and dismiss what they can't fully grasp or understand, and I feel that this may be the case with some of Keen's critics and detractors. For such people, if they can't hold something in their hand, then in their collective minds, it simply doesn't exist, has no value, and it must be ignored and criticized. So it surely took a lot for Keen to write this book and to put herself up for potential public ridicule from some camps.Looking through the reality lens, at the end of the day, few or any of us have the unique gift of being able to see and experience things that lie beyond our relm. I certainly do not have this gift, however, I find those who do to be intriguing.Again, I applaud Keen for having the courage to write this book, and to open herself up to criticism. What she gives us is a wonderfully crafted narrative that helps people to achieve a sense of spiritual growth by taking them by the hand and re-introducing them to the deeply spiritual side of Lennon. In a way, it brings John back again, as all of his wit and charm come shining through in each and every page. Perhaps more than this, the book gives new and fresh hope to people that their own loved-one's have really not left them forever, and that in the end, the love that we have for our family and friends transcends death itself.As for John Lennon, what becomes crystal clear in the reading of Keen's account is the fact that he never really wanted to be idolized by millions, and he's now in a place where he seeks to reinforce this part of himself to those who want to listen.So this is definitley not your standard run-of-the-mill biography that analyzes the timeless songs that the leader of the Beatles penned during his life. Far from it. Rather, it is much more a chronicle of who John Lennon was a a human being, warts and all. Like all people, Lennon had some deep flaws in his life, and was a very troubled person. This book takes the time to examine and expose his drawbacks and personal demons in an amazing first-hand account. Those fears and insecurities that were never far from the surface during his life still seem to be in Lennon now.In my view, if ever there was a book that truly begs to be a movie or a Broadway play, \\"Across the Universe With John Lennon\\" is definitely it. As I say, if you're a person who admired the talents of John Lennon, and who has ever found yourself wondering what might lay beyond this life, this is a must-read for you. At the heart of it, this is a fascinating and captivating chronicle from a uniquely talanted and very brave woman."},{"Title":"Across the Universe With John Lennon","review":"My original review for the original title for this book, \\"John Lennon in Heaven\\" was reposted by the author when the new title was published, so appears to be her own review. To correct that, I am reposting this under a new review, below.In re-reading my review and also reviews of others, I am disheartened by the negative comments by psychotherapists and others who think they \\"know\\" that Ms. Keen was not connecting with John Lennon. Connecting with someone like John Lennon has posed the risk of having to prove everything and inviting ridicule from all corners, and Linda took that risk, in order to communicate her story.In the many years that John has been a spirit guide to me, and to others that I have met along the way, this style of communicating may seem silly to some, but it seems to be the way he does it.Linda's attempt to communicate this style was a lighthearted way of bringing John to the masses in a non-scientific, non-psychobabble or new agey way, but just as though she were having a conversation with someone.For what it's worth, the style may not appeal to some, but will to many, and in the end, there's much to be appreciated. The effort to discount it doesn't prove anything either.Here's my original review:\\"Across the Universe with John Lennon\\" is a down-to-earth and humorous story as well as a highly developed and positive spiritual message---just what I would expect from John himself. Linda's story bridges a gap---the gap between the sadness of John's death and the vague suspicion that our spirit friends are indeed trying to help us at this juncture in history around the new millenium. If ever there as a person who would try to communicate with us from beyond the grave, wouldn't John Lennon be among the first to sign up for the job? Anyone who understood him at all during his life must agree that John was a humanitarian who believed in love and peace and did not shy away from unconventional ways to get his message across---first through rock-n-roll and then through bed-ins. He was also deeply spiritual and experienced much psychic phenomena himself. It would not be difficult to accept the notion that John would still be around to help us, to finish the job he started during his life. He loves us. In all his unconventionality, he wants to show us that life still goes on after the death of the body and that many lessons are still being learned, even for him. He is showing us how it really is. God is not an old guy with a beard, and people do not immediately get wings and harps when they die. Whether you are a Beatle fan who loved John Lennon and would like to hear how he's doing and what he has to say, or just someone interested in the spirit world, this book is extremely enjoyable and beneficial to your individual spiritual growth."},{"Title":"Across the Universe With John Lennon","review":"\\"Across the Universe with John Lennon\\" - this book has undeniably changed my life in a way that words could never accurately describe. Linda Keen, as an author, does a wonderful job in transcribing her experiences with John Lennon in the afterlife. Her bravery in coming out with her experiences are commendable, and not one day that goes by, do I not appreciate her for this.Every single Religion on planet earth believes in an afterlife. So why is it so unbelievable when someone claims to communicate with others who have \\"crossed over\\"? Don't be skeptical just because this book is about \\"John Lennon in Heaven\\", that matters not. What matters is that this book reiterates what I always knew deep down in my soul and spirit. Love crosses all time. Love crosses all dimensions. Love crosses all space. Love crosses all incarnations. Love knows NO BOUNDARIES.Death is just an illusion. John is just as alive as all of us are reading this book and going about our daily lives on planet earth. John, and all others that have crossed over, are just \\"other- dimensional\\". We must take comfort in the fact that our loved ones are ALWAYS with us , guiding us and loving us every second of our day. They never leave us. This book may be about \\"The John Lennon\\", but it is no different than any other loved one that has passed over to the other side and sends us LOVE continually.John Lennon never wished to be worshiped, nor does he wish that now. Do not look at this book and think of John as \\" the dead Beatle\\". John was just as human as all of us when he was alive. John made many mistakes, as we all do. John was flawed and dealt with many demons in his life. John, believe it or not, was very sad, lonely and insecure at times. But John was also so full of love. Love for his family. Love for all of us. Love for humanity. Love for our planet. Love for the Universe!John shows us, through Linda and this book, how even after we cross over, there is much learning that we must all go through. The \\"Spiritual Journey\\" is continual. Teaching, learning, experiencing and evolving never stop. John also shows Linda how we all create our own realities. Our reality can be as beautiful as we can possibly \\"Imagine\\". \\"Heaven\\" is what you make it.John Lennon was very outspoken and involved in trying to reach us with the \\"truth\\" while he was alive. So why would one not believe that John was trying to reach us and teach us now? John touched so many people while he was alive on earth. He still does.So John is here now. John is trying to reach us all. Through Linda Keen's book, John is saying, \\"Here it is.\\" Here I am.\\" \\"Here is what I have to say.\\" \\"Please listen.\\" \\"This is the TRUTH.\\"\\"LOVE is REAL.\\""},{"Title":"Across the Universe With John Lennon","review":"So John Lennon is still at it, making us laugh and cry, shaking us free from worn-out ways and challenging us to think afresh! Through Linda Keen, his remarkable soul-friend and co-creator of this astonishing book, he sends us his fresh understandings; he shows us that - just like ours - his consciousness is alive and growing. Linda has achieved a feat of extraordinary listening: on every page we feel John's voice and her deep, compassionate response. Together they offer us wisdom that's profound and universal. Take the phone off the hook, bolt the door - and then start reading. I defy you to put the book down, or to read it and remain unchanged."},{"Title":"Across the Universe With John Lennon","review":"I approached this book with an open mind, believing that it is entirely possible to communicate with those who have passed on. But not long after the first few chapters, it becomes painfully obvious that this book is mostly about Linda Keen, not John Lennon.First we find out that not only was she his sister in a past life, but also a spirit guardian, first violin during his Mozart incarnation, his mother, a slave owner who adored her nanny Gracie/John, a son, a daughter, a soulmate, a twin soul, a lover, and on and on. If so connected, why wasn't Keen a member of a certain rock n' roll band from Liverpool during his last incarnation, of which she readily dismisses in her book with nary a mention of Paul, Ringo, or George. In fact, when it's her time to attend a fan function on his 50th birthday, she insists the fans themselves are intruding on her own private Idaho with John, as she is forced to heal him of all those annoying projections that keep getting in their way.The most appalling moment in this book occurs when &quot;John&quot; states he visits his murderer Mark David Chapman in jail, loving and forgiving him and claiming that the two of them fit together like hand and glove. Pleeze. I don't think even the great JL is godlike enough to come to this unthinkable conclusion.When all is said and done, Keen's dialogue is most likely a lively and spirited conversation with herself, the character of John Lennon merely a manafestation of some aspect of her own spiritual yearnings or connections that take the form of JL. If she had only taken a less literal tack to the story, it would have been a delightful read with interesting, enlightening and witty insights. Instead, it flounders in a sea of self promotion."},{"Title":"Across the Universe With John Lennon","review":"It's a challenge just to pick up a book like this. After all, Lennon fans miss him sorely. Sure, we'll read anything with his name on it. But this book is pure exploitation of that name and of his life. Not anything more than complete conjecture, speculation, drivel, and worse yet, PHONY QUOTES! It is apparent that since John Lennon is dead he is no longer a person, but a symbol, a cliche. Keen sidesteps any supposed commentary by Lennon on his life by not-so-tactfully having him shrug it off. Lennon explains his new insights early in the book &quot;I could only see all this, though, after leaving my body and looking from the perspective I have now.&quot; How convenient for the author. He does talk at length about people in his life who too are deceased including his mother, father, and Aunt Mimi, even Beatles manager Brian Epstein makes an appearance as a gender confused nervous nellie. Just to seem genuine, I suppose, John occasionally makes the slight reference to a place (Liverpool)in his past. Keen writes these references as though they are off the cuff remarks by Lennon, but these buzzwords from Lennon's past shine like a diamond in the sky (get it?) See, it's safer this way. No one can disagree because all the characters are dead. Even better though, and this was almost beyond my belief, Keen actually writes Lennon with an Liverpudlian accent! He says words like &quot;yer&quot; and &quot;luv'ly&quot;. I did approach this book with an open mind. I wanted to let my mind wander into the space Linda Keen's inhabits throughout this writing. Unfortunately, I was almost immediately turned off by her constant and consistent pounding of just how similar she and John Lennon are. Did you know both their names are derived from the Irish? That's the stuff twin-soul's are made of. From the onset Keen is to have us believe she delves head long into deep philosophical journey's with Lennon, runs through fields holding hands with him, and best yet, heals him in a hotel room (page 149) by saying &quot;It's clean-up time.&quot; We all know that CLEANUP TIME is a track from Lennon/Ono's Double Fantasy LP. This book is nothing more than a young girl's fan letter to John Lennon that falls just shy of &quot;When I grow up I'm going to marry you&quot; fantasy. Why is it that kooky writers always derive inspiration from famous people? How come Keen didn't meet with my grandfather in this other level? He was a pharmacist for 50 years and I'll bet he had some good insights too. And man could he grow tomatoes. Skip &quot;Across the Universe&quot;. And if you see Linda Keen tell her I asked, &quot;How do you sleep?&quot;"},{"Title":"Across the Universe With John Lennon","review":"This silly fantasy is a money and time waster, and whoever Keen is channeling, it's obvious from the first dialogue it certainly isn't JL. It might fool the young or casual fan, but no hard-core one. The language use is corny (as someone else has mentioned)---straight out of Liverpool 1964, not the JL of NYC 1980. Frankly, this character she's channeling isn't intelligent enough, witty enough, or literary enough to be John. Plus, there's no info given during any of these dialogues Keen couldn't have gleaned from old and widely published Lennon or recent Yoko Ono interviews---especially the &quot;Browning&quot; reference and the &quot;Mozart&quot; reference--which incidentally Keen misunderstood completely. JL conducting &quot;Sergeant Pepper&quot; (McCartney's work btw)---AS Mozart!?(Actually most of us know John was more of a poet or journalist than musician.) Frankly, Keen should have picked someone less familiar--or maybe dead longer--for her channeling claims. Truly, this book reads like bad fan fiction. If you're going to claim you're &quot;channeling&quot; someone, you'd better be intimately familiar with the subject's word choice, sentence structure, references, and little-known tidbits of information to successfully pull it off---and clearly, Keen is NOT. Other reviewers say none of this is important, but I disagree. Keen claims this book is an honest dialogue with JL, and if that's its sole premise--rather than a by-product of Keen's flight of fancy into heaven--then it's vitally important the reader be convinced she's actually talking with her subject. I most certainly was not."},{"Title":"Across the Universe With John Lennon","review":"Edgar Cayce said during a seance something to the effect. Why ask for guidance from ur dead drunk father, he is still a drunk. Meaning his level of thinking is still the same.

From cover to cover, this is a beautiful book."},{"Title":"Across the Universe With John Lennon","review":"First, please forgive the long review. I simply have too much to say to contain this to a few sentences. Secondly, I mention many spoilers here, and just wanted to warn anyone before they read any further.I wanted to believe this..really I did. I was so excited to order this book, being a fan of John Lennon and The Beatles. I also ordered, \\"Peace at Last\\", but was more eager to read, \\"Across the Universe\\". By the time I was done with both books, the reverse turned out to be true.I have no doubt that Linda Keen experienced *something* or *someone* in her psychic journey's, but I question whether it was really John, and also, whether Heaven (or the Afterlife, if you prefer), is really as she depicts. Much of what she said didn't resonate with me at all.For example, at one point in the book \\"John\\" is reminded of his abandonment issues and sobs uncontrollably. I've read many different spiritual books and the one theme that often comes up is how you are healed of the pain of your Earthly incarnation, if not immediately, then over time. I find it hard to believe that ten years after John's death, he is still struggling with all of the issues of the flesh, so to speak. He comes across very insecure, at times, and still very much attached to the ego. From most of the spiritual books that I've read, the impression I've gotten is that once one crosses over to the Other Side, they eventually come to know the spiritual being that they truly are; devoid of the trappings of the flesh and of the ego. All of the physical, mental and psychological pain of their former existence falls away and they are reminded of the pure and perfect soul that they truly are.If Linda Keen would have you believe it, Heaven is a place much like Earth where you can fall asleep snoring away (as John does), get drunk (as John does), eat (something I had read is not necessary in the spiritual realm--eating OR sleeping), and encounter wild boars that look like they are going to attack you. It's also a place where danger seems to lurk at every corner depending upon where you are or what you are doing. At one point upon climbing a mountain to get to Arcadia or Paradise, the author fears she is going to topple off of the cliff. In another, John and the author go through some type of initiation ritual where they are forced to face their fears, reminding me of a page taken from \\"The Celestine Prophecy\\". Why one would have to go through such measures in Heaven is beyond me, and contradicts everything I've ever read about the Afterlife.At one point, John meets up with his father who appears as a beggar to him. From what I've read, there are different levels of Heaven and those who are of the mindset (still harboring a beggar, thief, murderous mentality, etc.) stay in the same \\"communities\\" with like-minded people until they don't want to, anymore, and realize that their thoughts, alone, can make them \\"leave\\" at anytime. Why John's father would appear as a beggar to him in an environment so unlike his state of being just doesn't mesh with me and everything I've read.In another scene, Brian Epstein magically appears and in a flustered state hurries on his way because he is \\"late for an appointment\\". One of the comments that John makes after Brian has hurried away is that \\"he has a lot to work out with women\\". That comment struck me as being highly ignorant and inaccurate because most people (at least Beatle fans) know that Brian was homosexual, so to suggest that his sexual preference was an affliction brought about by having a \\"problem\\" with women is very insulting and narrow-minded, if you ask me. Why John and/or the spiritual realm would cast Brian's \\"malady\\" in such a light seems like a judgment to me that has no place in Heaven. As I understand it, we choose to be whatever we are (male, female, heterosexual or gay, etc), to learn life lessons, so looking at it in that respect, there was nothing whatsoever \\"wrong\\" with Brian being gay.Brian also comes across as some kind of bumbling idiot, unsure of himself and verbally sparring (albeit, briefly) with John.Sorry. Don't \\"buy\\" it.John also talks about his murderer, Mark David Chapman, how he loves and forgives him and how \\"it took guts for him to do what he felt he had to!\\"WHAT?????While I get the whole thing about your thoughts attracting what you most fear to you (something John mentions in relation to his death), I wouldn't go so far as to call Chapman a victim (as John suggests) because he was \\"being driven against his will to kill me\\".My honest opinion about all this is that John comes across still too attached to his last Earthly incarnation or his \\"human-ness\\" if you will, and the objectivity that you think one would possess as a spiritual being is sorely lacking. Yes, I believe one-hundred percent that John forgives his murderer because as a spiritual being he can see the whole picture of his last life and its purpose. Also, if you believe that we have \\"soul contracts\\" prior to our birth and nothing is an accident, then it would make sense that John would come to see (or remember) that his death was as it should have been. But his take on Chapman being the \\"bigger\\" victim then he doesn't ring true to my soul because it shows him looking at things from a human point of view.In \\"Conversations with God\\", God says that there are no victims in life; everything happens for a reason and is perfection personified, even though we can't see it as such while in human form. In \\"Across the Universe\\", I see a John with possibly the same human qualities he had on Earth, only difference being he is in the spiritual realms. Again, I find it very hard to believe that after being in Heaven all that time, his ego issues would not have fallen away to reveal his true spiritual essence. Aren't we all spiritual beings having a human experience? From the many spiritual books I've read, in Heaven you are \\"you, only better\\". In \\"ATU\\" I sense a John that has not evolved much from his Earthly existence, and that just doesn't ring true to me.Another thing, the author frequently basks in the glory of having shared many past lives with John. All I can say is, how \\"convenient\\". She also claims that John was Mozart in a past life, but there have also been claims that Michael Jackson was, too!Also, during their trip to Arcadia when they had a meeting of sorts, the \\"head\\" of the meeting discusses Greek philosophy, or what-have-you, and I failed to understand how this type of history lesson was to help their next Earthly incarnation. If I'm going to learn anything in Heaven, I want to know how to better cope with Earthly (or whatever planet on incarnate on) conditions, be it people or circumstances. I do not need to know what the Greeks thought about \\"such-and-such\\".In her travels, people the author meets range from homely to attractive, vary in shapes and sizes, and her and John's clothing often changes miraculously from one thing to the next.What's the point?? And why would there even be any homely people in Heaven, much less anyone with physical or mental afflictions?....An arduous climb up a mountain. Why??? Isn't Heaven supposed to be devoid of the hardships of Earth?In another \\"scene\\", John tells the author that a fellow \\"colleague\\" could have destroyed him, but decided to teach him a lesson, instead.Destroy each other in Heaven??? Not my Heaven...and the idea that getting to the gates of Paradise or what-have-you; the risk and mental and physical turmoil involved--makes no sense to me whatsoever. I believe God loves us all and that Paradise (or whatever one chooses to call it) is \\"free\\" to everyone. One shouldn't have to jump through hoops and go on stressful journey's to reach it, or worse, be forced to literally find it in order to experience the beauty of Heaven.While the spiritual insights that John utters are truths I've read of in other books, his personality and demeanor, the fact that the Heaven in this telling seems like a beautiful, but malleable and sometimes dangerous place, and the characters you meet along the way seem like just that--caricatures and not spiritual beings, make this a hard tale to swallow. Again, I've no doubt that Linda Keen believes what she saw in her channeling's.. I just doubt how much of this is true or whether it is the imaginative ramblings of fantasies she harbors about being a frequent past-life partner of a famous ex-Beatle."},{"Title":"Across the Universe With John Lennon","review":"This book is the best of all books about the afterlife because it deals with someone we all know (John Lennon) in a way that we all understand it. I'm sure that once in our lives a dead relative or friend has contacted us, whether we believe it or not. This is further proof that even though the people we love are dead, they are not unactive! It is a comforting thought. 'Across The Universe With John Lennon' is so real that one wishes they could be there right along side with Linda and John, and often feel as though you are."},{"Title":"Across the Universe With John Lennon","review":"I have watched the progression of this book and its author for ten years. I first encountered it in a very synchronistic way in a bookshop in San Francisco: it fell off the shelf at my friend not a day after we had been discussing John Lennon having been Mozart in a past life. I was compelled by this astonishing occurence to write to Linda as a fellow writer and long-time student of philosophy. I found her to be a very straightforward and down to earth person, not in the least a Beatlefan of the typical mould. Having some fifteen years' experiece at that time studying psychical phenomena, I was convinced that what she had experienced was quite genuine, as it fit exactly with what I had heard from other people who also had contact with John in other dimensions.Whatever certain reviewers here may think, based on what they think they know of the private Lennon, John was a deeply spiritual man, and one of his abiding concerns was to open up people's minds to the fact that there is more to us than the everyday workaday world would admit. As many people asked in early Beatle days 'Why was a man who could write the like of &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows&quot; jumping around on the stages of the world singing &quot;Twist and Shout&quot;?'I found this book deeply moving the first time I read it ten years ago and every time since; it is, I believe, a gift to us from John, a loving remnder that life is not meaningless, crass and stupid, that we do go on, and that loving each other and learning is what we're about. For those who are sceptical, or enquiring, or just beginning on a spiritual path this book is a good friend; it explains much commonly accepted basic information in a way that is palatable and not stuffy, by a pair of guides (John and Linda) who are unafraid to stand up and reveal themselves for what they are. There are no social masks, and, on Linda's part, no grandiosity."},{"Title":"Across the Universe With John Lennon","review":"I read the original edition of this book about four years ago and it was recently brought to my mind because I was describing to a friend a very unusual set of circumstances that happened while I was reading the book. Like several of the other reviewers, while initially getting into the book, I had some difficulty accepting that Linda Keen was actually communicating with John Lennon. It happened that I was reading the book at Thanksgiving time and, that Thanksgiving night, I was talking with a friend of mine in another state while I was holding and discussing the book (telling her I was having a difficult time believing it), which was closed on my lap. While we talked, I flipped open the book and just as I did, she said the words &quot;red clouds.&quot; I looked down at the book and saw that the title of the chapter was &quot;Red Clouds&quot; and then asked her why she said those words. She said she didn't know. I told her about the title of the chapter that I had flipped open to and we both were rather awed. The next morning I was getting ready for work and still carrying on a conversation with myself about whether the book was &quot;real&quot; or not. The previous night I had read about John's song &quot;Mother&quot; and I vaguely remembered it from high school days. I finally told myself that if I heard the song &quot;Mother&quot; before the end of the day, then I would believe Linda Keen's story. I had the radio on all day at work and never heard &quot;Mother.&quot; I drove home and was station surfing all the way. No &quot;Mother.&quot; As I pulled up to my house, I switched stations one more time and there it was... John Lennon screaming &quot;Mother don't leave me... Mother don't go.&quot; I just started shaking and crying. I have never heard that song on the radio since. It was a powerful moment and is one I'll never forget. The book is a real story about John and where he went after he died, of that I'm certain."},{"Title":"Across the Universe With John Lennon","review":"As a John Lennon freak and yoga teacher of more than 25 years, I am a fan of Linda Keen's books for a number of reasons. Her first book, Intuition Magic (originally written in the Netherlands in the late \`70's before John Lennon's demise) gives readers an entirely new way of looking at psychic ability, namely that each human being has their own \\"take\\" on--their own unique way perceiving--reality which cannot be compared with the reality of anyone else. In other words, \\"reality\\" only exists in the mind and heart of the beholder. John Lennon believed the same thing. Taking this into consideration, Keen's ideas in her book Across the Universe suggest that each reader will ultimately pick up different aspects of John Lennon's afterlife in their own way. Just look at the discrepancy in opinions about this book and you will see what I mean.With all due respect for individual impressions of Keen's authenticity, I find some of the criticisms of this book to be lacking in vision and understanding. For some do not even mention the vital and significant outcome of Keen's story, which not only shows a strong and transformed John, but illustrates how he is working on all levels of himself at the same time, each level being just as important as the other. One person says she knows there are different levels of heaven, yet at the same time, it seems she does not appreciate learning from the story about the details of why and how this is true, i.e. the less-fun and more difficult levels of consciousness which must be worked out either in the body or out of the body, i.e. the struggle between dark and light. This is what I found to be so interesting about this author's story, because it gave me a bigger picture of how heaven and earth are inter-connected, how they compliment and support each other, something she/John call \\"consciousness conveyance: the two-way street between matter and spirit.\\"I have my own ideas about what \\"heaven\\" might be like, but I was more than happy to broaden my scope and get some new ideas which only compliment the ones I already have. And, what some reviewers criticize as being silly or too far-fetched in Keen's/John's story is what I find to be the strongest element of all: John's love of playfulness and his outstanding sense of humor. Again, if he were to pick someone who could tap into this aspect of his afterlife, I think it would be someone with a sense of humor which Keen obviously has. And, if John were to choose someone to write about him in 1987 (when Keen's story begins), why not her? How do we know there isn't some connection between them? He must have some people on earth who knew him in his previous lives--yet not in his life as Lennon--what's the big deal?In addition, theoretically, if John were to choose a writer who could somehow touch upon his experiences out of the body, I think it would be someone like Keen who had been teaching intuitive/psychic development for years before she felt drawn to write about her experiences with Lennon, often with trepidation and resistance. I'm not saying that Keen's experiences are \\"true\\" or \\"false,\\" \\"right\\" or \\"wrong.\\" It's just that I believe this book has the potential of helping many readers, like I said, to open doors and to broaden their scope of what is possible in heaven and on earth.Again, with all due respect, I find some reviewers to be shortsighted and judgmental in certain places, for instance, an assumption that Keen is anti-gay just because John tells her that Brian Epstein has some important issues to work out with women. Keen's clearly compassionate position as a counselor and healer shows us that at least one reviewer is misconstruing the author's intent. Didn't John get himself into a heap of trouble by his misconstrued statement that the Beatles were \\"bigger than Jesus Christ\\"? Did this mean he was anti-Christ? Besides, how do we know that Mr. Epstein did not have something to work out, gay or straight? Like I said, it is simply Keen's interpretation of what John had to tell her, not something that must be labeled \\"right\\" or \\"wrong.\\"(Also, not everyone may know that it's well-established that Lennon and Epstein had a very close relationship).To sum it all up, if you take a look at all the books about John Lennon out there, specifically books about his spiritual beliefs, I feel that most of them, no matter how interesting or credible, lack a quality which John would have certainly appreciated and desired: humor and playfulness. So, for me, the criticisms of some readers who say the story is too outlandish, and therefore not to be believed, are suffering from a way-too-serious concept of what it is like to be out of the body. As someone who meditates regularly, I know that being out-of-the body--in dreams, meditations, or even in altered states from taking LSD or any other mind bending substance--can be filled, next to everything else, with amazing lightheartedness, fun and adventure. Excuse the pun, but truly \\"the sky is the limit\\" when it comes to what human consciousness can experience. So to have reviewers say, \\"don't read this book,\\" or \\"it's not worth it,\\" is, to me, a real pity as well as an unfortunate attempt to limit a quite plausible and shining encounter with the spirit of John.I suggest you give this book a chance."},{"Title":"Across the Universe With John Lennon","review":"\\"Across the Universe with John Lennon\\" is a down-to-earth and humorous story as well as a highly developed and positive spiritual message---just what I would expect from John himself. Linda's story bridges a gap---the gap between the sadness of John's death and the vague suspicion that our spirit friends are indeed trying to help us at this juncture in history around the new millenium. If ever there as a person who would try to communicate with us from beyond the grave, wouldn't John Lennon be among the first to sign up for the job? Anyone who understood him at all during his life must agree that John was a humanitarian who believed in love and peace and did not shy away from unconventional ways to get his message across---first through rock-n-roll and then through bed-ins. He was also deeply spiritual and experienced much psychic phenomena himself. It would not be difficult to accept the notion that John would still be around to help us, to finish the job he started during his life. He loves us. In all his unconventionality, he wants to show us that life still goes on after the death of the body and that many lessons are still being learned, even for him. He is showing us how it really is. God is not an old guy with a beard, and people do not immediately get wings and harps when they die. Whether you are a Beatle fan who loved John Lennon and would like to hear how he's doing and what he has to say, or just someone interested in the spirit world, this book is extremely enjoyable and beneficial to your individual spiritual growth."},{"Title":"Across the Universe With John Lennon","review":"Being a certified hypnotherapist, and an \\"engineer\\" type of person who likes to study how things work (consciousness, being the ultimate puzzle), I'm quite familiar with various altered states of consciousness. Like Harry Houdini, I don't like to see the unwary public being taken advantage of by those people \\"trying to pull a fast one,\\" and so I'm posting this.Psychic phenomena has become VERY common these days. Many people are \\"channeling\\" or are involved in some sort of communication with \\"the other side.\\" The vast majority of them have had little training (if any [beyond a weekend psychic development class]). What I run into SO often (and is the case here) is that the \\"channeler\\" will produce either NO information which was they did not already know or was available, or they will produce information which is completely unverifiable. I ask you: If Ms. Keen really WAS in touch with John Lennon -- and wanted to prove it so that no one could question it -- don't you think she'd have SOMEHOW gotten SOMEONE who KNEW John to at least give her a question (to which the situation or answer would not be public knowledge) to put to \\"John?\\" No... there's absolutely no such proof given, nor will you find any review here from anyone who DID know John saying that, Yes, this was undoubtedly THE John Lennon Ms. Keen was in touch with.So what is this book? Without getting Ms. Keen in for some sessions, I cannot say. It could be that she is indeed channeling \\"something or someone\\" (there are many, many presences who think it's great fun to impersonate and fool these silly humans). It could also be that it's all simply a result of a very active imagination (after all, how do you think fictional books get written?). I really wish Ms. Keen HAD been able to get in touch with John Lennon, but there's nothing written in this book to indicate such. Houdini would have seen through through this charade faster than a New York taxi driver can blow his horn. Give Ms. Keen one star for getting the book published and on Amazon."},{"Title":"Across the Universe With John Lennon","review":"Ok, I figure I'll be labelled a New Age wacko for giving this book four stars, but that's ok. Things aren't always what they seem, is my opinion. Linda Keen gives us her experience of dialogue with the late, great Mr. Lennon, and the workings of the afterlife. I've never been a particularly religious person, but choose to take from many spiritual systems, Hinduism, Theosophy, Buddhism, Paganism, etc. I found that many of the things Keen says, through John, relate to ideas I've always had about the afterlife, that we go there to learn things, work through problems in our previous lives, and hopefully learn something in the process. And that there is no fame there, and people have the same bodies just once in many lifetimes. My ideal of the afterlife would be to be able to walk up to F. Scott Fitzgerald, Van Gogh, Charles Chaplin or any other of my idols and have a good chit-chat. Supposedly, this is true. Then again, Keen could just have been spouting her ideas from reading them from esoteric texts. However, these ideas are what strike me most about the book, not necessarily the writing, which isn't all that great, and Keen spends too much time focusing on her own life, and how it related, supposedly, to John. Kinda brings back an old quote from the movie 'Bull Durham', when Kevin Costner says something to the effect of 'Why does everyone have these famous past lives, like 'I used to be Queen Elizabeth'? Why couldn't they just have been Joe Schmo?'The idea of John having been Mozart in a past life doesn't seem quite as far fetched as at first glance (and believe me, I was thinking, what a crock!). Think about it, from what I know, Mozart died a pauper, dismissed as a crazy man with little talent, who is now considered the greatest composer of all time. Why wouldn't John come back, to be more wildly famous than virtually anyone up to that point? Karmic, if you ask me.He was getting back what was due him; but he also had to pay a lot for it. I am not sure I disagree when Keen divulges that John almost inititated his own death. This was a man with many demons, and John himself did foray into spiritual matters, like astrology, in his secluded years, as if searching for an answer to overcome those demons.I'd only recommend this book to those with an open mind toward spiritual ideas. The text may be a bit cloudy and not have all the answers, but I feel it's a worthwhile read for those who are curious and can deal with contradictions.

Aajonus discusses some healthy food combinations and gives some valuable recipes (suited even for babies!).As I have found out with many of the MDs and PhDs I've listed in my other review of his first book, they all advocate using a blender and a juicer. It reminds me of what Richard Schulze M.D. always said: a blender and a juicer saves lives! It's so true.In this book Aajonus discusses what cooking does to nutrients in food, if microbes are dangerous to humans and bacterial food-poisoning etc.I was very pleased to read that Aajonus is writing new books and that CD/DVDs will be published that show how to make recipes and use kitchen equipment etc. Anxiously waiting these arrivals...!"},{"Title":"The Recipe for Living Without Disease","review":"Aajonus's first book was a little too New-Agey for my tastes. This, his 2nd book, is however OUTSTANDING. It contains numerous references to various scientific studies and reports, which I have seen referred to in New Scientist magazine among other sources. The previous book neglected this aspect to a certain extent.The beginning and end of the book deal with the theory behind the diet, demolishing the irrational concerns of society, such as regards parasites and bacteria, while the middle part deals with recipes and the like.All in all, I have to say, that I have tried numerous other diets out there(Palaeolithic Diet, Vegetarianism, Raw Vegan, Hay Diet,Instincto, Atkins, \\"balanced diet\\" etc.) but the Primal Diet is the only diet which actually restored my health. This book is a must-read for anyone who is interested in improving their energy levels or in curing their long-term health problems.I would like to add that my former (very serious) health problems were only got rid of completely once I switched to a fully Raw, Palaeolithic variation of this Primal Diet:- I had to eliminate raw veggie juice and all raw dairy from my diet(like many RPDers I have a very strong food-intolerance/allergy towards raw dairy), reduce drastically consumption of raw honey, raw fruit, and raw (solid) veg, to minimal amounts, and eat mainly (raw) organ- meats(especially high-fat ones like bone-marrow/suet/tongue etc.), glands and fatty muscle-meats in place of overly lean muscle-meats.

So you've read The Primal Diet, and you have learned that there is a recipe book. That's great! But, there's just one little problem; how to get the ingredients. I don't know about the rest of you, but I live in a state that licenses raw dairies, but not to sell in stores or even at outdoor produce markets. I have no idea what these licenses are for. Many states don't license dairies at all. No doubt, unless you live on a farm, there will be problems getting raw milk, raw butter, raw cream, raw cheese and meat from grass fed cattle to varying degrees depending on your location. But, not to worry; there is a way. Buying clubs are springing up like mushrooms all over the country. That's one of the things I learned about when I started looking into raw food diets. Many people are determined, in spite of the interference of government, to get real living food for themselves and their families. These clubs are composed of everyday citizens just like you and me who want the kind of food they know will keep their families healthy. In fact, there are so many that it's going to be hard for the government to convince the general population that the desire for natural food is just a fad promulgated by a few wild-eyed fanatics. The author's point is that raw meat and dairy are far safer than the government would have us believe. And raw dairy products taste better by far.The Recipe for Living Without Disease is well worth buying if you are serious about going raw, and even if you are not. It educates about the digestive system, and tells how to eat your food depending on what diet you are on, whether it's raw, cooked, or part raw, part cooked. There is a wealth of information about how the human digestive system works and what foods work best within it. The author talks about how we wage war on our bodies instead of working with them to keep ourselves healthy. Some people probably won't like this book because it brings home the fact that our bodies belong to the animal world whether we like it or not, and they have to be taken care of like the animals they are, no matter how spiritual we are or we think we are. He explains the role of bacteria and parasites in a way that I am sure you have never heard before, but this is information you need to see, even if only as food for thought. If you think long enough, you might realize that what he says makes sense. More than a recipe book, this is a book for serious study.Reading this book has both dismayed me and given me hope. I am dismayed by the deliberate attempts of the government to protect the purveyors of dead food at all costs and to remove all opportunities to obtain the living foods that our bodies need unless they are covered with chemical sprays and/or genetically modified while at the same time telling us we are not doing enough to stay healthy. It's amazing to me that we are as healthy as we are considering the obstacles they have put in our way.Have you ever smelled some of the baby formulas available today? I remember that long ago they used to smell like vitamins, but I recently came across one that smelled like moldy hay. The baby being given this formula was screaming his head off and drawing his legs up the way babies do when their stomachs hurt. Does someone actually believe that since babies can't talk they can put anything they want in these formulas and nobody will know the difference? Are the makers of these formulas getting the close scrutiny that sellers of raw dairy products get? If so, they need to explain what nutritious item in these formulas happens to smell like moldy hay.I have hope for the future when I see the strong community spirit among the buying club members and the way everyone works together and tries to be of help and service to their fellow members. I find this very heartening and uplifting in a world where the American People have been dissed and denigrated in every way possible. The Media paints us as the dumbest and most immoral people in the world, but when you get down to the grass roots, that's not what you see at all. What you see are smart people, thinking people, caring people who want healthy and happy families and who will buckle down and do the work that's needed to make that happen in spite of the obstacles being put in their way."},{"Title":"The Recipe for Living Without Disease","review":"This book will change the way you look at everything you put into your body.

I used to suffer from chronic cystic acne. I would get recurring infections that would not go away and would leave large scars behind when they finally did. Eventually I found out it was cooked and refined, sugars, starches and fats that was causing the problem. Eating a mostly raw diet of meats and veggies has brought health to me beyond what I even hoped for. I now have more energy, I'm not perpetually cold, I've finally gained weight and of course, my acne is gone.This book is great both as an introduction to raw eating and to help those of us who have been practicing this diet to understand why and how it works.It includes plenty of references so you can chase down his claims.The recipes are great, they allow you to enjoy things that you wouldn't be able to eat as much otherwise.The only complaint I have is that I want more.

If you trust information that only comes from a doctor, and food that comes in a container, than this is not the book for you. If you are interested in information that gets measurable, irrefutable results, than this book is worth experimenting with in your own life. What Aajonus teaches, he learned from recovering from 3 terminal cancers himself over 30 years ago, and replicated in thousands of cases over the decades. Success is its own review.The ideas were so radical,though, that I sat with the book for a month before trying it because I wasn't sure I could really do it. Then I did and I have never felt better in my life and I'm just 3 weeks into it. Even doing just parts of the diet will begin to bring energy and clarity back to you because where does life force come from? From food that has life.I recommend buying both books, this plus \\"We Want to Live.\\" It's important to educate yourself with both volumes - this one has recipes, the other has information plus protocols to follow with different symptoms of disease.

In my mind it just goes to show how adaptable the human body is. The food plan succeeds, in my humble opinion, because the author is eating at the extremes. The high protein diet would typically cause severe ketosis. This is counteracted by the highly alkalizing vegetable drink, There is virtually no fiber to speak of which will eventually lead to colon problems I'm sure. The gastrointestinal tract REQUIRES fiber to keep things moving along; it needs the fiber so there is enough bulk moving through the system to push things along. A high protein and vegetable juice diet provides almost no fiber. This can't be good long term.Some of the recipes are interesting and even tasty. It was a fun read though the diet appears flawed.

While I find the premise suspect, I found one element of the book downright disgusting - the author details a story of a woman whose health was restored from eating poop. Yes, you read that correctly - poop - as in feces.

It also paves the way for exploration of difficult issues like suffering and unfairness in the world.Wolpe never gets preachy; rather, he suggests ways to create shared moments with your child not just to teach but to validate his or her views on religion. A child who asks, &quot;Why did God give Moses a speech impediment?&quot; might not need an answer. He might be waiting to tell you, as Wolpe touchingly recounts, &quot;So my sister wouldn't feel so bad&quot; (because of HER speech impediment).That's the kind of God Wolpe wants kids and adults to share -- a God who cares about us and our feelings, even little girls who stutter. His chapters are at once deeply philosophical and eminently practical. You can tell just by reading this book that Wolpe is a man who knows kids and knows God and sees how naturally the two go hand-in-hand.Of course, because there's a child in each and every one of us, there is always the possibility that this book can help US re-establish connections to the divine that we haven't felt since childhood. And that, as they say in the credit card ads, is priceless."},{"Title":"Teaching Your Children About God: A Modern Jewish Approach","review":"I first became aware of Rabbi Wolpe through his television appearances. He is frequently a commentator on the programs \\"Ancient Almanac\\", \\"Mysteries of the Bible,\\" and other religious programs produced for the Discovery and History Channels. I have always found him remarkably eloquent, insightful, and wise. I checked this book out of my local library after the birth of my first child. Although I am not Jewish, I cannot imagine finding a better resource for how to talk, one day, to my children about God. Beyond that, I found the book to be personally inspiring because, obviously, such a book causes one to reflect on one's own understanding of God, and mine was most definitely enriched. I am sure that I will re-read this book many times for my own personal reflection before I ever consult it for advice on how to answer my child's questions.In terms of the \\"Modern Jewish Approach,\\" rituals such as the Sabbath dinner, Passover, Yom Kippur, the bris, etc... are mentioned frequently; stories and anecdotes from the Talmud, Midrash and centuries of Jewish scholars and storytellers are generously sprinkled throughout the book, however there wasn't anything mentioned that I felt I \\"couldn't use\\" because I am not Jewish. In fact, I plan to look for more because I found the anecdotes and stories most helpful in explaining complicated, philosophical issues.Among the issues discussed in the book are: Where does God come from? Did He write a book? Is He a She? Where to look for God? What does God want from us? Why are there different religions? Does God hear our prayers? Why does God permit evil? Why do we die? Is there a heaven and/or hell? Does God still talk to us? And many others I have not listed.The book is delightfully readable and I would highly recommend it to anyone, parent or not, Jewish or not, who is looking to have their notion of God reinvigorated and challenged."},{"Title":"Teaching Your Children About God: A Modern Jewish Approach","review":"This is a must read for anyone who has questions on how to interpret religion for children"},{"Title":"Teaching Your Children About God: A Modern Jewish Approach","review":"I really enjoyed this book.

This tells you in detail,from using the first angle of a childs imagination to teach them about the Lord, To common aspects of God we should teach our children such as Gods Love and Justice and Prayer.It also touches on the hard things in life such as death.

It's the book your English teacher(and your parents) didn't want you to read in high school. At times, it is debaucherous and raunchy, but then again so is growing up. That's what makes this book so great - Bukowski's impressive and unique ability to tell it like it really happened - with no sugar-coating or glossing over the dirty stuff. Some people say this is comparable to Catcher in the Rye as a rite of passage type book. I say this is much, much better than Salinger's book - no doubt. While both have a devoted fan following, Ham on Rye is unique in the sense that it is much more plausible and much more fun. I not only empathized with Henry and his trying travails and tribulations, I felt like I was there with him - looking at the teacher's legs, getting beat by his Dad, getting drunk with his friends, etc.While this book is not politically correct by any stretch of the imagination and, thus, not for everybody, I unequivocally feel that this is a must read for those of us who are not constrained by limits and boundaries placed upon us by others.

This is not a mystery or thriller. Much of the appeal of Bukowski's writing is one man's insight into human nature, even if viewed from the bottom, as he wanders from bar to bar, job to job, and woman to woman.For fans of 'frat lit' books like \\"I Hope They Serve Beer In Hell\\", Bukowski is light years ahead and you will know who the real master is. Enjoy."},{"Title":"Ham on Rye","review":"As an Angelino, there's a part of me that has always returned to Charles Bukowski(and \\"Ham on Rye\\" in particular) when I needed a much needed lift from the occasional overload of this megalopolis. Bukowski offers me a way to view my city and my world to some extent, through the prism of another no less difficult but perhaps more intriguing time that perhaps still exists somewhere right here within the confines of my own L.A. To make ruminating on these matters even better? How about if just for a little while I view it through the masterful, epic, sarcastic and humorous skew which I used to think belonged solely to Charles Bukowski? That's a little bit of heaven right there.Sometimes you'll hear people call something \\"authentic Bukowski\\" or \\"the real Bukowski\\" which means that we who already \\"get it\\" know what it is we're defining without necessarily laying down that definition. It's an irreverence, a humor darkly, a sharp wit, an acute eye....the list is long and each reviewer would necessarily add his or her own pieces to that puzzle. I'm hitting this book with 5 stars and there's more than enough reviewing in here to tell you why - it's sad, it's hilarious, it's \\"authentic Bukowski.\\" To be indoctrinated into that understanding you need go no further than to hit the \\"BUY\\" button.So yes, 5 stars and \\"BUY.\\" Also since I review a lot and the Bukowski audience is a special one into which there is quite literally no new material flowing I have a recommendation. I read, recently reviewed and loved the novel \\"The Nimrod\\" by Mark Kelliher. If Bukowski and Vonnegut got together in heaven and collaborated on a work, \\"The Nimrod\\" would almost certainly be that book. So there's my two for one review of similar works. Check them BOTH out. You won't be disappointed.The Nimrod"},{"Title":"Ham on Rye","review":"Bukowski comes clean on some things in this book, perhaps because, dropping back to childhood years, he couldn't help himself. Some things must have just bubbled up despite his outsider persona (more on this below). In this one we not only learn about his awful father and miserable upbringing, but about some of his early influences, as well as some writers and writing styles he recoiled from. He's more human in Ham on Rye.Bukowski hates pretense. It's what makes him fascinating, and laudable. He hates it with the passion of a Celine, another misanthrope who knew how to write. And yet in this book, with its smattering of vulnerable details, we get a hint that in other books, tough guy Henry Chinaski, Bukowski's alter ego, is not an entirely pretense-free construct. Which is too bad, because the scant criticism Bukowski gets (he has mostly fans, few detractors)--that there's no uplift in his writing, no redemption--probably derives from this missing slice of his life.And of course it should be said that Bukowski can be nasty. His takedown of Henry Miller in another book, for instance--whom he presents as an old man, living in Pacific Palisades, supposedly trying to cadge money from his younger visitor (a transparent aka)--gave me the creeps. Why savage your precursor?Back to Ham on Rye: somewhere along the way I realized I was reading this novel/memoir as if it were a noir mystery--a Jim Thompson, say--which is a genre I like, but whose limitations I understand. And I realized too that I'd lowered my expectations, to accept Bukowski for what he is: a very good writer, but not a great one.I Think, Therefore Who Am I?"},{"Title":"Ham on Rye","review":"This book covers Charles Bukowski from his earliest memories at the age of two, up until he is twenty years old. Every part of this book is entertaining, from his classroom antics and lineup of outcast friends, even down to his frequent beating at the hand of his father - which he get so used to, that they didn't even affect him after a while. What a miserable first twenty years he went through. Just when he starts to hit his stride, he comes down with what a doctor decribes as the 'worst case' of acne vulgaris he had ever seen. He didn't catch too many breaks in life - seemily not until the times he experienced in his novel \\"Women\\", another great book.

Henry is experiencing the normal occurences that a teenage boy his age does. But theres other not normal things happening to him, he is abused by his father and as a result of the abuse he gets involved in alcohol use and violence.This novel was appealing to me because the book immediatley had a sense of humor that fit me well. It also unlike many other books was very funny. This is what seperates &quot;Ham On Rye&quot; from many other books in my opinion. I found myself not wanting to put down the book, for example a 10 minute reading session would turn into an hour session in just what seemed like seconds. I think for this book to be appealing to the reader that the reader has to have a different type of humor to them. Overall this book was very good and I am looking forward to reading it again.

The main character, Henry Chinaski, is abused by his father and has trouble fitting in with the guys at school. This book tells it how it is growing up and expirementing and all the difficulties that come along with it. Bukowski talks about what the reader wants to read about. The book is not sugar-coated and tells about what really gets talked about and remembered from the school years. The writing style is very interesting and different, sometimes with sentence fragments and two-page chapters. The reader really gets into the anti-American outcast mindset of the main character. This book would appeal to most males 15-up."},{"Title":"Ham on Rye","review":"Every life is a fantastic piece of living art. Each is as unique as it is identical, and our minds are vessels of change and will. In Charles Bukowski's brilliant, ugly novel Ham On Rye, the reader is introduced to a tormented, strong and ironically delicate protagonist whose own life is his foil, and pain his only crutch. From a silent child to a brooding man who screams with his fists, his life is the focus, and the blurry characters that surround it.Henry Chinaski is a lonely character, tortured by a life he is forced to embrace, though ignorant to its agendas and inner workings. His is an existence swilling with horribly cynical and selfish individuals, numb to their own freedom and influence over those around them. Henry is bombarded with challenges of formidable and often overwhelming bearing, and he is forced to try and understand the will of others and the fickle nature of society, all the while desperate to piece himself together. The story follows Chinaski, from his first inklings of life's frailties to a weathered young man, strong with defeat. Henry's father, who raises him by pushing him down, throws Henry away with sadistic routine, both mentally and physically. His father's explosive anger is only overshadowed by his lust for his own eccentric sense of vanity, which is built up by the breaking down of those around him, acquainted or not. Henry, and his pawn of a mother are always the focus of his tyranny. With growing up comes many problems, challenges that are universal in essence but individual nonetheless. With Henry, the perils of day-to-day life are only accented by the heavy hardships he is forced to hurdle. From the ever-present, impossible mystery of women to an education system that cannot contain him, and even a horrid case of acne, which only augments Henry's state of isolation, his daunting and unending misfortunes weaken him inside as he grows stronger outside. He is driven to understand a life that he never will, favoring observation over inane experiences.This is a novel about love, yet devoid of it. Henry's life is as profound as it is random, as ironic as it is seemingly pointless. We follow him through awkward and turbulent adventures, visits with relatives he'll forget, and friends and enemies he'll never really know. The story is varied and raw (a true reflection of life), but Henry's relationship with is father is of central importance. His violent, heatless nature is Henry's only model for personal development. So, instead of embodying his father's twisted idiosyncrasies and strange, consistent machinations towards society, Henry counters his father's personality, and both consciously and subconsciously forces himself farther and father away. But the more Henry attempts to abandon his father, the more he begins to become him. A hoard of anger calluses over Henry's being, and he becomes short tempered, violent and quick to punches. As he matures, the bottle begins to beget all other events in his life, and becomes a cure for all his mental ailments. He begins to live his life in a drunken haze, throwing away the clear-headed, pessimism of his youth. With this comes a slow realization that the only thing he'll ever understand about life is the pain it brings. It has toppled a spirit that was never really there.Charles Bukowski writes with a brilliant sense of honesty, and raw, intense sympathy for his character. The novel is composed in such a way that it appears as though the Bukowski himself experienced, perhaps autobiographical. His observations are so vivid, simple and yet poignant. The author uses language that is fiercely lyrical and at the same time candid and crude.\\"My spoon was bent so that if I wanted to eat I had to pick the spoon up with my right hand. If I picked it up with my left hand, the spoon bent away from my mouth. I wanted to pick up the spoon with my left hand.\\"With all the pain Henry Chinaski experiences, there is still a strange sense of optimism about the novel. One not only gains appreciation and a better understanding of the fickle nature of our social environment, but also realized how painfully blind we are to each other and our means. Disillusionment is not something one typically grows out of, but rather learns to ignore, and the more one tries to understand the world around us the less one learns. There is no secret to life, and there is no ending, only new beginnings and uncertainty."},{"Title":"Ham on Rye","review":"Most fans of the late, great Charles Bukowski, myself included, list Ham On Rye as their favorite Bukowski novel - and rightfully so. This novel is actually a thinly-veiled autobiography of the man we knew and loved as &quot;The Bard of Booze and Broads.&quot; We see through the eyes of young Henry Chinaski as he comes of age in Depression-era America, the product of a dysfunctional and physically abusive household. From his early childhood as a desperately lonely, yet antisocial little boy to his adolescence (where he struggles with crippling acne and develops a love of literature), we see the genesis of a great writer. Bukowski pulls no punches (no pun intended) in his descriptions of abuse suffered at the hands of his father, a coldhearted, arrogant, sadistic SOB. The reader is drawn in to Bukowski's passionate determination to be the exact opposite of what proper society tries to mold its youth into. A powerful and heartbreaking read. Great work, Buk! R.I.P - you will be missed!"},{"Title":"Ham on Rye","review":"I have been returning to the work of Charles Bukowski (1920 -- 1994) after reading his novel \\"Factotum\\" and watching the movie based upon it. Bukowski's novel \\"Ham on Rye\\" (1982) is a coming-of age novel in that it tells the story of Bukowski's protagonist, Henry Chinaski, from his birth to his young manhood, ending with the attack on Pearl Harbor. (\\"Factotum\\", written in 1978 covers the next period of Chinaski's life, after he has been rejected for the draft and wanders from city to city in search of work.) Chinaski is based loosely on Bukowski's own life; but \\"Ham on Rye\\" and Bukowski's other novels are, after all, works of fiction and should be read as such.The scene of \\"Ham on Rye\\" is Los Angeles during the Great Depression, particularly the lower middle-class homes in which Chinaski grows up, as families struggle to survive and to escape from poverty. Bukowski is at his best in describing dingy homes, streets, schools, and desperate people.But \\"Ham on Rye\\" is a coming-of-age book told with irony and twists. It seemingly mocks the story of self-discovery and self-awakening common to these distinctively American books, but in the end I think it follows the pattern of a coming-of-age story in spite of itself. Most American coming-of-age books recount the life of a young person and end when that person comes to some crisis which he meets and, thus, attains a degree of understanding of himself which he carries through life. Bukowski's book tells the story of an unhappy childhood, as Chinaski is subjected to an overbearing father and frequent beatings. In addition, as an early adolescent, Chinaski develops a terrible case of acne which exacerbates his tendency to aloneness as well as his anger and rebeliousness. After graduating from high school, Chinaski loses a menial job, enrolls in a Junior College, and begins to drink heavily. He is well on the way to a life of alcoholism, fighting, wandering, and gambling that is detailed in chronologically later novels of Chinaski's life, such as \\"Factotum\\" or \\"Women\\".Yet for all its rawness and Chinaski's sense of failure and purposelessness, the book conveys a sense of promise. The book shows a young Chinaski forming the desire to be a writer, and beginning to work at his craft and respond to his experiences in a manner that, years later, would result in \\"Ham on Rye\\" and in Bukowski's other works of fiction and poetry. Some of the best moments in \\"Ham on Rye\\" show the adolescent Chinaski sitting alone in the Los Angeles Public Library and ultimately discovering authors, including D.H. Lawrence, Upton Sinclair, and Sinclair Lewis, who speak to him. As had many before him, Chinaski learns that projecting oneself into artistic creation offers a form of release from the difficulties of everyday life. Chinaski writes: \\"Words weren't dull, words were things that could make your mind hum. If you read them and let yourself feel the magic, you could live without pain, with hope, no matter what happened to you.\\" (p. 152) These words reflect the theme of \\"Ham on Rye\\" and, I think, of Bukowski's work as a whole.Similarly while suffering from his acute acne, Chinaski develops a character a WW I pilot named Baron Von Himmlen, and writes stories of his imagined adventures. Chinaski writes: \\"it made me feel good to write about the Baron. A man needed somebody. There wasn't anybody around so you had to make up somebody, make him up to be like a man should be\\". (p. 168)\\"Ham and Rye\\" is the story of how a young man found himself in adulthood leading a life of alcoholism, poverty, and loneliness, with no ambition and seemingly few prospects. The book is full of adolescent sexual frustration, dysfunctional families, rawness, vulgarity, and failure. It also includes some funny scenes. The story is told in a sharp, crude, no-nonsense style. But together with all the outward failure and the shocking scenes, we see a young Chinaski in the process of attaining his dream and gaining victory over himself after all. In spite of the dead-end vicissitudes of his life, Henry Chinaski perseveres and gradually brings his experiences alive and learns to make something worthwhile of his existence. He learns to reflect upon himself and his life and to describe them without cant or mercy. Henry Chinaski becomes a writer.Robin Friedman"},{"Title":"Ham on Rye","review":"In all of Bukowski's work there is a constant search for truth and freedom. With every breath that Bukowski takes he is locked in a fevered struggle with the forces around him that contiually attempt to make him walk the path of the common man. Bukowski sees this as nothing more than falling into a lock step towards certain death. Though he portrays himself as a repulsive type of human being, he is able to convince us that it is the world around him that is far more repulsive. In Ham On Rye, we are lead through the more meaningful chapters of Bukowski's childhood and early adulthood. There are very few pieces of literature that reaches readers with more honesty. As we read Bukowski we may at one moment feel relieved that we do not have to live his life, but in the next moment, are envious of the freedom in which he enjoys. Ham On Rye is one of those extremely rare pieces of fiction that allows a great work of art to simply flow into us. Reading Ham On Rye is simply effortless. It is almost as if it passes directly into us. This is, without a doubt, the most important American novel of the last quarter century. How can the readers of great literature wonder, in horrific despair, with the passing of Salinger, Miller and Bukowski, if a truly great writer will appear in our lifetimes.

If you read this book you have all the information you need to know to understand what made Charles Bukowski Charles Bukowski.

Sprinkled throughout is that old Bukowski humor, the flair for the surreal that's made Bukowski and his alter ego, Henry Chinaski, a hero to millions.I love his poems, but this bittersweet story of a young man coming to age is a classic. Highly recommended for Bukowski fans and any who are curious just what the hell the fuss is all about.Hank Lebowski"},{"Title":"Ham on Rye","review":"For years I sold Bukowski's poetry to sad-looking men and the occasional punk-looking (very young) woman. This was in the 1980s and early 1990s. I never took the stuff seriously. Poetry about hangovers and turds? Give me a break.But when I was introduced to Russell David Harper's manuscript of BALD -- his own ficitional memoir -- and Miha Mazzini's CARTIER PROJECT, I was forced to dig deeper into this phenomenon. (CARTIER is an eastern European Bukowski, and BALD is an intelligent memoir of hangovers.)HAM ON RYE was my first real Bukowski venture, and I devoured it. It's a sad and moving work. There's not a single metaphor in it; it's to-the-gut writing straight from the heart. I bought my copy dog-eared and coffee-stained in a sidewalk sale in San Francisco, and I'm not letting it go. However, I'm now afraid of digging deeper into Bukowski out of fear of being disappointed.

Anyone who's ever tried harder only to have their lot get worse can understand what's happening here. Don't be judgemental; Bukowski really is just a drunk with a typewriter, but he writes better than any high school composition teacher."},{"Title":"Ham on Rye","review":"Depending upon your taste in literature, Charles Bukowski was either a brilliant writer who has yet to receive to respect he truly deserves or nothing more than a drunk with a typewriter. Most of those who love Bukowski seem to have discovered him through his poetry, but Ham on Rye was my introduction to the author, and it remains my favorite work of his. In fact, I think Ham on Rye is probably the best coming-of-age story in American literature, far superior to Catcher in the Rye. Although Salinger's novel captures your attention when you're thirteen, it tends to suffer terribly when you reflect back on it as a more mature individual and recognize the narcissicism and insincerity at the heart of Holden Caulfield's attitude towards the world. Ham on Rye does not romanticize the innocence of children and depict adults as \\"phonies.\\" It is Bukowski's own thinly veiled account of his childhood and adolescence in Los Angeles between the two world wars, as told through the eyes of his alter ego, Henry Chinaski. Ham on Rye shares the same brutal humor and breezy prose style as Post Office and Women, but it is much more tightly focused than any of Bukowski's prior novels, which tended to be more episodic than anything else. For that reason I think it ultimately achieves a sort of lasting resonance with the reader that is lacking in much of Bukowski's other prose work, for all of the energy and spontaneity his writing always possessed. Ham on Rye is alternatively hilarious and horrifying, but it always remains truthful in a way that few coming-of-age novels are. Anyone new to Charles Bukowski should start with this."},{"Title":"Ham on Rye","review":"So asks (p. 245) Bukowski's alter ego, Henry Chinaski, as this gripping romansbildung draws to a conclusion. The rather mysteriously-titled Ham on Rye is undoubtedly Bukowski's finest and most obviously autobiographical novel. In it, he gives us a variably chilling, pathetic, hilarious, and defiant portrait of Chinaski's first 20 years, taking us right up to the attack on Pearl Harbor and Chinaski on his way to the Skid Row existence brutally chronicled in Factotum, the second volume in the Chinaski series.There's something heart-wrenching in Bukowski's description of the early years of his anti-hero Chinaski. A loser father who vents his self-hatred by sadistically beating his son; a spineless mother who can't stand up for either herself or her son--and whom Chinaski loves as little as he does his father; a sometimes comic assortment of misfit schoolmates who attach themselves to a reluctant Chinaski; boring, unrewarding, and mind-killing classes in primary, middle, and high schools; the wondrous discovery of books in the public library; the horrors of out-of-control acne, so like leprosy in both appearance and social consequences; the initial vagueries and eventually fires of pubescent longing; the (d)evolution of an abused and lonely boy into a hard-drinking, hot-tempered, bullying youth; and the beginning of a series of one dead-end job after another: these are the moments in Henry Chinaski's life captured in the novel. It's little wonder that by the story's midpoint, Chinaski is a young cynic, disgusted with the \\"proper\\" socially successful world to which his parents aspire. As he tells us (p. 174),'The problem was you had to keep choosing between one evil or another, and no matter what you chose, they sliced a little bit more off you, until there was nothing left. At the age of 25 most people were finished. A whole god-damned nation of a--holes driving automobiles, eating, having babies, doing everything in the worst way possible, like voting for the presidential candidate who reminded them most of themselves.'Bukowski's brilliant, disturbing novel is a chronicle of hope defeated and tenderness abused. By novel's end, Henry Chinaski has turned from a lovable, mistreated child into a genuinely unlikeable lost soul. To a certain extent, in later novels and in real life, both Chinaski and Bukowski will save themselves through art. But the climb up from the hellish youth and adolescence chronicled here will be long and difficult."},{"Title":"Ham on Rye","review":"This is Bukowski's masterpiece. It is vulgar, sad, funny, and compassionate. Not many writers can write a book like this. He does not exploit his terrible upbringing or less than \\"respectable\\" views on life (as he sometimes does in other books) but rather turns these facts into good literature. It's like punk rock on paper. The way he sees through the ridiculously fake nature of much of American life is truly inspirational. And his prose is, as usual, excellent."},{"Title":"Ham on Rye","review":"I've only read two Bukowski books, this and Post Office. After Post Office I was impressed, because Bukowski revealed some v. interesting, funny stories about his job (in ways that todays \\"Waiting\\" and other career novels/movies do) and the short chapters made it an easy read. However, after looking up on Amazon what I should read next - it was obvious - Ham on Rye.It's the book that Holden Caulfield may have written if he had written an autobiography at the age of 50. The way he writes is shooting from the hip - no crap, just as he sees it; even if it means he becomes humiliating in the process. It also makes you realise why Bukoswki was such a bittered and twisted man - and why he turned to drink.Ham on Rye chronicles \\"Bukoswki\\" or, his alter-ego Henry Chinaski, through his first memories, living with an abusive father, through school, where he is an outsider, and into the world of employment - where he see glimpses of Post Office and what is yet to come for Chinaski. It ends when he is in his early twenties.If you are interested in how artists find their passion, how human beings can be so cruel, how we are our childhoods - then you will love this book. If you have ever felt alone, and wondered if anyone in the world really cares - then this books for you. - Just a warning, Bukoswki isn't an optimist - the exact opposite, some times you may cringe with how depressing he is. But that is why he was such a inovative writer, just like Salinger before him; he didn't believe in hiding his readers from the big bad scary world - he introduced them to it."},{"Title":"Ham on Rye","review":"This was the first Bukowski book I have read and I loved absolutely every page.

The reader got to observe a young fellow from a sad background have to deal with his insecurities and fears. The fact that the mostly failed dealing with these problems made it seem all the more real. I don't know that there is a lesson to be learned from this story except to possibly give examples of what NOT to do in life and how exactly things can go off kilter if you just slump through existence.Father Saw Fairies"},{"Title":"Ham on Rye","review":"Bukowski bounces between drunken brawls, disgusting descriptions of acne and boils and familia dysfunction, altogether an enjoyable, but somewhat single-themed read. I prefer Vonnegut to Bukowski."},{"Title":"Ham on Rye","review":"Ham On Rye is pure Bukowski, and if you haven't ever read him you're missing a treat and a major part of American writing. I'm looking for other work by this author and went to Blockbuster to see if I could rent a copy of Bar Fly, (:a story based on some of his writing and staring Fay Dunnaway and Micky Roark) but they said Not Available. Oh well, I'll check Amazon to see if I can buy a copy. Pure Bukowski, and if you love him you'll love this, and if you don't love him that's your f*****g problem."},{"Title":"Ham on Rye","review":"Not what I expected. I read the whole book, but I didn't like it, it was not my style of reading. I would not recommend it."},{"Title":"Ham on Rye","review":"Dark, humorous, and hard to put down. An intimate look into a different yet compelling life with a basic honesty and vulnerability that gets your complete attention from the very first page. So well written that you forget the author is a writer!"},{"Title":"Ham on Rye","review":"I have read most of Bukowski's work and even saw him speak in Los Angeles many years ago. It's difficult for me to explain, but this book, as with many others of his, affect me in a visceral way that I carry with me for a long time afterward. His prose is simplistic and spare, but always very powerful. I'll return to these stories again and again over time."},{"Title":"Ham on Rye","review":"Wow, what a bleak time it must have been. But Bukowski's bitter prose keeps you reading through the violence and pain. A classic."},{"Title":"Ham on Rye","review":"Of the three Henry Chinaski faux-autobiographies I've read, \\"Ham on Rye\\" is, hands-down, the best.I don't even hesitate to call it a masterpiece. Of course, I'm not alone in that assessment.The fourth of Charles Bukowski's novels, this is actually the first in chronological order of Chinaski's lifespan, covering his decidedly rough upbringing from birth in Germany through dropping out of college.Chinaski grew up poor during the Depression, the son of an abusive failure of a father and a passive-aggressive mother. His life is street fighting, feeling left out, enduring his father's taunts and beatings, and acne vulgaris.Bukowski's ear for natural dialog is in strong evidence here; the narrative effectively serves as setup to a story told mostly in dialog, with occasional asides to set up how the boy is turned into the man.You definitely feel for Chinaski. You clearly understand how he becomes the antihero of Women, the third of Bukowski's novels (and one that most certainly does not leave a reader feeling compassionate for the protagonist). And you'll be shocked at how little difference there is, some 80 years later, between the life of a poor person then and now.I would certainly recommend reading Ham on Rye first, if you're going to pursue the Chinaski series. It establishes the character so completely, so perfectly, that even the relatively weak Post Office takes on new depth.Unfortunately, the Kindle edition has some problems with line breaks, which is especially distracting because most of this book is dialog, some of which is not directly attributed to a speaker. As a result, it can occasionally become difficult to figure out who is saying what."},{"Title":"Ham on Rye","review":"This book is one of Charles Bukowski's best works. He describes his childhood in detail, giving the reader insight about the trials and tribulations which would so dramatically shape this author's life and way of thinking. Buk is brutally honest about his thoughts and actions concerning his miserable existence as a boy growing up in Los Angeles. His writing captures the true feelings of a childhood outcast, making the reader assimilate himself in Charles' role and confront the demons of his own past. Truly one of Buk's most moving works."},{"Title":"Ham on Rye","review":"Bukowski writes what he knows. His use of short sentences and chapters leads the reader to not want to put it down. On top of that, the novel is true and honest. This, being what is termed his autobiography, paints an acute picture of his life, which is nothing short of a masterpiece."},{"Title":"Ham on Rye","review":"I have not read this book in English, I read it in Spanish but I think this is not a problem to take delight in its reading. It is a book capable of make you smile, cry, vomit, enjoy, think, ...It has all the humanity, reality and cruelty than you can expect. A comfortant teethache, an insufferable pleasure."},{"Title":"Ham on Rye","review":"This being my first Bukowski novel I had no idea what to expect. His poignant and often hysterical observations of adolescent life will keep me up thinking most of the night. A phenomenol read that has inspired to me to consume his other works. Henry's life was truly his own and conformity was not a luxury (or demon) that he would allow himself to experience. His life was harsh and on the edge, but it was 'his' life and as he grows he remains true to himself."},{"Title":"Ham on Rye","review":"The best sociological and psychological account of growing up in Hollywood fiction has ever produced. Charles Bukowski at his best.Ham On Rye by Charle Bukowski ISBN: 0876855583"},{"Title":"Ham on Rye","review":"Another brilliantly composed book by Charles Bukowski. Through excellent literary composition Bukowski shows a young man's struggle in a world full of poverty, pimples, and puberty. Henry Chinaski lives a life without love. His parents don't express their love for Henry and that lack of compassion leads him to find love in other places. Perhaps his confusion about what love really is leads his exploration of the female anatomy."},{"Title":"Ham on Rye","review":"Charles Bukowski appeals to the underside of us all. Love him or hate him, Ham on Rye has a piece of every American Family. From the torture of a neighborhood sissy to the beatings for leaving a few grass blades too high, Hank writes as it was. It's a wonder that after such a childhood, he held precious his daughter, his wife and his classical music. If you read nothing else this year, read Ham on Rye and Tales of Ordinary Madness. They'll change your views on EVERYTHING."},{"Title":"Ham on Rye","review":"It was probably one of the first books that made me laugh out loud in a long time. i was sitting in the lancaster library and people were looking at me, wondering what the hell i was reading. it reminded me of me and the way i saw the world when i was a kid. i guess it still looks the same. the world that is........ i could read it again and again. sometimes i try to find some of the places he talks about. it's a must read boooooookkkk!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Ham on Rye","review":"Ham On Rye explores the brutal, brooding and sexual life of low income post depression teenage existence. Charles Bukowski has developed a unique but Hemingway like writing style that is short, direct and insightful. All in all a great read."},{"Title":"Ham on Rye","review":"Ham on Rye really knocked me over. His writing is so powerful that a simple sentence, placed in the context he creates, gets you right in the center of your being. It cuts through your soul. It reaches down to your guts and twists them around."},{"Title":"Ham on Rye","review":"This book is pretty cool, its an account of Bukowkski's childhood and school years, and while there are interesting little experiences along the way, i didn't find it all that enthralling. You'll read it anyway, because you like Bukowksi, but if you are just starting out with him, try one of his other novels, like Post office or Women so you can get a full appreciation of it. I don't know i think this book is good after you've got an overall picture of who the writer is, rather than going in head first without knowing."},{"Title":"Ham on Rye","review":"Bukowski is what Nietzcshe referred to as a chandala... he was ugly, he was abused and mistreated, he was a little mean, he was a little perverse, and he suffered and struggled a lot.But he did it well and documented it well-- even the chandala need their documentarians, historians and champions...In any event, one thing people shouldn't confuse is that they probably would not want to be charles bukoswki unless it was their lot in life. As with many authors, Bukowski gets to take his shabby life and become a sympathetic protagonist.It is not a bad thing to examine the lower depths as long as one doesn't forget there are also human heights that are attainable for some people.--not for people like Bukowski -- but for other types.Bukowski's choice of cuisine says it all-- Bukowski is Ham on Rye, perhaps with a piece of stale swiss cheese and 3 day old potato salad on the side. Bukowski is every 10th guy at the wall mart -- who just also happened to be a writer with some insight into his life.-- perhaps it made it bearable for him. I hope so."},{"Title":"Ham on Rye","review":"This is my favorite novel by one of my favorite writers. Anyone who has ever read anything by Charles Bukowski knows that he pulls no punches, spilling his guts about his gin-soaked, skid-row life with brutal honesty, humor, and vulgar wit. In Ham on Rye, however, he reveals much more than his adult misadventures. He describes in devastating detail his childhood and adolescence, and after reading it, it is painfully obvious why he would feel the need to spend so much of his life numbing himself with alcohol. This novel truly reveals the pain, sensitivity, hurt and need hiding beneath the macho, crass exterior so many of his readers fell in love with. If he were still alive, I'd be tempted to track him down just to give him a hug."},{"Title":"Ham on Rye","review":"classic story of a boy's struggle growing up. vivid details for henry chinaski's hatred of the human spirit was in full effect. although ham on rye did not develop into the great story that it should have gone into, the book was interesting."},{"Title":"Ham on Rye","review":"&quot;Ham on rye&quot; was the first book by Bukowski I ever read, and after reading nothing more than merely the first page, my life had changed for ever. It sounds like a clich&eacute;, but in this case it describes reality. Bukowski's description of his unhappy childhood, mainly because of an unloving and bullying father, struck a chord of instant recognition with me. For the first time in my life (I was 18 at the time) I felt like I was not alone in the world. Thanks to this book (and everything else by Bukowski I have been able to get my hands on) I learnt to fight back. Thanks, Hank ! I owe you one !"},{"Title":"Ham on Rye","review":"Bukowski is king for those who don' t want to drive an SUV and go to Gordon Biersch on the weekends. Ham on Rye is a classic, one of BUK' s best."},{"Title":"Ham on Rye","review":"I had read Charles Bukowski's poetry first, and was extremely impressed by his abilities as a writer. This was the first of his novels that I read.While the writing style is good and the plot moves you along, one of the things that struck me most was how meaningless the story was. It does nothing to inspire or to teach. It is simply a portrait of a man who moves from one fist fight to the next - and is usually the one who starts the fight because he doesn't have enough depth of character to understand himself or other people. It's a portrait of a man who does NOT rise above his surroundings. He hates those surroundings, and doesn't embrace them so much as hold them up as a testament to his pain, like a child dramatically nursing a wound that some other child inflicted, long past the time it really hurts.The mood is stark and hopeless. The writing style is sharp and brief. There are no beautiful poetic interludes, or any evidence that he's a poet. It's merely the diary of a misanthrope, a misogynist and a hopeless drunk. Reading about his life is like watching someone say, &quot;So there,&quot; after driving his car into a utility pole.His female characters are two-dimensional - a problem many male writers have because they don't entirely realize that anyone is &quot;in there&quot;. He refers to them all as &quot;snatches&quot; and &quot;c**ts&quot;. He can't have them because he isn't attractive enough, and he longs after them, NOT because he likes them, but because he merely wants them.When I was done reading, I wondered what I was supposed to have taken away from it. Was it just a snapshot of a life and an attitude that makes the reader recoil? The point was NOT that he rose above anything despite desperate circumstances, because he let his circumstances win. Was his point that we can't ever understand his genius because of his unique and noble suffering? That we should understand that he could do nothing to prevent his wasted life?Sure he could. His abusive father and his weak (and poorly developed as a character) mother give him an unhappy home, but he doesn't describe anything that would have been insurmountable.I did not find a large soul behind the words in this book. I found a small one. I found a man who is petty, and spiteful and weak.Maybe THAT was his point: that someone who isn't much can still find a publisher and convince people to read books about his less-than-noble life and bad attitude."},{"Title":"Ham on Rye","review":"This is the funniest books I have ever read.

There was certainly a lot of character development, and the environment was constructed nicely. However, I kept waiting for some sort of redeeming qualities of the main character, Henry. He seems to be pretty unforgivable. I will say that I had the same feelings about Catcher in the Rye, and people really enjoy that book. I would suggest this book to those that enjoy the Nihilistic style, but I would not go back and read it again."},{"Title":"Ham on Rye","review":"This is the second book I read by Charles Bukowski, he is easily my favorite writer. His words are raw and genius without being pretentoius. An amazing read, you feel his childhood you will be in awe at his emergence of brilliance under horrid circumstances."},{"Title":"Ham on Rye","review":"Charles Bukowski's Ham on Rye details the early childhood of his fictional alter-ego Henry Chinaski through his teen years up until the attack on Pearl Harbor. A majority of the novel finds Chinaski growing up in the depression-laded lower-middle class part of Los Angeles, and details his discoveries of alcohol, women, authors, and writing. What is most likely an autobiographical fueled novel, Ham on Rye ends up becoming a startlingly poignant piece of literature, much like many of Bukowski's novels. The reader becomes impassioned with Chinaski's hard, young life as he discovers and withstands the futility of his own existence, gets into fights with his privilaged schoolmates, and develops an extremely painful case of acne that leaves him physically scarred. Though we don't always feel sorry for Chinaski as his actions make him labeled a \\"truly ugly person\\", there's no denying that Ham on Rye is a stunningly powerful and bleak portrait of the life Bukowski himself lived. Not as quintessential as Post Office of Factotum, but an essential piece of Bukowski's work nonetheless."},{"Title":"Ham on Rye","review":"This was my first book by Bukowski that I've read and found it worth my time.

He wrote back and his letter said this: &quot;Almost everything is a copy of something else that wasn't very good to begin with.&quot; Buk was not part of that Almost everything. He was a true original. I have taught English for over ten years and he is always on my reading list. Not one individual who decided to read him could stop reading him. Some writer might see a shiny pretty rock shimmering through a tranquil stream and they will sit and admire this rock and all the romantic literary possibilities of this rock.

In Henry Chinaski, Charles Bukowski has given American Literature what to my mind is one of the most devastatingly funny, sad, compassionate and wise portraits of adolescence we have. The book is packed with dozens of thumbnail vignettes that shine a tiny circle of light upon man's humanity--and lack thereof--to his fellow creatures. Think of Nurse Ackerman; the scene with the kitten trapped by the dog; the itchy ROTC uniform; Henry's beatings at the hands of his sadistic father; his friend with one arm...it goes on and on.

Salinger, Ernest Hemingway ,et cetera, but if we could only realize that he's allowing us to better our lives with his non-chalant way of living and not particularly prizing anything too much we'd be happier individuals! It's funny how this great mind lived in the same era I did, and yet I never took the chance to congratulate him for him? that is how much this writer means to me, and not just Ham On Rye, but every single one of his books.

This being the first novel by him i've read I was truly blown away.He dosn't just write about living in hell, but as being the lowest creature of hell, his rejection throughout childhood and his rejection of others are shown in the backdrop of this harsh environment.I love the chapter when he is alone in bed and there appears the devil, 'god had forsaken you'.His anger for the world as a child of depression was written beautifully, blunt and brutal. I love the way he begins as this innocent child, inquisitive and still rather happy. As he grows and as the pages get turned his language changes. He becomes angrier, although his quiet stoic demeanour is still prevalent.I actually connected with Henry on many levels.

Truman Capote was quoted as saying &quot;He just typewrites&quot;.For his part he liked Hemingway, Dostoyevsky, John Fante, Celine and a few others whom he felt were speaking the truth as they saw it and lived it.&quot;Everyone else just seemed to be playing tricks with words&quot;.No kidding.Bukowski valued honesty in writing above all, and it doesn't get more honest than &quot;Ham On Rye.&quot;I wish we could all &quot;just typewrite&quot; as well."},{"Title":"Ham on Rye","review":"Horror stories often involve the supernatural or the extra-ordinary. Often times the only mundane subjects in such stories are the principal characters, generally mortal men and women bereft in a world that once made perfect sense. But what if the world never made sense? What if the horror itself was mundane and the result of a sometimes banal landscape? Charles Bukowski's Ham on Rye is as semi-autobiographical as his other novels except this one deals primarily with his coming-of-age. The horror to which I spoke of earlier in the paragraph is growing up feeling like the world has something against you, which is the general sense one gets reading this novel.To read the rest of this review and others, please visit the King's Crier: Book Reviews blog."},{"Title":"Ham on Rye","review":"A thoroughly enjoyable rough-edged early American autobiography which blurs reality with fiction of what soon became a fashionable antihero -"},{"Title":"Ham on Rye","review":"Bukowski writes with a grittiness I love.

It outlines young age in a way seldom seen in film and literature. It is dark, true, and a vivid read, depicting youth in all its colors-- or the ones Chinaski, A.K. Bukowski, \\"Laureate of Skid Row\\", it seems breathed.It tells young Chinaski's tale from birth to about 20, whereupon, from battling daily a \\"sadistic\\" father, or just living an isolated or pensive, vulgar childhood, he hit the US roads, entering into a sort of Kerouaic, boozy and starved depression-era existence.The meaning, Ham on Rye, stands for-- that I got from, from [his] friend/editor John Martin, in the film biography on the author Born Into This,-- either the economy-style sandwich, or a ham or showboat-type fellow on rye whiskey. It sums up the tale in a small way.Overall great read, I read it 3 or 4 times; one of Bukowski's best novels."},{"Title":"Ham on Rye","review":"At times in his life, Charles Bukowski may have lived like the dissolute Hank Chinaski, his alcoholic protagonist inpost office: A Novel,Factotum,Women: A Novel, and HAM ON RYE. But in reading HoR, the quality that communicated most clearly to this reader was Buk's immense discipline. There's no self-indulgence, anywhere, in this book. There's no material, anywhere, that doesn't immediately contribute to the development of Hank's character. This discipline means that HoR has absolutely zero bloat. There's not a word that's wasted.HoR has 58 chapters, few longer than five pages. It begins with Hank's first memory and then gradually moves from his childhood, through his adolescence, and to his young manhood, with each chapter developing some new aspect of Hank's personality and life. The amazing thing is that the perceptions never get ahead of Hank's age, with the boyish Hank seeing boyish issues, the adolescent Hank showing how his upbringing and experiences affected his teenage outlook, and so on.This discipline makes HoR a remarkable reading experience. In one chapter, you can see Bukowski, say, add a little depth to the adolescent mentality of Hank. In the next, he adds a little breadth. In fact, Buk's control in each chapter is so tight that the chapters lend themselves perfectly to capsule summations. In my marginalia, for example, I find: Hank wins a medal but declines to pursue success (chapter 41); head games during and after baseball confirm the funny Hank's sense of failure (42); bold Hank humbled by his failed seduction of his only friend's mother (43). What am I saying? In every chapter, Buk shows something new about Hank. This is character that is always developing.Furthermore, Buk always stays within voice--not an easy task for an author taking a character through his formative years. Here's that voice at the start of Chapter 44, with Hank, a high school senior, considering his future.\\"I could see the road ahead of me. I was poor and I was going to stay poor. But I didn't particularly want money. I didn't know what I wanted. Yes, I did. I wanted someplace to hide out, someplace where one didn't have to do anything. The thought of being something didn't only appall me, it sickened me. ...To get married, to have children, to get trapped in the family structure. To go someplace to work every day and to return. It was impossible. ...was a man borne just to endure those things and then die? I would rather be a dishwasher, return alone to a tiny room, and drink myself to sleep.\\"One final point: In Chapter 52, Hank's father throws him out (he's enraged his son is writing short stories) and Hank is made to begin his adult life. In this and subsequent chapters, Hank's shenanigans morph from sad but hilarious contrariness to something darker, as the masterful Bukowski clarifies the underlying story he's been telling."},{"Title":"Ham on Rye","review":"Why some other books which we are forced to read in school are considered \\"far superior\\" to this one is above me. Bukowski's sort of autobiographical book \\"Ham on Rye\\" is nothing short of spectacular and holds up amazingly well over time. The reviewer who mentioned that some coming-of-age stories lose their appeal when the reader reaches adulthood couldn't have said it better in my opinion. \\"Ham on Rye\\" is just as effective when you're 17 as it does when you're 35.....This is an important literary book, regardless of what many literary critics....ahem, hacks....say. Bukowski has many fans and this book is one of the many reasons why. If you have not read \\"Ham on Rye\\" yet, I suggest you do so, and for a more modern coming-of-age story that reminded me of this, check out \\"Little New York Ba$tard.\\" Both books leave a lasting impression."},{"Title":"Ham on Rye","review":"growing up bio about hank's lifehonest stuffrealization that if you stick it out--anyone can make it to be something or somebody if you have a talent that you keep at"},{"Title":"Ham on Rye","review":"any time i feel really crappy, i crank out a bukowski book. his writing is subtle in its greatness and who can't help but laugh at that attitude. don't just read this one. read them all."},{"Title":"Ham on Rye","review":"A real revelation.

It is humourous, sad and at times uplifting, leaving you feeling empathy with the main character - himself. It is not a book you can put down easily because of this and I finished it feeling somewhat dissapointed because I wanted to read more."},{"Title":"Ham on Rye","review":"Bukowski's words leave an imprint not unlike the cystic acne which shaped his youth."},{"Title":"Ham on Rye","review":"Like most of his books this is loosely based on Bukowskis real life experiences. Ham on Rye covers Bukowskis childhood and early adulthood, ending around his second year of college. Even though he had a pretty terrible childhood if your to believe this book he finds a lot of humor in some very horrid situations. I found myself laughing out loud constantly while reading this, so this is not some depressing whine fest. Even though its sad at times its also a VERY funny book. One slightly annoying thing is, even though he paints himself as the ultimate loser in virtually every facet of life he does not seem to be able to resist the urge to paint himself as a tough guy straight out of a corny Hollywood movie. Never losing a fight in his teen years, crushing an ape like college football player during a pick up football game, and even telling the ridiculously unlikely story of beating up a professional boxer in a backyard boxing match, even though he had never trained, been an athlete or even had a pair of boxing gloves on in his life! But besides that slight annoyance this book is a truly great read."},{"Title":"Ham on Rye","review":"Bukowski is the writer that pimpley-faced middle-class boys turn to when they want to feel a bit bad, a bit tough. He isn't a very good writer but he is the dirty old alcoholic uncle you (perhaps) wished you had when you were younger. 'Ham on Rye' is certainly not literature but it might amuse you, particularly if you happen to fall into the 13-18 year old category or enjoy Benny Hill. Bukowski is unable to articulate a single genuine emotion without resorting to obscenity. I gave it three stars as it is the funniest door prop I own."},{"Title":"Ham on Rye","review":"I have to say I was a bit disappointed with Bukowski's autobiography. It lacked the humor and immediacy of his other writings. Not sure why he felt the need to lay out his life in such explicit terms, especially since his books generally tend to be autobiographical. He is at his best in books like Post Office, which have a James Thurber quality, albeit a bit raunchier in his take on life. Still, it is his poetry and short stories that stand out. Bukowski had a way of capturing those odd moments like no one else, even when delving into the seemier aspects of his life. But that ability was sorely lacking in this book."},{"Title":"Ham on Rye","review":"I give this book one star (only because my review could not go through without giving it at least one star). I found this book to be very unworthy of any stars, which is surprising, as I feel all books have a value - but not this one. I read about one-fourth of the book while on a trip and turned off my Kindle, as I found the \\"story\\" content to be anything but enjoyable."},{"Title":"Ham on Rye","review":"Ham on Rye was such a disappointment. It wasn't really even a thorough or complete comment on the era. I actually felt sick reading the abusive nature of the family depicted and I have a stonng literary stomach! Wouldn't recommend this as an investment in time."},{"Title":"Ham on Rye","review":"Charles Bukowski is a writer. He's not the type to go to writers clubs, instead he drank, as most good writers do - and a lot of bad ones I suppose. He's dead now, so it's ok to like him.I was making my way through the lot of his novels - his Novels because I hate poetry - \`Postal Service' is his best so far.What negated \`Ham on Rye' in my opinion was his EMPHASIS on just how hard his life was as a child growing up in a loveless household.Bukowski is a person who values the idea of individualism. It is hard for me to fully respect a man who calls himself an individual and a \`tough guy,' who so obviously blames his parents for his attitude towards the world.Directly after this book I read Celine's \`Death on the Installment Plan,' an author recommended by Bukowski as being one of his consistent favorites. I can understand that, because Celine's childhood was much the same; poor, loveless, solitary - in short a joy to read.Of course \`Ham on Rye' is well written, you get a very strong sense of voice and tone from all of his books. He's one of the few authors that are fun to read aloud to yourself because there's a definite beat and rhythm to his narrative process.Not a bad book, on the grand scheme, but it showed me a side of this man who lived a \`hard' life, who takes the easy way out and blames his childhood for being the character that he is."},{"Title":"Ham on Rye","review":"this was my first charles bukowski book and it is unlikely i will go back for seconds. the writing is unimaginative and there is no character developement whatsoever. the main character, henry chinaski, has no redeeming qualities. his childhood is not that much different from most except for the severity of his acne problem. his response to that childhood is chronic violence and alchoholism. he literally becomes what he detests and is even worse. if this is supposed to be a coming of age novel like catcher in the rye, it falls miserably short. holden caulfield is searching for something and has positive intentions. chinaski has none of this...."},{"Title":"Ham on Rye","review":"I read it all, hoping to find a paragraph or two worth reading. No luck. The dialogue, and the attitudes of the characters, certainly were not representative of the era.( BTW I was reared during the Depression and responded to the call for Service).A bio? I suggest there is much fiction here , especially in the college episodes and the dialogue. On second thought, an overwhelming amount of fiction, written for shock value, in which it failed.In fairness, I have not read the author\`s other works. I may, but I am not in a great hurry to do so.They may be worthwhile."},{"Title":"Ham on Rye","review":"I love reading autobiographical type books.............I have seen review after review giving this book 5 stars and statements about how absolutely great this book is. Maybe I just didn't get it but this was one of the most boring books I have ever attempted to read (I stopped reading about half way through the book). I don't get all the hoopla around this book. I was not impressed at all..........If it weren't for the profanity I would have thought this book was written for elementary school students. I'm sorry to all of the fans, but this was AWFUL."},{"Title":"Ham on Rye","review":"This is the worst book I've ever read. There's no moral, theme or lesson behind it. You don't learn anything. It's not interesting. There are a thousand different characters and it's nearly impossible to keep track of which one is which because every character is equally boring, uninteresting and one-dimensional. Also, Bukowski was obviously a sick, perverted, twisted person. He refers to one guy as a \\"fetus-eater,\\" and he goes into detail explaining things about bowel movements and masturbation (and in one case, one of his friends does a sexual favor for a dog). The story takes place from the early 1920's through 1941, and before I read it, I thought it might give an interesting perspective on what it was like to live at that time, with the depression and then pearl harbor going on, but no. It was boring as hell. Bukowski's life is incredibly boring and uneventful, and I really don't understand why he chose to give the world the misfortune of this book. It's terrible. Nothing happens. It ends so abruptly. I hate Bukowski."},{"Title":"Ham on Rye","review":"I'd been suffering from 'Reader's Block' when I picked up this offering from Charles 'Hank' Bukowski.It didn't take more than a few minutes and a couple of pages to realise I was hooked.To date, my main brushes with Hank have been through short stories and poetry, both of which I've loved. Why I didn't immediately pick up his longer prose, I have no idea. I have no excuses any more and there are more books in the post.Henry Chinaski is the name of the German American boy at the centre of this book. He's a solitary boy. An outsider. For lots of reasons. One of them being that he's human and growing up in a time of depression and alienation.Mr and Mrs Chinaski are tough cookies. They're intending to make their mark in a kind of middle-class way. They're proud. Hopeful. God-fearing.Early on, Henry introduces other relatives. There's his alcoholic uncle and grandad. Another uncle is all washed up and dying already, even though he's in his early twenties. There's his aunt and his cousins, penniless and without a man in the house since the man raped a young girl and went on the run. It's not a healthy family.Each of the characters is introduced in a short chapter. It's a collection of vignettes early doors, written sparsely and without pretence. The pieces have the weight and craft of great short stories, each closing with a punch that had me feeling the encounter. Seeing a bigger picture. Admiring the survivors of those tough times.From family, he moves on to describe incidents with friends, sport, acne, alcohol, school, books, violence and girls. They're wonderfully drawn pictures. Seriously powerful.Right the way through, a spade's a spade. Which makes me wonder why it's so bloody poetic. Perhaps it's something to do with the juxtapositions of one idea onto another, the layers of meaning and less-than-obvious comparisons.Take this one chapter. Chinaski's in English class. His teacher, a beautiful thing, sits out front with her dress rising. In the back row, one of his classmates is jerking himself off. The teacher tells the class about the European tradition of literature and talks about the new Americans who are going to blow them off the page. Hank seems to be screaming out that what has come before is literary masturbation, what is about to arrive is the new breed. And the new breed is Chinaski and the new breed is Bukowski and A-men to that.What Bukowski seems to be doing is creating the legend of himself. Taking his life and embellishing wherever he can or needs to. Maybe sometimes this goes too far, but at those points I found it useful to remind myself that it's a work of fiction and not biography. Sure, he uses poetic licence, but he is entirely justified in that.It would have been great to hear Hemingway and Bukowski comparing fishing stories, by the way. 'Mine was this big,' Hem might suggest while holding his arms as wide as he could. 'That was nothing. Mine was bigger than this,' Hank might reply, dropping his trousers and admiring himself.The story is fascinating. Brilliantly told. Refreshing and honest and dishonest and very well worth while picking up.Read and weep."},{"Title":"Ham on Rye","review":"Quick, raw, sharp and edgy- those are the words I would use to sum up Bukowski's novel about a young man coming of age. Forced to grow up fast, we see the narrator's life through his own cynical point of view of the world. As I read this, I found myself connecting with the character because of his isolation and his strength. The author hits nerves and isn't afraid to open his readers' eyes to a world where kids can't be kids....they have to grow up fast, similar to teens today. A good choice for male readers."},{"Title":"Ham on Rye","review":"It is an interesting book in the sense that I didn't really like any of the characters, especially the narrator, but I couldn't put the book down.

I bought Ham on Rye and Post Office in one hit thinking they were chronologically ordered but I was wrong. Ham on Rye is the early life of Henry Chinaski and it was thrilling to discover how our enigmatic hero was shaped into the womanising legend I had read about in Women. What sort of demented upbringing led him to writing, womanising and more importantly alcoholism? As usual Bukowski writes in a style that rolls off the tongue and its a good relaxing read. Post Office was next but I found it dull compared to Ham on rye. Still a pleasure to read but i'm off to read Factotum - apparently the post-adolescent successor to Ham on Rye. 5 bloody stars."},{"Title":"Ham on Rye","review":"If you're a Bukowski fan, you won't be disappointed.This focuses mostly on his childhood and has one of the most poignant final chapters ever written."},{"Title":"Ham on Rye","review":"i couldnt put the book down. you see the makings of a fine outcast. the prose is simple and tight. loved it."},{"Title":"Ham on Rye","review":"What I liked about this novel is it's representation of cruel juvenile realism. For children this kind of cruelty seems real. Adults hate you. Your parents hate you. Your peers hate you. You are ugly and stupid. Women don't want you unless you can give them a nice illusion of the future. All these realities are things we all experienced. In childhood you are controlled by your fears. Then your fears become your reality. There is so much drama growing up. Then there is the horrible boredom when you reach adulthood. These trapped feelings leave a sour taste in your mouth. The economy beats you up. The stupid wars beat you up. Your job beats you up. Your family and friends beat you up. OMG! That's what I got from this novel. That feeling of OMG like I had as a kid. Life really is a vile thing when you strip out the hope. But individuals have more control over their happiness than they realize. It seems to take a whole lifetime to figure that out."},{"Title":"Ham on Rye","review":"Nothing like diving into a Bukowski novel you have yet to read. Great book.

While reading this, I could almost smell the liquor on his breath. This particular novel and writer came highly recommended to me, and I recall reading most of this at a high school football game one Friday night last September (Football bores me). While everyone was screaming and yelling for the home team to win, I was sitting there transfixed by Bukowski's compelling narrative of his rotten childhood, and laughing hysterically at times. Suffice it to say, reading Bukowski is like eating supper in a public restroom. Definitely not for everyone."},{"Title":"Ham on Rye","review":"Yeah, I probably understood the idea of the \\"noble drunk\\" before I read this. I may have even been one; in a manner of speaking. I was definitely drunk. Buckowski likes to read and drink and tell what's on his mind. These qualities make him a clear-cut role model for the aspiring drunken hipster, as he sets a template for behavior that is amoral, yet ethical. He doesn't stand for phony-baloney golden rulism, just honesty and willfullness. In a way, he can be read as a sort of Buddhist in the way he recognizes his own id as well as the ids of others. This book is simply one of the best chapters in what is really one gigantic work that spanned his lifetime."},{"Title":"Ham on Rye","review":"Pick this book up and you will not be able to put it down. The story of a boy's upbringing held hostage by the hard hands and angry mouth of his father. Bukowski was the ultimate outsider, emotionally and physcially separated from world, a black-eyed prey who learns to fight back with scrapped knuckles and sharp words, all captured here for your reading enjoyment and emotional enlightment. Reading this book is a one-two punch to the head, wonderfully enchanting prose that makes you appreciate how much you have given as compared to the society's discards and a lesson on how to breath words into living sentences. His words flow like melted bitter-sweet chocolate. Bukowski is authentic and gifted -- put his books next to Hemingway on your bookshelves. (check out his poetry.)"},{"Title":"Ham on Rye","review":"What can I say, this book is brilliant. I would recommend this as a starting point for anyone getting into Bukowski. I read Betting On The Muse first, and I couldn't quite appreciate his poetry until after I'd read this. Hank Chinaski is the embodiment of everyman's underbelly. Sometimes raunchy and inappropriate, other times excruciating and vulnerable, but always completely honest. This one should be required reading for all of mankind."},{"Title":"Ham on Rye","review":"I guess it all stands to this with Bukowski, can you find humor associated with drinking? And do you mind something funny mixed with something tragic? If you can, then this author will please you.He never battled with drinking, he loved it. He wrote some beautiful poetry and entertaining autobiographical novels. The novels based on his life go from birth to end as follows, HAM ON RYE, FACTOTUM, POST OFFICE, WOMEN, HOLLYWOOD. This book is from his birth until the age around 21.I would not recommend this book to my mother, because she finds alcoholism a disease and very tragic. I also do sometimes find it tragic, but at times find it funny to follow the exploites of a gifted drunken bum. I have read most of his books many times."},{"Title":"Ham on Rye","review":"bukowski is largely unknown by the collins-grisham-sheldon reading mainstream. too bad for them.bukowski's alienation and frustration with this life is his bridge to the reader. these are universal feelings. chinaski is, at first glance, a pathetic man. cruel to women, incredibly crude in his speech, not lucid enough to maintain real friendship, the hardest drinker you've ever met. but i like him.bukowski writes 'spare'. doesn't use too many words to press his point. he doesn't need them. there are laughs on nearly every page. his smallest details point out how funny and screwy and absurd the world is. bukowski is one of the few authors who can make me stop reading because i'm laughing so hard.'the most beautiful girl in town' (short stories) and 'women' are also recommended."},{"Title":"Ham on Rye","review":"Bukowski was the best and worst all at the same time. At his worst he was a caricature of himself...a cruel, disgusting drunk...a wasted talent. His writing a useless desensitized trail of semantics. However, at his best, Charles Bukowski wrote with the urgency, honesty and clarity no other artist has achieved in the entire ludicrous history of literature.Ham and Rye is an example of the latter...a thinly disguised auto-biography, it is the prose of a writer at the peak of his craft. Each sentence resounding with a voice and character that readers immediately recognize as Bukowski. It is sad and humorous at the same time and it is unimaginably good. Without a doubt, the best novel ever written by a man who you will find to be one of the most engaging authors of all time."},{"Title":"Ham on Rye","review":"Bukowski is the master. He defies categorization. In a book that describes so much ugliness, Bukowski proves that the only beauty in life is truth. However, I am forced to split hairs and say that POST OFFICE is my favorite thus far."},{"Title":"Ham on Rye","review":"It's strange to read Bukowski as a woman. You feel as if you should throw his books across the room in disgust, but instead find yourself chuckling and even empathizing. Then you want more.Very few authors are capable of laying down a good clean sentence like Bukowski could. Once you take guilty pleasure in his writing, it's difficult to read most other authors. They seem to use too many words. Ham On Rye will give jaded readers new hope."},{"Title":"Ham on Rye","review":"I plow through Bukowski like I do Cap'n'Crunch. The man inspires drunken poetry on hot summer nights- while talking about women, booze, masturbation, classical music, &amp; horse racing. This book is my new favorite. Why? Because while facinating the reader with lurid tales of a painful and depressing childhood, Bukowski makes us laugh, cry, and feel sorry for that kid we made fun of in 7th grade. We relive our adolecence through the eyes of an outcast in a way that no other writer could prepare us for. I only wish I could tell the man thank you for taking the time to put his thoughts onto paper. (But he's not the type who would have received it well.)"},{"Title":"Ham on Rye","review":"The reviewer Robin Friedman a couple of reviews back did an excellent job in describing this book without giving away too many important details. There is no use telling you all what the story is about start to finish. That's what reading the novel is all about. Anyway, if you like Bukowski you've already read this and more than likely adore this novel. Ergo, this review is suited more for those who have never read a Bukowski novel (a couple of poems don't count). If you read this you need to be the type of person who doesn't take yourself and the world too seriously. Otherwise, odds are you will be disgusted with Bukowski as a whole and dislike all of his novels. Because unlike anyone I have ever read Bukowski is what he writes! And what he writes about isn't pretty, it isn't politically correct, it isn't nice, it isn't tasteful or tactful, it isn't informative, it doesn't have meaning, etc... do I need to say more? What it is, is real and gritty and funny and raw and honest and brave. This guy can write like nobody's business and as much as you need to hate and pity him you just can't help but like and admire him at the same time. The fact that Bukowski is so much more popular in Europe than he is in his home country would make for great coffee house debate (not that I ever have or as fun as it sounds ever will). Perhaps his poking fun at the American way of life, that it wasn't all Norman Rockwell, Howdy Doody, Ozzie & Harriet bull.... like it tried to portray itself back then (many may argue that it still does today) in the early days of TV, radio, newspapers, etc... Perhaps people in Europe see something romantic about an iconoclastic writer that doesn't have the same value system as the average Capitalist(myself included). The good, old red blooded American automaton marching off dutifully to work everyday. Perhaps in Europe they aren't as uptight with sex or politically correctness as the vapid Religious Right and the pretentious libs in this country are. I don't really know, I just know that I really like this guy warts and all. Forgive me father, for I have sinned."},{"Title":"Ham on Rye","review":"I have started with Bukowski books 3 months ago, and Ham on Rye and Notesof a dirty old man is the best I have ever read from him. Hank is unsortable author and in Czech Rebublic he became to grow favorite."},{"Title":"Ham on Rye","review":"This was the first Bukowski book I've ever read, and I don't plan for it to be my last. I picked up this title because I'd read that, at Christmas, Bukowski's books are among the most stolen from NY bookstores. I love to read books that end up banned or those that end up stolen, usually because they're astounding pieces of work, and this book was no exception. Henry utterly hates life (especially his father), and it's easy to see why. Through Henry's eyes, the reader sees and feels some terrible things -- Henry's beatings, the treatments for his skin, the repulsive traits of fellow characters. The book will leave you drained and angry because the images Bukowksi gives you are very vivid, some bordering on disgusting. It wasn't until after I read the book that I learned it's a thinly disguised bio. No wonder Bukowski's tone is bitter and fierce; if you read this, you'll see why. I couldn't help altering my feelings for Henry at almost every chapter. You get one side of Henry in one chapter, and in the next, you'd swear it was a whole new character. Henry isn't a very complex character, but his observations are. One of the saddest parts of the book comes when Henry's skin treatments end; the nurse who performs his therapy seems to be the only person in the entire book that cares about him, albeit in a medical capacity. Bukowski shows us a seamy side of life with rich descriptions and chracters that no fiction writer could create. Can't wait to try more of his books!"},{"Title":"Ham on Rye","review":"This being the first book I ever read of Bukowski's, was the one that made me fall in love with him and his writing. It took me on a literary journey into a beautiful, sad, intelligent landscape that drove me to set higher standards for other writers. This story felt very real, I hated him and loved him and felt sorry for him...the imagery was so perfect I was there all the time. I felt everything and could empathize and understand the core of his actions and thoughts. The first paragraph hooked me and kept me intrigued until the last page and left me wanting more. I have now been on the hunt for all his books,not to sure I am really into the poetry, but still would love to own them for fear I may miss something incredible if I don't."},{"Title":"Ham on Rye","review":"Having read nearly every word the man wrote (in his published career), I would agree wholly with the other reviewers who suggest that this is his best novel.Some describe Bukowski as being unnecessarily crude. Personally, I feel that his &quot;crudeness&quot; is merely the most efficient vehicle of expression. In this respect, and many others, I consider Bukowski to be the most successful American author in history.I have often felt insulted by his writing, but it has never insulted my intelligence with needless passive voice metaphors."},{"Title":"Ham on Rye","review":"Every woman should read this book but I suspect few will. Written in the form of an autobiography, which follows the life of Henry (or Hank) who grows up in a poverty stricken home, is an outsider, dreamer, and who develops a truly horrifying case of acne/boils which makes him an object of disgust as well, it is characterised by two outstanding qualities: honesty and clarity. Mr Bukowski eschews the adjective and the adverb and like another great writer of clear English, George Orwell, it is a pleasure to read. As a former boy I can relate to many experiences that young Henry has at school, with gangs, with girls, with teachers, with parents, that seem to be of universal application. The revelation he experiences when he is praised for an &quot;essay&quot; he writes at school on witnessing President Roosevelt visiting, when the essay is a complete fabrication, is revelatory for the reader too. There are other such moments in this great read. One is when students in Henry's class share a joke with their teacher, and they laugh, and laugh, together; another is the sexual games another teacher plays with them and the boys feel they are truly in love with her, and she with them. There is much HUMANITY in this book. Compassion, sadness and the understanding of what it is to be human in the 20th century in America, is in this book."},{"Title":"Ham on Rye","review":"Wonderful and essential book for any Bukowski fan.

After this book, I was hooked on his books. This is the kind of book that once you start reading, you won't be able to put it down. His writing style is so clear and simple, but not in a retarded way. This is so much better than all those Shakespeare things you have to read in school. It's very blunt and uncensored and the events that occur in the book are so hilarious and true to life.The book starts out when the main character (Henry Chinaski) is a kid and continues on into adulthood. His life is so hard and it is easy to identify with him. It's hard to really summarize the plot of this book. It's about Henry Chinaski's day-to-day life and the struggles he faces, including terrible acne, alienation, and depression. You won't be disappointed by this book. And if you don't like it, it's probably because you are trying to be too sophisticated, as this book would not be considered \\"proper\\" or be considered as good reading material for young children. \\"Ham on Rye\\" is a great book whether you admit it or not."},{"Title":"Ham on Rye","review":"At one point in this book, the main character has started a reading mission by going to the library, picking out books (mainly the \\"classics\\") and reading them frantically. Later on he comments on these \\"classics\\": \\".....they are all a massive pretentious pomp about not much\\". Now, that is a heavy, ultraheavy statement to make when it comes to \\"classics\\". While i have the same opinion i also think that if you're going to deliver a hardcore critique like that you better be able to back it up. Bukowski does so in an overwhleming way not only in this (autobiographical) novel but basically in all his books.The thing about Bukowski is that his writting is so direct, so mercilessly direct in fact, that you feel more like watching a film rather than reading a book.Take the story in \\"Ham on rye\\" for example: this story for all intends and purposes is not an extraordinary story. By no means. Stories about poverty or growing up in financially dire times (like the 30s in America) can be found aplenty. Stories about abusive or clueless parents (or both) also abound in literature. Stories about discovering sexuality during teenagehood just as well. But in the end, no matter what the story, extraordinary or not, what matters is who tells it and how.Someone can start telling you the most incredible story and still fail to grab you with it. Bukowski could be talking for 4 pages about some \\"chick\\" he saw working as a clerk somewhere and the fantasies he has about her and you'll be totally engulfed in reading it. Or, he could be describing something as mundane as a football game and the bravado involvd in it and you'll feel like being right there standing next to a linebacker and due in for a hard hit.All this is intimidating and charismatic enough but when Bukowski spices it all up with his cynical and ruthless humour the sum is almost always a masterpiece.I've read quite some of his novels and regardless of the theme what always gets me is the power of his narrative. This guy can be compared to an elite few in that sector and those few would have very little to do with \\"classics\\" but more with writers who came straight from the underground of their time and who have the gift of being able to take in every important detail of what they are observing.\\"Ham on rye\\" is basically Bukowski growing up in the 30s while a crisis is at its peak, with a father who has made it a mission to beat him up systematically so he can become \\"worthy\\", a mother who's as clueless as your nearest wall, and a case of horrible acne (the \\"worst on the planet\\" he says) which condemns him to outsiderdom . But acne or no acne, Bukowski was an outsider anyway. He never \\"fit-in\\" exactly because he was beyond most of the people around him. He saw things they never saw and grasped things they never even suspected they were there for the grasping.It's also about a young Bukoswki discovering the opposite sex, and the drive that basically makes this planet go round, and it's simoultaneously a young Bukoski forming his first sociological conclusions which -predictably- are quite detached from the mainstream.If you've never read this author start here. It might be widely under discussion what his best novel is, but thsi one is one that easily combines all his talents in a hilarious, often explosive and then again bitter package. Those who claim that once you read \\"Ham on Rye\\" you'll want to read all his novels are absolutely dead on."},{"Title":"Ham on Rye","review":"Defending Charles Bukowski's rebellion against societal norms is a lost cause, and his abuse of alcohol, women, himself, and humanity in general have often gotten him slagged as a misogynistic wino with no karma left to burn. As a fictional memoir that covers the overlapping lives of Bukowski and anti-protagonist Hank Chinaski, Ham On Rye serves as a tome of both explanation and unorganized insurrection towards his detractors and, oddly enough, his own followers.Most likely a play on Salinger's Catcher in the Rye, Bukowski's Chinaski goes through the same qualms as Salinger's Caulfield: hostility through sexuality (and vice-versa), a slap in the face of a torn nation (Bukowski and The Great Depression, Salinger and WWII), and alienation as a way of life. However, Salinger's (perhaps lack of) emphasis on personal growth is turned into Bukowski's emphasis on ignoring the reasons he/Chinaski grew up tough, mean, and odd. This could have easily ended up a stale story of a broken home and a broken country paralleling and splitting the life of what would become a broken boy, but Bukowski focuses on the scenes and people he was surrounded with. Were he real, Chinaski himself would probably ponder the effects of the distress around him, but in the end he would have concluded that he didn't care, and cracked another beer.Plus, Chinaski's just a bigger bada** than Caulfield. Amidst the sad and awkward climb into adulthood, Chinaski encountered numerous situations where he bit down hard and threw a punch, whether or not he was going to win. He has rhino balls and elephant skin.The book may be a quick read, but it's anything but a light read. Bukowski manages to be smart without being academic, offensive without being alienating, and able to write in a way that somehow lacks both the fluff and the stilted language/situations of minimalistic prose. His style has always taken a backseat to his tales, giving (good) directions, but never a reason to pick up a book and turn the pages. However, with Ham On Rye Bukowski is able to turn a well-lived life into a well-written story. Between this and his collections of letters, the world could someday understand Bukowski and world as he saw it, laughing from the barstool near the corned, feeling so badly the p***ing and s****ing glory of humanity."},{"Title":"Ham on Rye","review":"My buddy said &quot;here, read this book&quot; so I did. I loved it ,I read the whole book in one day. This was the first book in a long time that actualy made me laugh out loud.I've read a lot of his other books since and felt the same way. Charles was a total lush, and it all started in this book, when he told of his first glass of wine.Be careful, reading his books makes you wanna drink(a lot more if you already do)a lot. Charles bukowski was heavily influenced by Celine,and if you have ever read DEATH ON THE INSTALLMENT PLAN by Celine, you will notice some huge similarities in the way they were constructed,the short and abrupt sentencing, and tastful vulgarity and shameless self criticism. Read this book, then read WOMEN, then watch the movie BARFLY,(which is about Bukowski's life) then read HOLLYWOOD(which is about the making of the movie). Then read everything else. Bye, I,ll be home soon"},{"Title":"Ham on Rye","review":"It's been a cold, rainy week in Minneapolis and I've just finished Ham on Rye, which I've torn through. I do not know what to make of this book. It's quite disturbing, in terms of the frankness, and finishing it actually made me cry...especially the ending, which of course I will not give away. The main character, henry Chinaski is more disdainful than Holden Caulfield. He is so hard, yet I know he has a sensitive soul. Anyways, as I patronized the local record store I noticed one of the local bands in Minneapolis is called Chinaski and that spooked me. So, in all, I recommend this book, you will become attached to Henry, I promise"},{"Title":"Ham on Rye","review":"Long time Bukowski fans cringe at the site of so many posers jumping on his bandwagon. These bohemian wanna-be's who see themselves as rebels yet are usually simply \`alternatively conforming' think Buk is \`their man' because he is often \`vulgar' and \`partied.' This is a typically idiotic interpretation of Buk. The truth is Buk would detest these posers just as he despised the posing conformist rebellion of the beats. It is true that Buk was sometimes uselessly vulgar, yet often his vulgar scenes were meant to shock the reader into acceptance of a greater point or were symbolic of something else. Notice in Ham on Rye the scene where the \`slow' student masturbates while the English teacher lectures on the creation of a new American style of writing. Obviously this is symbolic of Buk himself, who was making the point that the new American style of writing would not come from the beautiful faces and flowery language of schoolmarms but from the defeated, the crippled, the misfits of society. The \`slow' child is Buk and all misfits, who creates the new language (notice it makes a lot of noise just as these new writers did). As to partying, while it is true that Buk loved alcohol like no other writer, Buk preferred to drink alone, to escape existence which he saw as obscene and absurd. A close reading of his work showed how much he hated parties, going to them simply for the access to liquor they provided. And Buk was also a hard worker who struggled with poems for weeks and read virtually all the classics. He was no lightweight, so lightweights, stop claiming him!Ham on Rye is the place to start for any Buk fan. He is at his best here, showing why he chose to \`drop out' of the rat race altogether. There are many beautifully written scenes of great tragedy, humor, and drama as well as well thought out symbolism (I love the scene where a college English teacher tries to seduce Chinaski saying he can have whatever he wants if he will stay in school: the teacher represents modern fiction of the time, superficially pretty but demanding a falsity that Buk can't accept, he turns her down to forge his own artistic tradition). The next logical choice if you like this book is Buk's Post Office or some of John Fante's work (especially Ask the Dust or Dreams from Bunker Hill). Buy this book, you will learn something."},{"Title":"Ham on Rye","review":"Even though 'Ham on Rye' is listed as a novel it is also well understood to be a thinly disguised autobiography of the author's early life (until his early 20s). This worried me since I don't like autobiographical material because its singular focus on the author. Having said all this, 'Ham on Rye' is such a detailed horror story that, like looking at an auto accident, you can't help but be drawn in.Our main character is raised during the depression by an absolutely horrific father and doormat of a mother. The guy is also plagued with a complexion from hell, and seems to be in a bad need of a hug (yet no one wants to get near him). Besides he completely fights off anything that resembles affection or friendship. Not surprisingly this dysfunctional young man grows into a dysfunctional adult.What makes this book distinctive is the author's rather decent writing skills and his complete lack of self-pity. The story is heartbreaking but the main character carries on, like a stray mongrel wandering the streets. Depressing, terribly depressing. But it is a story that should be read, especially by fathers who never spare the rod lest he spoil the child.Bottom line: sometimes depressing books should be considered as mandatory reading material. This is one of them."},{"Title":"Ham on Rye","review":"First I wanted to know why he called it &quot;Ham on Rye&quot;.I mean, I know that ham on rye is a sandwich but I figured that Henry Chinaski liked a drink and Henry Chinaski is Bukowski's &quot;literary alter-ego&quot; - which means Chinaski is Bukowski - and Bukowski was an alcoholic and alcoholics aren't that crazy about food (because, hey, why eat when you can drink?) so maybe it didn't mean sandwich.I looked up the two words in a dictionary. Aside from the filling for a sandwich, ham is also the back of a pig. Rye can mean gentleman (from the Romany word &quot;rai&quot;), or king (from the Sanskrit &quot;rajan&quot;). I felt clever then. &quot;Ham on Rye&quot;? King Pig. Gentleman Pig. That sort of makes sense. I like that. I didn't stop there, though. Rye is also a kind of grass used in the manufacture of whisky. Here we go, I thought. Whisky. That's more like it. Ham, too. Like Radio Ham. An actor who relies on stock phrases and gestures. An actor. Somebody who acts. A phoney. A phoney on whisky. That didn't make sense so much. Not the phoney part at any rate.Thinking about phoney did the trick, though. Phoney = Holden Caulfield = &quot;Catcher in the Rye.&quot;&quot;Ham on Rye&quot; and &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot;. Both of them adolescent rites of passage. Sort of.Got me thinking. It's been at least ten years since I read &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot;, so forgive me, but - if I remember correctly - catcher in the rye was Holden Caulfield's ideal job. The rye field on the edge of a cliff. Children playing, running through the rye. Holden there, at the edge of the rye and the cliff, saving the children (stopping them fall over the edge into experience or whatever it is down there).If it was Chinaski in that field, those kids'd fall. He'd be boozing or reading. Those kids could fall off a cliff for all he cares. All those kids would probably hate him anyway. They'd all be the sort of kids who called him names when he was small. Chinaski would sit on the edge of the rye field, daydreaming about his teacher's skirt.&quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot; is a book you read (and love? yeah, maybe) when you're sixteen, when you still believe in things, when chances are laid out like a hand of cards. You read &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot; and you take it seriously. &quot;Ham on Rye&quot; is a book you read when you know a little more about life. You know life can be hard. Not all the time. Don't get me wrong. Life can be plenty great too. Just sometimes. Life can be hard. You don't always get what you want and it isn't always down to chance or fate or anything else. Sometimes life is tough through no fault of your own. Life can be beautiful (beautiful like a teachers's raised skirt? yeah, maybe), and life can be ugly (because, hey, it's always other people get the breaks, am I right or am I right?).&quot;Ham on Rye&quot; knows it. Bukowski knows it. You know it. I know it. You find joy where you can. You find joy here."},{"Title":"Ham on Rye","review":"I am a poetry man (and a poet), and as such think that Bukowski is the best American poet ever.

His writing style is so direct and honest, so sober (ironically!) that it might SEEM simple to write like he does, but if that's that case, then why have I read so few books as good as this one? I saw another reviewer claim that this book has a lot of unrealistic bragging, specifically about a boxing incident. That reviewer is the one who exaggerated things, Bukowksi seems to stick up for himself when needed, but he also admits getting his butt kicked when it happens. Most of the time Bukowski is the loser, and he talks about feeling like an outcast.I can barely wait to read all of Bukowksi's other novels. What a great book.

Factotum picks up where Ham on Rye leaves off. Which follows into Post office and then Women. By reading them in this order you can follow Henry Chinaski (the main character) from childhood to old age.

What you willfind are autobiographical reminiscences dating from Bukowski's firstmemories when he was two or so in 1922 Germany to December 7, 1941, adate which will live in infamy due to Buk's stunning defeat at thehands of an 8-year-old Mexican boy. Is this fiction? It hardly seemsso, but Bukowski himself reveals how he learned the secret after beingpraised for a 4th grade essay in which he imagined having gone to seePresident Hoover speak: &quot;So, that's what they wanted: lies.Beautiful lies. That's what they needed. People were fools. It wasgoing to be easy for me.&quot; Lies these may be, but it didn't seemeasy for Bukowski. Growing up was a relentless sequence of beatings,humiliations, and hospitalization. His only solace: books andalcohol. Many of these episodes are related in his poetry(particularly in the posthumous collections) and it's interesting tonote the factual consistency. The key difference is that the proserenditions are often laugh out loud funny. Grim situations are madehumorous through understatement and blithe observation of humannature. It is art without artifice. Bukowski is just a guy who hadthe guts to be honest with himself and used words to understand andshare his experience.

Until that happens, those of us in the know will just have to keep the faith, keep telling people of Buk's genius, keep praying for those poor, misguided Ph.Ds with their dry-as-death, dead-weight tomes and their sorry, miserable theories of literature.Bukowski is so real that he scares the phonies shitless.The king is dead! Long live the king!"},{"Title":"Ham on Rye","review":"\\"Ham on Rye\\" was my first introduction to the writing of Charles Bukowski, and tells the story of his alter-ego, Henry Chinaski. It is semi-autobiographical, so when reading, it is best to approach the entire book as fiction, rather than trying to attribute events in the book with the real life of Bukowski. It begins with Chinaski's youth during the Great Depression, and relates his struggles with social and familial acceptance from elementary school through college. The book focuses on his relationship with poor relationship with his parents and a puzzling general disdain for his peers. One of the reasons this book is so fascinating is because it is written in a seemingly crude and blunt prose, detailing a hard life surrounded by fighting, drinking, and women. It shows a culture where daily fights were a necessary part of life and brings forward an image much like we would consider our lives to be like if we lived back in the Old West, and were forced to challenge a man for cheating at cards or looking at you funny.With my air-conditioned office, feather bed, and teeth whitening strips, I can't imagine I would ever have survived in Chinaski's world, so it's enjoyable to experience it from the safety of Bukowski's novel. Although I mentioned a \\"crude\\" writing style, that should not be confused with poor writing. Bukowski's to-the-point style makes for an extremely easy read that I was able to finish in a few hours, unlike the usuals novels that I pore over for weeks to get through. Even though Chinaski is portrayed as a \\"tough guy,\\" Bukowski does not shy away from detailing all of his faults as well, which describe a young man filled with self doubt and a lack of ambition. While I'm not sure how Ham on Rye would fare with female audiences, I highly recommend it for males in the 15-35 age range.To read Bukowski's novels about Pinaski chronologically, follow this order:Ham on Rye: A Novel- Early life, elementary school to collegeFactotum- Young adulthood, World War II erapost office: A Novel- Later years, 1952 - 1969Women: A Novel- Later years, as a poet and writerHollywood- Dealing with Chinaski's later life as a screenwriter"},{"Title":"Ham on Rye","review":"After reading the first page of this novel, I felt as if I had finally found a writer that was talking about life the way I experienced it as a child. The way the young boy views the world that surrounds him, the cruelty of his father, his cold mother, his sympathetic grandfather, his few friends (usually considered freaks, like himself), the popular kids taunting him, ... and women, of course ! Bukowski's prose is so devoid of pretence, of gimmickery, it's as if the man was sitting right next to you, talking from the heart. Nobody has ever written as directly as Bukowski, as truthful or as touching. His poems and short-stories vary from weird to good and fantastic, but this novel is his absolute masterpiece !"},{"Title":"Ham on Rye","review":"If you know nothing about Bukowski this is a good place to start. You'll have a MUCH clearer picture long before you finish. This book is somewhat biographical though it claims to be fiction. With Bukowski anything is plausible and if it didn't happen to him as told in the book it probably could have. Sometimes I think he's a genius and other times he seems to me as just a drunk misogynist with some writing skills. You decide.If you do enjoy this you might consider renting &quot;Barfly.&quot; This movie, starring Mickey Rourke, came out around 1987. Rourke seems to have captured the essence of Bukowski on film."},{"Title":"Ham on Rye","review":"When I was reading reviews and thinking about my experience with Ham on Rye (my second outing with Bukowski, after having read Pulp), I initially thought I would give it 1 or 2 stars based on how much I disliked the character. I started checking out Bukowski after doing a thesis on the importance of Beat lit, and noting his proximity to the time frame and stylistic similarities to the writers I so adore.I disliked Henry Chinaski because, in my mind, he felt real like a lot of the characters I had loved in my favorite books, but instead of having a glowing outlook on life despite setbacks he just let it fester inside him and make him bitter, and I ended up resenting Chinaski for most of his personality (he comes off as a chauvanistic, alcoholic, bitter prick to be completely frank). That coupled with the fact that it seemed as though he was parading around how bad his childhood was because he was poor, had bad acne, etc it started to feel like a pissing contest with no one in particular in mind. But the more I thought about it and dissected him, there were portions of that personality I loved that would peek out from under the foil of a disenchanted youth, angry at the world. There's an odd sort of humanity in Chinaski, and it's very unique to this novel.This book is also very funny, if you don't take it (or yourself) too seriously. I don't know that Bukowski meant it to be humorous in a satirical or ironic sense, but if you don't internalize the things Chinaski thinks, says, or does, and just take them at face value in context of the rest of his personality, it actually is quite funny. But be forewarned, if you are offended easily you should turn back now. I have yet to check out Bukowski's poetry, but I think I will now that I reflect on this novel.Oh, and the fanboys flocking to the 1 star reviews: calm down a little bit. Just because some users don't (or can't) see what you see in a book does not necessarily make them mindless philistines. A majority of the comments I've seen on reviews were attacking people's intellect, self-esteem, or even their ability to read. It's nice that you enjoy your books, let that be enough."},{"Title":"Ham on Rye","review":"Favoring prose over poetry I am a big fan of Bukowski's novels. Although all of them, other than Pulp, are exceptionally good, Ham on Rye is by far his best work. Autobiographical and concentrating on his childhood it is filled with a sense of sadness and wasted potential. Bukowski's prose has a wonderfully stripped down, honest quality to it; almost an antidote to the pretentious side of modernist writing.As for Bukowski himself, he is one of those writers who never got over the basic stupidity of everyday life. His other novels are often a blurred cronology of odd jobs, troubled women, and near suicidal benders. This one is a departure from that pattern because it is about his childhood. Lets make one thing clear, Bukowski was a tough, unhappy, Alcoholic who just wanted to be left alone and also happened to be exceptionally talented at putting words together. He is an excellent writer and should be given due respect but I have no interest in reading work by other miserable drunks. Bukowski's writing works partially because his brutal self deprication compliments his writing style. I appreciate the fact that (in his novels) he avoids flights of fancy, flowery elaboration, heroism, and adventure. As I read his work I am very amused, saddened, and thankful I am not him.This is a great book."},{"Title":"Ham on Rye","review":"This is the second of four books I bought at a library sale for a total cost of about $1.10. It's not the best of the batch so far, but I enjoyed it. It's about this lonely kid with horrible acne who spends most of his time hiding in his room. It's interesting, though almost nothing happens, and funny as hell in parts. Overall, I thought it was a good read, but I still don't see why so many people call Bukowski a \\"poet.\\" His prose is very straightforward and honest and he isn't ashamed of his most embarrassing qualities (there are quite of few of them!) but he's no Nathaniel West or Steinbeck. I debated giving this four stars but overall it's not a great book just a good one about southern California."},{"Title":"Ham on Rye","review":"As another reviewer pointed out below , Ham On Rye falls into the tradition of self-revelatory novels in which an author recounts their early developmental years. Bukowski sets Ham On Rye in Los Angeles during the depression and his settings and characters are poignantly realized. These are people you feel you've met.The narrator/protagonist Henry Chinaski suffers through isolation in his early childhood, adolescence and young adulthood and he gradually grows to accept and embrace his isolation in some unexpected ways. Bukowski is brilliant when it comes to portraying the cruelty of adolescents toward those who don't quite fit in. Henry , always the outsider, has some moments of social acceptance and budding friendships but they never seem to develop. The real turn here is that while Henry struggles to understand his world the reader is gradually drawn into a sympathetic view of this guy.Bukowski can be crude but ultimately this was a very engaging read for me, and I will certainly pick up his other novels as a result of having read this."},{"Title":"Ham on Rye","review":"this is my favorite Bukowski book!!

I thought--as an autobiography of Buk's early life--it would be dreary and depressing. I am pleased to report that I was totally wrong. Ham on Rye isn't disheartening but it is an incredibly poignant tale.Here Bukowski's writing is excellent; perhaps superior to anything else he penned at any other point in his career. His first memory was of being under a table...and we progress from there. I was reminded of a line from the musician Beck, \\"at a time of chimpanzees I was a monkey,\\" after reading that the author's dad bought him an Indian suit with accompanying bow and arrow...at a time when all the other kids wore cowboy outfits. It seems such an outcome was Buk's destiny. His father also discouraged him from reading books and ridiculed his early WWI based stories revolving around the figure of a neo-Red Baron.Buk grew up during the depression and his portrait of those days is something that most of us--born citizens within an America of bounty--will have difficulty imagining. People in those days had three mortgages, and instead of selling new shoes the department stores sold heels and glue in order to maintain the ones you already had. Each child possessed two pairs of pants: one for Sundays and the second for the other six days of the week. When you get to page 95 (chapter 22) that marks Buk's first illicit drink you long to hit the delete key in order to prevent the main character's descent into an addiction that largely poisoned his life. But, as you'd expect, the tale of Baldy and he drinking from barrels wine is fascinating...as are all the vignettes included in this underrated masterpiece. If you read only one book by Buk, this is the one I'd recommend."},{"Title":"Ham on Rye","review":"With so many books on my \\"plate\\" I try mixing genres, topics, possibilities, and thought I was doing so when choosing this book right after reading Skippy Dies. Despite being written in different decades and by seemingly disparate authors, I was struck by the many similarities between the two. Boys will be boys no matter, and the protagonists of these two books met entirely different fates even though the roads they traveled were so similar. unlike fragile Skippy, Henry finds inner strength despite a remarkably brutal, lovless homelife and his own combative self-destructive nature. It's astounding how he survives, and as with many, the large part literature plays in granting him his only awareness that there is life outside his personal hell."},{"Title":"Ham on Rye","review":"I devoured this book.

I had just finished Women and was pretty burned out on him, but this novel was completely different."},{"Title":"Ham on Rye","review":"This book explains alot about Charles Bukowski's youth and gives explanation to his cynical ( or is it truthful?) view of life. I believe this book is mainly auto- biographical and it deals with his relationship with his cruel father, his terrible case of acne and his life as a young man up until his early twenties. I would not say it is Bukowskis best work (I prefer his short stories), however this book has a sense of completeness and cohesiveness which is not always present in his other work. This book could be a very good introduction to Bukowski's work as it is very readable and enjoyable."},{"Title":"Ham on Rye","review":"I had a guy I was dating introduce me to the talent of Charles Bukowski many years ago and I haven't been able to put him down since.

To cope, he turns to schoolyard violence and terrible habits, giving the reader a front seat into the world of a guy who makes nothing but bad decisions but keeps living in spite of himself.For those interested in modern literature, this book is a great example of dark anti-heroism."},{"Title":"Ham on Rye","review":"Man, Bukowski had some life. Growing up under an abusive psychotic father and a mother who was pretty worthless as a support, Bukowski had to fend for himself. He was sort of a bully at school, he develops a tough shell, a psychological as well as physical callousness that is demonstrated in his reactions to other people. This had me laughing out loud on the subway rides to and from work. The dark humor is enough to brighten your otherwise dull and uninspired day. His misery is bitter, how he deals with with it through the alter-ego Chinaski is hilarious. And sooner or later you begin to sympathize with a poetic and tragic anti-hero. You are reminded of the fact that ugliness is more of a mental thing than a physical thing."},{"Title":"Ham on Rye","review":"While I understand that this will probably not becoming required reading - I think most pass over this incredible work without giving it much thought. Charles Bukowski has given us an extraordinary diagnosis of the human condition through a look back at his own life.

It brings in Henry Chinaski, a character Bukowski uses in many stories. A must read, but with an open mind."},{"Title":"Ham on Rye","review":"Charles Bukowski was a genius, and this book for me epitomizes great writing. Succinct and to the point, honest and thought-provoking, without any of the superfluous window-dressing that most writers tend to clutter their work with. It tells the story of the author's childhood, growing up in Los Angeles under the roof of an abusive father and an uncaring mother, in a world that utterly rejects him at every turn. It is kind of a walk down memory lane, albeit a rather painful one. Bukowski's characteristic stark and direct style is in full evidence here, and it works to magnificent effect. This book describes the formative years of a man who rose from the depths of oppression and alcoholism and depression and a thousand dingy roominghouses and seedy bars and hardened whores to become one of the most celebrated writers of our time, soul intact. After I read this book, I sat down at the computer and started writing myself for the first time (and haven't stopped since) - it was that influential. There have been many imitators but there was only one Bukowski. He was a visionary talent who revolutionized both prose and (in particular) poetry, in a passionate and sometimes almost violent attempt to bring the art of writing down from its traditional perch in the clouds and deliver it directly to the masses, honestly and without pretense. The tale told in this book will make you laugh out loud, will make you cry, will make you want to scream with redemption, because here is someone who is telling it like it is, without thought of consequence or effect, spilling his mind and his guts out on the page for everyone to see. But most of all, like the life of the man himself, it should inspire you to tackle your own life with renewed vigor. This is my favorite book from my favorite author - I couldn't recommend a book more."},{"Title":"Ham on Rye","review":"I've read a few books of his poetry books and now know where Mr. Bukowski is coming from. In his poems, he's not just acting as a silly, drunk, sorry gambler for the sake of art - he IS all of these BUT he can write! He can tell a story, and Ham on Rye is a very, very good story. It's sad and happy and funny and so real all at the same time. For those growing up who think the whole world is against them and think their existence is so difficult, I recommend this book to them - and have already done so. This is one that belongs in the classrooms for its frankness and honesty. Sometimes, lots of times, life really does stink.

The book \\"Ham on Rye\\" is a simple narrative whos' directness of tone and economy of works gives an honesty lacking in a great deal of work around now. There are no complex subplots, there are no preachy beleaguering comments about our hero's choices, there is just the tale. Chinaski, the main character could easily journey with the men of \\"On the Road\\", but without their beatnik hipness that can so grate. It has that same joy of a narrative as \\"On the Road\\", that does not force the reader to some perfect conclusion and thus it stands that test of a classic. It is a book that you could forever reread. Its not an easy book to recommend to friends, it is a book of the outsider, it is similar to \\"Catcher in the Rye\\" in that it charts the characters movement from innocence to streetsmart, whilst avoiding \\"Catchers's\\" habit of trying to capture teen slang.

I suspect that Nabokov might actually be glad to hear that.I mention it in connection with \\"Glory\\" because this novel has so many autobiographical elements in it, yet the author himself warned us not to take it too literally. Maybe he's just playing games with us, as he often did. Or maybe we've just become accustomed to thinking that novels always reveal the author's actual past. Are authors really that unimaginative? Some might be, but not Nabokov.\\"Glory,\\" like a lot of this author's Russian novels, deals with a group of Russians who have fled the Revolution and find themselves in Europe. Martin Edelweiss, as his name suggests, has the good fortune to be part Swiss, so he and his mother have somewhere to go when the Communists take over (his parents are long since divorced and his father dead). They start in the Crimea, then move up to Switzerland, and Martin heads to Cambridge for university. Despite an interlude as a rural farm worker in France that gives him some peace, he finds himself longing to perform some daring exploit to impress a flirtatious girl named Sonia who refuses to marry him. So he decides to sneak over the border back into Russia.So much for the plot, which isn't the purpose of the novel anyway. In his introduction, Nabokov tells us two things. First, he says that \\"Glory\\" is his only novel with a purpose, and that that purpose is not the novel's story - rather, it's the opportunity to watch his character enjoy the generally normal and insignificant events of his life. Second, he informs us that the fun of reading \\"Glory\\" is to pick up on its various patterns, repetitive imagery, echoes along the time of Martin's life, and things like that.Well, I read the novel with these claims in mind, and it sort of works. For instance, Martin's endless searching for something new can get a little annoying until you recall that each of those searches follows a pattern established at the novel's start, when Martin as a child in the nursery becomes fascinated by a watercolor painting of a path disappearing into a forest. This image isn't so much a symbol of adventures as a calling for Martin, a way for him to explain why his life doesn't go the way he wants it to. He seems to think that if he stops looking around for mysterious paths, he won't be worthy of much, certainly not Sonia's love.Here's the thing - in almost any other novel, this early pattern of mysterious forest paths would likely lead to something easily explainable. Other authors, even excellent ones, might produce a story in which Martin learns to forget about such romantic notions, settles down and lives happily ever after. Or perhaps they might produce a story in which Martin insists upon the search for mystery and adventure, and either triumphs over all adversity and becomes a hero, or goes down to tragic disgrace. Some archetypal adventure story, in short. Be forewarned - Nabokov couldn't possibly care less about such things. He's interested in the pattern, not where it leads. He told us this quite clearly, so read \\"Glory\\" as he instructed us to. Do not expect him to tie up all the loose ends, or even any of the loose ends. Nabokov didn't seem to believe that there's such a thing as a loose end anyway. The pattern is what it is - the fact that it's carefully planned doesn't mean it has to be circular.As far as I know, \\"Glory\\" isn't considered to be a major Nabokov work. Nevertheless, it raises some interesting questions, and it's worth reading for that reason alone. For instance, as I said, Martin embarks on his quest to cross the Russian border to attract Sonia's attention, and to make himself feel worthy (at least that's what he tells himself). Just about everyone in his life, whether they find out about this project before Martin initiates it or afterwards, thinks that it's just about the dumbest idea they've ever heard. The author himself, if you read the novel closely, appears to agree that Martin's got no business endangering himself as he does (most of the time I don't bother you with the author's opinion of his own work, but Nabokov injects himself into his stories so often that it's worth considering). On the other hand, if Martin's search for glory is so idiotic, why bother writing a novel about it?Well, yeah, Nabokov says it's worthwhile because of the enjoyment we get from following the patterns the story produces, but that still leaves open the question of whether or not Martin's little jaunt actually gets him the glory he seeks. That's just one of those things that this author leaves up to you and me. It's probably a better idea to read Martin's search for glory as just another element in the pattern of \\"Glory\\" and let it go at that.Benshlomo says, If you play the game seriously, it might even get you what you want."},{"Title":"GLORY.

So much to learn about language - I can hardly believe sometimes that the sentences weren't originally written in English, they come out so naturally, with such an extremely high quality of aesthetic sound. Certainly a rather autobiographical novel ... as I get back to reading other stories by Nabakov I am confident I understand them better, getting a much better sense of the man by reading this one."},{"Title":"GLORY. A Novel.","review":"Let me begin by saying that I truly enjoyed this book and recommend it to anyone interested in serious literature. However, the one aspect of the book that still leaves me puzzled is the ending. I read the last 5-10 pages of the book several times after finishing it and I am still not exactly sure what happens. Perhaps that was Nabokov's intention, and perhaps the ending is just as vague in the original Russian version. Nevertheless, as much as I enjoyed the book and reveled in the historical setting and beautiful descriptive language I couldn't help but feel that the ending was unfulfilling. I'm not the type of person who requires &quot;closure&quot; in my stories but I do like a definitive ending. &quot;Glory&quot; didn't really seem to have one. Perhaps that is part of the charm of the book. I can honestly say that this one aspect of the story will allow me never to forget it. So perhaps in the end it is a good thing.One last thing, if you are going to read this book make sure you have at least a cursory understanding of European history during and just after the Russian Revolution.

And in his own words he says 'In general Glory is my happiest thing. ................. although nothing much happens at the very end ...........' If this is in any way off putting (novels are supposed to be about tension and resolution after all) I recommend you ignore it. For me, despite what the author says, EVERYTHING happens at the end."},{"Title":"GLORY. A Novel.","review":"Edelweiss? Noble White, the shy alpine flower that so quickly vanishes after spring. Are we readers to look for meaning in Nabokov's choice of the name Martin Edelweiss for his focal character? A good deal is said about the name early in the book, and we're reminded of it at crucial moments throughout. Just a few pages of Nabokov's so-carefully-crafted prose inclines this reader to suppose that nothing in \\"Glory\\" is merely incidental, that every detail is laden with pertinence. Whatever else one says about this novel, the first fact is that it's gloriously written. Every sentence snaps the reader's mind into focus. Every description is a poem in itself. Every characterization is a full dramatic portrait of individual flesh and blood.Martin Edelweiss is a frivolous young man embedded among Russian emigres utterly trivialized by the Bolshevik Revolution, about which we hear only frivolous rumors and reports in ephemeral newsprint. The only position Martin's querulous society seems to take toward the momentous events in their homeland is to wish they hadn't happened, but make no mistake, this a novel about the Revolution, seen through a lens of irrelevance. This is also a novel about the meaning of being Russian, though Nabokov conveys his meaning through the subtlest indirection. There's no ambiguity whatsoever about the ending of the novel. The meaning is as clear as plasma and as ominous as a drum-roll to a prisoner awaiting execution, but I do not choose to pre-empt anyone's reading excitement by declaring the obvious.At the same time, \\"Glory\\" is a coming-of-age novel, similar to other such novels about young men going off to college. Scott Fitzgerald's \\"This Side of Paradise\\" and E.M. Forster's \\"The Longest Journey\\" might offer interesting comparisons. In all three, a sensitive young man confronts the tawdriness of the intellectual life, slips into depression over his own mediocrity, falls hopelessly in love with a disdainful beauty while at the same time exploring lust with more accessible lasses, and wrestles with the identity of a seemingly more well-prepared friend. Martin, however, isn't a titan waiting to be awakened to his own worth at the end of the novel. Nabokov takes pain to show us that Martin is NOT a poet, not a budding genius of any sort, just a modestly intelligent everyman of no particular bent. In fact, Martin's only talent seems to be at tennis. Like a young George Orwell, Martin stumbles into a brief romance with the simple life of honest toil, dwelling incognito for a 'chapter' in a wine-growing village in southern France. But, like most of Martin's experiences, this pastoral interlude sinks quickly into the chasm of memory. Above all, this is a novel about memory. It begins with Martin's memories of childhood. Martin's perceptions are all foreshadowed, and his actions are all predetermined, by his memories. Even the passing moment is no more than a memory.Martin doesn't tell his story in the first person. Nabokov clings to Martin's shoulder like a personal daemon, or to be blunt, like a 19th C omniscient narrator. When suddenly, in the last chapter, the novelist shifts his perch to another shoulder, it's both a brilliant literary trick and a lucid statement of Martin's fate.\\"Glory\\" is a translation from Russian of an early novel by a writer who went on to create far more famous books in English. Perhaps that explains why it's less widely read than the Forster or Fitzgerald novels mentioned above. It's the best book of the three by far, and proves beyond a doubt that Nabokov could write traditional narrative as brilliantly as the more idiosyncratic interior surrealism for which he is famous."},{"Title":"GLORY. A Novel.","review":"I always pick up one of the &quot;Russian&quot; novels by Nabokov with a certain thrill of anticipation. Not only is the reader about to be thrust into the Russian emigre population that moved into the large European cities following the Revolution of 1917, but is also to me made party to the evolving literary genius of the young Nabokov.In this book, which the author describes as soaring &quot;to the heights of purity and melancholy that I have only attained in the much later Ada,&quot; he deals with the themes of alienation and the romantic musings which accompany the lives of the lonely and unspectacular individuals who make their way through this world. For Martin Edelweiss, the main character of the book, life has become a series of romantic possibilities: &quot;a necklace of lights&quot; seen from a train in the French night, the woman who throws a brief glance in his direction, footpaths dissolving into a forest - all these become possible &quot;gallant feats,&quot; if only in his mind.Although Nabokov downplays the similarity between the background of Martin and his own, there is a great deal in this book that is autobiographical. The author's years of emigre life in various European cities, his university days at Cambridge, and his period of manual labor in the south of France all find their way into this novel. Perhaps because of the author's emotional involvement with the book, Glory brings to life a softer Nabokov, one who is content to let the book follow its own winding path and who refrains from interjecting the tautness of his earlier efforts.As a stylist, Nabokov is incomparable and to read one of his books is an experience of sheer wonder. If this book does not rank with his highest achievements, it certainly demonstrates a more mature author at work, one who is on the brink of greatness."},{"Title":"GLORY. A Novel.","review":"I wanted to read fairly short, impressive book during my winter break/holidays. So, Nabokov came to my mind. I picked up &quot;Glory&quot; and I was taken from the moment I started reading. Book about young Martin Edelweiss, of Swiss and Russian heritage, follows his quiet life from his early childhood to his life of the grown up, young man. His parents divorce during his childhood, and Martin's father dies soon afterwards. Martin's mother re-marries to his uncle who sends young Martin to the Cambridge University. Here, Martin acquires new friends and even falls in love with Sonia, ruthless daughter of the Russian emigre editor. Sonia seems to enjoy seducing young man but is ever so easy in discarding them in order to avoid long term commitment. Martin is no exception. And after college days are over, Martin decides to travel around Europe: England, Switzerland, Germany. His uncle/stepfather is concerned about Martin's lack of desire to find suitable position in order to ensure steady flow of income. And while Martin's friends are building their careers in journalism, writing and other &quot;honorable&quot; professions, he seems to rather enjoy doing manual labor in order to find his true self. Until one day - he goes away. Forever.Very powerful novel. It made me Nabokov's fan in a matter of moment."},{"Title":"GLORY. A Novel.","review":"This novel was first published in Russian in 1932 and was much later translated into English by the author and his son Dimitri. In his interesting introduction to the book, Nabokov states that his original working title was \\"Romanticheskiy Vek\\", or \\"Romantic Times\\"; this was later changed to \\"Podvig\\", which can be translated as \\"gallant feat\\" or \\"exploit\\".The hero of the book is Martin Edelweiss, a young Russian of Swiss ancestry. Like Nabokov's own family, Martin and his mother are forced to leave Russia following the Communist revolution of 1917, and take refuge in Switzerland, where Martin's mother marries his Uncle Henry, a cousin of his late father. Martin is sent to be educated in Cambridge; after graduating, he refuses to find a profession for himself, but travels around Europe, taking casual employment in Berlin and the south of France. The book ends with Martin performing the \\"exploit\\" of the Russian title, a clandestine crossing of the Soviet border from Latvia, but the ultimate outcome of this deed is left obscure.Nabokov's two Russian titles for the work are both significant. Martin is a man of artistic temperament but without artistic gifts. He is bored and restless, something he has in common with the \\"superfluous men\\" of earlier Russian literature, such as Eugene Onegin or Pechorin from Lermontov's \\"Hero of our Times\\" (a novel Nabokov translated). (There is also, possibly, an echo of their obsession with duelling and honour in the rather ridiculous boxing match between Martin and his Cambridge friend Darwin). There are, however, important differences between Martin and these earlier anti-heroes. Their restlessness and boredom lead them into cynical, callous nihilism; Martin's lead him into a search for sense of purpose, something he remains optimistic about finding. As another reviewer has put it, he sees life as a \\"series of romantic possibilities.\\" Whereas their sense of purposelessness is internal, arising from something in their characters, Martin's is external, deriving from his situation as an involuntary exile, cut off from his country by political events. It is notable that when he goes to Cambridge he chooses to study Russian literature and culture, rejecting Henry's advice that he should follow a vocational course. Memories of his childhood take on great importance for him; he chooses, for example, to live and work for a time in a particular French town because of the (mistaken) belief that it was the town whose lights he once briefly glimpsed during a night-time train ride as a boy.Although the story is told in the third person, it is similar to a first-person narrative in that the whole of the action (except the last few pages after he has disappeared) is told as it appears to the central character. One of the most striking features of the work is the vividness of its descriptions of the physical world. Whether the scene is set in the Crimea, Greece, Switzerland, Cambridge, Berlin or Provence, there are plentiful references (at times in almost every sentence) to not only the sights of the locality but also to its sounds, smells, tastes and sensations. Martin is highly sensitive to the beauty of the world around him (something else, incidentally, that he shares with Pechorin)- lights seem from a train, the moon shining on the sea, a jay flying through blue sky above a snow-covered forest, or the scents of a Crimean summer.Because Martin is so much at the centre of the book, the other characters are less prominent, although there are one or two sharp portraits- Uncle Henry, whose cautious pragmatism contrasts with Martin's romanticism, Martin's first love, the married Decadent poetess Alla Chernosvitova, Sonia Zilanova, the fickle, flirtatious daughter of another &eacute;migr&eacute; family with whom he later conducts an on-off romance, and Darwin. (Darwin, incidentally, is not a fop, as some have called him. \\"Fop\\" seems an odd word to use about a winner of the Victoria Cross, and he often seems more practical and down to earth than Martin himself).The motivation for Martin's \\"gallant feat\\" is left as obscure as its outcome. Was it some secret mission on behalf of his fellow &eacute;migr&eacute;s? A desire for adventure? An attempt to impress Sonia? Nostalgia for his native land? Simple bravado? Nabokov provides no definitive answer to this question. Unlike some other reviewers, however, I did not find that the book was spoilt for me by the deliberately vague ending. In literature, as in life, mystery and ambiguity can be as interesting as precision and hard fact. Certainly, \\"Glory\\" is not a novel of the traditional sort, with a well-rounded plot with a beginning, a middle and an end, and should not be read as such. The fun of \\"Glory\\" lies elsewhere (to quote its author in a different context). The sensuous prose and the memorable portrait of a romantic young man in an age when romanticism was perhaps not in fashion make this a superb novel."},{"Title":"GLORY. A Novel.","review":"This is essential Nabokov. If this weren't one of his earlier works, I'd say that the master has done it again. Still, all the brazen overtness in prose has been polished away since Mary and The Defense. All the little prose games that make Nabokov a joy to read (relegating plot, sometimes even character to the background) is already well in place, though perhaps because it is in translation, the prose does not sparkle as it does in his English works.A word about the plot, it is very interesting when read against Kerouac's Vanity of Duluoz, both stories about drifterdom after college. Of course, the ending is inconclusive, but how? That's left as a surprise."},{"Title":"GLORY. A Novel.","review":"Glory is the comic/tragic tale of a young man whose fantasies of heroism come to replace reality and eventually lead to his downfall. The theme is simple, but because the novel is set between WWI and WWII, Glory might be best described as a somewhat cynical allegory about the plight of the \\"Lost Generation\\"--those ex-patriots who retreated to Paris during the 20s and 30s. Martin, our protagonist, while not an American in Paris, most certainly is lost. Having been forced into exile during the Russian Revolution, Martin, who is a highly Europeanized hybrid, finds himself adrift in Europe, wandering from Switzerland, to England, to Germany in an aimless pursuit of what to do with himself. Eventually he falls in love with the sulky, dark-eyed temptress, Sonia. But that, of course, solves nothing. Martin does not know who he is, where he has come from, or where he is going. Falling in love merely heightens his anomie.If this sounds somewhat uninspiring as a plot, you are right! There is very little action of note, and even less character development (which, in any event, Nabokov disdained). The appeal of this book is the sheer force of Nabokov's gorgeous writing. His exquisite attention to detail, his amazing insights into states of mind set him above all other writers. Perhaps you think I am overstating, but who else can take you to a river in Cambridge, make you smell the air, see the sky, feel as Martin feels, so deftly, so economically and with such great sensitivity? Nabokov, a synthaesthete, has a chef's awareness of how to spice his novels. A dash of this, a hint of that - he knows which sensations to describe in order to create a harmonious whole. There are passages in this book which I read and re-read, astounded by the clarity, the precision, the sheer beauty of Nabokov's prose.Glory is a literary delicacy, best savored slowly. Take your time consuming it, and you will be thoroughly satisfied."},{"Title":"GLORY. A Novel.","review":"In spite of multinational references in the book, \\"Glory\\" is quintessentially American. Martin Edelweiss (22 years old) is as every bit American as Rabbit Angstrom or Benny Profane (22 and 23 respectively). The unremitting chiseling oneself out is more in character with Rocky Balboa than with Raskolnikov.Martin is a bit of a Holden Caulfield, sensitive and highly original. But instead of defining himself as the negation of the surrounding world, Martin has an inner flame that carries him forth. Stepping off the train in the middle of nowhere in Provence, and settling there. Going back on the perilous cliff just to prove to himself that he could do it. Crossing a dangerous state frontier. Even washing himself daily from his ubiquitous collapsible bathtub. All these are emanations of Martin's spirit. And in the book he, the least purposeful one, is the only one possessing it. He is that miraculous lonely green branch sprouting out of a withered tree. The book, in fact, is no less radical than Bulgakov's \\"Master and Margarita\\" in its assertion that only according to your peculiar self is it worth living. The theme is not new, but the variation on it is presented with remarkable elegance. Only the preface, narcissistic and supercilious, is regrettably dissonant with the rest of the book.And, naturally, the language. What a beautiful serving, what a feast! It is a hillock of beaten egg whites, under the dappled sunlight of a linden tree alley, smiling at you with all the sun-ignited freckles of its icy crystals. Weightless and radiant, it is a young steed, now trotting, now galloping, but always having the air of freshness about it. As is typically with Nabokov's novels, the pace of the book seems maddeningly slow, until one surrenders to its flow and lets their senses resonate with its spell. Nabokov savors language like a wine connoisseur savors wine: lingering with it, swirling the words, slowly, slowly, until they reveal their intricate bouquet.Nabokov's lightness of touch, akin to Pushkin's, makes reading his books irresistible, like reading the best books in childhood, the ones to which you had to run home after school just to indulge yourself more."},{"Title":"GLORY. A Novel.","review":"\\"Russia is our Motherland. Death is inevitable\\". - Epigraph to \\"The Gift\\", another Nabokov's novel.Why did Martin Edelweiss march off towards his glory?The complete population of Nabokov's novel - Martin's mother, his uncle, his best friend, his lady acquaintance (Sonya is not really his girlfriend, is she?), her relatives, the adventurous Gruzinov, unafraid to boldly go into blood-soaked Soviet Russia through secret passageways - all of them cannot find an answer to this question.But let's rephrase it. Could Martin *not* march off towards his glory?Strictly speaking, yes. Should Sonya agree to come to Provence and lead a peaceful rustic life with him, among snakes, heat and garlic. But she had refused, and Martin ran out of options.He couldn't really spend his life working as a tennis coach in Berlin, throwing balls to elderly pupils - the balls he so deftly held in his hand, five at once.Nabokov gave to Martin the precious droplets of his own experience, something that was called the happiest childhood of Russian literature. He gave him the anglophile tradition, the old Cambridge ramparts, the glow of Riviera sand, the hot afternoon hours of Southern France, the smell of petrol in Berlin. He allowed him to lose his virginity easily and happily - before that, all Russian classical writers had bashfully neglected this crucial moment - probably none of them happened to be so lucky as Martin. Who else in Russian literature dared sleep with a prostitute with a feeling of such freshness and vigour, and no remorse at all? There is no overlapping in Martin's sexual and romantic life; tough luck, sure; but in contrast to a multitude of other Russian fictional characters, he does not turn it into a tragedy, or renounce both in a fit of despair.Having endowed his hero with nobleness, health, intellect, sense of humour, Nabokov did not give him any vocation. Martin never wrote anything longer than a postcard. Butterflies flip-flap their wings around him from time to time, but not a single one is given a name in the novel. He plays tennis well enough, but still he's only an amateur; he doesn't seem to play chess at all. In Cambridge, at first, he wants to do everything, but then he chooses the easy way and goes into Slavic studies, losing an excellent tutor on the way because of the latter's sexual preferences (squeamish, isn't he). Nabokov consistently denies his creation all of his own great passions. Even Martin's university studies are only mentioned fleetingly; they are not of real interest to anyone, to Martin himself in particular.Martin with a gift - that is the character of Nabokov's later novel, \\"The Gift\\", the writer Godunov-Tscherdyntsev. His future fianc&eacute;e would have dog-eared the book of his poetry before even meeting him. But what is left to Martin, who does not write any poetry? \\"Without a profession, he'll go nuts\\", says uncle Heinrich.So he did."},{"Title":"GLORY. A Novel.","review":"This was Nabakov's fifth novel. This is the fifth book of his I've read. Vladie is starting to sound like a grown-up.His first three novels were alientating stories of brilliant youth, bitter and obsessed over their awkward superiority to others. The Eye was a kid's afterlife story, all cute and smug and everything racked with some sort of glory.Then comes Glory.The protagonist is an arrogant, shiftless swan, kind and naive, but convinced he's worth something special. In point of fact, he isn't. All of his friends seem to be proving their worth and rising to the glorious peaks everyone always seemed to think he was supposed to attain. A sucker for grunt work, Martin decides to outdo everyone with a physical feat. But he's dumb, he's too self-absorbed, he's so full of himself that there is no idea of consequences or the future.Nabakov tosses off his previous experimentation and forges ahead to what looks to be an open door of brilliant, brilliant ideas. Each passing chapter builds more excitement and enthusiasm as you wander along just as aimlessly as poor, benighted Martin himself. I believe this to be an honest book--the first honest book of Nabakov's career--and the menacingly self-depreciating tone of everyone towards everything gives us an ideal perspectivist slant on the narrative, feeding along in a world where, regardless of private likes and dislikes, everyone pretty much reacts exactly the same. Life proves to be competitive and each player attempts to one up everyone else in the world.It's actually a 4 and a half star book, and I feel guilty about words stated in my previous review for The Eye, but I STILL round it down because of the obnoxious, tedious, and wantonly swaggering introduction Vladie scribbled in a self-congradulatory way to tell you that his idea is just too brilliant for you to appreciate fully. Perhaps so. What have I lost?"},{"Title":"GLORY.

Some of us had it in school, others have other exposure. But the thing that we tend to forget about Classical Latin is that just about nobody spoke it and only a few were able to write it. The language that Latin-speakers actually used was the one described here.\\"Vulgar Latin\\" (a name that the author doesn't really like, even if he uses it for reasons of its being the best-known name for it) was the normal speech of the Latin speaking world, and as a result, the language that developed into modern French, Spanish, Italian, and the other Romance languages. If you want to know more about the history of those languages, you should read a book such as this one.It is hard to tell how much of what I like about this book is due to its author and how much to the translator. The book was originally written in French in the 1960s, and an updated version (written also in French, but not published) was used as the basis both for a Spanish translation in the 1990s and for this one. Prof. Herman states in his own preface that his original French was turned into a much more readable English style by Prof. Wright, who is himself a professor of Romance languages in England. In consequence, much of the extreme readability of this book seems to be the translator's contribution.In any case, I found the book informative, while yet relatively easy to read. There is not much about a book that can be considered negative when it is both of these. Thus, it deserves the highest rating."},{"Title":"Vulgar Latin","review":"Jozsef Herman's VULGAR LATIN is a brief introduction to Vulgar Latin. At merely 130 pages with no complicated discussion of linguistics, it is perhaps the ideal introduction to Vulgar Latin for university undergraduates.The work begins with a discussion of the term \\"Vulgar Latin\\" and its problems. The term has had several meanings in philological studies. For Herman, Vulgar Latin is the set of innovations and trends which turn up in the Latin-speaking populations little or not at all influenced by school education and literary models.Once Herman has set a definition, he really gets into the main part of the book with an overview of Vulgar Latin phonology. This is an extremely gentle introduction with many examples and no expection of prior study of phonetics, though being able to read IPA is a must. He afterwards discusses inflectional morphology, again in a manner admirably clear and approachable for any student of Classical Latin. The final part of the core of the book concerns the Vulgar Latin lexicon and why many terms in Romance cannot be found to be derived from those of Classical Latin. There is a final chapter about \\"More General Problems\\", such as when the \\"end of Latin\\" should be placed in time.Herman's work was originally published in French in 1967 with a revised edition in 1997. It was translated into English by Roger Wright in 2000. Herman appears to have thought Wright an ideal translator, as Herman was himself indebted to some degree to Wright's research for the revised edition. Unfortunately, Wright's translation continues to use the Communist-era orthography for the Romanian examples (which he spells anachronistically \\"Rumanian\\").For undergraduate students of Classics or historical linguistics, Herman's is probably the best introduction to Vulgar Latin. It isn't perfect, and afterwards one will have to move on to more detailed coverage, but it is certainly worth picking up."},{"Title":"Vulgar Latin","review":"This book is an introduction to the forms of Latin spoken in the later Roman Empire. It begins with an introduction to the topic with discussion of the term \\"Vulgar Latin\\" itself, a designation the author dislikes because of its pejorative connotations (my wife, in fact, got a good laugh when she saw me reading this book, and asked why I wanted to learn *that kind* of Latin).The author discusses our sources for information about Vulgar Latin. One of the main sources is Latin grammarians railing against \\"mistakes\\" in Latin usage by the common people.Another source is through direct comparison with the phonetic features of modern Romance languages, the daughters of Latin. For example, Latin long /e/ and short /i/ merged into a single phoneme in later Romance: Fr. toile, croire, poire, foi; It. tela, credere, pera, fede; all from Latin tela, credere, pira, fidum. The assumption, which is borne out by the inscriptionary evidence, is that in the popular speech of the late Empire these sounds were already merging.Comparison of Latin forms with the lexicon of Romance languages is another form of information about Vulgar Latin. The word for \\"fire\\" (ignis), for example, is not continued in any modern language (except for late scientific Latin borrowings like \\"igneous\\", of course); they instead generalized the use of \\"focus\\" (\\"hearth\\") for \\"fire\\": Port. fogo, Sp. fuego, Fr. feu, Rom. foc, It. fuoco. There are many other interesting examples of this type in the book.As alluded to above, we can also gather information about Vulgar Latin from inscriptions. The craftsmen who produced the inscriptions, while probably literate, are not considered to have had exposure to the thorough classical education of the elites, and so many \\"mistakes\\" in usage crept into their work. The author writes that as the many inscriptions were gathered and published over the last century or so, Romance linguists and Indo-Europeanists were able to analyze them, and discovered that rather than indicating an occasional \\"mistake\\", the inscriptions revealed systemic changes in the language as used by the common people.In succeeding chapters, the author surveys the characteristic phonology, morphology, and vocabulary of Vulgar Latin as revealed in these sources.I don't have any background in Latin or Romance languages, only a general interest in such topics, yet I found this book to be quite interesting and easy to digest. The author and translator use an easy, popular style, and the many illustrative examples are given in both the \\"proper\\" Classical form, as well as the form(s) found in Vulgar Latin. So the points the author is trying to make are immediately clear and easily understood.A very worthwhile and enjoyable book."},{"Title":"Vulgar Latin","review":"This book should be read by anyone who wishes to learn more about how, via changes in the spoken language, Classical Latin morphed over time to become medieval Latin which, in turn, influenced the development of the modern Romance languages (Italian, Spanish, French, etc.).

He tries to do two things at the same time: explain the different options in Crystal Reports and go through a detailed example (which doesn't cover all of the options).2. I got off to a bad start in the book right away because he gives the .NET project the same name as the report, which confuses my version of Visual Studio .NET (2003 EA). In the sample code that can be downloaded from Wrox's web site, he uses a different name for the .NET project.3. His explanation of cross tab reports is a joke (and has some mistakes in it). Fortunately, he uses a good example(s) for the cross tab report(s) and a reasonably intelligent person can figure it out.4. He doesn't cover some of the &quot;fun&quot; stuff in report design like sizing and aligning report objects. He doesn't give you good tips for rapidly developing reports (other than using the report experts). He has written another book for beginners which I haven't read. Perhaps he covers some of these things there.5. He could use more examples and more detail on subreports in his book. The reviewer from Singapore, for example, might benefit from that.6. He does a very good job of reviewing the capabilities of Crystal Reports .NET versus the full retail versions of Crystal Reports like versions 9 and 10.7. He does a good job of showing how to use Crystal Reports within the Visual Studio .NET IDE (which a lot of reviewers liked). However, he mentions the context menu for the report designer several times but never gives a screen shot of the menu in the book.

It concisely covers exactly what the title says it does - CR.NET - not stand alone CR 9, nor Enterprise. It addresses an issue that both Microsoft and Crystal/Seagate documentation have always given short shrift to in earlier versions of CR - how the tool (CR.NET) is intended to be used in the context of the larger IDE (VS.NET).Still, the bad reviews here are somewhat valid. The important legacy issue of porting old CR 7 and 8 reports into CR.NET is not addressed - even though the topic would be germane to the subject matter. Also, while I haven't had any troubles using SQL Server stored procs in CR.NET so far, I have to agree that the topic is important and germane enough to deserve specific discussion. God help me for saying this about a Wrox title, but it would have been worth making it a little thicker to cover these topics.And hey, it's nice to see Wrox taking the time to let one author write a thin, coherent book instead of rushing out the thick, incoherent collections of chapter-length articles that they usually do."},{"Title":"Professional Crystal Reports for Visual Studio .NET (Programmer to Programmer)","review":"I bought the book for the web forms chapter and I found it to be too brief.

I have tried to use the version that shipped with Visual Studio 6 and with poor functionality and no decent documentation (from Crystal or otherwise), I finally just gave in and bought Active Reports. When I started using .NET, I was happy to find Crystal Reports had been updated but still no manual and poor documentation. I was about to throw in the towel when I came across this book-- it provided the missing link and I am now integrating Crystal Reports into my applications and didn't have to buy any other software to do it. If I had a complaint, it would be that the chapter on data sources doesn't go into a lot of detail on ADO.NET, just how to use it with a report. So if you haven't worked with data sets before, you will probably need to read up on it [at their site] or other similiar sites or grab a book just on ADO.NET if you plan to use it extensively.

The tool itself still is playing catch up to the regular version of Crystal but is miles ahead of previous versions. Like most of big Bill's products, the manuals were scarce in .net and the documentation on Crystal is sad. I had bought the complete reference and it was thin on developer topics, so I was happy to find this book and it provides excellent coverage on report integration, but why didn't Crystal do this themselves?!? once again WROX has the best."},{"Title":"Professional Crystal Reports for Visual Studio .NET (Programmer to Programmer)","review":"This book has an annoying trait of explaining super basic things as if you had no knowledge of computers. It tells you step by step how to add a project. Select File -> New -> etc. Which is fine if all material is covered with this detail. But it's not. The harder stuff is, or this stuff that's is impossible to arrive at with clicking, is glossed over.For instance, there's a section that tells you how to use Crystal Parameters with values entered in a textbox. A very useful thing. The explanation is laborious on how to add components on the form but when he gets to the code part, he says, \\"You can now use this code to set you parameter fields\\" No mention of where this code goes. How could they assume you've never turned on a computer before with the Select File -> New bit and then assume you know where this code goes.It makes this book useless. It's one of things that is just infuriating. Who do they think the audience is for this book? If you know VS you know how to add a project, for Christ's sake. If you know Crystal you know how to make parameters.

It is mostly due to the style and approach of his writing. Even though this book follows a formula format like some of his other works, I found this book to be very engaging. Some humanist may charge that LaHaye and David Nobel are being &quot;over-dramatic&quot; about the secular humanist movement, but, this is not the case. Although the book doesn't always give enough detials about some of its accusations toward the humanist movement, it does speak the truth.It could be that I would have liked more detials because I take a very investigative approach with this type of material, but for the average reader, the book gives enough specifics to satisfy their mind and present the truth. Therefore, I gave it five stars, because a review shouldn't always be about personal taste, but instead, whether a book has achieved its goal, and done so honestly. That is what this book has done.This book further exposes the dangers of humanism and where it has brought our country. The book demonstrates through solid documentation that the minority culture is having a &quot;bigger say&quot; than the majority public. This book is a must read and I recommend it because I hope it will spark an interest for Christians to read other, more detialed works, like Colson and Pearcy's &quot;How Now Shall We Live.&quot; This book accomplishes the task it is set out to do: Inform, and hopefully motivate Christians to study more on this subject and be prepare to inform others on the dangers of a secular soceity."},{"Title":"Mind Siege - The Battle For Truth In The New Millennium","review":"As an American, I support people's right to express their own opinion and view of the world no matter how crazy, baseless or intolerant this view is. Having said that, Mr. LaHaye and Mr. Noebel have set down a theory of our current society which is based on very little fact and is extremely intolerant of views not based on (their) specific Christian values. The view that American society is being &quot;taken over&quot; by secular humanism has been a theory of fundamentalist Christians for many years. The authors target this &quot;movement&quot; called secular humanism and claim that is a conspiracy against American (Christian) Values. I have read the humanist manifesto and have not found it to be at odds with most Christian based values at all, in fact, I believe that most of the humanist values are from Christianity. With the great diversity of ethnicity and religious views in America, we must keep a seperation of Church and State, a point lost in the paranoid ravings of this book. This book is based on a minority's narrow view of our great and diverse society with very little intellectual scholarship or factual basis. Just as Timothy McViegh was willing to kill innocent adults and children in the Oklahoma City bombing based upon an unfactually based conspiracy theory, so is Mr. LaHaye and Mr. Noebol willing push out a theory about our American Society which is based almost solely on their &quot;humanist conspiracy theory&quot;, as it has been formed by their obviously Christian Fundamentalist shaped views and certainly not on fact. People who know history know that these all Christian (or any other religion/worldview, i.e. Islam in Iran/Iraq) have not been more just or ethical than a &quot;secular&quot;, tolerant and free society (i.e., the United States). Mr. LaHaye and Mr. Noebel have ignored that &quot;Christian&quot; societies have been responsible for such intolerant acts as, for example, the Spanish Inquisition in the 15th century where people were tortured and even killed for views that violated those of the Christian Church, or the Salem (Massachussetts) Witch Trials in the mid 1600s to the early 1700s, where Christian Puritans decided, based on thier factually unsubtantiated beliefs, who was a witch and what their punishments (drowning, burning at the stake, etc.) would be unless they &quot;repented&quot; and accepted the view of the &quot;good&quot; Christian people who were punishing them. Lets not forget the horrors of Nazi Germany by a Christian society. Although this book is written well, its theory of a conspiracy of secular humanism is unfounded. I do not recommend this book for the educated and/or for those who believe in the American values which came out of the need for freedom and tolerance for a variety of differing religious and philosophical views."},{"Title":"Mind Siege - The Battle For Truth In The New Millennium","review":"Regretably, I had to give this book one star because of Amazon's rating system. As so many of the reviewers have attested, this book is nothing more than fundamentalist Christian hysteria gone mad! The only purpose this book could possibly serve is to help high school or university freshmen students taking critical thinking courses to practice detecting logical fallacies and unsupported claims. To really investigate the philosophical underpinnings of the 'satanic' humanist movement, I highly recommend Corliss Lamont's classic statement of humanism, \\"The Philosophy of Humanism....\\" Lahaye and Noebel's treatment of the relevant issues are woefully distorted and misinformation abounds between the covers of this book. It's one thing to have philosophical and religious differences, but quite another to lie and slander as done in this volume."},{"Title":"Mind Siege - The Battle For Truth In The New Millennium","review":"these reviews are funny. Looks like no middle ground, just a bunch of people wanting to prove they are right on either side with \\"yes, humanists are destroying our planet\\" and \\"no, LaHaye is a religious lunatic.\\" I just finished the book. Yes, LaHay takes the issue to the extreme. He admits that the secular humanists are a very small part of society, but then says that they control everything. I think the enormous amount of research that went into this book gives it some validity, but not absolute authority. I think many valid concerns are addressed while many are also greatly exaggerated. I think the book is a great starting point on the issue, read it and take what you want from it. Every book of this nature is biased, thats kind of the point of trying to justify and confirm one side. Read the book and make your own decisions, there is always something to be learned, despite what the far right and the far left are littering the reviews with. If you are interested in the subject of Christianity and Secular Humanism, certainly pick this one up, and perhaps seek out other books from other sides of the discussion."},{"Title":"Mind Siege - The Battle For Truth In The New Millennium","review":"I thought Tim LaHaye had many interesting points in this book. Moral relevatism is not a good philosophy to live by, as treating others the way you would like to be treated is important, no matter what part of the world, culture, or time you live in.While LaHaye explains things like, feminism, homosexuality, etc., as a decay to our society, and in part that is true. But, I would have to say he has turned a blind eye to the atrocities that religious fundamentalism and extremists have caused through out many years.I don't see secular humanists hijacking jet airliners and flying them into buildings, nor barging into a classroom full of school children and opening fire.I have yet personally to see a secular humanist do all these things, so they can get a part in their &quot;Paradise&quot;,As these Islamic Fundamentalists go out for. This is why I give this book 3 stars, while LaHaye mentions moral relevatism, breakdown of traditional values, he fails to mention the filth of religious fundamentalism which is the real threat these days. As somebody who acknowledges Jesus as the Christ and who God revealed himself to the world through, I know I have more rights and freedom here in the US, then I would in Iran, for example.There, I probably would be treated as a second class citizen at best in an islamic theocracy.But again, that is the trouble with fundamentalism, as God wants us to forgive one another, just like he did to the thieves on the cross, the roman soldiers who beat Jesus and crucified him.While interesting, Lahaye should write a book titled &quot;Mind Siege:How Fundamentalism Can Destroy Society&quot;. In part, these people scare me, and should have every right minded person concerned."},{"Title":"Mind Siege - The Battle For Truth In The New Millennium","review":"The book is basically exposing the secular humanist takeover of American society. I found it initially hard to believe in certain ways. Some of the comments made me feel more than a little alarmist -- and then I found that what I thought must be exaggeration is quoted directly from documents from the humanists. Other ideas in the book made me initially think \\"pooh-pooh\\", but then I asked myself what was really wrong with what was being proposed -- and then I wonder how much I've been brainwashed in the past by the humanists he writes about.I can't agree with the people who call the authors bigoted. There's no foundation for that accusation. When the parts that alarmed me were coming from documents the secular humanists wrote, like the Humanist Manifesto, then Tim LaHaye is not putting words into anyone's mouth. The humanists said it themselves...and you'll find it as alarming as I did.The secular humanists have convinced us that we should keep the Christian beliefs this country was founded on, locked up in the four walls of our churches so they can continue unhindered. I think the negative reviews of this book were written because they are scared we'll read the book and react."},{"Title":"Mind Siege - The Battle For Truth In The New Millennium","review":"This book exposes the secular humanist takeover of American society and describes its infiltration into nearly all areas of American culture. The book is thoroughly referenced and well organized. Some of the humanist ideas that Dr. LaHaye discusses would be hard to believe except for the fact that these ideas come directly from humanist propaganda! Other reviewers have indicated that most of the ideas in this book are overblown. This vewipoint can only be adopted if one is willing completely ignore the role that Christianity had in the founding of this country. One only needs to read the inscriptions at the Jefferson and Lincoln memorials, to read about the personal lives of the founding fathers (the real stories, not the ones presented in school textbooks which portray them as atheists), to compare the structure of our Constitution to the Old Testament books of Law to see Christianity's influence on America. Of course, the idea that Christianity was the basis of this country sounds very foreign to many members of today's society; hence the importance of this book. A primary criticism of this book is that it is an attack on tolerance and diversity, 'the very essence for which our country stands.' I agree with Dorothy Sayers' definition of the term tolerance as it is used in today's politically correct environment: 'the sin the believes in nothing, cares for nothing, seeks to know nothing, interferes with nothing, enjoys nothing, hates nothing, finds purpose in nothing, lives for nothing, and remains alive because there is nothing for which it will die.' If we continue to sit back and let humanism continue its takeover, we will quickly progress to the scenario described at the beginning of the book."},{"Title":"Mind Siege - The Battle For Truth In The New Millennium","review":"and lets hope it wakes up America. This book is right on target. As a school volunteer and as substitute teacher I see the &quot;humanistic values&quot; being shoved down our childrens throats.

While I thought it was far fetched, it's not all that far off. Tim Lahaye, author of the hilariously bad Lef Behind novel series, now envisions a future in which those bad Devil-worshipping, pot smoking, communist liberal hippie secular humanists we've read all about have conquered the world and the poor poor Christians whom we've all known to have long struggle through history(uh huh)are the oppressed minority.What's ridiculous about this novel is that the two guys who wrote it are quick to pin all the world's problems on a form of thought which has never had much influence in world governments globally. Communism is not secular humanism, nor was the athiesm of the French Revolutiuon. Hey Mr. Lahaye, last time I checked, it wasn't secular humanists who ordered the mass slaughter of supposed heretics during the Dark Ages. It wasn't secular humanists who launched a bloody Crusade in the Middle East for generations to take back Israel. It wasn't secular humanists who invaded foreign countries with smiling missionaries who's goal itwas to destroy the natives' culture and religion, subjugate them, convert them to a Western-style of dress and thought, and usurp their resources. It wasn't secular humanists who jailed a man in the backward South for simply teaching a theory to a science class. Secular humanists don't have hate mongering fat cats like Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson who smile and speak of healing the world while the reside comfortably in their million dollar estates and consorting with their Third World dictator buddies.Listen to me fundie far right christians. Seperation between Church and State is a good thing, although you hate it with all your hearts. This way, anyone can worship what they want. Organized school prayer may be illegal, but there's no reason why Bobby Sue can't have a silent communion with Jesus right before her big history exam. And Ahmad, the Muslim guy sitting next to her, has every right to go to the gym and find a comfy spot for his prayer rug. This is freedom for religion.Take a look at Europe, which is in many ways the true heart of Christianity. These where nations once dominated by the Church, but whom have slowly learned to shoulder aside Church intervention in political affairs and are becoming a more secular society. But America? America, who was founded by glutton-for-punishment puritans, still retains this primitive religious ethic. It's quite odd.What people like Lahaye really want is an American theocracy where Christians are granted special rights. Even though this is largely a secular country, Christians have had plenty of power in government, education and otherwise for the last 200 years. You guys already run the show, quit crying."},{"Title":"Mind Siege - The Battle For Truth In The New Millennium","review":"I got this book before I went to college, in that liberal age where you want to understand all that is encompassed in this reality. With a lot of open-mindedness, I made it through. Having re-read it recently as an 'upper-middleclass' taxpayer, I'm ashamed to have supported Tim LaHaye with my book purchase.The problem with the book has nothing to do with words or editing skill. It has to do with several Christian-built-ins post-Reagan. This fanatical Christian-minority really got its foothold there. People like LaHaye have stolen Christianity from the Christians. In this, LaHaye pounds home that Christians need to fight back. Mostly against love, open-ness, understanding, compassion, and other founding Christian principles. He wants us to defend the lunatic fringes view points of inequality amongst sexuality, races, genders, economic principles, social conditions...It's strange. Christianity was doing fine when it was allowed to be taken for it's good qualities. Don't lie, cheat, steal, kill, etc, it's really easy to get behind these and they bring Christianity out as a force of good. To demand people toe the line to the precise antique, perverted, interpretation of the bible is sick. Hopefully it will have LaHaye's desired effect, to end Christianity and its present influence and present corruption."},{"Title":"Mind Siege - The Battle For Truth In The New Millennium","review":"This book is eye opening. Quotes from the humanists own \\"bible\\" (Humanist Manifesto) show what they really stand for, and what they really plan to do with everything from your children's minds to your money. Authors demonstrate how even though humanists claim to be, their theories are unscientific. Exhaustive footnotes document how not only are their theories misleading, but they are just plain wrong.Divided into four parts, The Conflict, The Situation, The Truth, and The Challenge; Mind Siege clearly outlines what pro-moral people need to know and to do to take back their country. This is a call for action with the information you need to act easily accessible."},{"Title":"Mind Siege - The Battle For Truth In The New Millennium","review":"Mind Siege is a book that brings to light the constant struggle that is occuring in the world today. The struggle is the knowledge of good and evil. America has undoubtedly left behind its traditional Christian heritage and replaced it with what the author's call \\"secular humanism.\\" Instead of allowing our nation to be proud of its past and relish where we have come from, our leaders today including the leftist media and other secular forces have replaced the God of our Fathers with Darwin and Freud. This book is a great tool for all Christians and Non-Christians to use because it helps to remind us that if we will not stand up for truth, then there will be a horrible price to pay in the future. If America is to remain the \\"shining city on a hill\\" as President Reagan so eloquently said, we must make sure never to leave our founding roots. We all need to remember that a building will crumble without a solid foundation. Nations in this aspect are no different.

As a staff member for a Congressman, I see these forces working in unseen ways that the average Christian does not get the opportunity to see or flatly ignores. This book illustrates why politics is an EXCELLENT, though trying, profession for Christians and why Christians have a civic duty to be involved.Some write in saying this book is hogwash. If you are a believer and believe in absolute truth, you will read and learn. No doubt about it. You will learn why you must pray for elected officials who share your viewpoints.

If that is your reason for buying this book, then you will not be disappointed. Trying to identify a redeeming feature of this book was difficult, but I guess if the book has one, it is to alert rational citizens about the loony thought processes of many on the Religious Right. This book contains the paranoid brayings of its two willfully ignorant authors who, incredibly, blame all the world's problems on secular humanists. It is a collection of wild unsubstantiated assertions, blatantly transparent misrepresentations and terribly misunderstood science, written by two people who vigorously resist being dragged into the nineteenth century. In their simplistic black and white world of good and evil, there is no place for rational thought. More worrisome are their urgent and repeated calls for political activism. Even a cursory inspection of our current political landscape reveals that they and their ilk have already enjoyed a considerable degree of success.In short, this book is quite alarming. If you do contemplate purchasing this book, buy a used copy so as not to create any new demand. I'll reluctantly give this book one star only because I can't give it less, but that's still one star more than it deserves."},{"Title":"Mind Siege - The Battle For Truth In The New Millennium","review":"I am first and foremost a Christian. I am also an educated adult who has worked in the field of education. I have a variety of experience in the arts and have attempted to keep current on news and world affairs. Therefore, I really wasn't all that impressed by MIND SIEGE. The author's main point of the book is to illustrate to Christians how secular humanists are taking over the world. Now, some may find that assertion far fetched. However, it really isn't and I agree with it.The problem I had with MIND SIEGE wasn't the message (it's not intended for the unconverted). The problem with MIND SIEGE is that Tim LaHaye's writing really isn't that great and he uses a bunch of sources that are basically the same source. Therefore, though the book has a good message it's tangled up in bad writing and bad research. Had LaHaye done a better job at writing and researching the book, it would have been much better. Still it's a decent book to read for any Christian who really doesn't have a clue what's going on in the world and who maybe wondering how they can influence the culture. For anyone who is at least half-way knowledgeable I recommend reading ROARING LAMBS by Bill Briner or HOW SHOULD WE THEN LIVE by Francis Schafer."},{"Title":"Mind Siege - The Battle For Truth In The New Millennium","review":"anyone familiar with tim lahaye's previous works will not be surprised by this book. once again, lahaye (assisted by david noebel) makes it clear that he has a morbid fear of the modern world, as well he should, since science, tolerance, pluralism and secularism work to undermine the hellfire and damnation philosophy of christianity. lahaye identifies all the ills of modern society with the baleful affect of &quot;secular humanism&quot; and considers america to be in the midst of a civil war between religious fundamentalism and secularism. he seems to have a particular animus for philosopher paul kurtz of the council for secular humanism, the architect of &quot;humanist manifesto-2000&quot;. the principles of tolerance, reason and human autonomy delineated in this manifesto are anathema to people like lahaye, who embrace the slave morality of christianity, the religion that lahaye's southern forbears used to justify the enslavement of millions of african-americans.lahaye, in his attacks on kurtz, makes no mention of the fact that paul kurtz served with distinction as an officer in the u.s. army during WWII. lahaye, like most other religious right loudmouths (e.g. rush limbaugh, patrick buchanan, jerry falwell) never wore the uniform of his country. he and his ilk have no business criticizing patriots like paul kurtz who support the secular principles on which this great nation was founded.lahaye should read the treaty of tripoli, signed in 1798 by founding father and president, john adams, which explicitly states that &quot;the government of the united states is in no way founded on the christian religion.&quot; the usa was founded on the secular principles of the Enlightenment and it is this foundation that people like lahaye are seeking to undermine. the book &quot;mind siege&quot; is only the latest in the attempt to tarnish the secular foundation of our great country. true patriots will look upon this work with revulsion. and they have nothing to fear from the imaginary hell that lahaye consigns the vast majority of the human race for having the audacity not to be &quot;bathed in the blood of the lamb.&quot;"},{"Title":"Mind Siege - The Battle For Truth In The New Millennium","review":"This is a book so far removed from objective reality that I don't really think it could convince many people who didn't already believe its message. The book starts with a hilarious scenario about life in the very near future, where Christians have been declared insane terrorists, and all nations have joined together in a one-world government. I guess the racial, social, tribal and religious differences which have divided people since man could pick up a sharp stone have dissapeared in less than 15 years due to secular humanism... hey, wait, that doesn't sound all that bad! No more war, racism, poverty. Oops! I think LaHaye and Noebel have had the opposite effect on me!The authors write, &quot;It is no overstatement to declare that most of today's evils can be traced to secular humanism...&quot; That sentence sums up their falacious argument succinctly. I think the authors' main flaw, and the one which destabilizes so many of their arguments, is the assumption that their foe (God-hating Secular Humansts) is somehow as organized and cannonized as their group (Evangelical Christians).This distopian view of a Secular Humanist future should be read by everyone to give some sort of understanding to the religious right and their beliefs. If the religious right continues down the path of ignoring science, demonizing everyone else and devaluing any ideas outside of their narrow belief system, then the future could look bleak for them; but rather than the oppressed &quot;Christian Terrorists&quot; the authors describe in their book, fundamentalist Christians will be viewed by the majority of people the same way the Amish are viewed by fundamentalist Christians: a benign misguided curiousity, interesting to look at from the outside, but not something one would ever want to be.I give the book two stars for the belly laughs in every chapter."},{"Title":"Mind Siege - The Battle For Truth In The New Millennium","review":"I was prepared, as a Roman Catholic, to disagree with Drs. LaHaye and Noebel on many points in their examination of latter-day godlessness. And although I may still have some criticisms of some of their specific complaints, I came away quite impressed with their arguments supporting their general thesis (with which I agree): \\"Cursed is the one who trusts in man, who depends on flesh for his strength . . . [b]ut blessed is the man who trusts in the LORD, whose confidence is in him.\\"The battle for the mind is quite simple, the authors tell us: Morality and Truth (absolute super-human values) vs. Amorality and Consensus (variable, situational rules). Man has put his Creator on trial and, in many instances, banished Him. And while the authors specifically detail the battle in the U.S., the ultimate war is global.Indeed, all people who believe in the absolute moral authority of God will find in this book a message that is uncharacteristically (dare I say it?) ecumenical coming from evangelical biblical Christianity. Dr. LaHay says it best as he illustrates the importance in all people of faith in coming together for this conflict: \\"When I was assigned to a B-29 flight crew as a waist gunner, I did not ask the other ten men whether they were Catholics, Jews, or Protestants. I merely wanted to know if they could fly the plane or shoot the 50-millimeter machine guns. Later I discovered that the other waist-gunner was a Mormon, the turret gunner a Catholic, and the tail gunner a Southern Baptist. We probably never could have worked together on a religious project (in fact, we could not talk about theology without disagreement), but on one fundamental issue we were in 100 percent agreement: We were all Americans interested in preserving our country's freedom.\\" [pp. 225,26]I would have liked to see a little more dissertation on the value of spiritual evidences and the valuelessness of empirical evidences in spiritual arguments. The notes were hard to sort through given their collection at the end of the book instead of chapter, and the lack of easily distinguishable sectioning type. Still, this is a great work and a distillation of many modern writings and thoughts related to this secular v. ecclesial conflict. This book is a warning (in the best tradition of Ezekiel's watchman), a primer on the \\"theology\\" of secular humanism, a call to movement, and a strategic and tactical manual of specific, positive, Christian action. This is like the LDS (Mormon) President Hinckley's milder \\"Standing for Something\\" on holy steroids. Perhaps this book of Drs. LaHaye and Noebel could have been called \\"Fighting for Something.\\""},{"Title":"Mind Siege - The Battle For Truth In The New Millennium","review":"Tim LaHaye lays out the facts on how an ideological war is being waged against Christians in America.

Much of this book is written on a surface level - for more in-depth reading on these subjects, I'd recommend Francis Schaeffer's works, especially &quot;The God Who is There.&quot; But this book is an easy primer on these subjects.The only thing I disagree with Tim LaHaye on is the assertion that Christians have enough power left to fight the onslaught. I live in the northeast, and here, the battle has been faught and won; it's only a question of when the troops show up at our door to drag us away. I hope LaHaye is right; perhaps other parts of the country are still strong enough to resist."},{"Title":"Mind Siege - The Battle For Truth In The New Millennium","review":"There wasn't much expectation of a coherent argument, but I read it still and found the world view of the authors to be depressingly sad. The call to action by Mr. Lahaye is as bigoted as any that I have read and, as another reviewer pointed out, is on the same footing of the anti-semetic writings being used today. Humanists are to blame for every ill even though there representation miniscule compared to the Christians who have had the run of this country for the last 200 years.The real problems the authors have is that our country is a secular nation. Competing against other faiths and with the inability to use the power of government to make people, especially those in the middle and lower classes, to worship their version of god is what drives them mad. Thanks to our constitution, we have the freedom to tell the authors to take a hike and they can't stand it. What they want is to take over the government and force their views, no matter how hypocritical, down the throats of everyone regardless of their faith.Finding a group of people to blame every problem on is straight out of the tyrants playbook. Hitler would be proud. We are on the road to these American Ayatollah's vision of a theocracy in which those who dissent will be cooked in the ovens. The freedoms that we have are the very ones that they wish to curtail and makes them just as bad as the religious fanatics in the Middle East who see us as the Great Satan.The people who came and come to this country came here to escape religous persecution, which the authors seem to conviently forget. This is why our country is the greatest and envy of the world. The immorality mentioned in this book is the price of freedom. It is because the authors message of division, us vs them, and for Christians (evangelicals only) to take over the government to force morality upon a population that has rejected such hate filled messages that they will fail. We are too big and diverse a nation for us to ever be enslaved by such fanatics."},{"Title":"Mind Siege - The Battle For Truth In The New Millennium","review":"According to Tim LaHaye, there is a huge conspiracy afoot to destroy Christianity. Who is behind this conspiracy? The evil secular humanists, of course, who LaHaye sees behind every bush and around every corner. Why, they're probably reading over your shoulder right now. Boo!LaHaye's paranoid ravings fill this book. One thing that DOESN'T fill it is actualy factual information. For example, he decries evolution as being a failed theory, but doesn't provide anything to back up his claims. I suppose his intended audience won't be asking for proof anyway, but some of us actually find such things useful. The same is true of pretty much all his claims. He expects the reader to believe him and charge on Washington to prevent the evil secular humanists from taking over...."},{"Title":"Mind Siege - The Battle For Truth In The New Millennium","review":"This book is ridiculous. The basic premise is flawed. This country was founded on the idea of the separation of church and state. While many of the Founding Fathers were Christians in their private lives, they were Secular Humanists in their public lives. Secular Humanists haven't taken over this country; they are the reason this country exists, are the people who wrote our Constitution and Declaration of Independence, and are the true patriotic Americans.It is far-right fundamentalists loonies like LaHaye and his ilk who are threatening to take over the country and who want to distort its origins."},{"Title":"Mind Siege - The Battle For Truth In The New Millennium","review":"After reading this book I recognize the secularist teaching that truely is running rampant in our colleges and universities. For two years I have been hearing its influences but not recognizing them. My only wish is that I had read this book two years ago. This is a must read for Christians who fear for thier children and what they may be tought at school."},{"Title":"Mind Siege - The Battle For Truth In The New Millennium","review":"It's really easy to see why I've seen so much hostility towards this book in some of the reviews. If you're a Chirstian, espiecally if you're in college, this book is must.Most of the stuff I see in this book, rings very true as I was raised in state (more commaningly called &quot;public&quot;) schools. All the stuff about evolution being asserted as fact (which it's not, as part of this book shows) people teaching atheism as fact, and the outright hostility towards Christianity (which by the way is Biblical, some Christians don't like that) was very prevelant in my education.Futhermore, I liked his arguement that you can't disprove the existance of God. I've heard it said that since man has discovered so very littled, maybe one-millionth of a percent, it's probably more rational to believe that God exists out there somewhere. His reference to G.K. Chesterton saying that the Christian doctrine of the fall is provable scientifically, since we don't see an abundance of evidence for man's internal goodness around, should please any Catholic familiar with the thinker.In one of his appendix's he lists a long list of Scientists who where Chirstians, including the father of the scientific method -Sir Francis Bacon. In this appendix he notes that Oppenheimer, who as far as we know isn't a Christian, said that science wouldn't be where it is today had it not been for influence of not only scientist of faith, but also their guiding belief that God created a rational, orderly universe.Being a former humanist myself, I really appreicate this book. Considering it's apologetic, philosphical, historical and political nature, I think this book is very, VERY important for those in college where it's very unfavorable (at least in my experience) to be a Christian. If you're a humanist skeptic, you'll hate this book, but I challenge you with this: If there is no God, then you don't have to be afriad of the Bible; read the book of Ecclesiastes and refute it with your own wisdom and philosophy.&quot;Take heed, senseless ones among the people, you fools become wise? Does he who implanted the ear not hear? Does he formed the eye not see? Does he who disciplines nations not punish? Does he who teaches man lack knowledge? The Lord know the thoughts of man; he knows that they are futile. Blessed is the man you discipline, O lord, the man you teac from your law; you grant him relief from the days of trouble, till a pit is dug for the wicked.&quot;Psalm 94:8-12"},{"Title":"Mind Siege - The Battle For Truth In The New Millennium","review":"I never read anything by LaHay and Noebel, what initially intrigued me was the cover and the title, which somehow sounded inspired. When I began to read this book, well I felt I had been misled.I was raised in a catholic family with very profound catholic beliefs and traditions. My stance against abortion is adamantly against its execution for instance, and I make the respect of life and of others my top priority.In my modest opinion these guys would have had a ball back in ancient Greece, sweet-talking their extremist views to Socrates or maybe Plato, but in this day and age...mankind has had enough of these extremist views. At least that was what I thought before reading this book.Personally I believe that repression and intolerance will only lead to more repression and intolerance. Fighting fire with fire will only burn everything up in the end. I just wonder what Christ would have said had he gone through this book himself. I mean he was the one who said &quot;Love thy enemy as thyself&quot; and who never refused a sinner who was willing to change his or her ways.The real problem lies not in practicing or not practicing religion (that is a choice and a walk of life), but in society waking up to the permissive and often too-relaxed attitude when faced with major issues that have taunted and are still taunting society.Where I live there is a saying which goes something like this, &quot;Help yourself and God will Help you!&quot;. I think it could not have been said any better. What society, the world over requires, is a return to values; tolerance towards the ignorant or the unweary, compassion for the ailments of others, respect of other people's views, willingness to teach those who want to be taught and to learn to really forgive &quot;...those who trespass against us&quot;.In conclusion, I hope for everyone's sake that LaHaye's hypothetical future-vision does not come to pass. Mankind must learn to come to grips with itself, finding time to listen to its own collective conscience and to the signs from above that stand as signposts in this chaotic era."},{"Title":"Mind Siege - The Battle For Truth In The New Millennium","review":"In this book Tim LaHaye and his associate, David Noebel, have produced the religious right's American Mein Kampf. If one would substitute the word \\"Jew\\" in this book for the the word \\"humanist\\" it would be identical to Hitler's vicious hatred of the of the Jews as written in Mein Kampf.

I have grandchildren who are being taught that they were made from \\"stardust\\". That God is not a diety and that they need to accept every crack-pot idea that is before them so as not to disrespect anyone. Tim Lahaye, tells us what is actually the truth about what is going on today. Apathy within the peope of this world is the cause of how this world has gone from fairly clean living to accepting trash. The author alerts the reader to the subtle ways of the \\"humanist\\" and how they are creeping ever so slowly \\"but surely\\" into the lives of every American in the world. To not get involved simply allows humanist to spread their propaganda throughout the world. Acceptance of free sex, lewdness, pornography, gay rights, etc., etc., has brought us to the world we now know and it is out of control.

I'm glad I read it."},{"Title":"Mind Siege - The Battle For Truth In The New Millennium","review":"Mind Siege is not a book for those simply looking for a relaxing afternoon read. It will challenge each reader in some way. Reactions will be as varied as those in the other reviews on this book. The subject itself does not allow a non-reaction from the reader. Be prepared to experience challenges to any preconceived notions you may have to the very real struggle now underway between the religion of Secular Humanism and Christianity.La Haye and Noebel provide detailed, although sometimes repetitive, insight in the battle for the mind occurring in today's society. If you've wondered where Secular Humanism and Christianity diverge, this book will tell you.While I found myself in nearly perfect alignment with the conclusions reached by the authors, I was challenged in two areas.One area concerns the fact that the authors do not discuss the ultimate source of the struggle. While a conflict of life systems exists between followers of Jesus Christ and those who promote and follow the tenents of SH, it is simply a visible revelation of the bigger revolt of Satan against the one God of the universe. To leave the struggle at the level of human vs. human means Christian combatants may forget to love the person while working against the philosophy. It would have been a better book for me if the authors had included that level of discussion.Secondly, the authors challenge Christians to align with other moralist groups in an effort to combat the moral malaise championed by SH. While the concept appears basically sound, it does not find the same biblical support as most of the other arguments the authors present. In fact, the examples we do find, particularly in the Old Testament, of alliances made with others against a common enemy are almost always disasters. Perhaps the results suggested by the authors in the proposed moralist alliances would be better achieved simply by ensuring those who acknowledge Jesus Christ as Lord truly rely on Him to make the most of their efforts and to help them refrain from inhibiting the efforts of other moralists when those efforts are not in direct conflict with basic Christian tenents.Again, an excellent, challenging book for those seriously concerned about the apparent moral collapse of today's world."},{"Title":"Mind Siege - The Battle For Truth In The New Millennium","review":"It would be hard to imagine a more incredibly absurd historical position than that found in one reviewer's assertion that Secular Humanists founded this country. Secular Humanism did not even exist in 1789 and it is frankly insulting to our great Founding Fathers, and to anyone with a modicum of historical intelligence, to pin that philosophy on the founders of the United States. Whatever else they were, they were not Secular Humanists. Thomas Jefferson was not a Christian certainly, but he did argue that men were inherently free of all but moral law, a law given by God. Men who try to free themselves from moral law would eventually become slaves, first to their own passions, then to tyrannical gov't when they no longer can govern themselves. Democracy requires personal self-government, a virtuous citizenship, based upon the laws of God. \\"Our Constitution was made only for a moral and religious people. It is wholly inadequate for the government of any other.\\" So said John Adams, 2nd President of the United States. THAT is what our Founders believed, and it is the exact antithesis of Secular Humanism. (Incidentally, the Constitution of the United States, as it was initially written and ratified, did not forbid states from having state-supported churches--which several did well into the 1800s. Thus, modern interpretations of \\"separation of church and state\\" are also not what the Founders had in mind.)Modern secularism, which arose out of 19th century utopian, naturalistic theories, has largely undermined the kind of country our Founders envisioned--morally AND politcally. A moral people do not need much government--they govern themselves. Hence, the limited government established by the Founders. An increasingly immoral populace needs larger government control; \\"if men are not governed by God, then they must be governed by tyrants\\" (William Penn). Christians would like to have, at least morally, a return to the vision of the Founders. Then gov't could be scaled back as well. So there IS a direct corollary between the Christian right and limited government conservatism (conservatives who want a return to limited government without a concomitant return to Christian morality are whistling in the dark; it simply can't be done. Limited government demands a moral people, and man has never been able, and never will be able, to agree upon a naturalistic ethic.) But LaHaye's book is not the way to accomplish this return. Frankly, he's probably preaching only to the choir anyway. If you do not believe in Christianity, then don't waste your time with this book; it will not convince you to become one (unless you are of limited intelligence and easily scared out of your wits, and I don't mean to be insulting). On top of that, LaHaye's \\"Christianity\\" is not even Biblical. The premillennial views of much of \\"Christendom,\\" which LaHaye represents, is not what the Bible teaches. Yes, Christians have every right to oppose homosexuality, the abortion of unborn babies, and destructive feminist theories. To label Christians as racist, anti-women, anti-science, \\"homo haters,\\" etc. is simply left-wing \\"feel-good-ism,\\" an attempt to gain the moral high ground, which the left can never do, except in its own eyes. They are a walking evidence of the God they despise--they have a conscience and they try to salve it with their politically correct utopianism. The true hatred in this country is from the left, though they certainly don't have a monopoly on it. Conservatives are hated because their view of the nature of man does not allow the left to socially engineer society, through government (or terror and murder in the case of non-representative based secular governments) they way they wish to do. Christianity is hated because of its opposition to immorality, especially the sexual revolution and its consequences. But this isn't surprising. Jesus wasn't crucified because of the love He preached; He was crucified because He demanded men repent of sin. And modern man has no more desire to do that than 1st century man, thus any Christian insisting upon a change of man's ways can expect to be hated just as the Founder of the religion was. LaHaye will be mocked for non-politically correct views; that's to be expected. The \\"politically correct\\" shouldn't even be reading the book because it isn't for them. He would do well, however, to make sure his theology is correct for there is the area in which he is truly leading others astray.One final thought--there is SOME historical basis for the \\"future vision\\" LaHaye portrays in this book. The Terror of both the French Revolution and Bolshevism massacred many, many believers in God. Atheism in power has never been kind to religion. To believe that it could never happen in America is naivete of the worst sort because secularism demands the destruction of religion in order to create the utopia IT wants to create--the two visions are simply diametrically antithetical and if secularism must destroy the religious to produce its heaven on earth, then so what? The believers are all going to die some day anyway (as Stalin said of the peasants he murdered by the millions). The left will never be convinced of that, of course, and it's not going to happen in the next 10-15 years, either. But to say it cannot happen in America only betrays an ignorance of history akin to the notion that our Founding Fathers were secular humanists."},{"Title":"Mind Siege - The Battle For Truth In The New Millennium","review":"It's sad that the majority of reviews about this book have come from atheistic, secular humanists. The defensive attitude and ludicrous reviews from these people only enforce the fact that Secular Humanism is alive and well in this country.

I thoroughly enjoyed reading this from the perspective of light entertainment. Unlike Tim who, according to his beliefs in music lyrics, believes that whatever someone encounters (reads, hears) will ultimately become part of their philosophy - I fully read his work, and disagree with his hardline stance.

He does make valid points about secular humanism (I was surprised to learn that it holds the same tax exempt status as do mainline Christian churches) and moral relativism in American culture. However, his valid points drown in a sea of seemingly mindless Christian rhetoric.Mr. LaHaye, take note of how Jesus Christ preached to the masses.

Tim LaHaye has labelled me as the root of all of evil, which is sad coming from an author who breaks the commandment to not bear false witness more times than I can count in this book, and who will rake in a cool profit for himself out of promoting slander and lies at my expense. Now THAT's &quot;amoral.&quot;"},{"Title":"Mind Siege - The Battle For Truth In The New Millennium","review":"It seems like many reviews here are from misguided enthusiasts or bitter dissenters [who often are speaking out of bad experiences with organized religion]. Shrill is shrill, whether you love it or hate it.I am writing as one who would be characterized as an evangelical Christian and yet has significant problems with this book. First of all, its descriptive categories are woefully inadequate. While there might be a small number of card-carrying 'secular humanists', the term for the most part is an astounding oversimplication of multiple ideas and activities coming from diverse sources. Secular humanism is a categorical strawman that lost its currency, if it ever had any, decades ago.Another enormous problem with this book is its idea of Christian America. While history does reflect a Christian presence in this country [though in multiple theological / experiential forms], the idea of a monolithic Christian America just isn't true. Not only does this ignore the religious beliefs and practices of Native Americans, but also the presence of other religious beliefs [minority though they were]. It also downplays the substantial influence of the Enlightenment on the 'founding fathers.' It ignores the many other reasons people came to this country, and the fact that they were loosely assembled groups with different beliefs and governments until the Revolution. As a Christian, I am so weary of hearing this 'return to the glory days' schtick. Those glory days were as corrupt and complex as our own day.The most serious problem I have with the book, which is also why I think there is so much emphasis on America as a Christian nation, is the conflation of nation and church. Don't confuse them. Christians should be the church: proclaiming the gospel, participating in worship and sacraments, taking care of the widows and orphans. Lahaye's view of the end times, fleshed out in the 'Left Behind' series, is the dominant view in the Christian subculture, but one that is a particularly American phenomenon [Read Mark Noll's Scandal of the Evangelical Mind].One fianl comment: Christians who politicize and nationalize their faith ultimately marginalize their faith, reducing the body of Christ to a special interest group. Talk about a mind siege."},{"Title":"Mind Siege - The Battle For Truth In The New Millennium","review":"In this day and age far too many people call themselves Christians, they go to church, they sing their hymns, they put money into the offering plates. They may go to the Sunday school classes, they may shake hands, they may even say &quot;I strive to live the Sermon on the Mount&quot;.Yet how many Christians it seems truly knows what Christianity is up against in this day and age? How many Christian fathers and mothers know about the secularism being taught in schools, about the political correct Nazis spout out by groups like NOW and people like Al Gore, about teachers telling our kids its all right to do this or that &quot;because we're all just evolved animals anyway.&quot;Tim LaHaye, like Josh McDowell and several others, has hit the nail on the head with this book. In section by section, he takes on full force the problems facing the decline in American values. So many liberals have tried to take Christianity out of the Founding Fathers, so many liberals have tried to say it's ok to kill babies by calling it &quot;a woman's choice to have an abortion&quot; (since...again, we're all just &quot;evolved animals&quot;). So many have tried to make the guilty free and the innocent blamed/or forgotten in our court systems (O.J. Simpson comes to mind).It's got to stop.As this book shows, when we enter into our jobs and our kids enter the schools, it's not just another day, it's another spiritual skirmish between God and Satan. As an educator myself, I have seen the PC groups and humanism in action. It's ok to teach Hinduism and paganism in the classrooms, it's all right to give our children condoms (when we really should be giving them common sense), but these &quot;tolerant hounds&quot; have a hiss attack if one tries to bring moral values into the school buildings, office buildings, and courts.Of course, this book is Not about several things. This book is Not about hurting groups such as homosexuals. This book is Not about bombing abortion clinics. This book is Not about forcing people to become Christian. Such things were Never taught in the Bible, though sadly some people have made their own doctrines of evil under the title of Christianity--and even worse, the liberal media has clumped truth loving Christians with violent monglers and false prophets.Thankfully, Tim LaHaye puts the proof on the table for Christianity for all to see, in this book. With fearlessness and love toward all sinners, the Bible truths are spoken.Tim LaHaye's book should be read with a complete understanding that Christianity is not just a &quot;feeling good about oneself on Sunday&quot; idea...it's standing up with a total and honest conviction that the Bible is indeed right and that the world and the world's prince is wrong. The Christian community should of course always love the sinner and hate the sin, but should also be willing to speak out about what the Bible specifically says is right and wrong... that is what Tim LaHaye does with this book. He takes the sword of truth and successfully combats the lies of humanism, secularism, evolution, and paganism. He also invites every firm Christian believer to do the same, to help bring people out of the darkness and into the grace giving light of Christ...the Truth, the Whole Truth, and Nothing but the Truth.I would also suggest the wonderful books by Dr. James Kennedy such as &quot;Why I Believe&quot; and &quot;What if Jesus had Never Been Born&quot;."},{"Title":"Mind Siege - The Battle For Truth In The New Millennium","review":"It seems that the people who gave this book a negative review are anti-Christian or Humanist (many admittedly) and therefore have an existing world-view that distorts their thinking on this topic.The issues raised by LaHaye are thought-provoking and should be a concern to every citizen."},{"Title":"Mind Siege - The Battle For Truth In The New Millennium","review":"This book is an outstanding survey of today's culture and how it arrived. Not only does it serve as a biblical looking-glass for today's American society, but it also serves as a history lesson of Secular Humanism and its rise to dominance in the 20th Century.Those of us who study the Bible know that one of the overriding themes is that Man, by nature, will almost always pridefully reject God and claim that he (Man) is self-sufficient. The Babylonians built a tower and said, &quot;We will be like God.&quot; Lucifer's fall was a result of the same pride. The Bible says that the lost &quot;call evil good, and good evil.&quot; Isn't that apparent in America today when hunting an animal for food is deemed evil while killing an unborn child is considered good?One of the biggest Humanist beliefs is that &quot;there is no absolute right and wrong.&quot; If that were the case, then there would be no reason to abstain from ANY acitivity (including rape, murder, and -- gasp! -- INTOLERANCE!) Of course, it is arguable what exactly is right and what exactly is wrong. But no one can successfully argue that no right and wrong exists. Imagine the chaos that would ensue (and that surely will ensue before this century is over!)I'm not sure if and how this ridiculous tide can be reversed, but I know that I will go to great lengths to make sure my children are raised to know the Truth.I highly recommend this bood for anyone who needs a wake-up call!"},{"Title":"Mind Siege - The Battle For Truth In The New Millennium","review":"This is one book that you will read from cover to cover and say when finished, &#34;My God !

For too long, believers have kept their beliefs in the church rather than out in the world. The book calls for us to adopt a Christian worldview as well as become involved in our communities.The book is generally divided into three parts. The first part is a hypothetical case showing us where America is heading. The father in this case is talking with his son about school. Although the case seems far-fetched, many of the things mentioned have already happened, or are just a few steps away from happening.The next part is about how America is getting to the point illustrated in the case. Primarily, it is through the inactivity of Christians politically to confront secular humanism that we have let these things happen, which leads to the third part, the authors' call to action.Although I found a few logical fallacies in the argument, the overall argument is true.

It also quotes the Humanist Magazine, the &quot;official organ&quot; of the movement. The last time I checked, the magazine's circulation was so tiny as to be embarrassing. How many Card Carrying Secular Humanist have you met? So, how can Humanists have such power? They don't--they have little influence, and with the evangelical revival underway in the U.S., their influence here is in steep decline. So, like Jews of old, who better to blame for the World's ills? Who knows them? Who would miss them? To the camps!The book is a paean to ignorance and lack of research. In two sections, Mr. LaHaye states that the Humanists control The Netherlands and Sweden, and have brought morality to these nations to horrific lows. But facts prove otherwise. While it is true nearly one in four Dutch are Atheist, a recent Reader's Digest experiment also showed them MORE honest than their US counterparts. Moreover, both the Netherlands and Sweden are considered less corrupt than the U.S., according to Transparency International. The lightest research would also have shown Mr. LaHaye that 90 percent, or more, of all Swedes belong to Lutheran Church of Sweden (we guess they are all Fifth Column Humanists). Mr. LaHaye wouldn't know this, of course: his endnotes are thick with old secondary sources or Evangelical Christian tracts, not original material.There are many cultural problems in the U.S that Mr. LaHaye lays at the feet of &quot;secular humanists.&quot; However, if Mr. LaHaye had done any real research, he would have seen &quot;secular humanists&quot; decrying the very same problems. Steve Allen, signatory to the Humanist Manifesto, fought vocally against television's &quot;moral sewer.&quot; Journals associated with skepticism and Humanism denounce notions like feminist science, New Age religions, and other nonsense. Yet, Mr. LaHaye sees these people not as compatriots, but as evil incarnate.This book is inflammatory and dangerous. Mr. LaHaye states that &quot;secular humanists&quot; are traitors to the U.S. and must not be permitted in government. He calls for the seizure of the government by Christians (peacefully), and for the nation to pass laws based upon evangelical Christian viewpoints. He seems to be unable separate law of God and man, and wants his version of the eternal truths made law on Earth. Works well in Afghanistan!Mr. LaHaye's book is well organized and his writing style, while a vision of ignorance, is easy and clean. However, he incessantly modifies quotes with his own material that some readers will mistake as being in the original. The book contains no photos, graphs, charts, or historical data to bolster the authors contention we're heading for Gomorrah. As noted, the endnotes indicate a lazy research regime; they also would have better served the reader if they were put at the end of each chapter. But the editor apparently didn't think the reader was serious: he left the index out entirely!Mr. LaHaye urges the reader to buy more copies of the book to share with friends and relatives. In this reviewer's opinion, if you get this book, promptly dispose of it!"},{"Title":"Besame Mucho (Bruno Gmunder Postcardbooks)","review":"Another of the Bruno Gmunder postcard books. This one presents a selection of images from the Usabiaga book of the same name.The B&amp;W images are absolutely thrilling to look at. The boys are sultry, sexy, and so in touch with the photographer. Their happiness, thoughtfulness, or sheer sexiness leap from every page.The pictures are printed on good quality card, ready to send throught the post to your friends, or perhaps to tear-out and frame.Worth the low purchase cost."},{"Title":"Bloodlust II: The Taming of Serge Dumont (Erotic Vampire)","review":"Marilyn Lee is excellent at bringing very hot erotic stories with good plots to life. The first part of this series, Bloodlust I, is one of my favorite eroticas of all time. Unfortunately, Bloodlust II did not live up to its predecessor. I was very much looking forward to Serge's story after Bloodlust I, which is the story of Mikhel, Serge's older brother, but the heroine, Derri absolutely ruined it. The hero (Serge) and the sex (which there is a lot of and in many interesting ways) are five stars all the way....Derri, on the other hand, is about a negative 3 stars.Before anyone says thinks that my dislike/distate of Derri is because Derri is black and Serge is white, let me put that to rest...I could care less what color anyone in the story was but the fact that Derri herself was hung up on the race issue and refused to treat Serge as anything more than a quick romp in the hay and wouldn't believe his continued declarations of love JUST because he was white and she was determined to fall in love and marry only a black man even though she was attracted to white men and Serge and his brother Mikhel in particular became very annoying after about the 3rd or 4th repetition of this theme. Added to the fact that Derri came off as emotionally crippled and stunted AND whined about everything that didn't fit in her narrow view of the world irritated me beyond belief.As a continuation of the Bloodlust storyline, you have to read this book. If you haven't read Bloodlust I (which is part of the Things That Go Bump in the Night anthology), get it and read it first. The whole anthology is great and a great introduction to all of the authors in it and Bloodlust I is basically a must read before you read this book or Bloodlust III."},{"Title":"Bloodlust II: The Taming of Serge Dumont (Erotic Vampire)","review":"I am with the reader from Concord on this one: (I'm just glad I'm not the only one [peeved] about the lead female character.) This could have been a great story if Derri hadn't been such an irritating, smart mouth, pain in the [behind]. I am a fan of ML but I don't know what she was thinking, when she decided to turn Derri into such a headache. I never felt like she really love Serge, even by the end of the story, the love was all one sided to me. She was more than ready and willing to go find her lost love {The one she really wanted to marry} and apologize, but she never thought for a second to go and find Serge and apologize for all the wrong she'd done to him. He was the one that had to go to her and basically beg her to take him back... Honestly I felt like Derri didn't deserve Serge. One would expect this type of behavior from a secondary character but not from a lead.Derri was 1st introduced in The Talisman. The story of Cassy {best friend to Derri} and Chandler was a very good read. I gave it 4 stars. Cassy was a leading female character that was very likable.While some of the story was actually very good {and the sex scenes made me wanna jump into my computer screen} I gave it 2 stars because the lead character left much to desired and being a black woman myself, I was not proud of her."},{"Title":"Bloodlust II: The Taming of Serge Dumont (Erotic Vampire)","review":"I enjoyed the world Marilyn Lee has created of hot lusty vampires. Serge Dumount is head over heels in love w/ Derri Morgan, whom happens to be such a pain in the ass.I really hated the way she would berate Serge as I was reading this. I think Marilyn Lee wanted conflict between the two-the classic story of one falling for the other while the other falls in love....eventually. I think you could have conflict and tension w/o the heroine being so annoying.I enjoyed her previous book, The Talisman, very much. Derri's friend Cassy is a very likeable character, who wasn't wimpy, but didn't have to be nasty in order to be strong and determined.I still enjoyed this book, I would love to see her do a story on the sexy bi-racial vampire, Alex. It would be wonderful to read about him in bloodlust!"},{"Title":"Bloodlust II: The Taming of Serge Dumont (Erotic Vampire)","review":"Derri Morgan is a high powered attorney in Philadelphia. On a whim she goes to see a fortuneteller, and meets a man she is very attracted to physically. However she believes him to be much younger than she is, and so she refuses to give him a chance.Since she is about to take on a major case for her law firm, her boss wants to send her away for some rest and relaxation. For that reason, she travels to the Pocono Mountains for a few days stay at The Retreat, a cabin owned by her boss. Since she is a single female, he employs a security firm to keep an eye on her. By sheer coincidence, one of the members of that security team is the young man she is so attracted to. Serge Dumont is a vampire who turns out to be older than she is. Serge believes Derri is his bloodlust, but has a hard time convincing her. However, once he finally gets her in bed, she can no longer resist his appeal.The problem with the relationship is that Serge is about to go through a &quot;sickness&quot; caused by the fact that his bloodlust is not vampire, but human. During this time, he remembers nothing of what he has done, but he becomes someone Derri does not know and fears. At the same time, his brother is also going through this period of sickness, known as the Feast of Indulgence.There is a lot of story line for Erica Kalai and Mikhel Dumont, Serge's brother, who obviously were the main characters in a previous book. The characters were not into monogamy, and this book deserves its NC-17 rating. I gave the book a 3.5 rating simply because of my own personal feelings about love and what constitutes cheating."},{"Title":"Bloodlust II: The Taming of Serge Dumont (Erotic Vampire)","review":"Marilyn Lee gives us a whole new hot sizzling breed of vampires. The hero's are wonderful, romantic and handsome men willing to die for their women and family. The intimate scenes are VERY hot. Pull up a comfy chair, a glass of water and be prepared for one of the hotest erotic stories you've ever read. The Bloodlust Series are stories you CAN NOT miss."},{"Title":"Bloodlust II: The Taming of Serge Dumont (Erotic Vampire)","review":"If you like Omega-Males then this is the book for you. The hero (Serge)is a wimp and the heroine (Derri) doesn't have to try hard to wrap him around her finger. By the end of the story Derri has got Serge so under her thumb that she's choosing his underwear!As for the &quot;steamy&quot; love scenes don't hold your breath for maraton sessions. Serge is quick off the mark, not once but TWICE. I give this story 3 stars because it's very funny and well written. But if you like Alpha-Males then opt for Jaid Black, Susan Johnson, Christine Feehan, Dara Joy. It's a shame because Marilyn Lee can write, but this guy just didn't do it for me. A strong woman like Derri needed an equally strong man."},{"Title":"Bloodlust II: The Taming of Serge Dumont (Erotic Vampire)","review":"I found Derri to be a refreshing change from the usual female leads who fall for a man and then proceed to let the man take complete control of her life. Derri Morgan was a strong woman who fell in love, but still retained a strong sense of herself. It was interesting to see a vampire male brought to his knees and so in love with a woman who knew what she wanted in life and set out to get it.And the love scenes between Derri and Serge are some of the hottest you will ever read. The scene where he enters her dreams and she blows him is so hot! And the bathroom scene where they make love with Alex is the house is to die for.If you like wimpy women who go to pieces when they fall in love, you probably won't like Derri. If you like your female leads with some backbone, who can fall head over heads in love and still be strong, you'll like Derri.If you like vamps and steamy love scenes and discovering a centuries old secret, check out this book. And I too want to read about the sexy, blue-eyed, cinnamon skinned vamp Alex. Wow! What a hunk!"},{"Title":"Bloodlust II: The Taming of Serge Dumont (Erotic Vampire)","review":"This book sizzled. After reading Bloodlust from Things That Go Bump In The Night, I could hardly wait for this sequel. And I was not disappointed.Serge is the hottest, sexiest, hunkiest vampire I've ever read. He made me drool and sweat. And the vampire culture this author is building is so intriquing. Imagine a world peopled with sexy vampires looking for their perfect mates and not adverse to a little \\"brotherly\\" love on the side. Vampire brothers Serge and Mikhel are gorgeous,sexy, and always ready to \\"take care of business.\\"If you like vampires...if you like erotica...if you want a hot read that will leave you panting for the next book in this exciting new erotic vampire series, don't pass on this one."},{"Title":"Bloodlust II: The Taming of Serge Dumont (Erotic Vampire)","review":"WOW! That's what I thought we I read the first love scene in this book. This book is something else. It's a vampire romance. It's an erotic romance. It's an interracial romance. There's even elements of suspence in this book.This book is not for everyone because the love scenes are frequent and some of the hottest I've ever read. There's a scene in the woods where the vampire hero and the heroine make love in the woods that nearly made me want to melt.There's also a \\"dream\\" love scene that is too hot for words.Now that I've discovered this book, I have to go back and read the first book in the series and then go on to read the next book.If you like vampire and eroticsm, you won't want to miss this book."},{"Title":"On native grounds: An interpretation of modern American prose literature","review":"This is an excellent review of the literature of the late 19th century up until the first third or so of the 20th. It is written with the purpose of finding a higher meaning to the changes undergoing literature during this time period, and Kazin does a remarkable job of keeping this long book interesting. The book helped me understand how many of my favorite authors fit into the 'grand scheme of literature' as well as how authors and individual books fit into political and social history. It was also useful for discovering new authors that I may like to read someday. I would recommend this book to anyone with a serious interest in literature."},{"Title":"On native grounds: An interpretation of modern American prose literature","review":"Alfred Kazin was by any reasonable measure one of America's greatest critics and men of letters, a reader who read first of all as a human being full of questions, passions, and--alas, overworked noun--heart. This is the astounding apprenticeship piece by the 27 year old Kazin. Does it have weaknesses? Surely. Young Kazin was blazing trails, as well as sharpening his tools, making way for future works of the journeyman. But it also sets a standard that those of us, like myself, who are nearly twice the age of the then young author, could scarcely live up to.Judged from a mature perspective, four stars. Judged as a work of youth, more than five.Young critics scholars, read and weep--and, of course, learn."},{"Title":"On native grounds: An interpretation of modern American prose literature","review":"Kazin or Edmund Wilson, take your pick for the most penetrating 20th century American literary critic. 'On Native Grounds', Kazin's magnum, is especially good on American realism. Kazin is an engaging raconteur, fills in the common lacunae, and has a capacious thumbnail - very useful for the University level student, essential for grad and post grad work in american lit."},{"Title":"On native grounds: An interpretation of modern American prose literature","review":"Alfred Kazin was one of the great literary critics of his generation. 'On Native Grounds' a study of late nineteenth- century and early twentieth century American Literature is his most well- known critical work. It opens with a masterful consideration of the dilemnas of the Dean of American Literature of the time, the great champion of Realism, William Dean Howells. It shows how Howells became despite his great eminence increasingly isolated in a world in which Naturalism and even young Realists seemed to go their way without him. Kazin displays a vast reading in this work but wears this quite easily. The book is a highly readable one. There are those who say that he despite his efforts came close to producing a work of criticism on this level of originality again. And this when his autobiographical writings have a unique literary value and strength of their own, arguably even beyond the critical ones."},{"Title":"On native grounds: An interpretation of modern American prose literature","review":"Kazin in his 1942 assessment of Faulkner's writing as &quot;incoherent and ungrammatical&quot; is completely without merit. Any literary scholar with a basic understanding of linguistics can see the importance of Faulkner's writing not only as a genre, but as a launching pad to further understanding of his complex and cherished characters."},{"Title":"Lean Six Sigma Statistics","review":"This book is a must reference for any Black Belt or Master Black Belt involved in transactional projects.

Buy it, you will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"REMEMBER RUBEN (African Writers Series)","review":"This book starts out somewhat at a tangent. The interlocutor,Mor-Zamba, appears as a refugee from another clan as a small boy, and he meets with both African hospitality and foreigner rejection in equal measure. He is teased and rough-handled by the local boys, and celebrated for upholding the honor of his adopted village by winning a wrestling contest which pitted &quot;his&quot; village with another. But he recieves little gratitude from the villagers afterwards as he proceeds to build a house for himself. Only Abena, whose family has welcomed him and who will remain his livelong friend gives him a hand. And to cap it all, he is sent away as an indentured servant ( a colonial kind of slavery) to work for the colonials as a prisoner. His crime: the colonial authorities need laborers and the local chief has to provide them. The local stranger with no family roots in the village is the obvious victim. But Mor-Zamba endures prison life, and his friend Abena also leaves the village and takes up degrading work with a European priest to be near his friend. But that is not all... This time Cameroon is on the verge of political independence, and the trade union leader, Ruben (Um Nyobe) and his PPP (UPC) party are asking for the type of indenpendence the French authorities are unwilling to give their colony. The french will go very far, supporting a more ammenable Baba Toura (Ahmadou Ahidjo) and will engage in covert assasination of local leaders opposed to their choice. And so Baba Toura's opponents are killed by a ruthless gang of french-backed mercenaries. Ruben (um Nyobe) becomes the first matyr and his followers resort to guerrilla tactics--les maquisards. Meanwhile, Abena returns from a long war effort for France that had taken him from Europe to Indo-China. His return is a boost for the Rubenists, but it also heralds a new destiny for Mor-Zamba, who has to return to the village and reclaim the chief's stool that had been usurped by his erstwhile nemesis.This books shows the daily picture of a period in time, the birth of political emancipation in a former french colony (or trust territory in this case), and throws some light on post-colonials political developments in Cameroon.Reviewer's Note: Ahidjo eventually quashed all opposition, formed a one-party dictatorship, and ruled for 22 years."},{"Title":"The Science of Electronics: Analog Devices","review":"I like building circuits and playing with electronics. It is one thing to build a circuit board from scratch and solder all the pieces into place and quite another to understand WHY it works.I therefore recommend this book if you want to know WHY.I found it concise, easy to understand, and well presented. A very organized book which starts from first principles and introduces diodes, then BJT and FET and then Diff amps which is a natural segue into op amps and active filters.Plenty of worked examples and exercises to test your knowledge.Highschool math prerequisite.A very practical introductory book the hobbyist such as myself can understand and appreciate.Expensive which is why I gave it 4 stars."},{"Title":"The Science of Electronics: Analog Devices","review":"This product did not completely meet my expectations due to the fact that I was expecting a hard copy, but I guess it was my fault for not reading if its written somewhere that it is a soft copy.

In my case it was the eighth edition, published in 1982 and republished in 1986. CAPT Noel's versions of the \\"Watch Officer's Guide\\" and the \\"Bluejacket's Guide\\" were also instrumental to me in my Navy career, as they surely have been to generations of sailors.Now that I have retired from naval service and have done a few things since, I have had the chance to re-evaluate this book and would like to mention some things about it that I have found to be of value.This remains one of the best books about the art and science of naval leadership I have ever read. This includes literary works by Melville, Conrad, and others, as well as film and Television episodes such as \\"The Caine Mutiny\\" (which we also watched) and a variety of Star Trek \\"The Next Generation\\" episodes, which deal in naval leadership themes with a surprising degree of detail and nuance.The lessons of naval leadership that CAPT Noel imparts in this book are timeless and increasingly relevant. The three core elements of leadership he mentions on page 4 of the book remain fundamental: personal example, effective management, and moral responsibility. In stressing the importance of the human element of leadership, CAPT Noel would probably be considered old fashioned in today's technology infatuated military. A word to contemporary military strategists now embracing anthropology and other \\"soft\\" techniques about CAPT Noel's definition of \\"moral responsibility:\\"\\"The difference between Hitler and Churchill was not only their methods but in their motives. Irresponsible leadership threatens, bluffs, deceives, and oppresses; morally responsible leadership guides firmly and honestly, with every possible regard for human dignity\\" (p. 5).The U.S. Navy (and the other service branches), as well as business and industry, would do well to adopt the honorable and learned counsel he imparts here."},{"Title":"You Can Be a Great Parent!","review":"I read the original Promises to Peter 25 years ago and just recently that it has been the foundation for my parenting all these years.

Sweet Thursday the sequel is not as good but solid nonetheless. Sweet Thursday is not as episodic as Cannery Rom and it is more philosophical and a stronger romance element but this is not always good the romance and philosophy sometimes dont work. INparticular the romance seems forced. The novel maintains a lot of the humor of Cannery Row and one doesnt need to read Cannery Row to enjoy Sweet Thursday though it would not hurt to do so"},{"Title":"Sweet Thursday","review":"A nice follow up to the infamous Cannery Row.

Like &quot;Cannery Row&quot;, I found it to be pretty light hearted, although it did tackle some more serious issues at times.

Overall, i would recomend this to everyone, especially those who really enjoyed &quot;Cannery Row&quot;, for this is a worthy sequal."},{"Title":"Sweet Thursday","review":"&quot;Sweet Thursday&quot; is, without a doubt, my personal favorite Steinbeck novel.Assuredly, he wrote better books -- ones, such as &quot;Cannery Row,&quot; for example (and for which this volume serves as a sequel), which were arguably far more profound and which today remain far more prominent in the public mind as examples of Steinbeck's craft -- yet I don't believe that he ever wrote anything with more insight, not mention love and dedication, than &quot;Sweet Thursday.&quot;&quot;Sweet Thursday&quot; is, simply put, a 'love letter;' Steinbeck's love -- for the characters (and the real-life people who inspired those characters), as well as his love for the simple craft of writing -- shines forth in every page. Written approximately fifteen years after its &quot;prequel,&quot; &quot;Sweet Thursday&quot; also serves to document Steinbeck's growth as a writer (he'd significantly narrowed the gap in those intervening years between what a writer wants to say -- as expressed by yet another California author [Raymond Chandler] -- and his ability to actually say it).But above all else, it's simply a &quot;marvelous read;&quot; and, by the way, you don't have to read &quot;Cannery Row&quot; beforehand in order to fully enjoy it."},{"Title":"Sweet Thursday","review":"Steinbeck's colorful sequel to &quot;Cannery Row&quot;. WWII has passed, and in one way or another everyone from &quot;Cannery Row&quot; has either fought in it or been affected by it; now, they have resumed their lives in Monterey. Some old characters have left, moved on, or died, and new characters such as Joseph &amp; Mary Rivas (one man), Flora, Whitey #2, and Suzy are new. But the main characters without whom the book wouldn't have been written, Doc, Mack, and Hazel return. Each character is real and believable from speech to dress, thought and action. Their seemingly mundane and simple lives are interesting and appealing (as are most people's without even realizing it), and the love story which develops between Doc and Suzy is charming in my opinion. Throughout, and especially in the two chapters Steinbeck entitles &quot;hooptedoodle&quot;, there are interesting asides on subjects such as Pacific Grove, Carmel Valley, and marine biology for example, which help fill in the larger universe of &quot;Sweet Thursday/Cannery Row&quot;. One of my favorite chapters is the one entitled: &quot;There's a Hole in Reality Through Which We Can Look if We Wish&quot;. Here, Doc takes a lonely, evening stroll along the beach where he encounters a man called &quot;the Seer&quot;. The Seer invites Doc to his campfire for dinner and in a mystical conversation we begin to really see and feel another side of Doc's personality not as evident in the more light-hearted &quot;Cannery Row&quot;. This mysterious beach-bum talks to a morose Doc and gets him to realize that what's lacking in his life is nothing less than Love. &quot;Sweet Thursday&quot; is the story of Doc's accepting love, as well as the good intentions of his diverse friends, into his life. Steinbeck's further development of the other Cannery characters, along with his wonderful descriptions of Monterey County and the post-war time period is a perfect blend of art and story-telling talent which make for a highly enjoyable novel. It's quite possible that you will want to read it more than once, not only to re-live Steinbeck's &quot;Cannery Row&quot;, but also to re-discover the warm-hearted life lessons contained within."},{"Title":"Sweet Thursday","review":"Rarely do sequels rise to the level of the first book, but this one sure does. Although it is not essential to have read Cannery Row before Sweet Thursday, it certainly helps. Sweet Thursday carries on the stories of the misfits of Cannery Row and their unceasing cause of paying Doc back for all the good he has done the misfits' community.This sequel takes place after World War II. A few characters are vets, one was lost in teh war and the canneries have closed. The main characters return in full favor and flavor.This is a rarity for Steinbeck - a humorous love story. The characters, as always, are interesting and very engaging. The wit and wisdom of the unemployed men and brothel denizens keep the pages turning. A new store owner, a visiting professor and a new &quot;hustling&quot; lady are added to the cast of the previous book. With every page there is a smile a bit of thought-provoking philosophizing.A wonderfully entertaining book."},{"Title":"Sweet Thursday","review":"This is Cannery Row part 2, and it does not let up from part one, I'm happy to say. To note, Cannery Row was copyrighted 1945, and Sweet Thursday in 1954. Sweet Thursday opens by letting the reader know that it's after WWII and the boys are coming home from the war, except for Gay. For me, the central character is Doc. I think this is so, because almost all the characters think so highly of him, especially Hazel. Doc has a crisis, and I will not say what it is, but it has made a significant change in Hazel. But getting back to Doc, there is more about him, particularly about how he is \\"inside\\" the man of science. When I finished reading I was uplifted and satisfied. I only wish there was a part three somewhere for us to discover in some attic in Salinas. This is a must-have for Steinbeck fans."},{"Title":"Sweet Thursday","review":"I read Sweet Thursday in my undergrad days and I remember sitting up all night to finish the novel. Steinbeck is an intelligent writer, and one has only to roll his words in the mind, over and over again, to get their full import.Doc epitomises the secret fantasy in every man's mind to be the average man but with above-average ideas. Living in this world, yet supremely unattached from its petty temptations and puny ambitions. Doc tries to pick up his life in the post-War society with changing priorities and prejudices. He tries to tackle issues with his &quot;archaic&quot; set of values and morals and gets confused in the process. The reader feels almost relieved to identify with Doc's confusions, in the novel. With the meeting of Suzy and Doc, the mood of the novel changes to tantalizing hope and expectation. It is a happy novel, with wonderful 'hooptedoodles', that serve as apparent distractions but in the end complete the whole picture of Doc and his mates of Cannery Row.If I ever write a novel, I would like to write one like this."},{"Title":"Sweet Thursday","review":"I had read Cannery Row several times before I got my hands on a copy of Sweet Thursday. I was skeptical that a sequel could possibly live up the epic greatness Cannery Row and I was worried that Steinbeck would somehow ruin the wonderful characters of the &quot;palace flophouse.&quot; Sweet Thursday is every bit as magical as Cannery Row. The new characters are beautiful and the old characters are so expertly polished that they shine brighter than ever. The book picks up the lives of the Row characters a few years after the events of the first book. Steinbeck masterfully chronicles the rise of an unlikely hero as a frightening crisis threatens the Western Biological Supply. The only mistake I ever made was seeing the movie based on Cannery Row and Sweet Thursday. It was horrible - a crime against Steinbeck."},{"Title":"Sweet Thursday","review":"This book re introduces the reader to Doc , who was last seen in the book Cannery Row. It is the end of World War 2 and Doc has returned to his home district known as Cannery Row. However something is very amiss in Doc's life. He is depressed and lonely and even his work as a Marine Biologist is no solace to him. Full time bum and drunk (and part time philospher!!!) Mack decides that Doc needs cheering up so he sets about trying to find a woman for Doc. There is a new girl in town who works as an escort and Mack and his friends decide that she is too classy for that profession and try to \\"hook her up\\" with Doc with hilarious results. If you think John Steinbeck just wrote serious and sad novels I suggest you read this book. This book is a gem which is often overlooked by Steinbeck readers which is a real shame I think."},{"Title":"Sweet Thursday","review":"I've read this book around 30 times I think since I first found it in High School (30 years ago!) it never came into focus completely until I read the introduction to *Sea of Cortez* about Ed Ricketts. If you never read another book by Steinbeck, read this book, and the prequel *Cannery Row*. I won't spoil it for you... if you don't love Marine Biology before you read it, you will by the end. And you might even find out something about that mystery we call love."},{"Title":"Sweet Thursday","review":"New Hampshire, Singapore and Mr. Schilf: you are all absolutely right. There is more warmth, humanity and wisdom lovingly crammed into this beautiful story ... Those who only know the Steinbeck of Grapes of Wrath or East of Eden should meet the Steinbeck of Cannery Row, Sweet Thursday and Tortilla Flat. The greatness of the man is here. My favorite novel."},{"Title":"Sweet Thursday","review":"\\"Men seem to be born with a debt they can never pay no matter how hard they try. It piles up ahead of them. Man owes something to man. If he ignores the debt, it poisons him, and if he tries to make payments the debt only increases, and the quality of his gift is the measure of the man.\\"I admit I went into this book with considerable expectations. I had recently read Cannery Row and expected this books to pick up where the other left off. Which technically happened.I was shocked, half way through the book to find it was a love story. A really touching, accurate and painful love story. It would be a spoiler to reveal how the story unfolds but it wouldn't be if I said it was subtle. Steinbeck weighs in on fate, responsibility and compatibility in his usual brilliance.This book has something that none of the other Steinbeck's I've read have had. It has a fragile heart and it is exposed for all to love. You have to read Cannery Row to get this book, but you should get this book."},{"Title":"Sweet Thursday","review":"I had read Cannery Row in college and loved it so much that I could never read this book. One day a friend of mine left it behind and I started to read it. Two hours later, I was back in Steinbeck land, laughing at the antics of the Cannery Rowgang. What a glorious sequel. The lost art of the novella was resurrected in these two books by Steinbeck."},{"Title":"Sweet Thursday","review":"In his early career when Steinbeck was married to Carol Henning, Joseph Campbell had a very public, and for John, a very painful, flirtation with her. As the rumor goes, Steinbeck got revenge by lampooning Campbell with the charactger in SWEET THURSDAY, Joe Elegant.\\"Joe Elegant was a pale young man with bangs. He smoked foreign cigarettes in a long ebony holder and he cooked for the Bear Flag. ...He sneered most of the time, and except at mealtime kept to himslef in his little lean-to behind the Bear Flag from which the rattle of his typewriter could be heard late at night.\\"p. 133 \\"After lunch Joe Elegant read Fauna his latest chapter. He explained the myth and the symbol. 'You see,' he said, 'the grandmother stands for guilt.''Aint she dead and buried?''Yes.''That's a kind of a messy guilt.''It's the reality below the reality,' said Joe Elegant.'Balls!' said Fauna.\\" (Fauna's the madam of a cheap bordello.)I don't regard this as one of Steinbeck's better books, but Ch. 23, \\"One Night of Love,\\" stands out for how it conveys a deep understanding and compassion for humanity and the transformational power of love. Steinbeck rarely comes right out and talks about love, but he does here and in a way that proves he's given it a lot of thought. Here, Doc and Suzy (a woman engaging in prostitution out of desperation) are dining in a restaurant in Monterrey (they've not yet had sex):\\"The shock of a necktie was leaving Doc. He looked across the table and smiled at Suzy and he wondered, What is beauty in a girl that it can come and go? This Suzy did not faintly resembble the tough hustler who had screamed at hm the night before. He raised the coctail glass. 'You're pretty,' he said. 'I'm glad you came with me. Here's to both of us.'Suzy swallowed a gulp, held back her tears, and waited for the spasm to pass.\\"Suzy's a prostitute. Doc knows she is, yet he treats her as a lady, and she behaves like one. Suzy turns heads when she walks in the restaurant. The maitre d' defers. Doc wore slacks, tie and jacket. This isn't a paid transaction, either, it's a bonifide date, arranged by Fauna, Suzy's boss and a trusted friend of Doc's. The entire book is worth this one restaurant scene in this one chapter."},{"Title":"Sweet Thursday","review":"How easy it seems to come to John Steinbeck...I can picture him typing away on his old typewriter, and majically producing these rich, rich stories that have &quot;it&quot; all. The townfolk of Cannery Row continue to grow without becoming stale. A perfect union of old characters introduced in the preceding books, _Tortilla Flat_ and _Cannery Row_ meet a new assortment of equally compelling personalities. His talent is evident in the concise revealing of these people. Humanity, love, and the fragile bonds that connect all sorts together makes for a rich broth that he serves up to the reader. Nothing is left out, he is incredibly sensitive, vulnerable, and compassionate in describing his characters. Just as well, he is hysterically funny and original. It is quite simply, a movie in your mind when you read these 3 books. Crisp and absolute, I can &quot;see&quot; everything he has written and it is one of the best movies I have ever had the pleasure to view!!Steinbeck keeps the original Palace Flophouse alive, but now, sadly, it is occupied by the post war survivors. One of the beds is a virtual memorial to one of the boys. No one is allowed to sit on the bed, and everything is left the way it was when he left. Especially, because he is presumed dead, they hold out all hope and respect for his return. The &quot;boys&quot; slowly return from war, reunite and again, become the essence of Cannery Row.Mack, the man in charge of the Flophouse, presides over the Palace on his street skills and hustling abilities, of which he is duly recognized and respected by all. Most of his attention, if not to the boys, is to &quot;Doc&quot; and the constant attempts to reward and recognize Doc for all that he has done for the boys, and all the &quot;down and outs&quot; on Cannery Row.Doc, usually the strong, wise and controlled, meets his mid-life crisis ( for loss of a better description of his angst.) He returns from the war to his Biological Lab, which is in total disarray from the mismanagement of the person he left in charge. His return and shock in finding the conditions of his lab are the catalyst for the initiation of his self doubt and relentless introspection. A man from days before the war, he was content to collect biological specimens, preserve them, and reward himself with the pint of beer. All in town knew of his habits, his schedule and his goals. His self doubts create a disturbing equation to his life and the Cannery Row folk feel his unease and seek resolution. He ultimately confronts his loneliness with the attention and intervention of all the inhabitants in Cannery Row. All contribute opinions, astrological forecasts and speculations. Those that hold debts of gratitude are many, for he is a man that extends himself to all in need. Be it a man ill, he is the healer. Be it a person in disability, he is their ability. Not a man to be self-serving, he is their rock and their stability. Without him, they are all vulnerable to the nightmares they each dream at night. And, so, Doc, without any ill intention, allows all to see his infortune, his dis-ease, his vulnerability. He expresses his fear of failure, and his desire to write a scientific paper about the behavior of octopuses. He feels how important it is to his soul that this paper is written, and those who love him understand this priority. Enter into the turmoil, is a woman named Suzy. A young girl abused by her family into leaving her home, she steps off the bus to find a future in Monterey. More than a few people take her under their wing, and she becomes a treasure worth fighting for. Doc struggles with his pretensions, lust and love, all of it yet another stew to stir and dwell on. He is stunned by everything. He isn't acting predictably. The town watches, consults, and agonizes. Can they help Doc? What is wrong with Doc? The pulse of the town beats with the need to solve the puzzle. It seems to affect everything, yet compared to other towns, it has it's own unique difficulty. Really, it isn't so bad, after all, it could have Pacific Grove's agony with no monarch butterflies making their annual show.Such unusual behavior is interpreted by the simple minded &quot;boys&quot; with great fear, for his well-being is inherent to them all. His discomfort is their discomfort. His joy, their joy. If he is joyless, or at a loss, so are they. What comes of this is their responsibility. They must change the world to accomodate the need for equanimity. They feel the ultimate need to produce this for their beloved friend, Doc. In this need, the story produces the joys and sorrows so perfectly and elegantly delivered by John Steinbeck."},{"Title":"Sweet Thursday","review":"If you liked Cannery row, this is a lesser knownsequel to it, and it is a MUST READ. It is goodSteinbeck reading even without having readCannery Row, but you are cheating your self outof all the tasty character building and incedentsin the first book that serve as foundation forSweet Thursday."},{"Title":"Sweet Thursday","review":"This novel is Steinbeck's sequel to his very successful CANNERY ROW, which was published in 1945. The book revolves around Doc and the prostitute Suzy; everyone in Cannery Row thinks that Doc needs to get married (his life is in a funk), and that Suzy is the best prospect (her honesty is her key feature). Doc isn't sure he agrees with everyone else about getting married, and Suzy doesn't think she's worthy of him. But the inevitable must occur, of course, and with everyone doing the best they can to get the two together, they finally decide to tie the knot.Steinbeck had a musical comedy in mind when he wrote this, but his attempt at lighthearted humor is not his forte. The big party with the goofy costumes is more silly than funny; better is when Suzy describes the man who would be perfect for her and Doc tells her that's him to a T, but she doesn't believe him. The ending is fairly predictable as the two principals stumble toward it. Not one of Steinbeck's major achievements."},{"Title":"Sweet Thursday","review":"I don't think many people would associate great literature with &quot;fun&quot;, but Steinbeck proves this can be done. &quot;Sweet Thursday&quot; is just as entertaining as Cannery Row (it is a sort of continuation of the story, but you needn't have read one to understand the other). The antics and strange logic of Mack and the boys cracked me up. There's even an odd love story woven in. I have to say I thoroughly enjoyed this book. My favorite Steinbeck novel is &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot;, which is not funny like &quot;Sweet Thursday&quot;, but is an excellent story. Gary Sinise reads it on audio (abriged bummer) and he does an excellent job. I would suggest reading it before listening, though. Anyway, buy this book--buy any Steinbeck book--I guarantee you won't be wasting your time or money."},{"Title":"Sweet Thursday","review":"Of all the books I've read of Steinbeck this one is my favorite. I think the case is that this one express life in the fullest. It gives a true reflection of the ups and downs while at the same time conveys a sense of joy even in the hardest things and struggles in life. Highly recommended, but read 'Cannery Row' first for sure."},{"Title":"Sweet Thursday","review":"I recently found out this sequel to Cannery Row existed. Very cute and light hearted. I actually enjoyed this more than Cannery Row and the audiobook version is fantastic."},{"Title":"Sweet Thursday","review":"This book is a deemed a continuation of \\"Cannery Row,\\" which I have yet to read, although it is on my list. But, it is also written in the spirit of Steinbeck's \\"Tortilla Flats,\\" in that it is a story of men who are down and out conspiring to help each other through life's many setbacks. In this book, the men of the Palace Flophouse work together and separately to overcome the ennui being suffered by their pal Doc, a marine biologist, who is burried under an extreme case of loneliness. Enter Suzy, who becomes a member of the local brothel. How to get the two together? That's the charming focus of this book. Men and women looking out for each other; a terrific moral, a bawdy and sentimental read, a book I enjoyed to the fullest."},{"Title":"Sweet Thursday","review":"Beautiful. Never read anything like it. Steinbeck really got it together for this one. Doc and Suzy are fabulous. Must read."},{"Title":"Sweet Thursday","review":"I read Sweet Thursday before I read Cannery Row, before any other Steinbeck novel actually, and then proceeded to devour everything else he wrote. Steinbeck and Graham Greene are 2 of my favorite authors. Character development is rich and the story itself is reason enough to read this book. YOu will read everything else you can by him if you haven't started to already!"},{"Title":"Sweet Thursday","review":"John Steinbeck is truly one of the 20th century's greatest authors. Sweet Thursday continues the exploits of Doc, Mack and the gang after WWII. Steinback writes with a sweet hopefullness about the goodness of mankind. If you liked Cannery Row this is a worthy sequel."},{"Title":"Sweet Thursday","review":"Perhaps Steinbeck never should have bothered writing this novel, since it's simply a sequel to his infinitely entertaining and unsurpassable \\"Cannery Row.\\" Whereas the latter book is more a series of lovingly written vignettes about Monterey in the late 1930s than a straightforward novel, \\"Sweet Thursday\\" (which deals with the same characters and places in the late 1940s) does not have the same feel, involving a more coherent story and more \\"character development.\\" This is why some of the magic and charm is taken away from characters like Doc, Hazel and Mack - although one could argue that Steinbeck brought these characters down to earth by showing them as normal people subject to change and aging (i.e. Doc's rather odd version of a mid-life crisis). Even though it is a much weaker literary work than its predecessor, \\"Sweet Thursday\\" is still engaging and very, very funny."},{"Title":"Sweet Thursday","review":"this is not a worthy sequel to cannery row, which is about as wonderful a book as any american has produced. sweet thursday itself rises not much above the level of a tv sitcom. prostitution here is treated like a warm, light-hearted profession, pure television sitcom hooey. i wish mr steinbeck had let cannery row stand on its own; for, while sweet thurday is an okay light read, it adds nothing to, and can only diminish the pleasures stored in one's memory of the classic original story. don't miss out on cannery row, or tortilla flat (another classic in the same vein), but feel free to skip sweet thurday, which is pure fluff compared to those two wonderful works. this book was a steinbeck mistake. i guess we all make them."},{"Title":"Sweet Thursday","review":"excellent novel - characters are real,funny, insightful - novel is thoroughly enjoyable and a good example of Steinbeck's finest work."},{"Title":"Sweet Thursday","review":"&quot;Cannery Row&quot; is my favorite Steinbeck novel and I enjoyed this book very much. Many of the characters are the same and it's fun to read about them again. I love the descriptions of Monterrey CA (sp?) and enjoy reading about Doc's work as a marine biologist. Steinbeck has his characters speak in everyday language, which is qite enjoyable. I reccommend this book to anyone who likes Steinbeck, imagery, or glimpses into ordinary people's lives. There isn't any huge, spectacular plot climax but it is definately an enjoyable book."},{"Title":"Sweet Thursday","review":"I almost never bother to write a negative book review but on Sweet Thursday I'll make that exception. I have read every single book that John Steinbeck published and I enjoyed every single one of them, except this one. It rambled on and on, wasn't focused in the least, didn't hold my attention. I only kept reading because I expected it to get better. But it didn't and I must confess, I never made it much more than half way through it.It is odd too, because Steinbeck is a real master, a fabulous writer, creator of stories and charters that will outlast most of us. But this one didn't get it for me, this one could have used more editing. Still, one dog out of so many great books, it is a darn good record. By the way, just finished reading Down to a Soundless Sea, by his son, Thomas Steinbeck, and I was quite impressed with it...great stories, fine writing. Check it out and take a pass on Sweet Thursday."},{"Title":"Sweet Thursday","review":"As a giant fan of Cannery Row, I resisted reading the sequel for years. There were many reasons to put it down along the way, especially early in the book. The prologue is Steinbeck at his absolute worst and stands in sharp contrast with the poetic opening of Cannery Row. In it he uses Mack to tell us that this book is an exercise in dialogue and that the plot will flow without interruption. Feels like a far cry from the love with which he writes in the first book and downright hacky. Steinbeck goes on to \\"plug and play\\" characters, using the template of the town to create utterly forgettable figures in Fauna and Joseph and Mary as replacements for Dora and Lee Chong. Sweet Thursday plays out like most bad sequels in that giving in to the temptation of bringing back beloved characters, the original magic wavers. Still, Steinbeck can move a story along and there are sweet moments along the way, just not enough to warrant seeking this book out."},{"Title":"Sweet Thursday","review":"a story of the common man facing everyday obstacles"},{"Title":"Sweet Thursday","review":"It seems like Steinbeck tried a little too hard to be witty, too hardto be philosophical, too hard to be human and sweet. What made the originalCannery Row so enjoyable was its relaxed style and atmosphere. This bookis fun to read, but still is coerced. I guess sequels never do work out . . ."},{"Title":"Sweet Thursday","review":"Steinbeck carries over his characters from Cannery Row to Sweet Thursday. It is helpful to read CR before ST, but it probably isn't 100% necessary to do so.Once again, Steinbeck breathes incredible depth into the characters. I didn't detect any radical changes in the players that came through from the previous book. There were a few new ones that were just as likeable as those in CR.The main story line is more emphasized in this one compared to CR. There were far fewer side stories. This book also continues the humor that went with CR, which made the characters all the more life-like."},{"Title":"Sweet Thursday","review":"Sweet Thursday, Steinbeck's second part to Cannery Row, is in many ways an equal and worthy sequel and a pleasure to read. There is simplicity to many of the story's characters, but there is also a deep, symbolic, spirited prose in Steinbeck's writing, making even the simplest idea of life seem grandiose and thought-provoking. It's as if each statement takes on a larger meaning or is a microcosm for life.Many of the same cast from Cannery Row returns to Sweet Thursday, including Doc, Mack, Hazel and the boys, and then the most relevant new character is Suzy. Suzy comes to town looking for work, and you can tell despite her denials that she carries some baggage with her. Eventually she takes up some work with Fauna and her girls in her brothel, but you can tell this just doesn't suit her. As much as the town takes an interest in Doc, Fauna takes an interest in Suzy, and she gets the urge to try to play matchmaker with Doc and Suzy. While much of the first half of the book deals with Doc speculating on life, Mack and the boys coming over to socialize, or Suzy's orientation into Fauna's business, the novel takes off a little more in the second half, when the town ties to figure out what is wrong with Doc (because even he doesn't know). The second half also focuses on Fauna trying to be matchmaker for Doc and Suzy.Doc is really the character who drives the story, and many of Cannery Row feel indebted to him: \\"Doc was more than first citizen on Cannery Row. He was healer of the wounded soul and the cut finger...When trouble came to Doc it was everybody's trouble...\\" While everyone tries to decipher exactly what has Doc obsessing over writing the paper, and his frustration with it, Hazel, an unlikely hero, decides to try to take some matters into his own hands. While some of the story might be a little predictable by the novel's end, the mean by which Steinbeck is able to arrive there really is the talent in this novel.Steinbeck has a way with prose, and seems to inject a symbolic nature in even the minutest moments. For instance, the very brief two scenes with the man who is called the Seer are important to the fate of both Doc and Hazel's later actions. There are also many beautiful descriptions of Northern California--Salinas, Monterey, Pacific Grove, Cannery Row. Steinbeck makes setting as significant as its characters. There is a small town feel to the novel, and whether Doc is lamenting over life with Mack with a drink of Old Tennis Shoes, or taking a walk over to his lab, there is a slice of everyday life in every chapter of Sweet Thursday."},{"Title":"Sweet Thursday","review":"Sweet Thursday is Steinbeck's best work. That's saying quite a bit, considering Grapes of Wrath and East of Eden. His unparalled understanding of the human psyche and spirit was evidenced in both of those books; but to bring a delightfully comic spin to plot and characters while maintaining that insight shows his true genius. He was able to make each of numerous characters large, real, complex and humorous in a comparatively short book. I marvel at Steinbeck's insights and his ability to &quot;slap me in the face with some hard truths&quot; while making me laugh! What a gift Steinbeck gave us with this book."},{"Title":"Sweet Thursday","review":"In his early career when Steinbeck was married to Carol Henning, Joseph Campbell had a very public--and for John a very painful--affair with her after the botched abortion Steinbeck insisted she have. (Complications from the abortion resulted in an hysterectomy.) As the rumor goes, Steinbeck got revenge a few decades later by lampooning Campbell with the character Joe Elegant in SWEET THURSDAY. Judge for yourself from the following quotes.\\"Joe Elegant was a pale young man with bangs. He smoked foreign cigarettes in a long ebony holder and he cooked for the Bear Flag [a restaurant/bordello]. ...He sneered most of the time, and except at mealtime kept to himslef in his little lean-to behind the Bear Flag from which the rattle of his typewriter could be heard late at night.\\"p.133: \\"After lunch Joe Elegant read Fauna his latest chapter.

Steinbeck rarely comes right out and talks about love, but he does so here in a way that proves he's given it a lot of thought. Doc and Suzy [a novice, driven to prostitution out of desperation] are dining in a restaurant in Monterrey [they've not yet had sex]:\\"The shock of a necktie was leaving Doc.

It is a sequel to Cannery Row, set after World War II in the same location with some of the same characters.Steinbeck is always insightful and unerringly descriptive but he wants to drift into the dark and depressing. He is certainly at his positive storytelling best here, though, and I feel like I'm sitting with him in the lab, sipping Old Tennis Shoes, and listening to him spin out this delightful yarn.Buy this with Cannery Row and enjoy two thumping good reads."},{"Title":"Sweet Thursday","review":"I read \\"Cannery Row\\" years ago with some generally good impressions. Later I watched the rather lame movie version and I was reminded that humor was not Steinbeck's forte. I mention this because the first few pages of \\"Sweet Thursday\\" led me to think that I was going to get more tired scenes of old reprobates catching frogs at night. I perservered and, as soon as page 22, I was making margin notes for future reference. There is humor in \\"Sweet Thursday\\" and some of it is pretty good. However, it is Steinbeck's frequent forays into human psychology that kept my attention.I suspect that this group of misfits was a good laboratory for Steinbeck to tests his theories and write down his observations. There is a rather off-beat romance that seemed predictable although in an unpredictable way. I actually got to liking many of the characters although some were still a bit much. Somehow this mixture of high brow and low brow works out pretty well. I'm ready for some more Steinbeck!"},{"Title":"Sweet Thursday","review":"I love what I call \\"adjective enriched\\" style of John Steinbeck. If you don't know the writing of John Steinbeck then you will appreciate the ability of Steinbeck to put you in the scene of every chapter.

This is not the type of book for readers that just read by skimming the text."},{"Title":"Sweet Thursday","review":"I had heard about reviews of this book and most of them were pretty awful. I was a bit skeptic considering it was a sequel because I didn't think the message of love, happiness, and understanding of Cannery Row could ever be beat. I was mistaken. And I'm glad I was! From just reading the introduction, I knew this book was going to be something special. After reading the book, I can only look at those people around me and smile. I smile and think to myself, &quot;Thank God we have these people to live with.&quot; Otherwise life would get pretty dull. The only advice I have left is to order you to read this book.

Hilarious, warm and true, it's an unforgettable tale of the common bonds of humanity that bind us all."},{"Title":"Sweet Thursday","review":"Well, folks, a sequel is a sequel. By definition, it is less original, creative, surprising than the first instalment. Granted.Apart from that it is more of the same enjoyable ramble through different levels of life. Of course mainly the lower ones. Can't see Steinbeck writing a society novel.During WWII, excessive fishing has depleted the seas around Monterey, so now in this post war period, there is no fish to be canned in cannery row. The story is set around the survivors from part I, mainly Doc and Mack etc. Add Fauna and Suzy as delightful new characters, not to forget the Patron, Joseph and Mary. What a name.I loved it. Steinbeck had a great sense of humour. His fun stories are so much better than the mythical ones, like e.g. East of Eden or Burning Bright. Yes, he dropped a bit in productivity and creativity in his last 2 decades.Not quite surprisingly then, part of the 'plot' of 'CRII' is a writer's block of the main hero, Doc. (Whose real life model had by then died in a car accident, by the way!)I would agree that the story drops off speed a bit in the last quarter, since the pedictable outcome takes a little long in coming together.One more thought: is there any other Murakami fan (like me) around here? Don't you agree that the seer in the chapter about the hole in reality could have walked straight into a Murakami story 40 years later? (Maybe it is time to relate Murakami more to Steinbeck than to Kafka!!)"},{"Title":"Sweet Thursday","review":"I liked the sequel better than the original, a must read and I must advise you because I feel a fit coming on to stop reading after the three periods... Abandon all hope ye who continues to read...(three more periods, take note) I am reminded of me mum telling the story of how she had lost a gas cap to something and that she stuck a potato in the gas hole and fixed the problem. We all laughed at this story and to tell you the truth I knew that if I ever lost a gas cap the first thing I would do would riffle through the potato cabinet. As luck would have it I was riding my Yamaha 60cc Mini enduro and one day I noticed my gas cap was missing, I swear I did not pull this stunt on myself its just one of those be careful what you wish for things. Well my brother Charles Chadwick was keen on the idea of the potato solution and me not being very mechanical enlisted his help. We found a fine potato had to wittle it into a taper and then found it would not stay put when we raced so we took some duct tape and taped it over the gas hole and this worked until the potato shrank or I ran out of gas and had to untape my potato. Again fate came a knockin' and we found a gas cap that fit the bike but it was a little oversized so it looked like I had a pie pan on my gas tank, no problems it worked better than the potato. I need to call my mum and find out what sort of gas hole a potato works on, I'm just not ready to take this one out of my bag of tricks.

It's a sweet tongue-in-cheek story about a bunch of characters in Cannery Row, Monterey (where I went in June!) who live in the same community and stick their necks out for each other and roll through the days with fun and vigour. It's got friendship and romance and humour and a page-turning style of writing. It's about their way of life and the beauty of coastal California. It also has a wonderful love story between Doc and Suzy, the type that makes you go, &quot;Aww ... &quot; when they finally get together.At heart, the message is - everyone needs someone, and every man needs a woman. I can definitely do with that. This is a true literary page-turner, something all too rare in fiction."},{"Title":"Sweet Thursday","review":"Steinbeck has a unique ability to portray simple exploits of life and weave them into lessons of life that we should all know. He understands the ideosyncracies of the human spirit and subtleties that many individuals don't often pick up on. This is a great, relaxing read, from which many of us can learn a great deal.Many readers may disagree with my analogies, but with Cannery Row and Sweet Thursday, Steinbeck is actually a lot like a Seinfeld. He can take seemingly uninteresting situations, and develop them into humorous portrayals of quirky people. He takes personalites that everyone is familar with, and just stretches with a little neuroses."},{"Title":"Sweet Thursday","review":"The master Steinbeck is back with a sequel to Cannery Row that features the same incredibly natural dialogue and economical insight into the psychology of every character. A few years have passed since Cannery Row and a wholly appropriate amount of transition and change have occurred in both the setting and the lineup of characters. I recommend reading some other book by someone else between Cannery Row and this one to substitute for the passage of time. It is also likely to highlight how Steinbeck is truly one of the greatest dialogue writers that has ever picked up a pencil."},{"Title":"Sweet Thursday","review":"Perhaps it's not rated as John Steinbeck's best books - but it's my favourite. Whenever someone tells me they enjoyed Cannery Row, I say: read Sweet Thursday; it's better. Steinbeck invented such wonderful characters and breathed life into them."},{"Title":"Sweet Thursday","review":"\`Sweet Thursday' is the follow up to \`Cannery Row' and although it has many of the same characters from that first book it doesn't quite live up to the charm you felt from when you first delved into the lives of those on Cannery Row. Don't get me wrong, \`Sweet Thursday' is still very good and is written in Steinbeck's usual descriptive and rich language and once you start you are quickly engrossed in the story being told, but nothing beats the first time you met these characters in the first instalment. You get Mack and the boys in the palace flophouse and their various exploits, but this novel focuses more on Doc and his loneliness and how the inhabitants of Cannery Row go about alleviating it for him with the usual hilarious results. This novel is slightly longer than \`Cannery Row' and follows life after the war and when the area is run down and dilapidated. Having only recently found this novel I was delighted to immerse myself in the lives of these wonderful characters again and if you liked \`Cannery Row' it is a safe bet you will like this as well, in fact it would be good to read them one after the other to get the full impact of the story. A worthy successor to \`Cannery Row' and a good novel in it's own right, well worth a look if you're a fan of Steinbeck.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."},{"Title":"Sweet Thursday","review":"Steinbeck gives birth to fully formed characters about as well as any modern author, and the characters in \\"Sweet Thursday\\" are some of the loveliest in literature. They all have their warts; they all have their peculiarities; they all expose a little heart sometimes as well. I'll bet you'll find a bit of yourself in this tossed-salad of humanity. I loved \\"Cannery Row\\" and Steinbeck doesn't miss a step in this sequel. You don't have to read \\"Cannery Row\\" first, but I'd recommend it. And if you liked \\"Cannery Row\\", you have to read \\"Sweet Thursday\\"."},{"Title":"Sweet Thursday","review":"I like this novel, I really do, but I just don't like it as much as the original CANNERY ROW. There was a bohemian, free-spirited, atmosphere in the original that just doesn't come out here, or at least it is much more subdued. It apparently dwindled along with the sardines.Part of the problem is that the novel thinks too much. That is also the problem with the main character, Doc. He stops living for the day and starts thinking too damn much. Unfortunately his thinking, and Steinbeck's, has an irritatingly Freudian mold to it. The upper, middle, and lower voices that Doc hears sounds a little too much like the superego, ego, and id. But then maybe serving through the war in a VD unit changed Doc. In any case, this Doc is no longer like the original inspiration, Ed Ricketts. Ricketts had a strong spiritual side to his nature. The only place you find that here is in the character of the Seer- a person that still lives for the day and close to the earth- and still sees-and believes in- visions. But then, he is an outsider among outsiders even on the Row.All-in-all this novel has more in common with the cold grey 50's then it does the 30's and 40's. The spirit is there but it is a fading echo. Maybe Steinbeck consciously, or unconsciously, sensed the creeping soul death in the land and this book just reflected it. Still, compared to today, it is a laid-back oasis of nonconformity and humanity."},{"Title":"Sweet Thursday","review":"In every way except the title, \\"Sweet Thursday\\" is a sequel to \\"Cannery Row\\". Most of the characters return, with a few new additions to the Monterey, California community. John Steinbeck again proves to be a master of developing charcters in this work. As is the case with most sequels, the second is not as good as the original.Having read all of Steinbeck's other works except one, I went into this book with certain expectations. Knowing the characters in this story from a previous work, I expected Steinbeck to further develop these characters. Doc continues to be the centerpiece of the story. With the other members of the community rallying to his aid, the plot centers on the attempt to attain Doc a love interest. The \\"Seer\\" adds an interesting element to the story, which acts as a device for Steinbeck to give less realistic traits to the characters. This entertaining aspect sets this work apart form \\"Cannery Row\\".This is not Steinbeck's best work. When a writer has such a high standard of excellence, it is hard to write a \\"Grapes of Wrath\\" in every book. Fans of Steinbeck will enjoy this work."},{"Title":"Sweet Thursday","review":"Probably my favorite book. This book pleases on all levels. For the person looking for merely a light-hearted and amusing story, you'll find it here. For a person looking for a wonderful glimpse into the humanity of a microcosm of society that most people would frown on--this is it. This book manages to be exceedingly funny (don't read it on an airplane--people will hate you), while at the same time holding together a wonderful story."},{"Title":"Hell in a very small place;: The siege of Dien Bien Phu (A Vintage Book)","review":"Together with Fall's earlier book 'Street Without Joy' (Rue Sans Joie), 'Hell In A Very Small Place' is indispensable to understanding the Indochina wars of the twentieth century. Even the general historian should not be without this book.On the subject of the Indochina wars there is only one shame in the world: that, owing to their slavishly politicizing everything they recount, former Viet Minh and the Peoples Army of Vietnam have not produced a single book measuring up to Fall's two superb volumes.Fall's two books are the best accounts of the 1946-54 French experience in Indochina. Indeed they're among the best accounts of warfare in any epoch."},{"Title":"Hell in a very small place;: The siege of Dien Bien Phu (A Vintage Book)","review":"This book can be broken down into two categories. The historical aspect as well as the tactical perspective. Not only do we recieve the who and when but also the why.

This is a must read for those interested in American foreign policy as well as the determination and struggle of a besieged peoples."},{"Title":"Hell in a very small place;: The siege of Dien Bien Phu (A Vintage Book)","review":"This is probably the most detailed book available to the general public concerning Dien Bien Phu. Dien Bien Phu was not fought as jungle warfare. For the most part, it was a classic artillery duel, though the surrounding jungle complicated French logistics. The battle need never have been fought. The French chose the ground, and in so doing, ceded the strategic, tactical, and most importantly, the logistical advantage to the Vietnamese. Choosing to fight from a fixed position, at the bottom of a geophysical bowl, was just the first, and most deadly French mistake. General Giap, the Vietnamese commander, must have been astonished that the French chose to fight where they did, on ground that could be continually assaulted by artillery and mortar fire, from positions that the French could not locate with sufficient accuracy to offer counter battery. In any event, the French were unable to effectively resupply the garrison, just as they were unable to disrupt the Vietnamese supply lines. General Giap never wanted for artillery shells, which he rained down upon his enemy's airfield (destroying all French recon aircraft, and making resupply by air impossible), infantry and artillery positions, command posts, and even casualty collection and battle dressing stations. For the French, there was seldom a reprieve, and never any relief of significance. Finally, the Vietnamese gunnery was very good. Fall describes all this to a level of detail that will be of interest to the serious military analyst, but that may be a bit dense for the more casual reader. His coverage of the many poor command decisions by the French is excellent, as well as the great bravery of French soldiers and junior officers, whose heroic actions multiplied as the enemy made the ring about them tighter. He also covers the heroic, but foolish gestures by senior French commanders as the end neared.This book, when read with Fall's other Indochina book, \\"Street Without Joy,\\" and Neil Sheehan's \\"A Bright Shining Lie,\\" gives the reader an excellent understanding of western involvement in Indochina during the post World War II era."},{"Title":"Hell in a very small place;: The siege of Dien Bien Phu (A Vintage Book)","review":"Hell In a Very Small Place is a masterful and, I felt, at times moving account of a classic battle.

It was about a week before Christmas of 1969. At this time in history, the war in Vietnam was going full force. Upon ordering our drinks a rather senior Captain wearing the First Cav (Horse Patch) on his right sleeve, fortified by drink, got up and raised his glass high. \\"On your feet gentlemen, this toast is to those battling Legionnaires who died with their boots on at Dien Bien Phu!\\"At this time of my army career I was just becoming aware of what Vietnam was all about but two years down the road I would learn first-hand my experiences in Vietnam. It took me forty years to come to grips with my army experiences when my army buddy Bob Toto and I wrote our book In Our Duffel Bags, Surviving the Vietnam Era. Since we did this I've begun to read a lot on the Vietnam Wars. Bernard Fall's books on Dien Bien Phu and Street Without Joy are indeed classics.Mr. Fall goes into a thorough study on all the causes and effects of what transpired at the valley of Dien Bien Phu. The author will go into a much detailed account of strategies, tactics, battles and intelligence analysis of \\"the agony of Dien Bien Phu.\\" Fall's description of the heroics and absolute professionalism of both the French and the Viet Minh makes me truly understand the meaning of that good Captain's toast almost forty-three years ago.Included in Fall's book are the thoughts of Generals Cogny and Navarre. The descriptions of what happened at all the locations as designated from the French are very real and at the same time very haunting. One such happening was an attack of Legionnaires on the Viet Minh and as they advanced they were singing loudly their haunting Legion songs. The Vietminh were so stunned that momentarily they stopped \\"busting caps\\" (shooting) at the advancing Legionnaires.My intentions of this review are not to spoil what Mr. Fall states as his thesis of what happened at Dien Bien Phu or his thoughts of how the North Vietnamese should be handled militarily. The grand strategies lack of air power and poor logistics doomed Dien Bien Phu. The US learned from the French mistakes as they never lost on the battlefield to the NVA or the Vietcong for that matter. However Fall expounds again on the term revolutionary war. Read that and you will understand Giap and how he was to win the war when in fact he never won a major battle against the US in the eight years of direct combat.Too bad our politicians didn't listen to Mr. Fall's advice. Unfortunately Bernard Fall died on the Street Without Joy in 1967 on operations with the US Marines. Not enough stars for this read!"},{"Title":"Hell in a very small place;: The siege of Dien Bien Phu (A Vintage Book)","review":"The men of the French garrison of Dien Bien Phu most likely didn't expect to become a huge geopolitical metaphor, but they did. In losing their position in that valley to the surrounding Viet-Minh soldier, they signaled both the twilight of French (and western) colonialism and the stoking of fears of the dreaded \`Domino Effect' for the inheritors of the new colonialism. Unfortunately for 53,000 American soldiers, sailors, and airmen, the lessons of this battle were not internalized in time, and the French mistakes were redone under a different flag.Bernard Fall, a soldier and a scholar, details the day by day actions in the garrison for the reader in this book. The first part of the book is slow, as we see the building of the fortress and the slow build up on the surrounding hills from the other side. The Viet-Minh lines encircled the French until it was a noose taking the air out of the men. The book doesn't pick up until the details of the last desperate weeks of the battle are detailed, but the slower parts illustrate the quiet desperation that overtook the situation: boredom punctuated by panic."},{"Title":"Hell in a very small place;: The siege of Dien Bien Phu (A Vintage Book)","review":"2004 marks the 50th anniversary of the epic battle of Dien Bien Phu, easily one of the most significant military engagements of the 20th Century. It marked the end of French dominance in Indochina and the French Empire itself; propelled the aggressive USSR/Red Chinese backed Viet Minh into power in North Vietnam, then into conflict with the U.S. and its South Vietnamese ally; on to conflict with Cambodia and its former ally, China; and contributed to generally increased Cold War tensions from Korea to Germany; North Africans who fought for the French in Viet Nam were soon fighting against them back in Algeria.I read the entire book, which is something of a challenge since there is arguably too much information in this 500 page, small type face work. The days of the pre-battle preparation and the 58-day siege itself are told in great detail and with dozens of similar-sounding small unit abbreviations and difficult-for-most-Americans to remember French and other foreign names. It's almost overwhelming and one is tempted to skip a lot of it, but the hundreds of details and vignettes give the reader a cumulative impression of the thousands of actual details and vignettes experienced by the combatants (from the French forces' perspective) that actually comprised the unimaginable, for anyone without infantry experience, hellish experience.The approximately 20,000 men in the French Forces' represent a startling diversity of nationalities. It was, after all, a colonial French force. The initial garrison had only 13% French Mainland troops, although since a third of the volunteers who jumped in as replacements during the siege were French the total French Mainland representation was about 18%. The largest number of troops were Foreign Legion (26%, mostly German, Eastern European and Spanish) and Vietnamese Regulars (27%), followed by North Africans (18% of the initial garrison, almost none of the volunteer replacements, mostly Algerian and Moroccan) and the remainder were Vietnamese \\"auxiliaries\\" (upcountry ethnic groups, 10%) and less than 2% sub-Saharan Africans. The North Africans sustained the highest casualty rate, 68% of their numbers were killed, missing or wounded and the Foreign Legion casualty rate was nearly 60%. French Mainlanders who were only 18% of the battle force comprised 25% of those killed. There were about 12,000 total casualties before the 360 mile death march to POW camps and many more deaths.Clearly, the besieged troops fought gallantly and fearsomely - Viet Minh casualties were perhaps four times higher - but the initial French strategy, if you can call it that, of drawing the Viet Minh to a remote battlefield with little strategic importance seems idiotic and the logistical execution was, at best, mediocre. French fortifications were pathetically inadequate and only after the battle began did officers request instruction manuals for building fortified trenches! The initial Viet Minh artillery barrage was so unexpectedly overwhelming, despite surprisingly accurate pre-battle intelligence about Viet Minh capabilities, that the French artillery colonel who bragged Viet Minh guns would never touch French Forces committed suicide shortly after the battle started.A few French idiosyncrasies will astound American veterans. Within the fortress throughout the battle were two official French Army Mobile Brothels, one with Vietnamese women and the other with Algerians. Although they couldn't bring in enough engineering materials to properly fortify their positions the French made room on pre-battle supply flights for 45,000 gallons of wine, and then airdropped additional French Army-developed wine concentrate during the battle itself, causing troops to mount aggressive missions into Viet Minh lines to liberate wine concentrate that fell outside the fort!Both sides fought with American equipment. Most of the French artillery, radios, vehicles, aircraft and even one aircraft carrier that supported the garrison came from the U.S. The Viet Minh got lots of American artillery and other supplies the Chinese had captured in Korea, where a cease fire occurred less than nine months before the battle started. During the battle about 10% of the Viet Minh ammunition came from air drops that fell into Viet Minh lines, often from C-119s piloted by American civilians.As the situation deteriorated the French begged the United States to unleash B-29s to carpet bomb the Viet Minh. More than 60 bombers plus jet escorts staged on Okinawa and in the Philippines (some reportedly repainted in French colors), USAF officers made planning flights over the battlefield, and two U.S. carriers deployed to what 10 years later would be called Yankee Station in the Tonkin Gulf. In the end Eisenhower, as well as the British, declined to intervene in support of the French, a fact that contributed to France all but dropping out of NATO.In a section about the French forces' experience in Communist POW camps Fall describes how during the battle Viet Minh political commissars gathered prisoners every morning to tell them details about how badly the battle had gone the prior day for French Forces. POWs who agreed to sit in a special section and cheer each time a piece of bad news or casualty count regarding the French forces was read got extra food and medicine and did not have to work so hard. The Communist captors awarded such prisoners who cheered their own side's losses with the title of \\"progressives.\\" It reminds me a little too mcuh of some self-styled &quot;progressives&quot; in the U.S. in 2004.The grainy black and white photo reproductions are interesting, especially seeing the pictures of some of the warriors - man, some of those French generals had big noses! Sketch maps throughout the book supposedly illustrate the battlefield and how the lines evolved over time but I found them incomprehensible.Highly recommended for military history and Cold War buffs or military veterans. Anyone who thinks things aren't going so well in Afghanistan or Iraq needs to read this for a sense of perspective."},{"Title":"Hell in a very small place;: The siege of Dien Bien Phu (A Vintage Book)","review":"Great book if you want to know every minute detail about Dien Bien Phu. To me it spends way to much time with the politics of why and how France found itself in Vietnam. The book was full of redundant information. If half of that was removed from the content you would have 200 page book. Instead we have to slug through 500. I thought the best reading of the entire book was the last two chapters where the author threw off the formalities and gave a good overall picture of the French defeat. It seemed to take forever to get there though. The Finale, detailing the journeys of those that escaped was also fascinating. As well as the Postface, &quot;Where are they now&quot;. Other than that I'd pass this one up unless you are really insane for French Indochina military history. I only gave it 4 stars because it is historically, about the most thorough writing on the subject."},{"Title":"Hell in a very small place;: The siege of Dien Bien Phu (A Vintage Book)","review":"A classic! thats more than enough. Not five stars, five stars should be only for the best of the best. Bernard Fall, is a must read if your interested in vietnams history, at least from a military or political point of view. A street without joy, may deserve the five stars, if not for its depth for its scope and readability. The best thing with Fall is that you can sense his deep involvement in the topic, that makes it a passionate read. Ive read current books like[[ASIN:1400066646 Valley of Death: The Tragedy at Dien Bien Phu That Led America into the Vietnam War], its good but to distant from events. If you like history from people close to events but not too close to have too much to hide this is a good book.Its an account mostly from the french side, although Fall is not doctrinaire about it, it has a French Bias. Most of it is about the last part of the battle, probably becasue Fall felt the most guttwrenching, that last part of the battle was what made Dien Bien Phu heroic, the earlier is the sad. So yes this is a Heroic account of the battle, heroic even in its tragedy.In any case, its a clear and comprehensive account of the battle as any. Even for informations sake its still very, good. Makes you want to read more about the first Indochina war."},{"Title":"Hell in a very small place;: The siege of Dien Bien Phu (A Vintage Book)","review":"French colonialism in Indochina has a long and entangled past.Having first arrived as Jesuit missionaries in the 17th century, and rising as colonial powers in the mid-19th century, the French were established on the Indochinese peninsula for nearly three-hundred years when the Second World War brought forth Japanese expansion into South East Asia. With Europe attempting to stem the blitzkrieg, and France soon to fall to Nazi Germany, the French colonies in Indochina were quickly consumed by the Japanese war machine.Following the Japanese defeat in WW II, a power-vacuum emerged in South East Asia. In order to fill the vacuum, the nationalist Viet Minh, led by Ho Chi Minh, attempted to create a sovereign nation. France, attempting to regain control of its lost colonies quickly sent troops to re-establish control. Thus began the First Indochina war.Rather than concentrating on the entire conflict, Dr. Fall discusses in depth, perhaps the most defining moment of the war, the siege and fall of Dien Bien Phu.Based upon countless interviews with active participants and careful analysis of innumerable government documents, Dr. Fall pieces together an amazing history of the battle in nearly minute by minute description. Not only does he discuss the actual battle but also the subsequent political implications that made Dien Bien Phu one of the most decisive events of mid-20th century, comparable to the Cuban Missle Crisis or the end of the Korean War.Dr. Fall's account is highly readable, dividing the work between strategical analysis and an extensive description of the myriad and strikingly unique men participating in the battle, from the Commander-In-Chief of French forces, to the individual strong point commanders.Indeed, Fall has produced a seminal work of a watershed event that will remain for sometime the peerless account of Dien Bien Phu and the resulting end to French colonialism in Indochina."},{"Title":"Hell in a very small place;: The siege of Dien Bien Phu (A Vintage Book)","review":"Non-fiction books can be dry and tedious sometimes.

Ryan's A BRIDGE TOO FAR, it just captures your attention. I am of French/Vietnamese/Chinese heritage and come away as a better person after reading this masterpiece. I have the utmost respect for both adversaries. Fall has written a very human account. I highly recommend it. Especially for persons like me who yearn for pieces of their history."},{"Title":"Hell in a very small place;: The siege of Dien Bien Phu (A Vintage Book)","review":"Bernard B. Fall's \\"Hell in a Very Small Place\\" is undeniably a classic of military history. It has at one time or another been an assigned text at the U.S. Naval War College and West Point. Fall had an unusual career as an academic who conducted field research by accompanying first French forces and later Americans into combat in Indochina. Such dedication to his work eventually cost him his life.\\"Hell in a Very Small Place\\" is the definitive account of the battle at Dien bien phu -- a debacle that ended the French empire in Indochina. It is a sad tale of folly. The arrogance and stupidity of French political and military leaders are only partially redeemed by the valor and esprit of their soldiers -- French, Vietnamese, and Legionaires. They made a mistake fatal to many throughout history by underestimating the enemy. French generals believed their firepower, air support, and professional soldiery would allow them to annihilate the Viet Minh in open combat. Vo Nguyen Giap displayed the strategic vision, logistical flexibility, and the tactical determination to turn the tables and instead destroy the French Union's elite forces.Fall's book is not only well written and readable, but also authoritative. His research is thorough, using both primary and secondary sources. In 1966 David Schoenbrun said of \\"Hell in a Very Small Place\\" that \\"future historians will be using Fall's book as their main source material.\\" Thirty nine years after publication, that statement is still true."},{"Title":"Hell in a very small place;: The siege of Dien Bien Phu (A Vintage Book)","review":"Great book by all accounts. Gripping alright, and I couldn't put it down even through the &quot;build-up&quot; stage which some readers (I gather from the reviews here I've read) find boring. Once the battle starts you just won't go to sleep. It also (and this is very important) stays true to the facts and I find Fall an honest historian, which is rare and refreshing. I recomend some further reading on some of the main protagonists in the battle like Dr.Grauwin (wrote a book himself), Godard, Giap, but aspecially Bigeard who went on to greater things in Algeria and elsewhere and ended up a full general. The man is still alive.I found the book interesting for other reasons too. I'm not French, American or Vietnamese. I spend six months each year in the United States and observed the last year's anti-French campaign there. I found it destasteful. I hope Americans who read this book will reject the portrayal of the French as cowards, for what the French paratroopers did at Dien Bien Phu and how they fought was nothing short of heroic. I also hope that these readers will go on to read other books on history of France and study them carefully. They will find that the French are not just good soldiers (in fact, just as good as anybody), but a truly interesting and great nation too, perhaps closer to you, Americans, than it would appear. After all, they fought for your independence too."},{"Title":"Hell in a very small place;: The siege of Dien Bien Phu (A Vintage Book)","review":"Dien Bien Phu was one of this century's few truly decisive battles. Fall conveys the scope of the tragedy as it unfolded, in the appalling trenches and deadly skies above Dien Bien Phu, the jungle bases of the Viet Minh, the airconditioned offices of the French generals in Hanoi and Saigon and in the political arenas of Paris and Washington. The incredible bravery of the French forces in an impossible situation on the ground is brilliantly contrasted with the incompetence of their political and military leaders."},{"Title":"Hell in a very small place;: The siege of Dien Bien Phu (A Vintage Book)","review":"Bernard Fall uses a very fitting epigraph from Menachem Begin, of all people, to foreshadow one of his book's themes: \\"When a nation re-awakens, its finest sons are prepared to give their lives for it liberation. When Empires are threatened with collapse, they are prepared to sacrifice their non-commissioned officers.\\" (as Fall goes on to indicate, all too often those non-coms were not even the French of the \\"Hexagon.\\"). Fall states in the introduction that for three years he \\"lived\\" in this small valley in extreme northwest Vietnam, with the prosaic name, \\"Seat of the Border County Prefecture\\", or, in Vietnamese, \\"Dien Bien Phu.\\" The product of those three years labor is an absolutely superlative book on one of the classic battles of the 20th Century, whose ramifications are being felt even today.Make no mistake about it, the book is primarily a military history replete with unit designations and the military lingo, mindset, and outlook (contrary to some reviewers, I thought the maps were excellent.) But for those who are not \\"specialists\\" in that area, or students at some War College, the slog through those parts are well worth it, (imagine learning that the re-supply effort involved delivering almost 50,000 gal. of wine and 60 kg. of mustard, inter alia). Fall gives equal stage to the principal actors on the French side (he had far less access to those on the Vietnamese side), their egos, (did de Castries give female names to those strong points in honor of his mistresses?) as well as the incredible hubris of the French ruling elite that brought this disaster upon them. Fall offered lessons that the Americans did not learn in Vietnam (that same hubris in operation again - mainly \\"we\\" are not the French, and \\"we\\" don't lose). On page 8 \\"The fact that such mixed French-Vietnamese units on the whole fought far better than purely Vietnamese units and also purely European unit...was forgotten in South Vietnam ten years later.\\" And from page 440, \\"When everything was said and done, it remained a fact that the anti-Communists Vietnamese simply had not fought like the Vietnamese on the Communist side.\\"Although Fall is primarily a military historian, he can offer achingly poignant insights and passages. He covered the \\"mon vieux,\\" (old buddy) radio farewell between Cogny and de Castries, but the climatic point has to be when the Vietnamese radio operator, who had been monitoring the French radio traffic, breaks in, and requests that the French not destroy their radio sets quite yet, that \\"President Ho Chi Minh offers you a rendition of the Chant des Partisans,\\" and the Vietnamese proceed to sing the same song the French resistance did when the Germans were occupying their country.In the Epilogue section Fall covers the various \\"might-have-beens,\\" but deals only with the tactical ones. He never asks what might-have-been on a strategic level: What if the United States, in 1946, had supported the one force that had fought with it during WW II, Ho Chi Minh, and his band of partisans, who had coordinated with the OSS; while telling the 40,000 French colonists who had supported the Japanese that it was time to go home, and give the country back to the Vietnamese.My life has been intertwined with this book for a very long time. I recently re-read it, but first read it when I was in Vietnam, in 1968. Shortly thereafter, I was deployed to a similar valley, in extreme northwestern II Corps, Polei Klang, along with a company of tanks, to re-enforce the Special Forces camp there. The NVA held the hills, with their 122 mm rockets, we held the cratered runway on the valley floor. Fall's italicized statement on p 455 proved to be prophetic: \\"Air power on a more massive scale than was then available could not have changed the outcome of the Indochina War, but it would have saved Dien Bien Phu.\\" It saved Polei Klang, until we chose to abandon it. But it did not change the outcome of that war either. It was Westmoreland's rigid adherence to Johnson's ultimatum to ensure \\"that there were no other (euphemism) Dien Bien Phus\\" that lead to his focus on Khe Sanh, taking his eye off the danger to the cities, which lead to the Vietnamese Tet offensive, a tactical failure, but a strategic success. I returned to Vietnam three times in the \`90's. In 1995 I was one of perhaps the first 1000 Westerners to travel overland from Hanoi to DBP, as the Vietnamese were relaxing their travel restrictions. It took a total of 20 hours, over two days, in a Russian jeep, to cover the 320 km - clearly underscoring the difficulty of re-supply. We arrived the sixth day of Tet, but they opened the museum for us, with its large \\"heroic\\" paintings of the Viet Minh dragging the 105's up the opposite side of the mountains surrounding the valley. The bunker that de Castries walked out of to surrender on May 07, 1954 is still preserved. There is also a small memorial to the French dead, the result of the work of Jules Roy, which Mitterrand \\"commissioned\\" in 1984.This book is excellent history, meticulously researched, and well-written.And today? The lessons are still unlearned.

With Dien Bien Phu, American policymakers had to ponder the risk of getting involved--again--with Red China only months after the costly Korean stalemate. They had to weigh whether saving a remote, and apparently-doomed airhead--of a less-than-reliable WWII ally--would serve any useful purpose. Could they have reconciled a (attempted) bailout of French colonialism with Containment? Mr. Fall did a wonderful job of covering this complex situation."},{"Title":"Hell in a very small place;: The siege of Dien Bien Phu (A Vintage Book)","review":"Bernard Fall obviously did extensive research for this work, and his writing style is so invoking, so compelling. He covers all aspects: An almost diary-like account of battle itself, the reasons why it was fought, the international haggling and politics involved in trying to save the Dien Bien Phu garrison.Most importantly, he puts you right in the midst of the battle. When you read this book, you can actually feel the emotions: The fear of going through another Viet Minh barrage, and the tension before yet another infantry attack; the determination of fighting for survival, or to save comrades; the satisfaction after a successful counterattack, and the frustration of dealing with uncomprehending leadership in Hanoi. If you're a fan of military history, this book will not disappoint you.

My only gripe is the racist slant of the author, wherein all white soldiers were heros, and Southeast Asian and Africa mercemaries of the French Expedionary Force, other than the Foreign Legion, were lesser mortals and shirkers(other than a brief mention of some German deserters from the Foreign Legion, it seems that no one white soldier had surrendered or been captured before the very end). Also the author whilst glorifying the heroics and self sacrifice of the para/legion officer mafia, had chosen to omit the fact that most of the para/legion officers never fought in the trenches, but opted to stay in the HQ bunker, and most of them were captured alive and unwounded, as attested by period photos. Most of the officer casaulties (and those who suffered most were from the infantry and tank branches, rather than the elites like paras and legionnaires) were self inflicted (suicide) or caused by some well aimed artillery hits on top of a dug out/bunker.Whilst not denying the bravery of the ordinary soldiers there, I will hesitate to eulogise the French officers, whose negligence, cowardice and incompetence were just too obvious to ignore.I will also like more reserach on the \\"Rats of Nam Yum\\", those shirkers and deserters who refused to put up a fight. Who were they? Fall implied that they were the Vietnamese, Algerians. Sengelese and Morrocans.

And yet he has the nerve to very slyly put down the American's. After reading around 75 to 80 books about the wars fought in Vietnam, I can honestly say this was the most boring, wordy, mind numbing book I ever tried to read.I honestly tried very hard to read all of this book, but after 10 minutes my eye's would glaze over and I wouldn't even remember what I just read.I also read Mr. Fall's book \\"Street Without Joy\\" and at least got through it. The very same story was put down in print by Howard R. Simpson titled \\"Dien Bien Phu: The Epic Battle America Forgot\\". Mr. Simpson's account of the very same battle that Mr. Fall wrote about was very easy to read and very well written and very easy to understand. All in all, this was a lesson in how one person know's how to write a very interesting and informative book that hold's your interest, as opposed to Mr. Fall's book on how to write a very boring wordy book with a lot of useless information. As far as Mr. Fall's Book \\"Hell in a Very Small Place\\" This is the first book I ever read where I couldn't finish it no matter how hard I tried. To put it bluntly, This book [is terrible].

Having a broad interest in Vietnam in general I quickly placed my order and am glad to report that this really is a great military history book. I had feared that the \`angle' of this work would be too, well, staff college fodder in its demeanour for me to properly take in but I was quite happily proven wrong on that score. In essence my feelings regarding this book can be summed up as follows;# Mr Fall obviously had access to a great wad of documents and really pored over them. While there is was the potential pitfall of him being too close in time to the events portrayed to put them in context in my estimation his very closeness in time and space has allowed him to invest his work with a great atmosphere and to speak to interview people while their memories were still fresh.# The book is a bit of a brick but it has to be said that the mountain of detail in the work does appear to flow quite easily. You don't have to have been to staff college or be a closet weapons geek to understand what is going on. But a word of warning - I would not make this my first military history book ever. It helps if you have some concept of warfare and the wars in Vietnam during the 50's, 60's and 70's in particular.# While the outcome is known from the outset of the book the author has still succeeded in creating a sense of suspense and his portrayal of the action is quite gripping and there is plenty of praise for the heroism of both sides sprinkled throughout the pages.# My last point would be to praise how the author has created a sense of tragedy. The pitfalls of the French actions are shown fully and the reader finds themselves wondering inwardly how on earth the battle was ever allowed to take place in any event. Not to mention the waste of many very brave men on both sides.All up this is not the breeziest war book I've ever read. There are undoubtedly plenty of books focussed more on quick payoff action sequences and at the end of the day it also comes down to what particular period of military history you are interested in but for me this is perhaps the book that has felt the most complete to me in that it gave me a sense that I was getting the full story and it's encapsulation of so many rear echelon aspects of the battle as well as gripping flurries of action gave it pretty much perfect pacing."},{"Title":"Hell in a very small place;: The siege of Dien Bien Phu (A Vintage Book)","review":"Bernard Fall \\"Hell in a very small place: Dien Bien Phu\\"Bernard Fall's recount of the siege of Dien Bien Phu in 1954 is a classic. Not only does Fall set out the strategic dimension of the battle, but his attention to the small platoon-level tactical battles gives this book a depth that has become the gold-standard of battlefield reporting.Dien Bien Phu was won by the Viet-Minh who outclassed the French in thinking and executing their bold battle plan. The French upper echelon collapsed under the immense pressure of heavy artillery bombardment, determined tunnelling and frontal assaults. Colonel Piroth, the artillery commander, committed suicide, and de Castries's Chief of Staff had a nervous breakdown after three days of battle. The French still though they would win and Major Bigeard and sticks of paratroops dropped into the beleaguered battlefield at night. Many of the French units were composite units and the T'ai montagnards responded to communist propaganda and started to desert.In siege warfare similar to that of the Western Front some thirty years earlier, the Viet-Minh used civilians to dig the trenches that would encircle and strangle Dien Bien Phu. After 11 days, De Castries collapsed and didn't come out of his bunker again, and the paratrooper, Lt Col. Langlais informed de Castries that he was now in charge. The Viet-Minh artillery cut off the airstrips and the garrison had to rely on airdrops from greater and greater heights.The doomed French forces put up noble resistance and one by one the strong points fell. Eventually on May 7th 1954, de Castries's bunker was taken, and a silence fell over the battlefield. C'est fini.In hind sight modern readers sit and wonder why the French left the garrison in situ, even though their intelligence knew what was coming. It seems everyone agreed that they would play the end-game near the Laotian border, in the Monsoons. General Vo countered every move and won an important military and political victory."},{"Title":"Hell in a very small place;: The siege of Dien Bien Phu (A Vintage Book)","review":"Since the fall of the Soviet Union, improved relations with China and the normalization of relations with Vietnam historians have had greater access to materials and persons involved in the battle than did Fall writing in the 1960's at the height of the US Vietnam War. The works of Ted Morgan (\\"Valley of Death\\") and Martin Windrow (\\"The Last Valley\\") did benefit from these more complete resources but Fall remains highly readable and uncontacdicted by the new data.I have read this book twice. The first time in 1968 just prior to my own tour in Vietnam. The second time was some thirty-plus years later when I stumbled upon a copy at a local thrift shop. My re-reading of Fall was much more rewarding than the first.

His books are standards I set for other books on the Vietnam War"},{"Title":"Hell in a very small place;: The siege of Dien Bien Phu (A Vintage Book)","review":"This is it! This is the book that should be in the library of every seriou student of the Indo-China War. While this book concerns itself with primarily one battle in the war that occupied France from 1946 through 1954, what a battle it was!The Battle of Dien Bien Phu (March 13-May 8, 1954) was not as long as some, but it played such an important role in what was to follow that years after the fact, the name Dien Bien Phu is still met with equal amounts of disdain for French folly and admiration for the resolve of the Viet Minh, who ultimately defeated the best of the French Expeditionary Corps.The late Bernard B. Fall has provided history students with a masterpiece of research, writing and scholarship. He first came to the attention of American military, political and diplomatic leaders in the early 1960s with his quintessential look at the French war effort in STREET WITHOUT JOY. He followed that success with HELL IN A VERY SMALL PLACE, which ironically was first released in early 1967, just weeks after the author was killed on Highway 1 (the old RC 1 - the Street Without Joy) while on patrol with United States Marines.When the reader first opens this one volume history, he encounters the reasons for the French seizure of a valley 175 miles from their headquarters and main source of supply. The French High Command in Tonkin decided that controlling this valley would deny the Viet Minh access to the highlands of neighboring Laos and the mountain peoples who were more loyal to the French than they were to the Vietnamese.After the airborne assault on the valley on 20 November 1953, the French consolidated their position and began to fortify the valley floor. A short time later, the field commander for Viet Minh forces, Vo Nguyen Giap decided that in order to ensure Viet Minh victory at the negotiating table, he must first inflict such a stunning defeat on French colonial forces that they will have no choice but to accede to Vietnamese nationalism and quit the &quot;crown jewel&quot; of their overseas empire.Fall does an exceptionally fine job of describing French and Communist preparations for the cataclysmic battle. While he goes into great depth and technical detail, he never forgets that armies are composed of men and he also delivers to the reader all of the key French and Viet Minh personalities. There are the names good students of this battle all know: there are Giap and Ho Chi Minh, Henri Navarre and Rene Cogny; we get to meet and know Colonel (later Brigadier General) Ferdinand Marie de la Croix de Castries, the aristocratic cavalry officer who commands French forces at Dien Bien Phu (and who is so totally unsuitable for the job). There is the paratroop &quot;mafia&quot; of young airborne officers who effectively take control of the fortress (Langlais, Bigeard, Botella, Brechignac, de Seguin-Pazzis, et al) and hold the Viet Minh at bay for 57 days.But the French Colonial Paratroops were not alone at Dien Bien Phu. There were also Foreign Legionnaires, Algerian and Moroccan rifles, Tunisians, Senegalese, Moroccan artillerymen, grounded air force pilots and maintenance crews, Vietnamese paratroopers and local mountain troops of the Red and White T'ai. Fall forgets nothing and leaves no one out. His detailed descriptions of the battles and the travails of the garrison are on a daily basis and no details are missed.Fall wrote this book with the help of the French Ministry of Defense, the North Vietnamese and after thousands of interviews with survivors of the battle (French, Communist Viet Minh, Vietnamese nationalist troops, Legionaires and the junior officers who learned bitter lessons in Indo-China and later applied them as they later attempted to keep Algeria French).This is a battle that has fascinated two generations of students and teachers alike. It is hard to imagine a better single volume discourse on the subject, especially as time moves us further away from the battle. It was a battle that changed the outcome of France's war and ultimately led to American involvement. For it was LBJ who denied the French the aerial assistance of the B-29 bombers at Clark Field in the Philippines and it was this same LBJ, who 11 years later committed American troops to the endless quagmire that ended his presidency and tore the United States apart.As a primer for the later American involvement, this book is mandatory reading for if for no other reason, it lays out the roadmap of French defeat and the limitless hubris of the United States as it stepped into the breach and tried to do what France could not. This is &quot;the&quot; book on the subject and it explains in vivid detail how one of the most modern armies of Europe could lose to a guerrilla force. It is about arrogance and hubris and anti-colonialist national aspirations.Although the main position at Dien Bien Phu fell on 7 May and Strongpoint Isabelle a day later on May 8th, France did not sign the Geneva Accords on Indo-China until July 22, 1954. As the Vietnamese saw the end of 85 years of colonial rule by Paris and as France pulled out in defeated shame, little did anyone know that the shadow of Dien Bien Phu would continue to haunt a world superpower for years to come.If you are not a student of this battle, I still recommend this book, because it is a natural starting point for anyone interested in finding out how America became embroiled in its longest and most divisive war."},{"Title":"Hell in a very small place;: The siege of Dien Bien Phu (A Vintage Book)","review":"If you have an interest in the history of the Vietnam War, or the Indochina War, then this is basically a must read, it will simply put the entire French war in Indochina in perspective for you (though I would also recommend you read &quot;Street Without Joy&quot;). As other reviewers have said, its almost appalling at the similarities between the French mistakes during their war in Indochina and the US's mistakes during its war, so much of it could have been avoided if the right people would have listened and done the proper background work on Vietnam. As far as the book goes, if you want to know something about the Battle of Dien Ben Phu, this book can tell you, it simply has everything, maps, strategies, the times and places that the individual attacks/counterattacks happened, absolutely everything. Yes, there are a lot of military terms and units that will be referenced in the book, but its still well worth the read. Also gives a nice buildup to the battle, as to what had been happening in the war up to that point, and why the French felt it necessary to take such a gamble behind enemy lines. Trust me, its a long book, but its all well worth it, and you will come away with a better understanding of how the French got there, and why we eventually took over after they pulled out. Its unfortunate that our men had to suffer or die needlessly because the right people didnt get their hands on some of the great books out of this era, things could have been a lot different, but hindsight is always 20-20."},{"Title":"Hell in a very small place;: The siege of Dien Bien Phu (A Vintage Book)","review":"For any fan of military history, and particularly for those interested in America's involvement in South-East Asia, &quot;Hell In A Very Small Place&quot; is crucial reading. It is long and it is packed with enormous detail, but it tells a fateful story very well. After having read most of the literature on 60's Vietnam and the \`American War' it was an eye-opener to learn of the role that the then US administration played in the French war of the 50's. 20/20 hindsight's a dangerous thing but after having read Fall's book one does wonder why the lessons of Dien Bien Phu and France's experience in Indo-China were not taken on board to a greater degree by subsequent American governments."},{"Title":"Hell in a very small place;: The siege of Dien Bien Phu (A Vintage Book)","review":"I read this book while serving as a helicopter pilot in Vietnam in 1967. I found the book in a Special Services Library. My first thought was, &quot;Has anyone in our government read this book?&quot; My second thought was, &quot;Why hasn't EVERY commander in Vietnam been required to read this book?&quot;There were so many parallels to so many situations I observed in Vietnam that it was incredible. Two that immediately came to mind were Khe Sanh and Dak To, both located in valleys surrounded by higher ground, safely accessible only by air and isolated from the nearest major support facilities.We never benefitted from any of the lessons that the Viet Minh taught the French and we let the Viet Cong teach them to us all over again.Bernard B. Fall wrote from the persective of a former member of the French military and continued to write throughout most of the American involvement. He died covering the war in Vietnam. Other books by Mr. Fall include: Vietnam Reader, Vietnam Witness, The Viet Minh Regime and Street Without Joy."},{"Title":"Hell in a very small place;: The siege of Dien Bien Phu (A Vintage Book)","review":"I came of age during the Viet Nam War. It was a time of turmoil and discontent as a nation. The \\"lessons\\" we learned then now seem to have been faulty in many ways and the mistakes of the past are influencing the present. However, before America had to face the Vietnamese dilemna, it was France that first faced the challenge. As a youth, I knew of the critical battle of Dien Bien Phu but, until I read Bernard Fall's \\"The Siege of Dien Bien Phu\\", my understanding of that battle was as faulty as my understanding of the American Vietnamese experience.I had known that Dien Bien Phu was a battle that saw a technologically challenged Viet Minh army riding bikes to the remote location while superiorly trained French forces looked to carry the day. The ability of the Viet Minh to surprise the French with their numbers and armaments led to a quick demise that saw the French army surrender in shame. Well, now I know better. Like the book \\"We were Soldiers Once...And Young\\", \\"The Siege of Dien Bien Phu\\" is a masterfully told acount of a battle with keen insight as to what went wrong and what could have gone right. The litany of errors made by the French led to more and more setbacks until only a miracle (in the form of massive US Air Force involvement) could have rescued the day. What impressed me the most after finishing this book, was the heroics of both sides and the ability of the French to nearly pull out a victory. In the end I was dismayed to discover that far more French soldiers died in captivity than did in battle. In another Asiatic \\"Long March\\" reminiscent of the Bataan Death March, many weakened fighting men died and even more died once they got to their prison camps. Brave fighting men of both sides deserved better fates and we know of the bravery because of Fall's excellent focus on the day to day ebb and flo of the battle. The roughly 53 day long engagement is told in an exhaustingly realistic narrative. I found myself wondering how anybody, especially the French forces, could ever get any sleep in that \\"Hell in a Very Small Place\\". I also found myself bewildered as more and more French paratroopers were airlifted into battle on a daily basis. It is true courage to knowingly go into harm's way when you know that harm holds the winning hand. The greatness of \\"The Siege of Dien Bien Phu\\" is Fall's ability to bring such heroics to life while always maintaining a focus on the ongoing events.At times the book bogs down briefly while examining the international political negotiations surrounding the battle. However, I came to appreciate the tedium of those few sections in the book by understanding the soldiers perspective; the soldiers were living day to day while the diplomats were taking their own sweet time.I can't say enough about the impact that \\"The Siege of Dien Bien Phu\\" had on me. Like \\"A Bridge Too Far\\" it is a book that showcases the gallantry of the best of 20th Century warriors. War is Hell, as Sherman said, and the hell is ever present in the book. Yet we come to realize that civilizations survive by the extra-human efforts of such men as are presented in this book. France had much to be angry about after the battle ended but it had nothing to be ashamed of...nor did the Viet Minh soldiers."},{"Title":"Hell in a very small place;: The siege of Dien Bien Phu (A Vintage Book)","review":"Bernard Fall's book, HELL IN A VERY SMALL PLACE is the definitive history of the battle of Dien Bien Phu, a battle that had serious implications for generations to follow. In it, he recounts in detail the planning and execution of the battle at all levels. The possibility that a small, preindustrial state like Vietnam could defeat a modern army never entered the minds of the French, until it was too late.The Communists were adept at waging war at the military and political levels simultaneously. In order for the political, main attack to succeed, Dien Bien Phu had to be in Communist hands prior to the Geneva Convention. The number of casualties the North Viets had to sustain was irrelevant so long as they got what they wanted: a strong bargaining position at Geneva. After France left, if Communism was going to be contained in Indochina, America was going to have to do it.Communist tactics such as moving artillery pieces and the tons of ammunition to support them down seemingly impassable roads and digging anaconda-like trenches around French positions slowly choking the life out of the garrison would soon be seen again by American soldiers. Western planning books said this could not be done. The books were wrong. They would still be wrong a few years later when the Americans arrived.On the political front, France was reduced to begging for American air support to save the beleagured garrison and with it, their entire position in Indochina. The question of whether the U.S. could or should intervene and if so, how, was debated at the highest levels for weeks. As the politicians and diplomats bickered, the garrison slowly suffered, bled, and died.HELL IN A VERY SMALL PLACE is a manual for communist political and military tactics used in Vietnam. Our failure to heed the lessons learned there cost many Americans their lives. We indeed failed to learn from the mistakes of the past. As usual, it was the soldiers on the ground who paid the price for those mistakes with their lives."},{"Title":"Hell in a very small place;: The siege of Dien Bien Phu (A Vintage Book)","review":"I knew virtually nothing about Dien Bien Phu other than the standard types of things that it was the pivotal battle of the First Indochina War, effectively ended French colonialsim in SE Asia, etc. and decided to buy this book to learn more. In short, if you have any interest in military history, French or US history, or are just looking for a good read, don't hesitate to buy this book. There is an ENORMOUS amount of detail about the battle in this book, but it is wonderfully written with a deft prose. This is not some dry scholarly work that will require discipline to finish. You will feel the agony of the French soldiers as they continue to hold on while the Viet Minh are slowly squeezing them. I literally could not put this book down.The book starts with a description of the initial parachute drop into Dien Bien Phu, then backtracks a bit to set the stage and introduce the players. Fall then describes the build-up by the Viet Minh through a horrendous jungle supply line, and the preparation of the position by the French. The bulk of the book describes in great detail the siege. Outlying positions are reduced and pressure is slowly but steadly put on the central position until it is finally overrun. There is an incredible amount of detail here, the battles are often described (from the French side at least) at the platoon level. Perhaps the most interesting chapter is the discuss of Great Game politics between the US, France, and Britian as DBP is slowly being strangled. One thing that I never realized is that there was an intimate link between the French war in Indochina and the US/UN police action in Korea.There are several specific points made in this book that may be of general interest. First, Fall does not specifically blame one individual or decision for the catastrophe at Dien Bien Phu, but he does point out errors. He also dispells several myths that have grown up around the battle. For example, the French made several key errors in judgement by overestimating the effect of their own artillery, underestimating the effect of the Viet Minh artillery, not having a clear goal as to why a battle was being fought at Dien Bien Phu in the first place, among a host of other. One of the most interesting things stated by Fall though is that Dien Bien Phu was a failure of combat engineering. French intelligence knew that the Viet Minh were transporting 105 mm howitzers to the battle area. The fortifications required to defend a fixed position against such artillery were well known from WWII. The airlift capability of the French Air Force was in no possible way capable of delivering the required materials to protect 10,000 men. Fall discounts the idea that French intel failed (they predicted the size of the Viet Minh army at Dien Bien Phu to 10%). Fall also states that only a relatively small fraction of the Legionnaires at DBP were Germans. From other research, this claim seems still to be controversial, but there is a myth that many of the defenders of Dien Bien Phu were former German/SS soldiers.I strongly disagree with one of the reviewer Paul Conners on several counts. First, this is not the \`definitive' work on the battle. Fall wrote this book in the mid-60s and had no access to Viet Minh records. He did have some access to soldiers who fought on the Viet Minh side, but the complete story can only be told once full access to Viet Minh records is given to (Western) professional historians. This is, however, one of the best works of military history ever written in my view, even if it is not complete. Second, this is not an all encompassing account of the First Indochina War. Fall does put the battle into perspective of the larger war at some level, but this is certainly not his emphasis. Having read this book, I'm left with the feeling that I need to put it into a larger perspective. Don't let these small criticisms of the book (or of Mr. Conner's otherwise excellent review) prevent you from buying the book. I simply wanted to clarify a few points.Finally, several of the reviewers used their reviews to take shots at the French soldiers and officier (cowards, incompetent, etc.). I think after reading this book you will have a new appreciation for the French soldiers. Yes, mistakes were made by the French leadership in many aspects of the battle, but to call them cowardly or incompetent shows that these reviewers have no idea what they are talking about. Are General Navarre and his staff any less incompetent than General Westmoreland a decade later, or the current US (political and military) leadership in Iraq?

By the time of the final French collapse, the area left in their hands was virtually the size of a baseball diamond.This book, along with End Of The Line:The Seige Of Khe Sanh, is absolutely essential reading for anybody who wants to understand some of the key differences between the Western and Vietnamese approaches to combat and politics.While nobody could doubt the courage of the French soldiers, who were plunged into a cauldron of Death by a group of arrogant and totally out of touch leaders, you cannot fail to admire the courage and skill of a relentless and ingenious Enemy.The idea of setting up a base in a remote valley to draw in Enemy units and destroy them, was fatally flawed for several reasons. As the book shows, one of them being the failure to conceive of the VM's ability to deploy significant numbers of artillery pieces and anti-aircraft units so quickly and so far away.Yet the real nail in the French coffin lay in the fact that unlike the British and Americans, the French had no strategic heavy bombers. By comparison, the Air operation (Operation Niagara) in support of the Marine garrison at Khe Sanh in 1968 (during the Tet offensive) began with a strike by 36 B-52 bombers, each carrying a 30 ton payload.The small single-engined French planes could barely carry any weapons load, especially at such extreme range. Even then, they often fell prey to the radar-predicted flak that nobody believed the VM could deploy. Naturally, it was all courtesy of the Communist Chinese.Fall gives you a tremendous overview of the entire disaster, from the political machinations to the ghastly conditions on the base. One of the commanders who had refused extra artillery before the main battle began, shot himself. The desperate measures employed by the French included dropping two tanks in pieces, which the Army engineers assembled on the ground, and which caused havoc among the VM until they were overwhelmed by suicide squads, firing point blank into the observation slits and rolling grenades down the barrels of the guns.Hell indeed. Not just for the troops, but for the hopelessly overworked doctor, who had to crawl over a pile of amputated limbs to reach his bunk.As another reviewer mentioned, the French finally had to beg for US air support, and while the US decided not to commit carrier-based strike aircraft (they also decided against a tactical nuclear strike because of the danger to French troops), they did provide the French with a squadron of B-26's, two of which were shot down on the first raid by radar-controlled flak, at 10,000 feet. While these bombers may have made some difference had they arrived much earlier, the writing was really on the wall from Day One.A disaster, yes, and it should have been a wake up call. The clowns who sent US troops into Nam in the early sixties should have known that you cannot fight a vague holding operation against such a resourceful and fanatical enemy. The only reason the US fatalities did not far exceed 58,000 is because of the massive tactical and strategic air support that the French simply never had. Equally, the US helicopter force provided a level of mobility and close air support that simply did not exist at the time of Dien Bien Phu. The same helicopters saved countless lives by (usually) rapidly evacuating wounded to field hospitals where they could receive urgently needed surgery.Imagine Vietnam without the Hueys, the B-52's, the Phantoms, the Skyraiders, the AC-130's, the miniguns, the firebases, the Daisy Cutters, the cluster munitions, the Fuel-Air bombs, the napalm, the phosporous, the satellite photographs, the U-2 and SR-71 flights, the night vision equipment, the armoured units, the God-bless-'em-all men AND women who sewed everybody back together, and you will have some idea of what the French boys faced at Dien Bien Phu.As somebody else rightly said, it's a pity none of the US \\"planners\\" ever actually read anything about the French experience.An essential book."},{"Title":"Hell in a very small place;: The siege of Dien Bien Phu (A Vintage Book)","review":"Most books like this -- tightly focused on a single, poorly-known battle -- are dry and techical.

He is perhaps the most well known of &quot;French&quot; authors of the period simply because he was among the very few writing in English. As for his book, it is certainly long, occasionally hard to read, but an important account of this politically significant battle.Dien Bien Phu was not the first time that the French high command had tried to lure the Viet Minh battle corps into committing itself to a fight. De Lattre had done so at Hoa Binh in late '51 through early '52, and had found himself forced to withdraw French forces back to Hanoi after Giap shut the Black River and Colonial Route 6 main supply routes down. Giap emereged from Hoa Binh the winner, at least in the eyes of the junior officers who fought there. Later that year, the French tried the air-land base concept at Na San, further up the Black River on the road to Dien Bien Phu, but Salan was intelligent enough to declare victory and get out before the rainy season began in earnest.It was Salan who launched the Dien Bien Phu operation, ostensibly for building a CGMA guerrilla base, who thereafter took his entire staff home and left Navarre and his newbies on the hook. Both sides still bitterly debate who really made the fateful decision to draw the line at Dien Bien Phu. What subsequently took place was the destruction of the French Strategic Reserve, not the French Army in Indochina itself. But, akin to our own Tet-68 battle, this translated into a Viet Minh victory in the political arena. The peace conference then convening in Geneva, gave them ample opportunity to exploit that.Jules Roy's book, the Battle of Dien Bien Phu, is another fine work, and while pertinent, both had very little to offer U.S. tactical fighters of the 1962-72 period. Our problem was that the &quot;down in the trenches view&quot; of that war, which would have been very useful, had yet to be penned by the Trinquiers, Loustaus, Cabiros, and Denois de St. Marcs, all of whom had left Indochina to go on to a further via-crucis in Algeria, followed by the 13 May 1958 revolt, the April 1961 Putsch, and either exile, jail, or early retirement into obscurity.Theirs were the experiences that we really needed to study."},{"Title":"Hell in a very small place;: The siege of Dien Bien Phu (A Vintage Book)","review":"It truly is a masterpiece.

It covers not only the entire battle of Dien Bien Phu, day by day, in minute details, mostly seen from the French and US points of view, but it also explains the political and military causes and consequences of this unique battle which marked the end of the first Indochina war between the Ho Chi Minh led North Vietnamese communist independence force supported by the People's Republic of China, and France supported financially and militarily by the US.This book, which is loaded with official or personal references, contains many political and military lessons for what would become the second Indochina war, with the US replacing France, lessons which were apparently and un fortunately often not learned or understood, or could not be applied in the Cold War context of that period.What it also remarkable in this book is that it manages to cover the entire spectrum, from the strategic \\"big picture\\" to what happened to many individuals who were major or minor actors or victims in this dramatic battle, whether officers and soldiers in the field or politicians and generals in capitals and headquarters. In addition to the detailed description of all the tactical and technical military challenges and developments, the horrors of war are here on display, as well as the courage and initiative that some people can muster in such dramatic situations, on both sides.This is truly a book that should be made mandatory reading in colleges. Indeed, it is a great description and analysis of the drama and horrors of military confrontations as well as of the context and development of the Indochina war and Vietnam's struggle to regain its independence in a period which saw the progressive end of colonialism and the expansion of the Cold War.

Even a quick read will reveal the author's intent of drawing attention to the relationship of the follies of the occupying power in the First Indochina War to those of the different-but-related occupying power in the Second -a conflict which, alas, the author did not survive- but what I couldn't get out of my mind is the striking similarity in ATTITUDES between the French in Vietnam in the 1950's and the U.S. in,say, Iraq in 2005. Yes, the wars ARE very diferent, yes, the landscapes and some of the local tactics are also very different, but in both settings we have the enormous hubris of the occupier, the stubborn reliance on technology, and the equally stubborn refusal of a foe to just give up and settle for what the occupier is willing to offer.

Newlywed Judith Paige hires Nameless to find out if her husband is having an affair. Nameless follows Walter Paige to a motel room in Cypress Bay, where Paige is murdered. Nameless must found out who murdered Paige, and investigates. As he investigates, the list of suspects grows. This novel is not one of Pronzini's best-known books, but it is well worth reading, especially if you're planning to read all the Nameless Detective mysteries."},{"Title":"Undercurrent","review":"In 1971, author Bill Pronzini was only 27 when he wrote The Snatch, building on a shorter and different version of the story that appeared in the May 1969 issue of Alfred Hitchcock's Mystery Magazine under the same title. With the publication of this book, one of detective fiction's great characters was born with full fledged power and authenticity. If you have not yet read the Nameless Detective novels by Mr. Pronzini, you have a major treat ahead of you. Many of these are now out-of-print, so be sure to check your library for holdings in near-by cities.The Nameless Detective is referred to that way because Mr. Pronzini never supplies a name until the fifth book in the series, Twospot, although he begins toying with the reader about this point in the fourth book in the series, Blowback. I won't reveal that name here.Mr. Pronzini presents a world in which many men take evil actions to further selfish interests, and many women and children suffer because of that selfishness. The police and private investigators suffer along with the victims, for evil-doing has painful consequences for everyone. Mr. Pronzini's plots are complex, yet he provides plenty of clues to help you identify the evil-doer on your own. Despite the transparency of many plots, he successfully uses plot complications to keep the action interesting and fresh.But the reason to read the books is because of the character development for the Nameless Detective. Nameless is a former police officer in San Francisco who collects pulp fiction about tough private detectives. Overcome by the evil he sees as a police officer and drawn to the complex imagery of the strong, silent hero who rights wrongs, Nameless tries to live that role as a private detective. But he has trouble getting clients, and operating as a one-man shop causes him to lead a lonely existence. In his personal life, his career keeps women at a distance. Like a medieval knight errant, he sticks to his vows and pursues doing the right thing . . . even when it doesn't pay. At the same time, he's very aware of art, culture and popular trends. And he doesn't like much of what he sees. At the same time, he's troubled by a hacking cough that cigarettes make worse . . . but doesn't really want to know what causes his phlegm to rise. He's been afraid of doctors since he saw them operating on wounded men during World War II.The books are also written in a more sophisticated version of the pulp fiction style, employing greater style through language and plot. The whole experience is like looking at an image in a series of mirrors that reflect into infinity.These books are a must for those who love the noir style, and the modern fans of tough detectives with a heart of gold like Spenser . . . and can live without the wise cracks and repartee.In Undercurrent, the third book in the Nameless Detective series, a new bride, Judith Paige, asks Nameless to find out what her husband is doing on his extended weekend &quot;business&quot; trips that add over two hundred miles to his car's odometer. When her husband, Walter, returns from these trips, he's not very interested in her. Naturally, she fears she is being betrayed. It's a nice day in San Francisco, and Nameless doesn't want to have to look into the dirty linen of her marriage. However, he comforts himself with the thought that she may be imagining things, and takes the case. Immediately, he regrets the decision . . . knowing how much it will hurt if he finds out that Walter Paige has been cheating on her.The next day, Nameless trails Paige to the small village of Cypress Bay on the Monterey Peninsula where Paige checks into a motel cabin. Nameless rents the next one over, and settles down to watch. He follows Paige to a near by park, where he meets a man for an extended conversation. Nameless cannot overhear what is said, even after strolling past. Then Paige returns to his cabin. When no one comes or goes through the rest of the afternoon, Nameless gets bored and decides to walk around to the beach side of Paige's cabin . . . and finds an open doorway with Paige dead inside the cabin.Encouraged by the local police, Nameless stays on to assist in the investigation of the death . . . even after Mrs. Paige returns to San Francisco. An unexpected book in the cabin starts a trail that leads to more violence and hidden lies all across the community.The story is very authentic to the concept of the Nameless Detective. He does most of his detecting in an effort to be helpful, not because he is being paid. The connection to literature and the author's own career are more palpable than in the earlier two stories. So there's a nice set of irony to appreciate as you realize that there's an element of Bill Pronzini in the character, Russell Dancer, who's been a prolific pulp and western short story writer and novelist for many years. It's not only Nameless who is living a dream in this book.The story returns to the complexity that Mr. Pronzini so ably displayed in The Snatch. There are many secrets and lies to hide them in Cypress Bay, and most of the secrets and lies play unexpected roles in explaining who Walter Paige was and why he was in town.One of the strengths of the novel is that you will feel the disgust that Nameless experiences as he explores the tawdry side of a wholesome, innocent young woman's marriage.After you withdraw emotionally from this powerful book, think about where you should know more about others before you trust them. How can you find out without creating barriers to creating mutual trust?"},{"Title":"Undercurrent","review":"First Sentence: It was one of those jobs you take on when things are very lean.\\"Nameless\\" is hired by a lovely young wife to find out whether her husband was being unfaithful. \\"Nameless\\" follows the husband to a hotel of cottages in Cypress Bay (Carmel), sees him meet with a bald man and return to his hotel room.When, hours later, \\"Nameless\\" realizes the cottage may have a backdoor, he investigates and finds the husband has been murdered. An anomaly in the victim's possessions is an old pulp detective novel by a writer who lives in the area.There are a lot of wonderful and fun things about reading books in this series. The story takes place in the days where many men still wore hats, smoking was common, no one had cell phones and you couldn't just look things up on the internet. The latter was really made apparent when the characters were trying to track down a copy of an old book and I think of how easy it is to do that these days. There is also an interesting commentary on the state of writers and publishers. The worry, during this time, was that television and computers would make writers of fiction and printed matter obsolete.Pronzini, even in these early books, is a wonderful writer. His powers of descriptions add so much to his work. Although he renamed Carmel, I could envision exactly where the characters where. But more impressively, at one point he the fatigue that can overcome a detective while waiting for something to happen on a case. This particular story was not one of my favorite from Pronzini.The plot felt overly contrived and unconvincing to me, but it was still very cleverly done and well written. Pronzini, particularly the \\"Nameless\\" series, is someone I always recommend."},{"Title":"Undercurrent","review":"Over the years, I have read many of Bill Pronzini's \\"Nameless Detective\\" novels, whenever I could find one at a used bookstore. More recently, Amazon has allowed me to add some of the missing titles to my collection.I have long thought of Pronzini as a skilled storyteller and my favorite among a group of able writers of light, straight, credible detective fiction which includes his wife Marcia Muller and Sue Grafton. Although sometimes weak on plot and veering at times into melodramatic action, his books' characterizations, dialogue, descriptions of varied California locales, attention to detail, deadpan humor, and smooth, easy writing style usually make them a pleasure to read. His \\"Nameless Detective\\" is low-key, competent, and serious-minded, part slob and part romantic, despite being beaten down by reality. Pronzini regularly has fun with the character by humbling him with embarrassing or bad-luck situations and tests it by putting him through the ringer of traumatic experiences.I recently returned to the \\"Nameless\\" series following an extended absence, during which I had slogged through an almost unreadable non-\\"Nameless,\\" Pronzini-Muller collaboration, Beyond The Grave. After being somewhat disappointed by two of the later \\"Nameless\\" books, Sentinels and Illusions, I turned for solace to Undercurrent, Pronzini's third, written over 30 years ago. Unfortunately, I was disappointed in other ways.As far as it goes, Undercurrent is not a bad book, which is why I give it three stars. The writing is crisper, more focused, and faster-moving than some of Pronzini's other books. The tone is fresher, more energetic, and less world-weary. Although the usual humor is missing, and less attention is paid to Nameless' personal circumstances, there are enough character touches to maintain some interest. In short, the book is more of a serious, lean, straight-ahead narrative of a \\"Nameless\\" investigation -- this time hired by a newlywed to look into her husband's suspicious weekend trips to a town further along the California coast.My problem with the book is the feeling that while the material might have sustained a short story, it is too thin and too lacking in depth, richness, and substance to fill out a full-length novel. Maybe in this early book Pronzini was still transitioning from being a short-story writer.Despite its title and pretensions, nothing in Undercurrent cuts much beneath the surface in terms of invention, interest, intensity, or meaning. The description of the coastal town is sketchy and unmemorable, sub-par for Pronzini. The interactions between Nameless and the residents are abrupt, short, and largely unrevealing (a partial exception is Nameless's conversation with the self-described \\"hack\\" pulp fiction writer, but the writer is a fairly marginal character who can only provide hazy background). There is no nuance to the husband's character, which is drawn little better than the shadowy thugs who are his confederates. Similarly, the book treats the wife as nothing more than a poor, broken-hearted, small-town innocent taken in by a con man (and the book never really explains why it was in his character to have bothered). This comes across as simplistic, patronizing, over-sentimentalistic, tedious, and inconsistent with her so quickly acting on a sense that there was something wrong and hiring a private detective. The \\"hardworking, good guy\\" police chief, who not quite believably gives Nameless the free run of the investigation, is nothing special. The other characters flash by as mere blurs who we never get to know or care about. Much of the later part of the book is spent trying to chase down characters who have repeatedly stonewalled and either never open up or suddenly, at the last minute, tell all. The book feels more like a thin police procedural than keen, observant interrogation and detection.The two main subplots involving the client's husband -- one a long-running personal involvement, the other a scheme for a crime -- are unconnected and far too shallow, trite, uninvolving, and predictable. Neither is particularly clever or intricate. Nor do they come to light through any especially interesting legwork or deduction (for example, a mundane verbal slip figures prominently). The crimes are all relatively crude and uninteresting, the solutions anticlimactic.The book makes repeated references to \\"undercurrents being brought to the surface,\\" but this never develops into a meaningful, insightful theme. In the end, all the book offers on that level (mainly through expansive, last-minute confessions to the police) are a few hastily described, cliche personal predicaments caused by the husband, one of which is totally irrelevant to the events in the book. It is a surprisingly lifeless, perfunctory variant on the \\"town-with-deep-dark-secrets\\" plot.Others may (and on this site appear to have done so) uncritically praise Undercurrent simply because it recalls to them a favored, nostalgic \\"noir\\" style of writing, reciting the largely superficial plot and character developments as though they were deep and affecting. On that level, the book is competent and displays real story-telling talent.But I found the substance of what it had to tell -- both about the crimes and about the characters -- to be disappointingly thin and unsatisfying. Overall, the book pales in comparison to my memory of Pronzini's much more vital, colorful, and intriguing book Hoodwink, about murder at a pulp writers' convention, which I think was the first Pronzini book I ever read. Having now recently struck out with both later and early Pronzini books, I can only hope that I can soon find another entry in the \\"Nameless\\" series that will recapture my fond memories of his work."},{"Title":"Tom Swift and His G-force Inverter","review":"The book was in excellent condition.

(Gospel Tract Publications, Glasgow, 1999)The aim of the \\"The Faith of God's Elect\\" is to compare the election of Scripture with the election of theology. I seek to show that they are incompatible, contradictory, and materially different.In Chapter1 we look at what the scriptures mean by election and predestination. All of God's purposes are centred in His Son. The Elect of God is His own beloved Son, our Lord Jesus Christ. Those who are in Him are chosen in Him. We share in His chosenness. The church is God's heavenly election, chosen in Christ before the foundation of the world, for blessings which are heavenly, spiritual and eternal. Election is not to salvation, but to blessings and purposes which follow salvation. Election applies exclusively to the redeemed, having no relevance to the unbeliever. Such is the election of Scripture.The election of theology, on the other hand, presents a very different picture. In Chapter 2 we trace the origin of the election of theology. We are asked to believe that God has elected by an unchangeable decree those persons whom He will save and those whom He will reject. We observe that this unscriptural idea had its origin in the ideas of Augustine of Hippo. The later Reformed school, considering this dogma to be orthodox doctrine, adopted Augustine's views of double predestination as the foundational premise of their system. They superimposed this misconception on the Scriptures and by a chain of deductive syllogisms arrived at five-point Calvinism. We argue that the technique of syllogistic logic comes from Aristotle and is a totally inappropriate method for the formulation of Christian doctrine.In Chapter3 we offer a critique of the 5 points of Calvinism and also critically appraise the methodology used in their formulation. We argue that the 5 points are not derived by sound inductive Bible exposition, but are the result of faulty deductive reasoning.In Chapter 4 we have appealed for an approach to Scripture which will neither add to, nor take away from, the sacred text.The conclusion of the book is that Calvinist theology seriously misrepresents the Scriptural themes of election and predestination. But by far the most serious outcome of this defective system is its implications for the gospel message. It is noted that on the last great day of the Feast of Tabernacles, the Lord Jesus stood up and cried in the temple : \\"If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink\\" (John 7:37). The temple would have been crowded with men from all parts of Israel, and from \`every nation under heaven'. Let us, for a moment, allow the Calvinist his assumption that God has eternally and unchangeably decreed the choices and destinies of all men. What implications would that have for the Lord's offer to those men in His hearing whom He had excluded from His election, and to whom He would deny the gift of faith? The implications are unthinkable. It would mean that the Lord was inviting non-elect men to Himself in bad faith. We submit that there must be something very wrong with a theology which could put such a shocking construction on the Lord's words, while distorting and removing the element of grace from the gospel message. Some have tolerated the obvious contradictions by appealing to imaginary parallel lines which are supposed to accommodate the contradictions. We are asked to believe that the contradictions are only apparent and will be resolved in eternity. But the contradictions and tensions are caused when we impose the misconceptions of theology on the Scriptures. When we keep to the Scriptures there are no contradictions. We agree with the advice of Sir Robert Anderson, quoted at the commencement of the book, that the Scriptural truth of election must be kept apart from the Augustinian doctrine.Many Christians assume without question that election refers to God's choice of certain sinners to life. Some have got locked in an argument between Calvinism and Arminianism as if there were no alternative. It is vital to realise that the election of Scripture does not relate to the salvation of the sinner, but to the saints and their blessings in Christ which follow salvation.The book concludes with the following: \\"When I am asked if I believe in God's election, I reply that I most certainly do. But lest there should be some misunderstanding between the questioner and myself, I hasten to add that I believe in the election of Scripture, not in the election of theology. The Scriptural truth of election does not limit or prejudice the gospel message in any way. The gospel is a genuine invitation to all men everywhere. Salvation is of the LORD and woe betide the person who would try to limit it according to human logic. It is the Spirit's work to convince the world of sin, righteousness and judgment. Salvation is entirely God's work, but rather than limiting the scope of the gospel, this glorious truth liberates it. Any person can become a vessel of mercy (Rom 9:23); one of Christ's sheep (John 10:9); one of the Father's given ones (John 6:37); one of those who shall believe on Him (John 17:20); and, gloriously true, one of God's elect (Titus 1:1). God is sovereign, and because of Calvary, He is free to save whom He pleases. The gospel message is that He is pleased to save those who believe. Let us shed our theological baggage and grasp this truth afresh with both hands. It is vital that the trumpet gives no uncertain sound on this note. Paul told Timothy to pray for all men, because God will have all men to be saved, and because the man Christ Jesus gave Himself a ransom for all (1 Tim 2:1-6). Who would dare put a limit on the ministry of the Holy Spirit? Who would limit the vastness of the love of God? Or like the clay dictating to the potter, who would dare to limit the sufficiency of Christ's death? We conclude our study by quoting again the great gospel truth which flows from the heart of a loving, gracious, and sovereign God to a world of lost and perishing sinners:\\"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved\\" (John 3:16-17).Submitted by John Parkinson (Author)"},{"Title":"How to Mow the Lawn: The Lost Art of Being a Man","review":"I think this book is brilliant.

If you want something cute (albiet impratical) for a gift, this will suffice, but if you're looking for actual advice on lawn care or home repair or building projects or any other aspect of old-fashioned \\"manliness\\", look elsewhere. A good general home-repair or home-improvement book would be much more helpful and practical, and basically all the other advice in this book is just common sense or nonsense. For example: advice on how to shave is found on the shaving cream container if you really need it, and instead of giving you detailed instructions on how to grill a steak, this book instructs men to imagine a circle around their grill and \\"let no one enter\\" after they \\"make sure there's someone near to bring you more beer.\\" Please!There are potentially useful sections on how to survive in the woods, how to host a dinner party, and basic first aid, but these instructions are so brief I think they could almost be worse than no instructions at all.If you're looking for a small gift to make a guy smile, get him something good to eat or a Calvin and Hobbes comic book.If you're looking for a stereotypically male gift that's more practical, get a book on tools, outdoor survival, home improvement, bartending, or grilling. Or better yet, get him actual tools.Overall, this book was a cute idea, but is not actually useful or helpful."},{"Title":"How to Mow the Lawn: The Lost Art of Being a Man","review":"Sam Martin has managed a delicate balancing act, mixing useful instruction on the basics of manly behavior with just the right amount of humor to make the lessons stick.Besides the titular skill, the most useful lessons in the humble opinion of this Not Quite But Would-Be Manly Man are the outdoor survival techniques discussed in Chapter 1, the simple vehicle maintenance tips in Chapter 2, the simple appliance repair and basic plumbing tips in Chapter 3, and the basic first aid and simple rescue tips in Chapter 9. Some reviewers have complained that the enclosed tips are TOO simple, TOO basic, and that you'd be better off reading larger, more detailed books, containing more thorough coverage of the given topic. Well, yes, if you find yourself interested enough in the subject to want to study home repair, home improvement, vehicle maintenance, first aid, etc., more thoroughly and completely, then of course you'd be better off reading further. But as something to pique your interest and get you started moving down the path to more traditional manliness,How to Mow the Lawn: The Lost Art of Being a Manis a pretty good start. I find myself looking forward to reading Mr. Martin's other instruction manuals for men and boys (but I repeat myself):How to Keep House: The Lost Art of Being a Man,Bringing Up Baby: The Modern Man's Guide to Fatherhood,How to Achieve Total Enlightenment: A Practical Guide to the Meaning of Life,ManSpace: A Primal Guide to Marking Your Territory,The Curious Boy's Book of AdventureandThe Curious Boy's Book of Exploration."},{"Title":"How to Mow the Lawn: The Lost Art of Being a Man","review":"Don't expect to read this book and know how to care for a lawn.

It is thorough, but remains accesible to the lay reader. Zimmerli brings Ezekiel's propheicies alive and makes them modern without getting sidetracked by the eschatological pitfalls which often beset commentators on Ezekiel. The only factor which limits the usefulness of this commentary is that Church curricula rarely focus on this prophet - a sad circumstance considering the relevance Ezekiel has for our times, as illuminated by Zimmerli.

The men of this village, (who presumably resisted the Nazis and their local collaborators) have been arrested or otherwise disappeared. Disfigured and unidentifiable bodies wash up on the shore of the river where the women wash clothes. The women follow the lead of Sofia Angelos, claiming the bodies are their spouses and pushing the military officer in charge of \\"pacifying\\" their village for a decent family burial.The European Nazi setting was chosen in hopes that this book would pass censors and be available in Pinochet's Chile, the actual setting envisioned by the author. For further disguise, there was to be an original European (Danish? French?) publication and a later Spanish translation by a prominent South American writer.The book does not live up to its idea. Too much is vague, unclear or, for its length, extraneous. First, the switch from third to a first person (and back again) seemed to be unnecessary styling; Figuring out the identity of the first person narrator was distracting. In proportion to the short text, there was too much time spent on Emmanuel and his girlfriend, and they (particularly she) are not that germane to the story. The final meeting of Sofia (Grandma) and the Captain and the thoughts (a jumble of maybe thought and thought dialog between Alexis and his Grandmother) are sketchy. Sofia says her husband wasn't involved in politics. It doesn't ring true, but there are only vague clues as to why the men of this town were targets for the authorities. The gap between Chapters 7 and 8 is disappointing and makes for a unsatisfyingly vague ending.The idea is very good. Some of the dialogs such as the Captain and the priest, the Captain and the journalist, the trial, Yanina defending Serguei to Sofia, and Emmanuel describing his talk with his mentor are excellent and you can see how this has been brought to the stage. There are glimpses of character, such as that of Father Gabriel, the Angelos family, the Captain and the landowner Kastoria that illustrate the forces at work in an occupation. This could be a very powerful work because it has many good elements, but I see this novel as a missed opportunity."},{"Title":"Wildland Fire Apparatus: 1940-2001 Photo Gallery","review":"This is added to my collection and if it is about fire fighting of any kind that is awesome since i am a firefighter."},{"Title":"Wildland Fire Apparatus: 1940-2001 Photo Gallery","review":"Wildland Fire Apparatus: 1940-2001 Photo GalleryThis is what my son was asking for.

While in China he meets a young Chinese woman named Nulinh who works in her father's store on the military base and there is an immediate attraction between the two. Since Jeff is in a committed relationship with another woman back home, the two decide to become friends. In addition, they both realize that their cultural differences would make it difficult for them to pursue a romantic relationship. However, after a series of difficult events they discover that there may be a chance for love after all. The war serves as a backdrop for the story and between the battle scenes and the slowly developing story of forbidden love, this story has a wide reaching appeal.For the most part I enjoyed this story, but the pace of the book lacked continuity. There were times early in the book when I felt the story dragged along, but the last 100 pages seemed more like a race to finish the story and tie up loose ends in the plot. As a result, the relationship between Nulinh and Jeff was slow getting started but then seemed to progress unrealistically. The author did an excellent job providing enough back story so readers could understand what made the characters tick. He also did an impressive job including period related details such as desegregation of the US military and racism into the storyline, though there were a few anachronisms in the book. For example, there were times the characters used slang that was out of period. With stronger editing HAVE YOU EVER? could have easily been a five star book.

The focus of the latter two thirds of the book is \\"the role of paintings in the lives of wealthy Amsterdam families, particularly those in which human figures feature prominently\\". Indeed, they rely heavily on inventories produced by one man, Jan Pietersz Zomer, one of the first in the emerging 17th century profession of art dealer.The authors remind us that the picture which these paintings present - the fair of face, the cultured, sunny skies - are idealised, or exaggerated - drunken low-lifes, tavern scenes, the evils of tobacco and gambling - just as in today's scenic and humorous postcards. I wanted to know more: what do the (more true-to-life) drawings and prints tell us? the lyrics of popular songs?What of sources from other cities? Amsterdam was one of the largest and richest mercantile cities in the world: what about industrial Delft? the university town of Leiden? the aristocrats of the Hague? and what about the country folk (\\"boeren\\", farmers as well as peasants)? On the vexed question of gender roles, why were the four officially-appointed valuers (\\"schatsters\\") in Amsterdam all women? what do the records of their guild tell us?And crucially, I wanted to know how Amsterdammers from all walks of life dealt with the contradictions between what these paintings show and tell, and their heart-felt religion, which the clerics of the Protestant conversion (\\"de Alteratie\\" which formed Amsterdam) preached from the pulpit and the pamphlet. The extensive bibliography signposts some paths for further searching."},{"Title":"Never Without Heroes: Marine Third Reconnaissance Battalion in Vietnam, 1965-70","review":"Great book.

This book is well-written, with a lot of attention to personal details, from the heroic to the humorous...to the tragic. The men of Third Recon earned four Medals of Honor, 13 Navy Crosses, 72 Silver Stars, and numerous Bronze Stars and Purple Hearts. They took many casualties and inflicted many more on a tough, professional enemy. The book had a personal note for me, an account of a rocket attack I was on the receiving end of in July of 1967, with details I didn't know. As a Radio Relay Team Chief, I was lucky enough to be in a much safer billet with Regt. HQ than these guys, but this book made me proud to have worn the same uniform.

Going through the opening content is well worth the price as he gradually makes you more intimate with the real-life characters in the battalion. He makes his point over and over again interestingly and convincingly without being boringly repeitive. The text will bring tears sometimes and laughs another. The story is woven into the context of the times: the news media's reports, the political manipulations, the &quot;high&quot; command's good points and bad points; all convincingly. A good read for anybody who cares about what Vietnam was about at the ground level but, also, a must read for those who don't think they care. Vetter finds homeplate on at least two points: The American public's lament at the time that, &quot;there aren't any heroes left;&quot; and that the intelligence i! nformation was almost always there and good, but it didn't always fit the some of the generals' agendas. A good &quot;keeper&quot; in the shelf as a constant reference source for this aspect of the combat in Vietnam.

All of the stories are more or less directly related to the theme of 'exile'. Many are about people who were uprooted by the war and had to leave their homes permanently. Indeed, the majority of the stories is about the legacy of the war in one way or another. Other themes in the stories include gender issues (especially 'The Last of Hanak'o), stigmatisation and discrimination faced by families of 'defectors' to North Korea ('Scarlet Fingernails') etc. Some of the newer stories are not related to the war or major historical events and are about exile in a less direct way: a mentally ill person going on a vacation to recover in 'Conviction' or the secret desire for a healthy young woman of a middle-aged man whose wife is gradually succumbing to cancer in 'From powder to powder'.I think that one of the best stories is 'Land of Exile': The protagonist is involved in very different ways in three periods of Korean history: as a common peasant in the pre-war period, a People's Committee official during the brief occupation by the Korean People's Army and later a construction worker unable to return home for fear of being punished (killed) for his involvement in purges of a local landlord family. 'Kapitan Ri' is an intriguing depiction of a typical collaborator, willing to sacrifice his compatriots and even his own children and ally himself to every external power (Japanese, Russians, Americans) for his own benefit. 'The Last of Hanak'o's story of an awkward relation between a female designer and her university friends shows persisting stereotypes of the \\"unobtrusive and comforting female\\" and violence against women.Given the general theme of 'exile', there is a relatively strong focus on dramatic events such as the war, violently suppressed student demonstrations and escape from hostile regimes. Less dramatic or more gradual, constant themes in Korea are often dealt with less explicitly, but they are there, too: poverty, urbanization ('A Dream of Good Fortune'), gender issues (see above), harsh working conditions and low wages during the economic miracle ('Land of Exile').I found some of the stories a bit difficult to understand. But with the information provided in the introduction and at the beginning of each story I think I was able to get them.This book was very useful for me as a complement for history books and also because of its insights into Korean culture."},{"Title":"Land of Exile: Contemporary Korean Fiction (Unesco Collection of Representative Works)","review":"These comments refer to the first edition, published in 1993, not the revised edition published in 2007 with four additional newer works.The 1993 edition contained 12 short stories by as many writers, ranging from the late 1940s to the mid-1980s.

The youngest writers were Ch'oe Inho (1945-), O Chonghui (1947-), called one of the best female authors of the 1970s, and Im Ch'oru (1954-).Others included Chon Kwangyong (1919-88), Pak Wanso (1931-) -- another memorable female author from the 1970s -- Kim Sungok (1941-), Yun Heunggil (1942-) -- described as one of the writers best known abroad, Cho Chongnae (1943-) and Hwang Sogyong (1943-), called a major representative of the 1970s generation.So far as this reader is aware, these authors have lived mainly in South Korea, although some were born in the north, Manchuria or Japan. One, Hwang Sogyong, lived in the United States ca. 1989-93 after visiting North Korea, before returning to the south and enduring jail for several years.According to the brief introduction, modern Korean literature initially was modeled to a large degree on Western forms. In fiction the main influences were French and Russian realism, and realism maintained its predominance during the period the book covered. In the 20th century, writers frequently portrayed the country's harsh historical realities -- a rigid social and political structure, oppressive colonial rule by the Japanese, post-1945 chaos, and political tension and war resulting in division into north and south. Thereafter, as the north disappeared behind an iron curtain, in the south there was the imposition of military rule from the 1960s and accelerating industrialization, before democratization from the 1990s. Throughout these periods, major themes in the literature have been alienation, isolation and frustration -- forms of exile from the self, other people or society in general.In the collection, the stories from all decades were concerned mainly with broken families, urban squatters, ex-cons, political dissidents, social parasites, childless couples and soldiers lost in the mountains. Some of the stories seemed merely dark and drab, while others impressed for their artistry.Most distinctive for this reader was Chon's \\"Kapitan Ri\\" (1962), about a proud, xenophobic man who'd compromised with and survived all changes of government; despite the great personal and social cost, he was still going strong and plotting his next advance. Cho's \\"Land of Exile\\" (1981), on the other hand, was about a man whose entire life was blighted by circumstance -- the class system before the war, betrayal by a Communist soldier afterward, and poverty in the capitalist south. O's \\"The Bronze Mirror\\" (1982) showed first the individual problems of an aging husband, grief-stricken wife and nervous little girl, before bringing them all together in a beautifully described but bitter conclusion. Kim Tongni's story from the 1950s concerned a forest-dweller's revenge on bullying soldiers. Hwang Sogyong's piece from the 1970s showed the poor living like animals on wasteland that was soon to be destroyed by urban growth.Many of the other stories seemed slight in comparison -- a man returned to his struggling wife, then left -- or contained too many twists and improbabilities -- a long-lost sister and father recognized because of a mole. Or they contained characters and situations I just wasn't able to sympathize with.Other recent collections of Korean fiction include Modern Korean Fiction: An Anthology (2005), Modern Korean Literature: An Anthology (1990), A Ready-Made Life: Early Masters of Modern Korean Fiction (1998), Wayfarer: New Fiction by Korean Women (1997) and Words of Farewell: Stories by Korean Women Writers (1989). For tales from the north, there's Korean Short Stories: A Collection from North Korea (2003)."},{"Title":"The Guide To Selling Your Music In The iTunes Music Store","review":"The main obstacle to successful music sales is distribution. Getting your music into the retail stores can be a trying experience. Most of the major retail stores use major distributors which require a deal with a major label.

Sometimes the artist and the label is the same person or group of people. What can they do to sell their music?This is where the on-line music stores can bridge that distribution gap.

The lessons on the CDs have a very natural quality and sound like I'm getting a personal lesson from Breck Alan himself. This method respects the body and encourages the student to experience and explore his/her mind/body connection from the inside out, the whole time teaching the ear to hear the truth in what's happening during singing. As you get better at hearing what's really happening and better at feeling the \\"switches\\" (as Breck calls them) that make up the mechanics of the voice, then you are empowered to have choices and overcome the hurdles of singing and become more and more expressive as you become more coordinated. I am very thankful for Breck Alan's mastery of singing and teaching voice. His approach makes something so elusive &quot;see-able and doable&quot;. He is a great teacher.Thanks, Tom Delacruise"},{"Title":"The Art of Body Singing: Create Your Own Voice Vols. 1-4 (Pt.1)","review":"Iv been going to breck's studio in NYC every week for over a year now, and he is truly the best singing teacher on the planet! Ive been singing rock and heavy metal for 6 years, i've done musical theater, and i've had many instructors; Breck is by far the best. He helped me open up an entire bottom range i didn't even know i had, within just the first 45min lesson, incredible! I recently picked up the book and CDs so i could continue my practice outside of class, and i must say they are almost like being in the room with him. If you make the effort to pay attention to the descriptions of the techniques and give it all youv got every time you practice, you will be singing very quickly! Im singing on a level now that i cant believe! Im hitting notes that a year ago seemed like a far off impossible dream! If you want to learn how to sing rock or pop, without any stupid sounding classical or operatic diction, this is one of the best investments you can make!Seriously buy this now!"},{"Title":"The Art of Body Singing: Create Your Own Voice Vols. 1-4 (Pt.1)","review":"This book explains the mechanics better than any other method I've read on the voice. Most remarkably for me, it has shown me how to extend my vocal range and taught me how to \\"project\\" without hurting myself. My tone and confidence have improved. I recommend it fully, and even the DVD featuring the authorLead Singer Vocal Techniques Pop to Rock Level 1helps because you can see and hear the techniques. Plus the dvd's (the second dvd in the series is the one that really helped me) come with an audio practice CD which is not included with the instructional cd's in this book. That's a nice thing to have if you want to practice longer with some musical guidance. The sections on resonance and how to place it in your body are worth the price of admission. I finally understand how to sing without hurting my voice."},{"Title":"The Art of Body Singing: Create Your Own Voice Vols. 1-4 (Pt.1)","review":"I've sung in bands for years. I tried some lessons in the past because there were some things I couldn't figure out and I had a fair amount of vocal pain. I never stuck with lessons because I didn't see that they were really dedicated to singing in a natural (not operatic or show tune fashion). If it wasn't for all the classical teachers out there I was always confused by the Joni Mithchell sounding teachers that always talked in weird images and never seemed to say anything. I never saw the point. This book has been the most inspirational thing I've seen in the longest time. There is so much great technical info in this thing taught and demonstrated through a clear and very natural approach. Breck Alan is a great singer that sings in a natural contemporary style. He teaches a great process of constantly getting better and singing more and more difficult material by understanding how to coordinate your voice/body. From the very early exercises I felt more and more relaxed, centered and connected to my voice. Once you get rolling there are some awesome advanced exercises that for once identify how to do the hard stuff that I was always struggling with, like singing high and projecting while singing with a band etc. This book is like a bunch of private lessons with a very intense and serious teacher.

It's a great journey of the best vocal instruction I've ever seen in one place. Great exercises with clear application. This system has the greatest approach for the full out singing rock singers like to do without all the weird stuff that makes you sound like a opera or show tune singer.

This is not your typical vocal instruction guide, but one that guides you through helpful excercises, has CD's to listen to and work with, and techniques that help immediately. The author also tells you when hard work is required and how much time you must spend (ie - posture, support system) before you really see long-term results.Easy to use, enjoyable to listen to... a real singers tool!"},{"Title":"The Art of Body Singing: Create Your Own Voice Vols. 1-4 (Pt.1)","review":"Breck Alan's method is more for pop &amp; rock mic singers, and overall not useful for singers of musical theatre or opera. But his quick warmups, and tips on vocalises without accompaniment are very good. His instructions on posture and breathing are excellent as well. And there are some great new exercises that I was unfamiliar with. But the method assumes you'll spend 1-2 years mastering it, learning in small increments, before you really learn how to sing dynamically.(This is a very thin book). Singing is a lifelong practice, but it should only take several months, or even weeks to really notice an improvement, at least in my mind. And Alan's idea of vibrato is off. When he demonstrates vibrato on the CD, you have to listen closely to notice any pitch fluctuation at all. But overall, if your singing interest is primarily a rock style, you'll benefit from Alan's ideas."},{"Title":"Visible Cities Budapest","review":"Ms. Barber and Roper-Evans know more about Budapest and its history, culture, sights and amenities than almost any native Hungarian.

She was a woman of life and spirit. This novel is sad, Amanda's weaken state causes Spock anguish, that he cannot show in front of his father. When Sarek leaves, days before Amanda dies, Spock is angry and feels that his father betrayed his mother. In the end they reconcile, but it is hard, very hard on Spock's human half. I really enjoyed this book, I looked into what pre-Spock life was for Spock's parents. I saw how Amanda truly felt at certain moments. This book should be read by everybody who loves Star Trek and Spock. Keep the tissue close to you."},{"Title":"Sarek (Star trek)","review":"When pocket books combines a marqee character name and a hardcover publishing, you know they have checked the story over very carefully.The only problem with this novel about &quot;Sarek&quot;, is that it actually should be titles &quot;Farewell Amanda&quot; because it focuses on the end of Spock's mother.Certainly worth the paperback price."},{"Title":"Sarek (Star trek)","review":"This review is of the Audible unabridged version:I've been a ST fan since TOS ... and still am (except for the latest round of 'dark' movies). I used to read every ST book as soon as it was released. This is the first one I've read in years and maybe it's just a case of not being able to go back again. Frankly, I thought the writing was amateurish -- almost on a class with a fanzine. The overly emotional narration was a further drawback for me.I'm definitely in the minority here, but I just couldn't get into this book and when Amanda started waxing nostalgic over her moon-struck romance with Sarek, I had to stop and move on to a different book.Hope you like it better than I did!"},{"Title":"Sarek (Star trek)","review":"Sarek fleshes out the character of one of Star Treks most beloved characters, Ambassador Sarek. A.C. Crispin does an admirable job breathing more life into the character and his relationship with his wife Amanda and son Spock. The beginning and end of the book are very heartwarming. These sections of the book focus on Sarek's characterization. They're low-key and very effective.The middle of the book revolves around a Romulan plot to undermine the Federation. Here's where things get a bit convoluted. We see less of Sarek and more of Peter Kirk, Captain James Kirk's nephew. The plot isn't horrible, but it seems a bit jarring when contrasted to the tender scenes between Sarek and Amanda. Sarek himself has to resolve a conflict through ritual combat which seemed out of character. It seems almost like Crispin wanted to focus on Sarek, but felt like she need some galaxy-threatening plot to fill the book.The audiobook performance was fine, but nothing exceptional. A few times, Peter Kirk's voice was grating, and Klingons were over the top, but the narration moves the plot at a good pace and doesn't let the story drag.Overall, this is a must for fans of Sarek. If you're busy, read the first and last third carefully and skim the middle."},{"Title":"Sarek (Star trek)","review":"Not terribly exciting.

I hate to read when favored characters die. I lost the paperback in a move but still had the book on my \\"to be read\\" list. Having received the Kindle for Christmas, I'm not entirely sure what prompted me to pick this book as the first to read (I think I was influenced by a late night ST:TNG episode).This was an excellent book. It's the first book I've read in a long time that had made me cry. Crispin captures Amanda so perfectly both in her character and through her journal entries. The plot of the novel is good; the characterization of Amanda is better. It makes the novel."},{"Title":"Sarek (Star trek)","review":"This was a very engaging story. Crispin did an excellent job of bringing further development to the character of Sarek, creating a character that was both in keeping with the existing Star Trek character, yet also more complex.

In dealing with his beloved wife's death, Sarek is presented with a most difficult dilemma; stay at his wife's bedside, even as her last moments of life tick away, or answer the call to duty, as his superior negotiating skills are required to avert what could well be the early demise of the fragile peace recently accorded between the Federation and the Klingon Empire. As we move along through this story, we come to understand that it's not that Vulcans do not experience emotion; they've rather learned to master them, such that decisions are not made with emotions, but the emotional fallout from these decisions sooner or later comes to bear. Even as Sarek, and also Spock, come to terms with Amanda's passing, the depth of feeling they feel for her, as well as for one another, presents itself; yet both these Vulcans must deal with this emotional impact in such a way that does not compromise their logic.Well, as you can see, if finding out about the inner lives of Vulcans does not appeal to you, then there isn't much reason for you to read this book. However, if you are indeed curious to know more about the Vulcan culture, particularly as the culture lives within a Vulcan, a half-Vulcan, and a human, then you'll find much to interest you here.This book is really quite well-written, and whilst it can be enjoyed by Trekkers in general, those particularly interested in The Great Bird's culture of \\"emotional mastery via logic\\" shall delve into this wholeheartedly, with a greater insight into how the embracing, and mastery, of logic does not eliminate emotion, but rather allows it to exist subserviently. Surak taught that emotional mastery was largely the acknowledgement and mastery of fear; in this book, fear of grief, fear of powerlessness, and fear of \\"the other\\" all abound, and logic is called upon, not to negate these things (which would be highly contrary to the teachings of Surak; one can't remove a beast from one's living room by simply refusing to acknowledge it's there) but to master them, thereby preventing fear from becoming the master.I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Sarek (Star trek)","review":"this book seriously is amazing from the very begining to the very end this book is amazing its a must have for hardcore star trek fans and trekkies!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Sarek (Star trek)","review":"The main reviewer is wrong its not apiece of fluff.

Still, it is a little slow here, so I can't really give it the full 5 stars.The book picks up the pace TREMENDOUSLY, however during it's last 3rd when the usual cast of the starship Enterprise get more involved in what's happening. I really couldn't put the book down once I got into that! The last part of the book makes up for the slowness in the middle.'Sarek' also does a great deal to make connections between events that we see in Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country and even the two-part Next Generation episode which featured Spock.

As she moves into her life's final days, Sarek - Vulcan's most revered diplomat, and the Federation's best, also - must decide whether or not to answer a painfully timed call to duty. His skills are needed, and many lives depend on the negotiations he's asked to conduct. Sarek does the logical thing, and Amanda forgives him for leaving her when they both know she can't survive until his return. Can Spock forgive Sarek, though? That is the question.That is this novel's major plot element, which intertwines Amanda's journal entries from the time Sarek entered her life with events occurring in the story's present. Those events involve Jim Kirk's now adult nephew, Peter; the Klingon Empire as its leaders deal with the on-going crisis begun in \\"Star Trek: The Undiscovered Country\\"; and a mysterious connection between the Romulans and, of all things, the Keep Earth Human League.

A sad but fond farewell to a beloved character in the Star Trek universe and a great &quot;fill in the gaps&quot; story."},{"Title":"Sarek (Star trek)","review":"The audio tapes are only about two hours, making for a relatively snappy novella. The excerpts from Amanda's journal appear to be the primary cut, as most of the family dynamic and historical perspective other reviewers discussed are limited to the print version. There are some exceptions about \\"duty\\" and a few conflicts past and present between Spock and Sarek, with the one about Spock's acceptance by Starfleet a well-known nugget from the canon.Most of the usual characters are here, largely acting according to expectations. The major addition is Kirk's nephew Peter, who is captured and develops a relationship with an important young Klingon female charged with watching him. The author couldn't resist defining some similarities between the two Kirk kin, and I thought this subplot romance was a bit much.The actual primary plot is decent, and makes a good narrative, including the trifecta of Klingons, Romulans and Vulcans. We get some in-the-nick-of-time heroics and close calls, consistent with the TV shows and movies, which is fine with me.Mark Lenard narrated the novel late in his life, which was a nice choice, given his on-screen performance as Sarek."},{"Title":"Sarek (Star trek)","review":"When people ask me about the qualities that make the original Star Trek series so appealing, my response is, \\"characters and cultures.\\" The primary story lines were about sentient beings who found themselves in complex situations and where the gadgetry and weaponry played only secondary roles. Granted, Kirk was a Napoleanic character, but that is a characteristic that early starship captains would have to possess. The other characters were so well-defined that even the lesser roles are as well-known as the main three. We were introduced to the Vulcans, Romulans and Klingons, similar species, but all with exaggerated human characteristics. The Vulcans, a superhuman race with logic and ethics taken to an extreme, the warlike Klingons who nevertheless possess a strict code of honor and the Romulans, for whom deceitful plotting is an art form.This tale, which is set in the time immediately after the movie, \\"The Undiscovered Country\\" is based largely on a growing movement among humans to keep Earth for the humans. It turns out that it is another plot hatched by a secretive race who have interacted with Sarek and the Federation for many years. Once again, we are led through many of the subtle cultural backgrounds of the Vulcans, Klingons and Romulans.We are along as many of the journal entries of Spock's mother Amanda are read, as we learn a great deal more of the Vulcan culture as well as the origin of the rift between Spock and his father. Klingon honor, mating rituals and marriage rites are also explored, as we are exposed to more of what that complex race uses to guide their lives and rules of succession. The Romulan capacity for long-term plotting is exposed once again, although we do see how their honor is such that they are willing to sacrifice themselves to aid others.This is one of my favorite Star Trek books because it does rely on characters and shows us so much of the nonhuman cultures. The plot is well-defined and moves along rather quickly as the staid diplomat Sarek proves himself capable of being much more, including a spy."},{"Title":"Sarek (Star trek)","review":"Star Trek: Sarek written by A.C.Crispin is a book about the life of one of the most revered characters in the Star Trek genre... Sarek, spock father and an ambassador of the Federation.For being a book about a Vulcan, you would think this book would be void of emothion... far from this case, indeed. This book runs the full gambit of human emotion, you'll cry, laugh, be heartbroken and happy. This book's time frame is after the events of Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country, as Spock's mother, Amanda Grayson, is dying and Spock returns to Vulcan where he meets his father Sarek and they get reacquainted, so to speak, making for some very interesting reading.Of course, the U.S.S. Enterprise and her crew aren't too far away from this epic tale... no sir, as Captain Kirk's last surviving relative has become a pawn in the battle to divide the Federation. The Klingon Empire, you can always count on them, are the kidnappers with the Federation's distruction not too far behind.There is action-adventure in this story, love and loyality. There is an enemy more insidious and more dangerous than any faced to this point. The characteriztions are spot-on with a well-fleshed out dialog making for a very quick, fast read. You will get engrossed with this tale and will not want to put the book down til the end.You can always tell when you have an excellent Trek Book in your hands... the pages seem to fly by... this is the case with this book.

Crispin has a great way of representing the personalities of the characters, as well as the emotions. The anguish Sarek goes through, as well as other emotions, are well represented and touch the heart.This is a MUST READ for any Star Trek Fan!"},{"Title":"Sarek (Star trek)","review":"I loved this one, cause it really delves into Spock and Sarek's relationship, plus you get to see Amanda's point of view on things. It also show's a lot of her relationship with Sarek, shows the sentimental side of him that while loath to show it since it would be a emotional display it also makes you understand that they were truly in love and how they were able to make it work...because love is certainly not logical and humans are rather emotional about these things. I also enjoyed how it explained the falling out that Sarek and Spock had when Spock went into Starfleet. I've enjoyed the other books that I've read also that delve into the father/son relationship:The Vulcan Academy MurdersThe IDIC EpidemicSpock's WorldDefinitly read this one"},{"Title":"Sarek (Star trek)","review":"Repeat after me, &quot;This IS an abridged version of the book&quot;. They can't possibly get the whole book onto a 2-hour tape, nor do they try. There is a lot left out. You must read the book, which is wonderful. The great thing about this book-on-tape is that Mark Lenard reads it. He played the role of Sarek on the series and in the movies. It's a great tribute to him to have his wonderful voice and characterization on tape. It deserves to be in every Star Trek collection."},{"Title":"Sarek (Star trek)","review":"I have read over 150 Star Trek books and this one is my favorite. It is full of fun and adventure. It delves deep into the character of Sarek and the difficulties he faces. A side plot goes into the character of Peter Kirk, Captain Kirk's nephew. This is a very humorous book and is written in the spirit of Star Trek. A must read for Star Trek book fans!"},{"Title":"Sarek (Star trek)","review":"I liked this book. It was a well written treatment of the original series characters set immediately following Star Trek 6: The Undiscovered Country. The additional characters were all excellent. Truly I would have loved to see this as a movie, but alas it would never come to pass now that both Mark Lenard, and Deforest Kelley are gone... The most interesting thing about this book, has to be the insight into Spock's father, Sarek. You read about motivations, and actions that shaped Spock. You have direct insight into why Sarek married a human. And you see more of the vulcan culture. A truly engrossing read!"},{"Title":"Sarek (Star trek)","review":"Much above the level of most other Star Trek books. Strong, compelling characters (Valdyr, Peter Kirk and, of course, Spock and Sarek) and a great plot. Really nice love stories (both the one in the past and the present).

Crispin: Good Times.I really enjoyed this book, and in cadence with the other reviewers I couldn't put it down for the last 3rd. Literally, I hid in a closet and a stairwell at work just so I could get a few more pages in. I laughed and cried and gasped in shock many times during my reading. Every one of the characters acted as I thought they should and gave me new insight into those characters that I know so well. Even though officially it is not, in my eyes this is canon since everything jives so danged well and I love the story. And my word is law in some local bowling clubs."},{"Title":"Sarek (Star trek)","review":"Again, A.C. Crispin has turned out a fabulous book that has all the trademarks of my beloved Original Series as well as filling the book with subplots, humor, and a somewhat unexpected twist or two. Definitely needs to rank with: &quot;2001&quot;, &quot;Rendezvous with Rama&quot;, &quot;Childhood's End&quot;, &quot;Foundation&quot;, &quot;Ringworld&quot;, &quot;Advent of the Corps&quot;, and so forth."},{"Title":"Elements of rhetoric, comprising an analysis of the laws of moral evidence and of persuasion,: With rules for argumentative composition and elocution (Landmarks in rhetoric and public address)","review":"In his Introduction Whately begins by defining Rhetoric as persuasive speech or writing, distinguishing between Rhetoric and Logic, and making some observations on Composition. He then moves to Part I, where he studies the means of producing Conviction, studying the various types of arguments.In Part II Whately takes up Persuasion, which initially caused me to scratch my head. Don't you persuade by producing conviction? He soon makes himself clear by reference to Aristotle's persuasive triad: Logos, Ethos, and Pathos. Whately lumps Ethos and Pathos both under the heading Passion and distinguishes between legitimate and illegitimate appeals to Passion. E.g. Appeal to prejudice would be illegitimate, appeal to the sense of justice would be legitimate.Whately's point is that the audience can be convicted of the logic of your arguments, but if they are not also moved emotionally by your arguments, they are unlikely to be persuaded by your arguments. E.g. In an appeal for hunger relief for a famine stricken country, people may immediately see the logical need to send food, but they won't be motivated to send food until they feel the moral need to send food.Part III deals with Style, and Whately's observations on the subject are timeless. Part IV treats of Elocution or Delivery.Two things prevent Whately's work from getting five stars: [1] It presupposes the reader has a broader classical knowledge than most moderns possess. [2] Antiquated diction and sentence structure make for hard reading.Allusions to Classical, Biblical, & Enlightenment literature abound, and only the most well-read will be able to keep up. Whately takes for granted that the reader already has a working knowledge of Rhetoric, and consequently neglects to define such terms as \\"enthymeme\\" and \\"trope.\\"I started this book, got halfway through the first chapter, became frustrated with the convoluted sentence structure and murky exposition, and threw it down with full intention of abandoning it. I determined, however, to return to the book, and the reward was worth the effort. By the time you finish Part I, you will have acclimatized yourself to the antique language, and the rest of the book will be smooth sailing. (Until you hit Appendix A, which is in Latin).One interesting aspect of Whately's book: Whately was an Anglican Archbishop living toward the end of the Enlightenment. Of course, many Enlightenment scholars decided they were too smart to believe in God, and made elaborate arguments against Christianity. Whately disects these arguments in the book, giving counter arguments for the validity of the Christian religion. The debate over the existence of God hasn't progressed much since Whately's time. Whately deals with and refutes almost every modern argument against Theism & Christianity in the course of the book. Interestingly, he does a better job of refutation than most modern apologists."},{"Title":"Phonology: Theory and Description (Introducing Linguistics, Vol. 1)","review":"This isn't at all what I was looking for in a phonology textbook. It's perfect for non-linguistics majors who need to have a basic background in phonology. A warning to linguistics buffs wanting to buy this book: it doesn't touch the more fascinating parts of phonology(the introduction even states that it will not even touch things like Grimm's Law), and no connections to other linguistic fields. I wish that the description had stated that it was designed for non-linguistics majors, because that's obviously where this book is aimed. I really wish I had bought a different textbook."},{"Title":"Life in the Ancient Near East, 3100-332 B.C.E.","review":"I was first introduced to Snell's book in an undergrad archaeology class the year it was first published. This book is different from other more traditional Mesopotamian books as it has a short but heartfelt fictional story placed at the beginning of each chapter. This has remained in my mind sense the first time I read it and keeps it alive in my memory. The book covers topics as follows: The origins of cities, The rise of Empires, Reform within those Empires, Retrenchment and Empire, Assyrian Domination of Mesopotamia, Babylon and Persia, and Trends and Implications within those periods. I highly recommend this book for an insight into Mesopotamian life, culture, and historical background"},{"Title":"Life in the Ancient Near East, 3100-332 B.C.E.","review":"Well-organized and exceedingly well-researched, my only concerns with this book lie in the way Prof. Snell's sense of majesterial objectivity drop as soon as the subject of Israel arises. He is willing to accept many matters of the early bible as historical, even as he acknowledges it as essentially an article of faith. This certainly gives creedence to the author's religious sensibilities, but it detracts from his overall argument. If the myth records of other nations are not to be considered as the subject for history, neither should that of Judeo-Christianity; if the bible is a repository of historical fact worthy of inclusion in a book that weighs the evidence from more than a hundred works on the subject-at-hand, then the religious documents of Mesopotamia and Egypt such receive just as much regard."},{"Title":"Life in the Ancient Near East, 3100-332 B.C.E.","review":"Snell's book is important in bringing together available social historical evidence (it is also very well documented).

However, Snell's introduction to the middle east is too wide reaching for 140 pages. He tries to touch on every ancient culture, and therein the book looses its focus. This is feels like a disordered patchwork of several great books on ancient culture. It doesn't have the focus of some better histories--try van der Mieroop.However, I will add that the essay in the appendix, on theories of ancient economy, is a great read. If you find this book at the library, check it out and give this short essay a read."},{"Title":"Life in the Ancient Near East, 3100-332 B.C.E.","review":"I bought this book just from browsing around in Amazon.

I didn't give this book 5 stars because of its organization.I felt like there was no point to the book except to puke out all that the author had learned during his research. I appreciate the author's hard work, and I believe it was worth the small funds I payed for the book, but the author needs work on his writing skills.I would recommend this book to anyone interested in ancient history only because I have read so few books about ancient history. If you have the ability to stick it out through a book that has fascinating information, but requires some effort to read, then this book is wonderful. I am that type of person. I read a lot of computer science books as well :-) If you are the type that has to be lead through a book with the author exciting you all the way with his words, then don't pick this one up."},{"Title":"Life in the Ancient Near East, 3100-332 B.C.E.","review":"Snell's book is important in bringing together available social historical evidence; it is also very well documented.

In the Mallen Streak we met the Mallens and their immediate family and servants. Only a select few made it into this novel due to death and tragedy. Once again, Anna Brigmore is a governess, this time over the late Barbara's daughter, also named Barbara. Constance, the young Barbara's aunt is across the hill running a farm. Also in attendance, is the maid, Mary, tho she has a much smaller part in this novel.The story focuses on young Barbara and her love for her cousin, Michael, Constance's son. Barbara is deaf and amid the puppy love, teenage angst, and angry bouts of passion, readers get a look into the frustrations that a young deaf woman in the late 1800s has to deal with. Partly due to her disability, and partly due to an entire family trying to stand in the way of her being with the man she loves, Barbara becomes a manipulative and angry woman. She does something bad. Will she meet with a tragic ending like her mother did before her?In the Mallen Streak, there was definet lines drawn between master and servant. In Mallen Girl, readers will witness those lines being erased as new ideas about rich and poor and laborors rights are introduced, much to Anna's dismay.My only complaint is the \\"monologues\\" of the Bensham parents. They go on and on with their speeches too much. They, did, however, bring some interesting new additions to the story, by way of Daniel, John, and Katie.Three stars because I would have liked more Barbara, less of the older Benshams.

What began just as leisure would become THE masterpiece in History of Economic Thought. Schumpeter spent ten years in this colossal effort and unfortunately did not finish it before his death. Nevertheless, nowhere else you will find a book more powerful and more profound on this theme. By History of Economic Analysis Schumpeter means the history of efforts made in the pursuit of comprehending economic phenomena, from Antiquity to present; not a book on history of ideologies. Schumpeter places the authors in their times and contexts, and tries to understand how they proceeded in analysing economic reality. A must for anyone interested in economic theory, history and philosophy."},{"Title":"History of economic analysis","review":"The legendary History of Economic Analysis is without a doubt one of the greatest books of economic history ever written, but one should examine what kind of reading they're looking for before he or she embarks on this thousand page text. Schumpeter's unfinished history is divided into sections by ideology and time-period which is particularly useful but once you penetrate the well-organized table of contents, the writing becomes arcane and complex.For a reader well-grounded in economic theory and history, I am sure that this is a bible; but for a curious reader interested in the history of economics (in a more political as opposed to theoretical perspective) this book may not be right. Highly footnoted and not very smooth writing, as well as obscure references to economists and theories results in a history that is very demanding of the reader. If you are looking for an economic history text that reads like From Dawn to Decadence you may be seriously disappointed, as I had been, but if you are a serious student of economics and are willing to spend the time to deliberate over Schumpeter's words then History of Economic Analysis is right for you."},{"Title":"History of economic analysis","review":"The objective of Schumpeter, one of the greatest economists of all times, is to portray in a very comprehensive detail, all the philosophical thinking that conduced to contemporary Economic Analisys, since the beginning of the ancient greek thought.To me, that had a very great misconception about the works of Joseph Alois Schumpeter, this book was a revelation, be it for the immensity of his erudiction both as an historian, philosopher and economist, be it for the ingenuity in which he presents many new ideas and perspectives regarding economic analisys.He is sometimes difficult to follow, not helped by the many and extensive footnotes he appends the book with, and by the many quotations he does in foreign languages, which he usually do not translate, be it in ancient Greek, Latin , French or German. Also , the book was unfinished in his lifetime and had to be edited by his wife, who was also deceased before the full completion of the giantic task. Even so, the book has some 1.300 pages and covers the full range of all the relevant economic thougth until the time of its publication.A warning sign of caution must be addressed to the non-professional readers not not fully interested in the magnitude of such a scope, that is, of addressing the formative ideas of each and every important concept in economic analisys in a so complete way. This can be an overkill for you. But if you are interested in Medieval thought, the concepts exposed by , for instance, Saint Thomas and many others, this is a very good reading. Enjoy it"},{"Title":"History of economic analysis","review":"This book is one of the greats. Written by a master of economic theory, it reflects his learning and insight. But have no mistake, Schumpeter expects you to meet him half-way, so if you like to be spoon-fed and prefer pictures to words, this is not the book for you. The book needs to be read together with the original material: Schumpeter is not a substitute for, but a guide to the material he writes about. To criticise this book for not being light reading is simply to misunderstand this: to understand important thoughts requires some thinking and if you are not prepared to do the work, you shouldn't fool with this book. While Blaug's book is a decent solid survey, the only work which begins to rival Schumpeter's in erudition and incisiveness is Marx's Theories of Surplus-Value, which covers a narrower period. If you respect this book and *really* study it, the effort repays handsomely. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"History of economic analysis","review":"I was introduced to this author from the recommendations of Robert Helibroner's books and I am thankful for this books amazing depth. This book is not for faint at heart but if you are interested in economic analysis, you probably wouldn't be scared off by the magnitude of this masterpiece. The footnotes alone are worth the read. I think Schumpeter is amazing in his confidence, depth and skill in writing as if it was a one on one conversation. I was a bit surprised at some of his analysis of economic personalities but that is why this book is great. It's one man's opinion and that man knows his stuff.

This book was edited by his wife, and published posthumously. She wrote in her Introduction, \\"He probably began writing the History in 1941... As time went on, he began to emphasize that this was a history of economic analysis and not a history of economic thought.\\" (Pg. vi-vii) Schumpeter himself said, \\"We shall, of course, never neglect the general environment of economic thought in which, at various times, analysts did their work. But these environments ... are never our main object of interest.\\" (Pg. 39)He asserts early in the book, \\"I hold that the garb of philosophy is removable also in the case of economics: economic analysis has not been shaped at any time by the philosophical opinions that economists happened to have, though it has frequently be vitiated by their political attitudes.\\" (Pg. 31) He points out that \\"The history of economic thought starts from the records of the national theocracies of antiquity ... But the history of economic analysis begins only with the Greeks.\\" (Pg. 52) He states, \\"in the rising national states public finance acquired not only paramount importance but also a new significance.\\" (Pg. 199)He states, \\"there is one point about the gold standard that would redeem it from the charge of foolishness, even in the absence of any purely economic advantage... An 'automatic' gold currency is part and parcel of a laissez-faire and free-trade economy. It links every nation's money rates and price levels with the money rates and price levels of all the other nations that are 'on gold.' It is extremely sensitive to government expenditure ... THIS is the reason why gold is so unpopular now and also why it was so popular in a bourgeois era. It imposes restrictions on governments or bureaucracies that are much more powerful than is parliamentary criticism.\\" (Pg. 405-406)He says about the period of 1870-1914, \\"no philosophy can be proved to have influenced the economists of the period in the sense that they arrived at or failed to arrive at any analytic conclusions which they would not have arrived at or failed to arrive at without guidance from any philosopher...\\" (Pg. 779) Later, he adds, \\"It is one of the major aims of this book to destroy the myth that there ever has been a time when economists as a body scorned research into historical or contemporaneous fact or when economics as a whole was purely speculative or lacked its factual complement.\\" (Pg. 807)He concludes, \\"it is also true that, unintentionally and perhaps even against his will, Keynes gave a mighty impulse ... almost all work in macrodynamics now starts from a 'dynamized' form of his model. In a history of analysis this is still the point to stress. In a history of economic thought Keynes's policy recommendations---time-bound as they were---and certain characteristically Keynes's doctrines---which are losing their hold already---may be much more important.\\" (Pg. 1184)Although incomplete in certain sections, this massive tome will be of considerable interest to anyone interested in the history of economics."},{"Title":"Culture and International Relations (Explorations in Culture and International History Series)","review":"Collaboratively compiled and expertly edited by Jessica C.

There's a brief introduction by Groucho's biographer, Stefan Kanfer, a couple of Time magazine articles about Groucho, then the rest of the material is by the man himself. A kind of \\"greatest hits\\" volume. So you know it's guaranteed to be funny. It includes favorite scenes from \\"Animal Crackers\\", \\"Monkey Business\\", \\"Horse Feathers\\", \\"Duck Soup\\", \\"A Night at the Opera\\", and \\"A Day at the Races\\", among other films. There are some freelance articles, as well as selected material culled from his appearances on radio and TV.All of this is reliably funny stuff, but for my money the best part of this book was \\"The Groucho Letters\\", roughly 30 pages of correspondence. There's the surreal correspondence between Groucho and Warner Brothers, who were trying to claim exclusive rights to the name 'Casablanca'. Letters to Fred Allen, Russell Baker, Alistair Cooke, and others. But the oddly moving center to the whole collection is an exchange of letters between Groucho and T.S. Eliot, initiated when Eliot, who was an avid fan, wrote in 1961, requesting an autographed photo.Anyone troubled by the anti-Jewish sentiments in some of Eliot's writing should read these letters, which go a long way to softening the image of Eliot as a rabid anti-Semite. The two men obviously grew friendly, and held each other in high regard, as this excerpt from a letter from Groucho to Russell Baker shows:(January 21, 1965)I was saddened by the death of T.S. Eliot.

The author has picked scenes Groucho acted in, letters he wrote, segments from radio shows, articles he authored, etc. but the book fails to make the reader feel a need to find more (and more is out there). A more thought-out collection would have made you want to find more material of the kind laid out in the chapters of this book, but for some reason I felt the book just didn't do that. If you want to read some of Groucho's letters, get a book that covers that. If you want to read the radio scripts with Chico and Groucho, there's a book on that as well.

It has excellent plates and detailed text, and is a worthy addition to any library, expecially one which concentrates on fine art books.If you are not familiar with the works of Durer, this is an excellent introduction.

The detail of the images is pretty decent. You can see all the lines in each of the etchings and most of them are true to size. Each image also contains a brief history, which is interesting, discussing things that Durer recorded in his diary about a particular etching or how other artists portrayed similar scenes or just giving background on the story portrayed. It's a nice little treasure in my library. Love it!"},{"Title":"The Complete Engravings, Etchings and Drypoints of Albrecht Durer (Dover Fine Art, History of Art)","review":"Albrecht D&uuml;rer is an underrated artist. He is not known by the general public the same way the Italian Renaissance artists are - it must be a conspiracy, along with the Kennedy assassination and the inexplicable career of Keanu Reeves. Personally, I have been in love with the man's stuff ever since I took a class on Northern Renaissance art in college a long time back. D&uuml;rer's art is incredibly vivid and detailed, yet never seems cluttered or superfluous. His art truly makes an impression of the viewer - once you see one of his works of art you will not forget it - or him.This is a collection of Albrecht D&uuml;rer's engravings, etchings and drypoints. While I love his woodcuts and paintings, to me D&uuml;rer's true genius was in the engraving - he was the greatest engraver of all time. \\"St. Jerome In His Study\\" and \\"Meloncolia I\\" are the epitome of the craft. This well-made Dover paperback collection, as far as I can tell, compiles all of them for your viewing pleasure. Some resizing has been done on some of them to get them to fit, but you still get the detail so it's not a huge deal. Some of the reproductions are lower quality photographs (if you look really *really* hard you can see \\"newspaper dots\\"), which while not horrible are not ideal although most of the detail still comes through fine. One thing I really, *really* love about this book is that the descriptions of the works are right next to the works themselves - so no flipping to the front or back of the book to read about the etching that you're looking at. Another thing I love is that the editors give you some early versions and sketches of some of the pieces, which means that you get to see the creative process behind some of these masterpieces. Cool deal.Overall, this book is necessary - it is absolutely necessary for anyone who is a fan of Albrecht D&uuml;rer, necessary for anyone who is an engraver or just appreciates the art of engraving, and even necessary for any lover of art in general. If you like this than Dover also has a book of D&uuml;rer'swoodcuts, also available on Amazon."},{"Title":"The Complete Engravings, Etchings and Drypoints of Albrecht Durer (Dover Fine Art, History of Art)","review":"This is really money well spent if you are interested in the topic; there's a original sized picture of each work together with a brief description."},{"Title":"The Complete Engravings, Etchings and Drypoints of Albrecht Durer (Dover Fine Art, History of Art)","review":"I like this book very much.1) It contains all engraving,etching and drypoints works of Durer.2) Most pictures are big enough to my expectation.3) Print quality are good.Thanks very much!"},{"Title":"The Complete Engravings, Etchings and Drypoints of Albrecht Durer (Dover Fine Art, History of Art)","review":"This book is cheap and full of amazing reproductions of Durers prints, what it lacks in text it more than makes up for in images"},{"Title":"Veronika decide morrer (Portuguese Edition)","review":"Just after few pages I was wondering about sense of my life.That is why I think this book is very good.

The Octavius of Marcus Minucius Felix (Ancient Christian Writers)","review":"Minucius Felix's Octavius is an artful early Christian work that reminds us of the golden dialogues of Cicero. In the Octavius, there are three participants: Caecilius, a pagan sophist; and Octavius and Minucius, who are both Christians. As the dialogue commences, Minucius is set to be the interlocutor, while Caecilius and Octavius engage in a religious debate. So in a long diatribe Caecilius takes the offensive, advocating philosophy and traditional Roman virtues over Christianity, which he believes is nothing more than a secretive religion of rustics and criminals. Octavius, in turn, responds at length to Caecilius in a favorable manner and wins him over to the Christian cause. All in all this is fine, except that Minucius never mediates between the two. Minucius is not an Academic [skeptic] but instead an assenting Christian dogmatist who is never actively manipulating dialogue. He raises no suggestions and no questions; but this is evidently because he is left awestruck and bemused by the depth and beauty Octavius' arguements (see, ch. 39). Although this negates his role as interlocutor and ultimately damages the dignity of the dialogue. Minucius is found only at the beginning and the end of the Octavius and takes a positive attitude toward one side. It certainly would have been nice to have seen him arbitrating between the two. Overall, as a dialogue, the Octavius is far to simple; but it is adorned with the graces of Ciceronian elegance and style and this is a big plus, especially considering the era in which it was composed. Because of its charm, the Octavius is one of the easier pieces of patristic literature to digest. Despite its faults, which are forgivable, the Octavius is a definite recommendation."},{"Title":"A guide to Haleakala National Park, Island of Maui, Hawaii","review":"Most of us yearn to travel, and the preliminary to travel is to choose a place that others, people or books, say is interesting, then find out more about it.This guide is to help you find out more about Haleakala. It is neither a reference book nor a treatise. It sums up what many have studied and observed. It skims over the myths that the mountain itself created in the imagination of old Hawailans. It reflects also the labor and thought of the compiler. Its aim is to satisfy your interest while you are here on the brim, or at some other point. For some of you it may be the start of a deeper curiosity, to be satisfied by further reading elsewhere.Think of this booklet as a chatty companion along the way, and a ready reminder after you have left, of your pleasant experience at Haleakala."},{"Title":"Secrets from the Ninja Grandmaster: Revised and Updated Edition","review":"Palladin Press has certainly done an outstanding job of reissuing a definite classic in the canon of Ninpo books. The harcover edition is built for endurance, a thankful thing in my dog-eared library of martial arts texts.If you've never experienced authentic ninjutsu before (because there are certainly plenty of fraudulent hucksters out there purporting to teach the real thing) then this book might confuse you at certain points, given the interesting taped-conversation transcripts that make up the bulk of this tome. At certain times, Hatsumi-sensei seems to say things which are contradictory to other statements he's made in the past. Fools will say this simply proves the man is nothing but a fraud. People who have known Hatsumi-sensei and experienced the true nature of this art will understand that such spoken contradictions are merely another aspect of what may well be the most comprehensive and fascinating system of self protection available anywhere. Hatsumi-sensei teaches quite a lot when he talks...and even more when he doesn't.Most interesting to me was the updated chapter \\"Twelve Years later\\" which brings both Stephen K. Hayes and Masaaki hatsumi together once again in the recently opened Hombu Dojo to discuss the world of their art since the original conversations in 1986. Hatsumi-sensei once again has a great deal of important things to say - things that a lot of people should listen very carefully to. Having been over at the Hombu Dojo with a group of friends back in February of this year made the chapter all the more stirring for me.There are some illustrated techniques at the end of the book, but the draw for me was to have this book to replace the beaten-to-hell Xeroxed copy I made from another friend's book, since I couldn't find this years ago. I'm glad to have the book itself now, made all the better with the updated chapter and excellent hardcover edition.Don't miss this book!"},{"Title":"Secrets from the Ninja Grandmaster: Revised and Updated Edition","review":"On the very front cover of this book, the authors are listed in the order of student-teacher. As a major cultural faux pas, this ought to serve as a warning to what follows inside.Ostensibly an interview between teacher and student, this book is essentially promotional material for the interviewer. The material is translated and edited in such a way as to give weight to the importance of the interviewer and the answers that the grandmaster provides are so illuminating that one wonders whether he is simply doing his best to correct the misinterpretations that are revealed in the interviewer's questions and responses. An interesting aspect of this book is that the interviewer continually disagrees with his teacher.If you can skip the self-serving introductions to each chapter and focus on what the grandmaster himself has to say, then you will find that this book can be extremely useful. Nontheless, because of the weight given to the interviewer, common Japanese expressions seem to have been interpreted in such as way as to give the sense that there are only two people in the Bujinkan dojo, which of course is plainly false.The book's advertised feature is an updated chapter but I'm not sure as to why the interviewer would have even entertained the idea of including it as it only contains more disagreements with the grandmaster as well as a series of complaints and grievances.Despite all of these flaws (or perhaps because of them) I still found this book enjoyable as it provides a very good example of the grandmaster's approach to answering questions and in spite of the book's editing and translation flaws, this approach is still very much in evidence. Nonetheless, a copy of the original Japanese recordings would go a long way in improving any further editions of this book."},{"Title":"Secrets from the Ninja Grandmaster: Revised and Updated Edition","review":"I was delighted to see this in print again. If you have any interest in what the art of ninjutsu is about, this book will give you keen insights and serve as a great teaser to find out if one of hatsumi's students os teaching near you.One of the catchy characteristics of this book is that is is for the most part the transcript of a meeting that Hayes and his wife had with Hatsumi over 12 years ago, back in 1986. Its new conclusion is a modern transcript of a meeting that the three had a year ago.You will especially enjoy this book if you have trained with Hatsumi or his more skilled students. I would also recommend his other books, along with Stephen Hayes' books. Please take the time to look into getting Stephen Turnbull's books on Japanese martial arts. They are very well done and well illustrated!A real gem!

She was a great singer and friend. Lilia had asked Nancy to find her brother in Africa. Nancy agreed that she would try. Nancy gave another great mystery away. Well who knows maybe one day I might just turn out to be another Nancy Drew!"},{"Title":"The spider sapphire mystery (Her Nancy Drew mystery stories)","review":"\\"The Spider Sapphire Mystery\\" is one of the early Nancy Drew mysteries, unique because it is just as much an adventure as it is a mystery, what with Nancy and her \\"chums\\" traveling around Africa on a holiday. Along with Ned and his friends, Nancy, Bess and George are looking forward to their trip, but after several strange accidents involving two Indian men, Nancy begins to suspect that someone doesn't want her to go.It seems to be connected to a famous sapphire that has recently been stolen from its wealthy Indian owner. It's known as the spider sapphire on account of the petrified spider encased within and on visiting Riverside Museum to view a synthetic copy, Nancy is surprised to find that a small notice has been fixed to its glass case: \\"this gem was stolen.\\" The curator is furious at the slander, but soon Nancy has bigger things to worry about when she realizes that Ned has gone missing. With only a cryptic phone call to guide them, Nancy and her friends try to track down Ned and figure out what his disappearance has to do with the sapphire.Although Ned's kidnapping takes up the first segment of the book, the action only really gets started once the setting moves to Africa. Some amount of research seems to have taken place in order to accurately portray the country, its culture and its wildlife, and there are a few little tidbits of information strewn throughout. Though it is not the most imaginative mystery (the culprits are telegraphed from the get-go, and all they ever do is follow Nancy around and try to sabotage her holiday), the story hangs together well and there are several plot elements that are introduced (such as an African lullaby and a death mask) and brought back later in satisfying ways.Some aspects of the novel have dated, such as some mildly racist remarks and the fact that the group finds nothing wrong with buying elephant and rhino tusks, as well as a needless subplot concerning a girl called Gwen who proves herself to be quite an annoyance to the gang, but all things considered \\"The Spider Sapphire Mystery\\" is a solid mystery that makes more use of Nancy's circle of friends than many other books in the series. This time around, it's a team effort to discover the sapphire and catch the criminals."},{"Title":"The spider sapphire mystery (Her Nancy Drew mystery stories)","review":"this book came in shape promisedI would recommend company and purchase again to anyoneI liked everything about this purchase"},{"Title":"The spider sapphire mystery (Her Nancy Drew mystery stories)","review":"Bought as a gift for a friend who was trying to complete her set from yeasr ago.

Also, a synthetic spider sapphire is on display in River Heights (apparently it must rival New York or Los Angeles for these types of shows), but the exhibition is troubled by reports the that owner of the synthetic sapphire has stolen the real spider sapphire on which the synthetic one was modelled. In typical fashion, both mysteries which originate on another continent are tied to the exact place in Africa where Nancy is going. If someone can find even the smallest shred of something to enjoy in this book, I wish they would let me know because I couldn't find anything in it that I thought was good.

It's really too bad, because after reading this little book I felt totally prepared.There's a lot of great advice told in a nice, friendly, chatty, but altogether honest tone -- things like (I paraphrase) \\"Make sure you know yourself before writing a story, because the more specific your story is to what moves you, the more universal its appeal will be.\\"If that seems simplistic, think of how many people write stories they think other people will want to buy, instead of stories they really want to tell.That's more about writing, but there are a lot of tips tailored to what you need to do when you're \\"in the room,\\" too. One of the best is \\"Be Memorable.\\" I think most writers are so scared just to GO to the meeting that they don't even think about the producers or executives who have to SIT THROUGH these meetings... all day... every day. This is your big chance to entertain them, and there are plenty of anecdotes from successful writers who were able to do so and make a sale. (There are equally as many examples of what NOT to do.)Anyway, I don't want to give away the whole book and stop you from buying it. The info is indispensable, there's a whole Resources guide at the back (support groups, Conferences, Bookstores, Books, etc.). It's well worth the measly $12.95 cover price.

Scattered throughout the book are brief stories that are occasionally humorous and support the checklist. Also included is a section titled: Know the Industry, helpful publications and reference lists.Armchair Interviews says: This is a small, handy must have reference book.

It really doesn't get a lot more complicated than that in this book.To be fair it's not false advertising, that's probably what you should be doing ten minutes before the pitch.

I associate her with Kim Addonzio because of there manual on poetry the wrote together, The Poet's Companion, because they are friends, and because their work has a similar feel (though Laux doesn't write in meter and rhyme like Kim does sometimes). There is this raw emotion, but not just flopped on the page like so much bad poetry. In reading this collection, you see what a craftsman Laux is. Her poems feel raw, they feel spontaneous, but they are finely tuned pieces of art.The book is divided into two sections, Smoke and Fire. The first section, Smoke, is the stronger section, with poems like \\"Ray at 14\\", \\"Prayer\\" \\"How It Will Happen, When\\" and others. The poems here feel like smoke when you read them. They touch you lightly, but powerfully, bringing forth all these images, sounds, smells, feelings. Like smoke, they sneak up on you, and then hurt you.\\"What could be more sacred than her eyes,fierce and complicated as the truth. Your liferising behind them. Your name on her lips.\\"--Prayer\\"Death comes to me again, a girl in a cotton slip\\"--Death comes to me again, a girlThe second section doesn't differ much. The poems don't come raging at you like fire. No burning here. They are much more like smoke, but it does contain some great work, and has \\"The Shipfitter's Wife,\\" a beautiful poem that was selected for the Best American Poetry 1999 by Robert Bly.

I picked it up in college, and decided after reading it that I wanted to check out more work by Dorianne Laux. Why it took me close to two decades I've no idea, but I finally have.Smoke is a very, very good book. Laux is one of those poets who uses understatement, and uses it well, preferring to let the poem do the talking:\\"When I arrive at the tollgate I have to makemyself stop thinking as I dig in my pocketsfor the last of my coins, turn to the attendant,indifferent in his blue smock, his white haircurling like smoke around his weathered neck,and say, Thank you, like an idiot, and driveinto the blinding midday light.\\"(--\\"Abschied Symphony\\")This is definitely one to check out. ****"},{"Title":"Smoke (American Poets Continuum: 62)","review":"If you love poetry filled with beautiful images, great concrete detail and deeper than just the words on the page, you'll love Dorianne Laux's Smoke.

The tidbits of writing provided are choppy and poorly delivered. It is, however, an art book and that is what it provides. Art needs very few words (if any at all) to communicate meaning and so, therefore, most of the paragraphs within are biographical and dry. This is not something you pick up for the story of Giger's life, but rather the representation provided through his impressive artwork.For a coffee table or just to have for your own personal enjoyment, this book strikes a chord in all that are willing to open their eyes to the dark and twisted imaginings of the genius that is H.R.G."},{"Title":"Giger (Basic Art)","review":"i absolutely adore giger, so this book definitely made my day. the artwork and bio in it are both amazing."},{"Title":"Giger (Basic Art)","review":"First of all, there's no one quite like Giger.

The Mariner's Book of Days 2008 Calendar is a much different calendar. One that satisfies those of us who simply use a calendar to keep our busy lives in order and also a calendar that does much more than that. Education, insight, history, technical tips of traversing the sea, humor, family, love, and memories. This special calendar is all that and much more. This very special calendar is dedicated to the late Robb White from Thomasville, GA. Robb, was a very special person who comes from a very special family, a family which I have become a part of over the past year. In spite of my obvious bias for this wonderful calendar, I feel that even if I had never met Robb's family, this is a calendar that would have captured my imagination, my excitement, and my curiosity about a subject that we all have an interest in, from our younger years into out adult lives. My only complaint of the calendar (which has been published for several years) is that each new year brings more fascinating information built upon the previous year's calendar, thus begging for a much longer multi-year calendar (maybe a boxed set?). Although, maybe we should just take life one year at a time, fully enjoying and living that year to the fullest, something that I'm sure Robb White did and would suggest to the rest of us."},{"Title":"MARINER'S BOOK OF DAYS 2004","review":"If you have an interest in nautical history this is the calendar/journal for you.

So much is written about the men who helped pioneer in the west, this book gives the womens side. It is facinating to look into the everyday life of these woman and imagine how they were able to overcome such trials. You wonder how they were able to leave husbands and children, who had died, to have to bury them out alone in the wilderness. This book gives the reader a look into these brave women and the hardships they endured. It is like a trip back in time. This is the first time I have read a book of this type and this one made me anxious to read the rest, which I have allready started."},{"Title":"Covered Wagon Women, Volume 1: Diaries and Letters from the Western Trails, 1840-1849","review":"I got this book yesterday in the mail and it is already read. This book takes letters, diaries and other correspondence of women who shaped the frontier and gives the reader an insight into the hardships that their families faced making the long western crossing to the hope of a better future in Oregon and California.The author has tapped many sources in libraries all across the west to get this information together. He makes a point in the introduction that this is information compiled nowhere else. He deals with lesser known narratives except he does include a journal from Virginia Reed a child travelling with the Donner Party and Tabitha Brown one of the top 10 figures in shaping Oregon history.Very informative and educational! Can't wait to start the next book in the series."},{"Title":"Covered Wagon Women, Volume 1: Diaries and Letters from the Western Trails, 1840-1849","review":"The study of women's history has blossomed during the past several decades, and the result has been the production of several outstanding works on the subject. \\"Covered Wagon Women\\" is an important contribution to this growing field of investigation. It is a useful work that makes available to historian and buff alike several fascinating letters and diaries written by women involved in the westward movement of the 1840s. The editor, Kenneth L. Holmes and the publisher have undertaken an ambitious project, and, this work, and others in this series, represent a benchmark in this field's historiography.The material presented in this first volume has been arranged by the editor into twelve chapters with entries by fourteen women. These accounts are representative rather than exhaustive. However, there are important documents discussing the experiences of several intelligent and articulate women on the Oregon, California, Santa Fe, and Mormon trails. The editor chose his documents well. They are all primary resources, written at the time of the incidents described or immediately thereafter. More important, Holmes did not reprint commonly used diaries. I was pleasantly surprised that Susan Magoffin's diary of her trip to Santa Fe in 1846 was not included in the collection. It is an outstanding diary but readily available elsewhere. Instead, Holmes scoured the nation's archives and libraries, and solicited copies of documents from individuals, to assemble what should be considered an exemplary collection of manuscripts.Holmes's editorial work is also outstanding. He allows the individual writers to tell their own story without correcting grammar, punctuation, and syntax. He adds, moreover, useful annotations providing additional background information about key personalities and events without overediting, certainly no easy task judging from the number of edited works that suffer from this defect.The editor gives considerable attention to Mormon women during the westward trek to Utah. Holmes includes as a major piece within the collection a diary of Patty Bartlett Sessions, dated June 21, 1847, through September 26, 1847. The original, located in the Historical Department of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, has been well used by scholars investigating the Mormon trek to Utah, the role of women in the Church and in western history, and the development of medical treatment, but its publication for a wider audience is most welcome.While \\"Covered Wagon Women\\" is a fine book of lasting historical value, it could have been made better with additional work. For instance, the editor chose to omit both a bibliography and an index, opting for the issuance of a cumulative bibliography and index in the tenth volume of the series. This decision will, of course, make the volume less usable by researchers in the interim. Additionally, Holmes is inconsistent in his editorial work. He is at his best in his treatment of the diary of Patty Sessions. First, it has an excellent introduction that draws heavily upon the research of such leaders in the study of Mormon women on the frontier as Leonard J. Arrington and Maureen Ursenbach Beecher. Second, it includes a useful dramatis personae, briefly describing characters mentioned in the diary. Finally, Holmes attaches a solid bibliography pointing the direction for further study. In contrast, Holmes's editing of other diaries and letters possesses nothing approaching the depth of scholarship he demonstrates in his work on Sessions. Most other entries contain only a cursory introduction, and none has either a description of characters or bibliography. It would have been commendable had Holmes been able to bring to the other accounts in this volume the fine editorial work he displays in his work on the Sessions diary.In spite of these shortcomings, Kenneth Holmes has compiled a well-balanced, enjoyable book that should be of interest to all readers concerned with the study of women, the frontier movement, the overland trail, and Mormonism. This type of documentary history, although until recent years considered somewhat esoteric, should be encouraged, for it can open entirely new avenues of investigation when handled by skilled historians."},{"Title":"Covered Wagon Women, Volume 1: Diaries and Letters from the Western Trails, 1840-1849","review":"After reading Lillian Schlissel's excellent book \\"Women's Diaries of the Westward Journey\\" I was stricken by the 'curiosity bug' and NEEDED to read more. I turned therefore to Mr. Holmes, a recognized name in this field.His series, \\"Covered Wagon Women\\", currently consists of 11 volumes, although this review is just about the first book. Volume One consists of entries from the very first period of westward migration: 1840 to 1849. The authors are women who write of their experiences in a way that reflects both their ages and educational levels -- and it is fascinating.For example, from Keturah Belknap we discover how families prepared for the 8 month trip. She tells of difficult goodbye's to family and friends; how she spun wool so that she could have a friend weave it 'just-so' to make good solid wagon covers; and even how she and her husband packed their wagons. And from many of the journals we find out how absolutely difficult it was to cross the mountains. How in snow and rain they had to ratchet the wagons up by hoists and chains to get over huge boulders, and then lower them down the steep declines with breaks on the rear wheels. There are also the sad records left by the Donner party participants, and those that witnessed the drownings and accidents along the way.To his merit, Mr. Holmes has left these records pretty much alone. He has not changed the writers creative spelling nor punctuation, except to provide [spaces] where the sentences are run on and the meaning consequently obscured.In addition to the original writings, Mr. Holmes provides background information for each diarist, and footnotes throughout. While I found the footnotes interesting and informative, the introductory material dealt almost exclusively with with genealogy (rather than historical backdrop) and so was not of much assistance to me in trying to understand the emigrant's experience.Here are the Chapter headings:Editor's IntroductionAcross the Plains in 1845, by Betsy BayleyA Letter from the Luckiamute Valley, by Anna Maria KingA Brimfield Heroine, by Tabitha BrownThe Donner Party letters [note: by Tamsen Donner and Virginia Reed]Two letters of Phoebe StantonLetters from a Quaker Woman: Rachel FisherThe Diary of Elizabeth Dixon SmithA Pioneer Mormon Diary: Patty SessionsThe Commentaries of Keturah BelknapThe Diary of a Pioneer Girl, by Sallie HesterA Letter from California, by Louisiana StrentzelRunning a Boarding House in the MinesFour Stars [B-]. The diaries and letters published here are valuable historical records that thankfully have not been tampered with: the reader gets the full flavor of the writers. There is one map showing the routes, but almost no pictures of the women involved. And annoyingly there is NO Bibliography in this volume, with sole exception of the one provided for the one Mormon entry. Sources are listed throughout.If you are a newbie (like myself) interested in this timeframe and in written records of women, I would suggest you read up on the period first, or concurrently, before beginning this series. Personally, I would not have gotten as much enjoyment out of this book if I had not read Lillian Schlissel's book first.Lillian Schlissel's book \\"Women's Diaries of the Westward Journey\\":Women's Diaries of the Westward Journey"},{"Title":"Covered Wagon Women, Volume 1: Diaries and Letters from the Western Trails, 1840-1849","review":"I have read all 11 books in this series over and over, and I would recomend them all.

Historians and the general reader should be so fortunate that these noble women took the time out of their busy, hectic days to write letters and diaries of their westward travels. Secondly, we should also be grateful that these narratives have survived for us future readers to somewhat comprehend their stamina, perserverence and gutsy character.Heartfelt accounts of river fordings, lack of food and/or water for livestock and people, Indian misconducts, wagon breakdowns, disease and death of loved ones, vivid landscape and countryside descriptions and the numerous day to day occurences for survival.

BORING."},{"Title":"Kuhaku & Other Accounts from Japan","review":"Kuhaku is a difficult book to classify. Part cultural observations from long-term foreign residents in Japan, part translations of essays and stories by Japanese authors, and part insight into a street populated with cartoon rabbits and a family of cubes. Canned coffee, extra-marital affairs, a kegger at a buddhist temple, a stay at a hotel that caters to dogs, a man writing his way to a Nobel Prize by doing articles about sex shops in Tokyo; Kuhaku is nothing else but varied in the stories it tells.But the one thing that Kuhaku systematically achieves is a vision. The vision is to capture a feel, an attitude -- the zeitgeist if you will -- of contemporary Japan. This vision however is never truly fulfilled, and it was never meant to be; this the book never makes any apology for being what it is. Kuhaku invites the reader into a niche of a culture and lets the reader take away what the reader wants to from it. For the most part it is an attempt to break away from the typical foreigner-stuck-in-Japan literature, (Which tend toward quirky anecdotes about old ladies, packed train rides, sexual escapades, funny English, and superficial observation just beyond tourist insight masquerading as brilliant nuggets of anthropology, et cetera.), and tries to offer a more lucid, a more respectful and honest appraisal of life in Japan, here and now. In this aspect, Kuhaku is one of the best books -- with a foreign slant -- on contemporary Japanese life available; and I have read many. It can be appreciated by somebody who has never been to Japan, and yet very elucidating to those who call Japan home.Kuhaku is a compilation of the works of fourteen authors and artists. Some stories appeared elsewhere in magazines or in their original Japanese in other books; other sections were written and designed specifically for this book. The section on Japanese canned coffee convinced me to try some after two years of living in Japan without one sip. The ten page cartoon-like spread on a typical Japanese street is a delight of graphic design. And the three stories of Japanese housewives engaging in affairs at first seemed like an over-tapped subject used for the sake of naughty literature, but ended up being the most insightful part of the book. All three tales were devastatingly penetrating in their insights into the world of marriage, love versus lust, and the pressures of society on one's life and well being. They read better than most novels and were at times more fulfilling. The essay that explores contemporary problems in Japanese society, that starts with the concept of youths beating up businessmen, is a brilliant short exploration of a very large issue. But it is the glossary at the end of Kuhaku that makes for a perfect capper to these stories. More than just simple definitions, some words have full stories of love, betrayal, and slice of life fables that even after three or four readings still put a smile on my face.Even the weakest parts of Kuhaku still offer nuggets of wisdom that make them worth the reading, if not exactly memorable. The short story about the man who takes his dog to a hotel that caters to dog owners teetered close to the over-assumption of Japanese social mores based off of very simple anecdotal evidence that foreign authors are helpless to exercise. But it is a story about dogs and dog hotels and Japanese names for dogs, so I should let my high-handed Lafcadio Hearn proclivity rest every once in a while. And the one-page ditty about an editor's lunch break seemed unnecessary, but in hindsight, even the occasional mediocre moments of Kuhaku (and they tend to be the shorter stories anyway) add a nice seasoning to the total meal the book offers.I fear this book caters more to the experienced visitor to Japan, but thanks to the glossary and and inviting attitude of the design, I think Kuhaku would make a welcome edition to anybody's collection of Japanese cultural literature. Plus it comes with a bookmark thread, and I appreciate that."},{"Title":"Kuhaku & Other Accounts from Japan","review":"What does infidelity have to do with recycling? And what does canned coffee have to do with suicide?The obvious link between the widely varied stories within Kuhaku is the backdrop - all the events and stories take place in contemporary Japan. While sex and consumerism show up in more than a few tales, bigger themes - like loneliness and modern alienation - penetrate further. Kuhaku's paradoxical collage - the vivid forms of commercialism, sex, and modern technology combining to form an empty grey - tells a sometimes beautiful, sometimes bleak story of a society whose humanity appears in jeopardy.Its not all so serious, though - between a journalist's romp through Tokyo's red light district and a foreign woman's very un-Japanese reaction to getting groped on the subway, there's a good deal of material to amuse as well as enlighten.The Japanese-style design is worth noting - it makes the book a pleasure to read."},{"Title":"Kuhaku & Other Accounts from Japan","review":"Excellent book, not quite a travelogue.

Heller spends much useful time in explaining the reasons for Goethe's attempt to found an anti-newtonian science. Fittingly, the name of William Blake makes a brief appearance.Goethe saw the inhuman dimensions of the scientific project and where it was going with its inevitable war on poetic language and the construction of humane truths.Rilke and Yeats are also stars of the book, particularly Rilke who creates Nietzschean poetry, poetry that exalts a radical inwardness against a god-free world.I cannot diagram in this review the myriads of ideas and observations that make this book, The Disinherited Mind, so relevant to our own story. Erich Heller was one of the great titan critics of a century full of so many - Ernst Robert Curtius, Erich Auerbach, Theodor Adorno, Walter Benjamin, and so many more. Heller read literature within a massive scope of historical awareness. His exegis is never dull but always as pertinent and relevant as the details in great adventure fiction."},{"Title":"War Hospital: A True Story of Surgery and Survival","review":"Whether you are interested in contemporary history, war, medicine, morality and hope, you should read War Hospital. This nonfiction book about the siege of single town is an inspiring chronicle of true heroism by physicians and nurses in the face of war and its assorted horrors including internecine carnage, genocide and malign indifference. However, I first looked at this site not to see whether others enjoyed reading the book but because I wanted to see whether War Hospital had affected anyone else as much as it had me. I see that it has, and so I feel it's important to acknowledge the achievement of this book because I want everyone to have the experience I had.What was that?Well, as a social worker I was always quite skeptical of people who complained of \`compassion fatigue' or bemoaned their inability to care deeply about the unspeakable assorted cruelties and human rights abuse that scar the globe. I looked at such complaints as little more than excuses for choosing not to care. Yet I couldn't ignore the fact that I was becoming inured to the news of genocide in the Balkans, especially because it was being rapidly supplanted by genocide in other areas such as Rwanda. Although genocide is equally evil throughout the world and suffering itself has no color, I resented the fact that Africans were getting less press and global outrage. and because journalists were also tiring of the Balkans they began to desert it for the next hotspot du jour. In the age of information overload these were all competing for our attention and the surfeit of shocking details were producing a sort of ennui. I would never have admitted to compassion fatigue, but it was becoming harder to access my outrage and easier to fall into a melancholy desire to not know more.War Hospital proved just the medicine for this sense of paralysis.First, the book is no preachy lecture: It is entertaining and a gripping story, very well told, that quote effectively puts a human face and universalizes the experience of genocide. And this face is a heroic face, an inspiration. This taut story is as powerful and intoxicating as any mystery novel. It is the story of a group of heroes, but heroes not in the diluted newspaper sense of a fireman saving a child but heroes in the classic sense of people who survive seemingly impossible personal tests as they mature from nave, idealistic youths to flawed but ultimately successful saviors.A small corps of very inexperienced young physicians including Drs. Alic, Dachy, and Dautbasic find themselves trapped in the besieged city of Srebnenica, where they must care for an unstemmed flood of Bosnian Muslims. Worse, their patients are brought in suffering from gruesome traumatic war injuries-- shredded arms and legs, and devastating head injuries for which the pediatricians and internists are ill prepared to cope: There are no surgeons. Even anesthetics and disinfectants are in short supply. When the eagerly awaited surgeon finally cheats death through a hazardous odyssey to join them, he is revealed as just another young general practitioner, Dr. Ilijaz Pilav, without surgical training. This ill-equipped band faces the challenge of providing medical and surgical care, hope and inspiration to the remaining residents of the Eastern Bosnia area, including Srebnenica, a former resort town now physically ravaged by war, haunted by snipers and tottering on the brink of despair as it is seemingly abandoned by the world. And outside, the world remains mute as genocide overtakes the country and the city: When the former resort town falls, 8,000 people are massacred .All this is just the beginning. As Dr. Fink takes us on the roller-coaster descent of Srebnenica's fortunes, she fully fleshes out the individuals, telling their stories and illuminating their characters, warts and all: We know and care for them all by the end of the book. One man stumbled onto medicine because the engineering program he initially wished to attend was in a dull area that would not give him, a village boy, the urban experience he craved. Another must battle his own professional crisis of confidence-- is he really skilled enough to help all these people?-- as he seeks to allay the skepticism of others.Because we know and care about them, Fink's subtle gradual introduction of ethical and moral issues as the doctors and nurses confront them is very powerful. She avoids the pitfalls of introducing thorny medical ethics issues too early and in too much depth. This means that when characters with whom we empathize ask themselves how to triage the young vs. the armed, when they ask whether they will save more lives by arming themselves against aggressor or how they can morally justify treating an enemy soldier who will turn to genocide or massacre again these concerns become immediate moral crises, not abstractions. When some doctors decide that medical measures are not enough and they decamp to take up arms to rejoin former comrades or simply to abandon their work in the clinic as hopelessly inadequate, this becomes more than a political or ethical argument.An unexpected virtue of the book is its luminous language. It is written in a clear forthright voice that eschews semantic tricks but unerringly chooses each perfectly apt word in fresh combinations that are at once lyrical and evocative of a disturbing atmosphere: For example, a ravaged leg is \`filleted' by a young surgeon in preparation for amputation. A hazard-fraught nocturnal trek to freedom by the survivors is rendered in language that contrasts brute violence with wondrous depictions of the wondrous nightscape.In the hands of a capable writer this gripping story would have made a rousing book: In the hands of this writer who achieves rich characterization, keen ethical insight, and lyrical prose, it is an inspiration, and the cure for compassion fatigue."},{"Title":"War Hospital: A True Story of Surgery and Survival","review":"I don't think I really understood what the war in Bosnia was all about before reading Dr. Sheri Fink's fabulous new book. She has a marvelous narrative gift. This book reads like a compelling screenplay, yet is marvelously researched and documented. As Chris Hedges wrote in his glowing review in the December 22, 2003 New York Times, Dr. Fink dramatically tells the story of the war by focusing on a small group of brave young doctors trapped in the beseiged city of Srebrenica with about 50,000 civilians. Without access to supplies, equipment and even electricity, we struggle along with them to deal with the frustrations, ethical dilemmas, rivalries and romances of their lives, while the larger picture of the war, the shocking failure of the UN and the West to intervene, plays out. The targeting of medical aid workers in Iraq (Dr. Fink worked there recently, I have read) takes on new meaning after reading her book and seeing how aid is often another (albeit deplorable) weapon of war. This book deserves wide notice."},{"Title":"War Hospital: A True Story of Surgery and Survival","review":"This is an important, gripping book about doctors in wartime. And it is an impressive, beautifully written first book by Sheri Fink. War Hospital is a powerful, haunting narrative presented in fast-paced, present time, first person narrative that unfolds like a Greek tragedy. This is the story of a group of very young, inexperienced doctors amidst the siege and eventual fall of Srebnenica that ended with genocide in Europe as the world stood by. The very fact that our protagonists - humanitarians and idealists-are trapped in the midst of the eventual ethnic cleansing of Bosnian Muslims by Bosnian Serbs poses the book's central questions. Is the traditional role of humanitarian medicine -- neutral, unarmed, detached - sufficient in the face of looming massacre? And are the similarly evolved views of sovereignty and non-intervention in the international community outdated? If so, how and where does one choose sides, decide to intervene, offer medical care, or seek armed protection?But the strength of War Hospital ultimately lies in Fink's brilliant structural choice to save the analysis, the conclusions, the politics and policy dilemmas for an epilogue thus allowing the reader to become engrossed with the stories of Drs. Ilijaz Pilav, Eric Dachy, Fatima Dautbasic and a handful of others who serve as the only doctors for the 70,000 or so Bosnian Muslims surrounded in enclaves in eastern Bosnia. From the opening scene where Dr. Ejub Alic, a 32-year old pediatric resident with no surgical training, performs an amputation with a razor cleaned in hydrogen peroxide, you will find yourself caught up in a swift, compelling novelistic reconstruction of events worthy of a future film or television series. Like a special episode of ER, but with our cast operating in a very real dilapidated hospital without adequate equipment or supplies, War Hospital makes you care about Bosnians, makes you feel, see, and smell the fear, despair, humor, bravery, betrayal, and confusion that permeate war.When Dr. Alic finally gets a surgeon to help him out, the new arrival turns out to be the even younger, 28-year old general practitioner, Dr. Ilijaz Pilav, who has no surgical training either. He must brush aside questions on his past and training if he hopes to avoid creating despair or panic in Srebnenica. And so it goes. As our cast of young doctors is fleshed out, we watch their surgeries, their witness to massacres and gas attacks, their love affairs and infidelities, their arguments, and above all, their moral and ethical dilemmas as they try to live up to their calling to \\"do no harm\\" and to remain neutral as it becomes clear that active involvement, interposition with imperiled citizens and soldiers, and even occasionally taking up arms may be essential to survival and carrying out their medical missions. In this sense, War Hospital, in the best sense, resembles a high-toned TV survivor series where the outcome actually matters. As you watch some of our doctors join in fighting with Muslim forces, escape to rejoin families, get caught in ambushes, or leave overwhelmed and disillusioned, you will find yourself, if honest, frequently identifying with and then rejecting a number of moral stances and options. There are no easy answers here.This combination, then, of vivid narrative with a setting and structure that raises the most important ethical questions of our time for doctors and civilians alike makes War Hospital indispensable reading not only for medical students, physicians, nurses and other health professionals, but also for ethicists, historians, psychologists, journalists, foreign policy analysts and more. I can see it used in many, many university courses and, with decent publicity, selling well and giving rise to that movie.So. Go get War Hospital and read it now. If we had had it in 1992, genocide might have been averted. But its prose and powerful human insights and ethical engagement are as fresh and relevant today as the daily headlines from Iraq."},{"Title":"War Hospital: A True Story of Surgery and Survival","review":"I picked up War Hospital very casually. I hate to admit that I know very little of the Balkans other than a general feeling that it was war torn and had been for pretty much my whole life. This book changed this general apathy to the region in general and the peoples Croat, Serb, and Muslim in particular. I suggest every single person read this book--not only is it a great introduction to a small part of the Balkan conflicts, it is gripping and heart-rending. As I read it I felt chills-- sometimes I had to put it down. It also provides insite into the mindset of the international community who let 50,000 people fighting a better equipped enemy with only five doctors (none specifically trained in surgery). All in all-- a good read. I'm defintely going on to read more about the area and the conflict."},{"Title":"War Hospital: A True Story of Surgery and Survival","review":"Very well written narrative, exploring the struggles understaffed, overworked, and in a lot of cases under-educated doctors who risk there lives to treat there patients during a time of war, often in EXTREME circumstances. It is a very striking story in that some doctors join the fight, some stay neutral, others just get lost in the horrible world that there previously beautiful home has turned into. It really make you think what you would have done in there position and question ones own moral fiber. It also makes one question governments and there priorities. In some places the book digresses into too much history which was hard in some places to get through, but it was necessary for the overall picture for this true story.

Sheri Fink's account of the heroic services of a handful of doctors in Srebrenica is an amazing and skillful blend of personal narrative, medical practice, ethical dilemma, and humanitarian concern. It is a rich story that kept me riveted long into the night more than once.I was deeply drawn into the lives of the doctors portrayed here. I rejoiced in their triumphs, and suffered in their pain. I remain humbled and inspired by their courage, the sacrifices they made, and the risks they took for no personal gain. I was also fascinated by the glimpse given into organizations such as Doctors Without Borders / Medecins Sans Frontieres that so courageously operate on the edge of tragedy and terror, and who face choices of life and death every single day.I was entranced by the fascinating story of caring for tens of thousands of people in an isolated war zone, of doctors who went beyond their limits, beyond their lack of equipment, to save countless lives and be islands of care in a dark, tragic, turbulent time. And I was reminded of our human frailty when the burdens became too much for them.I was just as deeply drawn into the account of the tragedy in Bosnia as a whole, and I will never think about this war in the same way. Until now it was a confusing, remote war that I felt sorrow for, but in a distant abstract way. Now, I am touched deeply, and, in a small sense feel that I lived through it myself. It will always be a part of me.I could go on, but I won't :-) Go get the book; Sherri Fink has done a much better job than I could do here. This book is as rich as any novel I have read, and it is also completely true. I am amazed by this.

Escher's masterfully drawn plates take you on a tour of a surreal world where nothing is what it seems and mathematical perfection is the guide."},{"Title":"World of M.C. Escher.","review":"This book is essentially a printing of 184 of M.C. Escher's most well known pieces, combined with a 16 pg scholarly overview by J. L. Lochner.I've always been a fan of Escher's art (as is true of many people with a somewhat scientific bent) - I enjoy the way he plays with the perceptions of the viewer ... with conflicting nuances of perspective, texture, color, outline, light, shadow, as well as with his studies of how to use the finite to evoke the infinite. In any case, this book was an opportunity to dive more deeply into the artist's varied works - not just his well know pieces, but also many of his lesser known ones.The author's introduction is very capable and illuminating (if a bit short) - taking the reader on a journey across the artist's career (including both his pre 1937 period in which he focused mainly on the Italian and Spanish countryside; and his post 1937 period, in which he focused increasingly on studies in perspective, metamorphosis, and the infinite), and illuminating aspects that many viewers miss out on ... such as the artist's incredible talent for spatial precision and fine etchmanship (most of Escher's works are carved, rather than drawn - something that's easy to miss out on if you've only seen pictures of the works, rather than the originals themselves).All in all, I found this book to be a very adequate, if unspectacular, introductory overview of Escher's works."},{"Title":"Manuale typographicum","review":"A fine example of the beautiful possibilities of typographic expression.

A slight disappointment here."},{"Title":"Light of the Moon","review":"This BC novel is one of my favorites. I don't need to add the synopsis because it was very well explained by another reviewer (see below). I just want to say that I haven't had so many palpitations while reading romantic novels as I had with this one. Once again, even though I very much enjoy the sweet and romantic Cartland style, I like bettter the stories that include misunderstandings around the heroine, and jealousy, and distrust and so and so. So if you don't like that, please do not pay attention to my rankings.Our male character is by far the more ghastly and bad-intentioned personage I've read about in the BC novels. He throws parties just to make his so-called friends sin, he wants to see them go down in disgrace, he is looking for revenge against the social world and wants all the gentlemen to become rakes, just as he is, and just as he intends to keep being. Then he meets our heroine disguised as a gaiety girl. She looks too sweet and innocent to be his penniless friend's mistress, but he thinks that must be because she surely is not very sophisticated... yet. She must be new at this. She must. There is no other explanation... there cannot be. AND! She must be very much in love with her protector, she not only refused other man's proposals, a richer man, but she has made very clear to the Marquis she won't do anything that could upset his protector. That's how much she loves him, above luxuries or commodities, and that, of course, is what our dear Marquis has always wanted, someone who loves him for himself and himself only, and no for his title or his money.There is no one single part where he loses control, not even one line where he is not in command of himself, so there is no room for the raging part, and what is better, there is no need for it. It's all the efforts he makes to get her heart, and the way she seems not to fell in love with him because she still cares more for her protector, what I liked the most. He, a total rake, a rich and handsome Marquis, a man who has always had every woman he fancies at his feet, was so in love with her that was ready to play second in her life, than not to be in it at all!I loved this book. After I finished the last page, I told myself: We have a winner!Quote:\\"I suppose if I were man enough I would challenge you to a duel, but if you killed me, doubtless you would get my sister cheaper than you have got her already! I am taking her away and tomorrow I will leave the deed of my estate at your house in London!\\""},{"Title":"Light of the Moon","review":"As I've said in other reviews, you either love Barbara Cartland's style or you don't. Since she was born in the early 1900's, I'm sure she remembered a time when young women were as innocent as her heroines are - before the advent of mass media. Most of her books are rather short, but lately I've found others that were a little more substantive. This is one of those.Our nave heroine, Neoma, has somehow held hearth and home together after the death of her parents. Her older brother (all of nineteen), Peregrine, has moved them both to London and they reside in a rather tawdry area where many of the ton's mistresses reside. Neoma longs to return to their country manor which held delight (and fresher food) even in its rather dilapidated condition. But Peregrine loves the excitement of London and enjoys his club with his equally penniless friend Charles Waddesdon. The young men joke with each other and give each other phony IOUs when playing piquet at Whites. Unfortunately, one of these IOUs falls into the hands of the Marquis of Rosyth. I'll leave you to find out how he obtained it.The Marquis invites the two young men to his fabulous estate (named Syth) outside of London, where he is known for his wild parties. They are to bring their own \\"ladies\\" for gratification. The pair decide that perhaps the IOU can be stolen from the Marquis at this party and solve their problem since neither has money to redeem it. Charles brings an \\"actress-friend\\" and Peregrine brings his sister - telling her to not say she is his sister and to wear a little makeup to fool their host. (I found Peregrine to be selfish in his dealings with his sister but he does redeem himself later).Off they go, where indeed the party is wild and the other participants debauched. Neoma is confused about what is going on. She is so unworldly that she has no idea these are \\"fallen\\" women. She notes that the Marquis is rather detached from the situation and appears to watch and enjoy the depravity with a contemptuous attitude. He has his own lovely \\"La Flame\\" to entertain him. He, also, is confused about Neoma because she seems so untouched. They end up riding in the morning when he finds her visiting the stable. All the other guests are sleeping off their drunkenness! Neoma enjoys hearing about the history of the house and visits the rooms with Syth's curator and has several conversations with the Marquis about books, paintings and other of the household contents.There are many interesting situations within the pages of this book. There is the ever important Derby in which the Marquis's horse is running. Another twist involves an evil gentleman who has designs on Neoma. Plus there is the drama of Neoma trying to steal the IOU. She is caught by the Marquis himself who extracts a price that Neoma isn't even aware of! How will it all end? You find out why the Marquis is the way he is - and come to understand him better. It all ends happily, yet there is a paragraph about what a difficult road lies ahead for our loving couple. Typical Cartland style but pleasurable reading."},{"Title":"The White Priory Murders","review":"John Dickson Carr (alias Carter Dickson) is at or near the peak of his formidable talents in this book. The pace is fast, the atmosphere chilling, and the characterizations realistic and interesting, which I think in itself tends to separate him from the other great creator of Golden Age mysteries, Agatha Christie. He mixes in humor and romance nicely. And most importantly, he creates the most baffling and difficult to solve murder puzzles that any mystery writer has ever managed. This element is really brilliant and impressive, and this is one of his most challenging puzzles (how did the murderer not make any footprints in the unbroken snow around the victim's cottage--the only set was left by the discoverer of the body! Whatever you are guessing....probably not), and most elegant and satisfying solutions.Carr/ Dickson's portrayal of women is somewhat controversial I think, but I am generally impressed that he creates and obviously likes and admires strong women who defy conventions in pursuit of what they want. The victim here is well drawn--a charismatic and brilliant actress, though unfortunately selfish, callous, and manipulative, which brings about her downfall--but I won't give away details.This is one of the finest books featuring Dickson's detective H.M. (Sir Henry Merrivale), who combines keen intelligence, ill-temper, lowbrow humor, and bombast in a very Churchill-like way. Like Churchill he is given a background as a prominent WWI era government official, though I trust H.M.'s management of military intelligence went a bit better than Sir Winston's rocky tenure at the Admiralty--certainly if he brought to bear the brilliance and shrewdness on display in this classic whodunnit."},{"Title":"The White Priory Murders","review":"The author is at the top of his form in this hilarious and puzzling tale involving Sir Henrey Merrivale.

The first time I was on a long flight, and this book provided a totally engrossing and welcome distraction from other thoughts! The story is about a pharmaceutical company exec aiming for personal gain &amp; glory by trying to rush a diet drug first to clinical trials and then to the public, despite growing evidence that the drug has potentially devastating side effects.

I look forward to reading the authors next book."},{"Title":"Thin","review":"This is one of the kind of books you start reading in the evening, and you don't put down reading it, even if you are reading all night. Scary. Makes you seriously wonder about corporate ethics. The plot is very realistic and very detailed. It must be based on a real and possibly covered-up story. Much worse than the Enron scandal - at least Enron was only about money. If the story is real, this would be a scandal of epic proportions. Egomania and greed with a disregard for human life. If I remember right, a San Diego biotech one paid a hitman to take out a competitor. &quot;Thin&quot; may be another story that has not hit the newsdesks (yet). Even if it is pure fiction, &quot;thin&quot; is one of the best novel I have read in a very long time. I wonder who owns the movie rights to this one."},{"Title":"Thin","review":"Little did I know when I ordered a random book from a new author, what was in store for me. I did not put the book down until I was finished with it. I spent a sleepless night reading, curious as to what the outcome was. The plot seems very realistic - outright scary, if you think how monetary greed can motivate the wrong people to do the wrong things. I wonder if this story is based on a real event - there are many details that sound just like it. I think Winston has created a splash - I am waiting for the sequel or at least the movie to go with this. Based on the book, I'd put the author into the leagues of the Tomm Clancy's and Michael Crichton's. A must read for anybody."},{"Title":"Thin","review":"One of the best thrillers among my recent collection and that of a new and budding author. I was intrigued by both characters and plot. Having friends who worked in ambitious pharma companies, I can see certain paralells about how ruthless a business can get when driven by greed and the potential to earn big bucks. Apart from the fact that the reporter seems somewhat of an exhibitionist, the plot is convincing and realistic in most parts. Can't wait to read the sequel."},{"Title":"Thin","review":"Great story.

I think we have another Michael Crichton in the making - this book is best seller material. I can see it become the basis for another Steven Spielberg movie! Must read!!"},{"Title":"Thin","review":"This book rocks - it paints a very different picture of the ongoings in the pharma world - very intense and a very unexpected ending.

And an acceptable strategy to accomplish that summarization is not trussing up the lack of a coherent point with fancy words and numerous citations and references that amount, essentially, to academic name-dropping. This, unfortunately, is how Liria Evangelista spends the vast majority of her book.Original thoughts are few and far between. \\"As so and so says,\\" or \\"Utilizing the framework of such-and-such\\" is the norm. The book can at best be described as rather inauspicious, at worst as a self-congratulatory academic inside joke.Evangelista sets out to examine works of art (written, recorded, and filmed) created in the aftermath of Argentina's military dictatorship of 1976-1983, the euphemistically self-dubbed \\"Process of National Reorganization.\\"This is definitely not to say that the subject is unworthy of further exploration. I think it is the very rarest of subjects (if any at all) that does not merit further explanation. And Argentina's military dictatorship had a profound effect on that nation's citizenry, civil society and national self-image, as Evangelista acknowledges.But Evangelista never forges a point, never makes a generalization - no matter how broad - of what connects or does not connect the novels, films and rock songs she examines. Indeed, she offers no formal conclusion whatsoever. Her book just dead-ends, as do her futile attempts to bring clarity to a time of national turmoil."},{"Title":"VoIP Hacks: Tips & Tools for Internet Telephony","review":"I've been in telephony and networking for nearly 30 years. Started in R&D; at a PBX manufacturer in 1979, then did a stretch with the, at that time, worlds largest Ethernet company. Then I worked on a Fiber Optic Voice and Data MAN (IEEE 802.6) and have been manufacturing telecom products for the past 14 years. I think that gives me the qualifications to critique this book even without having to mention the Ethernet board I designed for IBM was featured on the cover of PC Week Magazine in 1987.This is a very good book. If you are a VoIP systems integrator or do anything with Asterisk, this book is a must have. There are major problems with the current state of the VoIP industry. The two biggest problems are security and the unavailability of a decent broadband connection with QoS and an SLA below $400 per MegaBit. Yes $400, but we're talking guaranteed availability and less than 0.5% packet loss,and 50mS or less latency with real penalties for not meeting the SLA.Before reading this book I would not have considered putting an IP-PBX on an ADSL link. The author's idea of putting a Sangoma ADLS modem in the Linux box with PPPoE client software and controlling the modem queue is nothing short of genius. Then to top it off with the AstShape QoS scripts and the QoS monitoring tools, this book is an absolute bargain. With these tools I'll not only know if the ADSL connection is capable of supporting VoIP service, but I'll know exactly why. Much better than cutting over to the VoIP system and later discovering the problems. The whole book is just full of great ideas. There is something in this book for everybody from the Skype user to a single VoIP phone owner, Asterisk, or enterprise PBX administrators. Just check out the Table of Contents. Amazon does not have the Table of Contents available but it is on the O'Reilly website oreilly D0T C0M.While the book is an asset for seasoned VoIP integrators, it is also a very good resource for someone completely unfamiliar with VoIP with a desire to learn. You can start out with free software for a Windows PC, progress to purchasing a single VoIP phone, then to a Linux PC. If you are leary of Linux, either get over it or you should probably stay out of VoIP altogether."},{"Title":"VoIP Hacks: Tips & Tools for Internet Telephony","review":"I enjoyed reading this book.

That is really handy."},{"Title":"VoIP Hacks: Tips & Tools for Internet Telephony","review":"Voice over IP, as with most emerging technologies, in the process of shaking up the world, in this case Public Switched Telephone Network and Plain Old Telephony Service. The author starts of the book off at the most basic entry point for most consumers into the world of VoIP, which is background about the main commerical carriers such as Vonage. The introductary chapters continue to build on the most elementary approach, giving the reader advice on modifying the soft phone[s] that the respective carriers will allow or provide to the consumers, such as alternating ring tones. It isn't long before Ted is explaining how to compeletly re-wire the house over to a pure VoIP infastructure using the existing wiring in your home as well as an, or the ATA provided by the carrier. While this is undoubtly over the casual readers head and possibly comfort level it is good see that this option is explored and explained for those that might not be aware of this solution.Of course, other VoIP solutions are explored. Skype, is mentioned and basic features are explored, although the detail provided on Skype is not as detailed as those of other solutions, which maybe due to the coverage for Skype under the Skype Hacks book. However, the coverage for building your own VoIP via Asterisk is quite detailed and in-depth. Options that explored for this approach, are call forwarding, hold music, voice mail applications and distinctive ring as well as basic advice on setting up and compiling the application. The process appears to be able to easy to implement, but alas was not tried due to this reviewers use of Skype for his VoIP needs.Also in the closing chapters of the book, issues of improving QoS are addressed as is the legacy signalling protocol that H.323 is since the adoption of SIP. Since QoS is vital to ensuring that VoIP traffic receives the bandwidth that it needs Ted gives us some basic commands to find out if there is jitter [dropped datagrams] and some ways to fix this issue. However, it should be noted that this chapter, as with most of the later half of the book is more in line for larger scale operations that use Linux/Unix and building their own office VoIP solutions.To summarize, VoIP hacks does offer something for everyone, although the hacks provided in the latter chapters are geared to the enterprise level deployment of VoIP. That's not to say that the information is not relevant or even eye opening, just the average home user will find little to apply this to."},{"Title":"VoIP Hacks: Tips & Tools for Internet Telephony","review":"VoIP isn't just a fad or the hot thing in the computer/Internet world, it's what is beginning to, and eventually WILL replace the old style AT&T; phone system that has predominated in the world for the past 100 or so years. With the availability of high speed Internet and the technology to go along with it, VoIP (voice over IP) has re-engineered how we talk to each other, making voice communication faster, quicker, and CHEAPER than ever before. AT&T; and the big phone companies have long raped consumers of their hard-earned dollars with tons of fees and overpriced \\"features\\". Its was only a matter of time before a better alternative came about, and now it's here and the # of new VoIP users that come online every day is staggering.

I often give the criticism that many popular physics books are too dumbed down --so much so, that they often erroneously convey the information such that what is said is only minimally true. This work, by Trefil, easily overcomes this challenge, as he finds ways of overcoming many, many challenges that one faces in converting hard physics discussion into a discussion consumed by non-scientists and scientists-in-training. He presents his subject, particle physics, in a way that uses most of the tools available to a science writer, and his proficiency in them makes for a very readable and enjoyable book. Trefil employs metaphors, analogies, simplified scientific tables, efficaciously designed diagrams, and single, well-chosen equations that convey his point from a different angle. I think that popular physics, histories of physics, and philosophy of physics should always make use of an equation whenever it can convey more information than words or help the imagination of the reader, even if it is only included in a footnote. Trefil uses equations in a way that would not be imposing to a reader who is averse to math. For me, the inclusion of these equations made me say, \\"Okay, I know what he means, and I see where he is going.\\" This was incredibly beneficial, because I have a technical background, but do not specialize in particle physics (and I have not taken a course devoted to its study).One point to make on the decay diagram and interaction diagrams: At first glance, they may scare the non-science-trained reader, but, after reading the relevant section on the interactions and decays, they will probably be very helpful. If you flip through the book, don't be intimidated, if you are inclined to be, because they can be skipped without taking away from the text; if anything, they are a positive, no matter how you slice it.As far as the manner in which he constructs his history, it is very impressive, in that he weaves physics with the developmental history of particle physics, yet the book is written in a fun way. If you are a serious reader, the book is smooth enough to take you the whole of a couple hours to read. The thing I like about a physicist writing this kind of book is that I don't feel as though there was much to add to the matter with which was to be dealt in this book. Of course, any such explication can go deeper, to the point of cutting edge technical physics; but what I mean is that there were no areas or major questions that I felt Trefil stayed away from. It is very satisfying to read such a work.Probably the only criticism I can give a book that is this good, is that I would have liked to see more leadoff into philosophy of physics. (I do dislike how books written by physicists that give momentary, platitudinous mention of ancient philosophers, such as Democritus and Thales, but I do respect the acknowledgement of heritage --not that many physicists take it all that seriously.) I won't go into much detail, here, but I think, in the discussion on color confinement and asymptotic freedom, he could have posed a question like, \\"What does it mean for there to be individual quarks that are never found in nature, individually?\\" I present this one, because think it is close enough to being a physical question that it is a legitimate philosophical question to ask for this kind of text.Overall, wonderful book!"},{"Title":"From Atoms to Quarks:An Introduction to the Strange World of Particle Physics","review":"I love the way this book brings you [mostly] up to speed on the world of particle physics with a ground level perspective. That is they don't look back dismissing things that we know now to be false or inaccurate. They take each discovery and show how it leads to the next - good, bad, or ugly. It's a very refreshing style, one that doesn't rewrite history and that gives you a great sense of _how_ we made discoveries one after the other (or a convoluted path of errors to correct understanding).The book is a bit dated, and a lot has been learned since. I would love an even more updated version. And it's not even too terribly deep. Anyone vaguely interested should be able to follow along. There are a few numbers in the pages, but they can be safely skipped."},{"Title":"From Atoms to Quarks:An Introduction to the Strange World of Particle Physics","review":"The original 1980 edition of \\"From Atoms to Quarks: An Introduction to the Strange World of Particle Physics,\\" is a fine exposition of the state-of-the-art in particle physics at the end of the 1970's. It is written at a level that a keen layperson can understand, but also provides technical detail that may quickly provide insight for an advanced undergrad or early grad student intending to major in particle physics or physics in general. Although advances in theoretical physics have moved beyond the content in this book, I believe the majority of what is presented remains an important part of accepted practice in theoretical particle physics.

This book doesn't understand anything about SUPER GLOBALS or any of the new 4.2 features.The examples assume that you have register_globals=on in your ini file, and I believe the default under PHP 4.2.x is to have this off. Therefore the examples won't work as expected unless you turn this option on. The author does tell you this. What isn't mentioned is that this technique is now deprecated in favor of the newer way of passing information in 4.2.x.The examples are downloadable from the WROX web site, but there is no version of them that's been converted for PHP 4.2.x. If there were, it would make the book more up to date even if you have to read between the lines a bit.Michael Kofler's MySQL book has a good PHP section, and his web site provides downloadable examples for both the older PHP versions as well as 4.2.x. His book was written in 2001, and he maintains his work to reflect changes in the industry to keep his material current. Now there's an author who cares!Using Kofler's examples I compared the older against the newer code and that gave me enough information to convert the examples in this book to PHP 4.2.xThis is a good book, but I wish it were a bit more current."},{"Title":"Beginning PHP4 (Programmer to Programmer)","review":"I have bought or borrowed every book on PHP.

The best thing to do is read the first half of the book (through chapter 9) and then skip around to what interests you. As others have mentioned, you will have to modify the code in the examples to get them to work because of the use of globals. This is not impossible to overcome if you write the message board for the book at http://p2p.wrox.com. However, it is annoying. There are other errors too, but it doesn't take much in the way of trial and error to get around them. The three chapters on MySQL are the most useful. If you've worked with databases in other scripting languages, e.g. Perl, Python, or Ruby, it's simply a matter of looking up what you want to do. There are some good style examples on structuring PHP code - use of an &quot;$action&quot; variable to drive the behavior of the site from a single page. The book also stresses putting reusable code in include files. The author dismisses classes/objects as not really being useful in PHP, but the use of classes elimates the need for the &quot;global&quot; declarations in many of the common include files. All in all, this is an adequate book, but noting profound. If you have programming experience, this book will get you up and running quickly."},{"Title":"Beginning PHP4 (Programmer to Programmer)","review":"....get the Professional book, even if you have limited PHP experience.

It is well written, and intended for someone with no programming experience."},{"Title":"Beginning PHP4 (Programmer to Programmer)","review":"I knew basic HTML and that was it.

I think it is the ideal book for someone to start learning PHP.

PHP Essentials gets you right into doing neat things without getting you bogged down for days and weeks in variable definitions, type casting, and other obscure things. I also found the examples after the beginning chapters were too complex to figure out what was going on. Having said that, I do like to have two books when studying a language so that I can use one as a reference. When I find something unclear in the main book I am studying, or want some nitty gritty detail not covered, I can look it up in the other book. In that regard, I find Beginning PHP4 very useful. One last thing to note: Wrox has a website with discussion forums for each of their books, which in theory is a great idea. You can go to those forums and discuss specific problems you are having relating to your book. Once again, a fantastic idea. However, in practice it is a failure. The forums themselves are poorly created, so mechanically they don't work well, which is really somewhat hard to believe, since there are free php forums at www.devshed.com and www.wsabstract.com that are technical wonders. Furthermore, I found answers to posts at the Wrox Beginning PHP4 forum are not forthcoming, which is probably due to the poor mechanics."},{"Title":"Beginning PHP4 (Programmer to Programmer)","review":"It's sad to say that this book is getting a bit out of date. So many of the examples use coding conventions which just don't apply any more. I also found it to have a fairly counter-intuitive approach. Why must we wait until halfway through the book before we see anything about databases? Surely databases are what server-side scripting is about?I came to this book, having been led into PHP by other titles I had read, but I felt - not so much dissapointed - but maybe just a bit dissatisfied. It seems there is no title out there which is sufficiently up to date to show me my next step. Perhaps this publisher is hanging fire until PHP5 comes along, but if they are I must say it's a frustrating wait for the rest of us who have to earn our living doing this stuff. Maybe I should try their Professional title?"},{"Title":"Beginning PHP4 (Programmer to Programmer)","review":"This is a great book for anyone who doesn't know anything about the PHP language.

It is also very inconsistant later on, as the various authors seem to believe in very different conventions, for example early on they claim type casting is unnecessary, then in Ch. 10 they use it loads - without any explanation, also in Ch. 10 they start introducing new functions without any explanation of how they work or even what they do (they explain some but not others) and the examples are really tedious due to similarity in some parts. The different authors also type the same commands differently (e.g echo &quot;&quot;; and echo(&quot;&quot;); - again without explanation, and they obviously didn't collaborate enough to ensure consistency.Otherwise an ok introduction to PHP4, but I'm sure there are better guides out these that will be more consistent."},{"Title":"Beginning PHP4 (Programmer to Programmer)","review":"The title of this review says it all... if you are new to PHP, this is the first book you should get.

Sure I paid them for it but I demanded this book. I'm not quite sure why I did but at the time I was wanting to learn PHP and I was not happy with the way the O'Reilly books were written for Perl (2nd Edition) so I knew that I was not going O'Reilly for learning PHP4. Now that I've had this book and time has passed I would say that I have suggested this book to lots of people and they have all learned PHP alot easier then they would have from O'Reilly books.I say go WNOR, Chris, et al. You all did a good job. I felt like the authors were sitting over my shoulder and giving me a one on one session each time I read the book. The examples were fun, understandable, and had a point them. They also helped me to have a better understanding in Programming in general. The next year, I had a C/C++ programming class and Aced it without a problem. You know, they say 9 out of 10 students fail their first programming class. I wasn't one of those nine thanks to this book."},{"Title":"Beginning PHP4 (Programmer to Programmer)","review":"Whenever anyone asks me which book I recommend for someone just starting out with PHP I recommend this one. The book is an excellent introduction to not only PHP but also to mySQL , database design, and elementary programming prinicipals such as arrays and datatypes. With confidence I can recommend this book to a beginner that has never used a database before (let alone designed one) or programmed before and know that with this one book they can get a handle on how to create a simple database driven php site. I found the examples to be excellent. In fact, I have reused code in this book on my projects several times.As a book for beginners should be written, it assumes no prior knowledge whatsoever and is easy and enjoyable to read. The one thing the book does assume, which I think is a must, is prior knowledge of HTML and some Javascript. If you've never even built a webpage before, you should start with learning those 2 things first before picking up this book."},{"Title":"Beginning PHP4 (Programmer to Programmer)","review":"I recently purchased this book, and as some of the other reviewers have said, it rarely leaves my desk. I found this book to be written at an ideal level of difficulty for someone with a good working knowledge of HTML, and NOTHING more.This book has helped me develop from a static HTML designer to a capable PHP programmer. The book covers a number of topics that I'd always wanted to use on my sites, including: cookies, sessions, interactive forms, and database connectivity, including an introduction to using SQL to connect to a number of different databases.The book has a number of tutorials and examples which perform the key function of transferring what you are learning into practical examples (often lacking in beginning books).There is also a great appendix of functions that gives the new programmer a reference to which they can refer for quick answers. Finally, and maybe best of all, Wrox has a great Web site with a number of forums related to the topics covered in the book.Overall, it's a great book for beginners. I used what I'd learned in the first week to add a number of dynamic features to my own Web sites, and the difference was instantly noticeable. Best of luck!"},{"Title":"Beginning PHP4 (Programmer to Programmer)","review":"I am a complete beginner and found the book fairly easy to read and apply. However, some of the scripts I downloaded don't seem to work. Maybe its my lack of understanding, I don't know...You must know how to read html to get anywhere with PHP. You can use Dreamweaver or any other HTML editor to write your scripts in.The book has a good Appendix for all the PHP functions and the authors do a great job at explaining PHP at the beginning of the book.Each chapter starts off with a real basic script as it develops and adds more functions to the script until you end up with a fairly advanced script. Every time they add more stuff to a script they break each line down with explanations.Over all its a good place to start with a lot of Reference material for advanced users. However, if you have never programmed or want to get an easier start with php, I recommend &quot;Php : Your Visual Blueprint for Creating Open Source, Server-Side Content&quot; ISBN: 0764535617.

It is good for people who are new to PHP but not so good for people who are new to programming. I've done a lot of programming in other languages and needed to learn PHP in a big hurry for a project that I was about to take on. This book got me up to speed fast. I'm inclined to think that a lot of the negative reviews are from people without any programming background. I agree this book is not the right place to start if you are a non-programmer. I've also done a fair amount of html prior to reading this book, I found that it's html section and php techniques for generating forms was really excellent, I learned some really great things!As far as depth goes, such as discussing details of the functions. Well, that's what the php manual is for (www.php.net). Initially I tried to learn the language from the php manual alone but didn't get very far, I couldn't see the forest because the trees were in the way, eg too much detail without a big picture. What this book does is to focus on the big picture of how and why to do something. It also shows multiple approachs to the same problem and compares them so that you get an idea of the alternatives and trade-offs.Starting from not knowing php to writing some very sophisticated programs... I learned it all with two books and the manual. The other book that I read is PHP Developers Cookbook. The two books are very complimentary, there is not that much overlap between them instead they fill each others gaps. Note that the \\"Cookbook\\" is more advanced and assumes that you already know a lot of php.Okay, the one big gripe that I have is their lack of proof reading. They must have really rushed this to press. There are literally hundreds of errors and the errata sheet is incomplete. However it is easy to get past the errors as long as you don't make the assumption that the text is always correct. In other words, if something doesn't make sense then you should be suspicious of an error instead of always assuming that it's your lack of understanding.The necessity of Rewriting the code examples is a little annoying, but the book can hardly be faulted for language changes that were made after the book was published. PHP is a rapidly moving target, no book will ever be current for very long. And besides, the best way to understand a program is to take it apart and rewrite it, that's why they are called \\"Examples\\". (most of the changes needed are trivial).Mostly what you need to do is to change $varname to $_REQUEST['varname']and that will fix it. If you are having trouble finding the correct variable then usephpinfo();to get a list of all of the available variables, then you just pick what you need from the list and put a $ in front of it.(...)By the way, the code examples can be downloaded from their website which can save a lot of typing..."},{"Title":"Beginning PHP4 (Programmer to Programmer)","review":"I am very pleased with Beginning PHP 4 and it's rarely off my desk. I'd highly recommend it to anyone wanting to get a fast, no nonsense tutorial and a great reference for PHP.This book is probably not for someone creating their first Web site. It assumes that the reader can code and publish HTML. I also think it would be a good idea for prospective buyers to visit some PHP sites ... before jumping into \\"Begining\\" PHP 4.Beginning PHP 4 teaches by example so the reader learns functions and techniques VERY quickly as they build working projects. Plus, the layout of the book is such that the reader can drop into any chapter and get a brush-up tutorial and sample code.So... get a basic feel for PHP, write a few simple PHP enhanced pages on your own and you'll REALLY enjoy this book.

It helps things to sink in better if it's repeated several times.Yes, this book has errors and typos just like any other book does, but if you go to the Wrox website, they have a very good eratta. I printed it out, then cut each page's eratta into strips and inserted them into the apropiate pages. No more problem!If you're a complete newbie to programming or PHP, get this book!

It solves no problem that exists. If you have never programmed, it will not teach you how. If you have, the book is sufficiently chaotic in its organization, and lacking in rigor, that you will find it difficult to get the information you want. And if once read, the book should be discarded, because it cannot be used as a reference.In an attempt, presumably, to produce a book that is not overly burdensome for a \\"beginner,\\" descriptions are frequently sloppy and filled with half-truths. The authors would have been much more successful in appealing to the inexperienced reader by significantly reducing the size of the book. Few in the target audience want to start with a 750+ page volume.As an example of the sloppiness I indicated above, the authors go to the trouble to distinguish between \\"parameters\\" and \\"arguments,\\" and then immediately use the terms with exactly the opposite meanings. For the purists among us, there is also a misuse of \\"less\\" and \\"fewer.\\" Finally, there are frequent references to appendices that do not exist.For anyone interested in PHP, I would recommend \\"Professional PHP Programming\\" if you want to stay in the Wrox family.

Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Beginning PHP4 (Programmer to Programmer)","review":"This book reads as if someone recorded a group of teen-aged programmers telling someone how to write PHP scripts, and then simply transcribed what they said into a book. The style of writing is so sophomoric and the pacing is so distracting that I found it almost unreadable.The sentences are poorly constructed, and usually contain too many unnecessary words. I realize that the style is supposed to be casual, but it is possible to write in a casual style, without mixing metaphors, and adding words, in sentences like this one (from page 39):\\"Once we've established, at a fairly basic level, what goes on under the hood of PHP, we will take a look at some of the building blocks of the language, and how we can use PHP to store information in our web pages.\\"First of all, is PHP like a car, or is like a building? Secondly, are we really going to learn how to store information in web pages? Don't you store information in files and databases and environment variables, and retrieve and display information on web pages? Perhaps the author of thissentence meant that we will learn how to store information which we receive from users who have typed that information into forms on web pages.The quoted sentence could have been changed to something like:\\"In this chapter we will give a brief outline of how PHP works, and list some of its key features. We will also show how to display a web page which allows someone to enter information which the script will then store on a web server.\\"It has been pointed out to me that the phrase \\"building blocks\\" in that sentence might refer to the components of PHP, or alternatively it might refer to the features of PHP being used as the building blocks of a system. In that case my suggested revision for the sentence would have to be changed. In either case, the sentence is confusing.I do not mean to single out this sentence in particular. This book is full of sentences like this.I suppose the authors of \\"Beginning PHP4\\" know something about PHP, but they don't seem to know the first thing about constructing a proper sentence. While it might be true that programming books should be written by programmers, they should be edited by professional editors.I usually buy the O'Reilly books, but my local bookstore was out of stock on O'Reilly PHP books, so I took a chance on this Wrox book.

They didn't introduce functions adequately in the latter parts of the book, for example in chapter 10 they start using new functions without any explanation of what they do or their usage, and the different authors didn't collaborate sufficiently as they use different ways of writing the same commands without any explanation (e.g. the echo &quot;&quot; and echo(&quot;&quot;) statements) and they also contradicted each other, for example again in chapter 10 the author uses typecasting while in a previous chapter we had been told this was unnecessary, and again no explanation is given as to why the author did this.The examples are also very tedious and in some places extremely repetitive (chapter 10 repeats the same example ten times with very little change).Overall a great dissapointment and it is also out of date as new PHP security means most examples will not work without changing to a weaker security setting.Not recommended, there must be more consistent books about for PHP."},{"Title":"Beginning PHP4 (Programmer to Programmer)","review":"The book was great.

I audited the 6-CD version, which is a powerful explication of the many historical &amp; geographic strands that led to 1492. Ruiz explores the social, political, economic &amp; religious factors that were bubbling up in the Iberian peninsula in the 14th &amp; 15th centuries.The title, &quot;The Other 1492,&quot; points to Ruiz's central thesis, which is that the discovery of the New World, significant as it was for the rest of history, was seen by contemporaries as a relatively minor event in itself. Thus he elucidates what he sees as the key events &amp; persons of the time.He explains the nature &amp; effects of the Islamic conquest of much of Spain, as well as the nature &amp; effects of the Reconquest (which culminated in the surrender of Granada in 1492).What we now know as Spain, Ruiz explains, was then a group of kingdoms speaking a variety of distinct languages, with Castilian (the basis of modern Spanish) emerging as dominant over time. (Ruiz notes in passing that the other ancient languages of the area, such as Catalan, have re-emerged in recent times.)Among the most striking revelations is Ruiz's analysis of the Converso phenomenon, i.e., the conversion of about 100,000 (probably around 50%) of Spain's Jews to Christianity, especially after major anti-Jewish movements in 1391.Especially interesting is his detailing of voluntary conversions, including one notable Jewish leader who converted voluntarily before the anti-Jewish activities, &amp; went on to become an honored bishop in the church, &amp; whose children (born before his conversion) also achieved prominence in the Spanish intellectual &amp; economic hierarchy.His lecture on the Spanish Inquisition puts it in quite a different light than a general reading of history is likely to, &amp; brings out a variety of motives for it, some obvious, others much less so.Despite his stressing of the minimal effects of Columbus' voyages at the time (especially compared to the Portuguese expeditions, such as Vasco da Gama's), Ruiz does devote at least one full lecture to Columbus, dispelling many of the myths, positive &amp; negative, which have grown up around the great Genoese sailor. He also touches on the after-effects of the Spanish conquests in the New World, shedding a good bit of light on the era.Ruiz does not hesitate to note &amp; discuss scholarly controversies about many of the events &amp; figures he discusses, while providing his informed &amp; nuanced opinion of the realities.Like so many of the Teaching Company series of lectures by top historians, this one is an example of the best that scholarship has to offer to the intelligent &amp; interested layman who is not fortunate enough to be a student in (as the Teaching Company's propaganda suggests) the best classrooms in the world. I listen to the CDs on a portable player as I go for my daily walks, often following up by reading further on the subject.I repeat that I don't know what the &quot;abridged&quot; CD comprises, &amp; would suggest exploring that before purchasing. I can wholeheartedly endorse the full 6-CD set as an enlightening, entertaining &amp; even moving educational experience."},{"Title":"My Home is the Farm: Who Am I?

Critics will place him in a pantheon that includes Joyce, Musil, Kafka, Mann, and Proust. Son of a well-off Jewish textile manufacturer (at an early age he converted to Catholicism), Broch had thirst for high intellect. Eventually he gave up his academic plans, his future as an industrialist, in pursuit of literature, through which he would deal with ethical questions and realms of experience rejected by the Vienna Circle of logical positivists. Likewise he devoted his life to the study of mass psychology and politics.&quot;The Sleepwalkers&quot; (published when the author was 40) is a trilogy, a three-dimensional work with one underlying philosophical unit. The first book, &quot;The Romantic&quot; portrays 19th century realism with von Pasenow as main character, a Prussian aristocrat clinging to ethical values considered outdated. The second book, &quot;The Anarchist,&quot; portrays the accountant Esch who is in search of a &quot;balance&quot; of values in unstable pre-war Germany. Both characters will meet in the third book &quot;The Realist,&quot; and will find hope in a fanatical religious sect, which foresees the coming of a Redeemer (fascism, Hitler). They will be defeated by Huguenau, an army deserter and opportunist, representing the new ethical standards of a society free of values or to put it correctly &quot;with no values.&quot; There are several parallel plots, a number of alienated characters, and cumbrous symbolism. To make things a bit more complex and elaborate, there are 16 chapters of poetry, and 10 chapters (Desintegration of Values) of sound and intensive philosophy.According to Broch, &quot;sleepwalkers&quot; refer to a gap between the death of an ethical system and the birth of another, as much as a somnambulist finds himself in a state between sleep and awake. The novel reflects the disintegration of values in Germany between 1880 and 1920, the psychological distress and disorientation of interwar Germany in which Nazism set its foot. Broch views the Renaissance as the starting point of disintegration of a unified Christian world into a multifaceted society with no ethical roots.This is a massive piece of literature, one that wil be viewed as lenghthy and boring if the reader is not willing to go beyond the &quot;first layer of the onion peel;&quot; it requires patience and perseverance. For any reader who wishes to crack down on Broch's literary work, &quot;Hermann Broch&quot; by Ernestine Schlant is a good suggestion."},{"Title":"The Sleepwalkers; a Trilogy","review":"Broch's Trilogy is the chronicle of the evolution of Germany in particular and the whole Europe in general between the years 1888 and 1918. The philosophical focus of the trilogy should be searched for in the third novel, Huguenau or the Realist and within that in the essay 'Disintegration of Values&quot;, which is allegedly written by a Bertrand Mueller, who according to Broch himself is the same Bertrand who appears in the first two novels of the trilogy. The essay on disintegration of values closely follows Max Weber's Protestant Ethics and the Spirit of Capitalism. In fact not before we understand Weber's theory of modernity and the role of the protestant reformation in the rise of modern Capitalism can we appreciate the full vigor of Broch's narrative. In ten separate parts, Broch explains masterfully the notion of style of an age, the relation of plastic arts with the the style, the concept of inner logic within each indididual value-system and the effect of it on the life of the individual. The third part of the novel, the realist, is the culmination of the trilogy as such. It is where all the characters meet and it is there that Broch uses all different narrative modes. A certain air of inevitablity is prevalent in Broch's narrative of the disintegration of values, which, in turn, appears to follow a certain Hegelian Historicism. This third novel of the trilogy consists of five separate parts, three of which are stories taking place in a German city near the Belgian borders and the other two are the story of the Salvation Army Girl in Berlin, which is Bertrand Mueller's journal and then his essay on the disintegration of values. It is Broch's wonderful technique to combine all five narratives as one by integrating the story of Huguenau in the essay, as though Mueller, omnisciently and from afar comments on the life of the people in this small and remote town. Bertrand Muellr, therefore, is Broch's own alter ego. He, along with Broch, is the author of Disintegration of Values. Reading The Sleepwalkers with patience is a joy. Loiter around every page, every line, every word, read them again and again and let them shine their light upon your eyes."},{"Title":"The Sleepwalkers; a Trilogy","review":"&quot;The Sleepwalkers&quot; deviates from the psychological novel as first conceived in the 19th century and endlessly reincarnated to this day by entering into a new territory where fiction is subserviant to and illustrative of philosophical principles. Thus the task of the reader is to decipher a surface which is at different times prosaic, irrational, symbolic, etc. This is not allegory or fable. The characters and situations are neither two dimensional nor transparently representational of secondary meanings. Rather, the author has let his intended supratext breath through more tangible and specific fictive embodiments. He does this with various success, more often than not needlessly obscuring his meaning by burying it too deeply. It is not as if the reader discovers Broch's meaning for himself so that by the end when it's spelled out in straightforward expository essay form the reader has already come to the same or deeper understanding. In fact, without Broch's plain exposition, contained in chapters entitled &quot;Disintegration of Values,&quot; I do not think the narrative fictive segments could stand on their own. Despite this limitation, which I take to be a limitation of the creative imagination at the expense of philosophical exposition, the work offers a vision of modernity that is at core irrefutable and in many aspects unique, making the effort to decipher &quot;The Sleepwalkers&quot; well worth the time."},{"Title":"The Sleepwalkers; a Trilogy","review":"&quot;The Sleepwalkers&quot;, by Hermann Broch, is one of the greatcultual achievements of the 20th Century. Today, over60 years after its original publication (and almost50 years after the English translation was published),its insights are perhaps even more relevant than before,due to the advent of so-called &quot;Post-Modernism&quot;, whichhas made a &quot;virtue&quot; out of the disintegration of valuesand the breakdown of life-forms in our society. Broch,in contrast, was committed to the task of findinga way through to meaningful life for all persons inour time.&quot;The Sleepwalkers&quot; offers diagnostic case-studies ofthe problem (often with a subtle wit), and, at theend of the book, briefly but powerfully points to asolution, in a renewal of community in inclusive discourse.Personally, when I first read &quot;The Sleepwalkers&quot;, ca. 1972, itit showed me why words might deserve to exist, and I feltthat, if I was who I wished I was, I would have writtenBroch's words. I was and remained struck by the&quot;ekstatic&quot; condition with which he must have beengraced to write this work (and other of his works,e.g., &quot;The Death of Virgil&quot;).Perhaps the ending words of &quot;The Virgil&quot; characterize,in a way different from how they are there meant,Broch's achievement: &quot;It was the word beyond speech&quot;."},{"Title":"The Sleepwalkers; a Trilogy","review":"I could not have finished The Sleepwalkers without the able assistance of Amazon reviewers. I assumed that this would be a novel similar to Embers or The Radetzky March. I could not have been more wrong. This is a very complex novel that can be read on many levels, philosophical, moral, and psychological. Regardless of which level you read, The Sleepwalkers is not a novel to take or read lightly. It requires great concentration and will inspire much reverie about modern life, values, and philosophy.The Sleepwalkers is a trilogy taking place in Prussia and Germany, starting in 1888 and ending in 1918. The first of the trilogy, The Romantic, takes place in 1888 and is about a Prussian aristocrat who adheres to the strict moral code of his forebears, leading to a loveless marriage that his family desires him to make. The second of the trilogy, The Anarchist, involves a bookkeeper struggling to find his place in Cologne and Mannheim in 1903. These two parts are fairly straightforward to read.The final part of the trilogy, The Realist, is longer and more difficult to read. Taking place in the final year of the First World War, it is a combination of five parts. The most straightforward part concerns an army deserter who settles in a German small town and insinuates himself into their society. He joins The Romantic, now a much older commander, brought forth from retirement to become Town Commandant, and The Anarchist, who has become editor of the local paper. Other fairly straightforward parts involve patients at the town's hospital and an alienated young woman whose husband is away at the war. The final two parts involve a character who has appeared in the other parts of the trilogy, Bertrand, who apparently represented the author himself. One part is Bertrand's journal, relating to his relationships to the Jewish community and a young woman in the Salvation Army. The last part is Bertrand's essay titled \\"The Disintegration of Values\\". Bertrand's essay is actually the point of the novel as a whole, and is integrated to correspond to various parts of the plot. However, it is very intense and philosophical.I recommend this book to those who want to read a complex, well-written, involving novel interspersed with profound philosophy. If you are looking for a quick read, this is not the novel for you. Although I'll probably never re-read the novel as a whole, I will read \\"The Disintegration of Values\\" again often."},{"Title":"The Sleepwalkers; a Trilogy","review":"The Sleepwalkers is a loosely connected trilogy of novels completed by Hermann Broch in 1931. Individual titles are The Romantic (1888), The Anarchist (1903), and The Realist (1918). Broch studies the psychological and social forces acting among men and women - artists, performers, intellectuals, labor organizers, beaurocrats, soldiers, merchants and shopowners - whose lives entangle in turn-of-the-century Germany.In The Romantic (1888), a young military officer crosses paths with a rising businessman in the vibrant complex of urban Berlin, as they become common rivals for status and female attention. While Major von Pasenow fusses over matters of custom and propriety in courtship, his regimental ways stand in contrast with the liberal affluence of Bertrand, who has a more playful and philosophical attitude to society and romance.In The Anarchist (1903) Bertrand has become a powerful \\"capitalist\\" in Mannheim, facing opposition from a conscientious accountant seeking to avenge the imprisonment of a friend and labor activist. As Esch gains the advantage, Bertrand clings to his philosophical position, and his sexual appetites move to the foreground in a confrontation with moral and tragic significance. The Anarchist concludes, about half-way through the book, with the accountant Esch marrying an inn-keeper and taking her to Luxembourg.At this point, after digesting a heavy diet of dreary social incidents, the reader may be feeling impressed but a little fatigued and weary of humorless conflict. Broch's characters may seem to be no more than profiles in anxiety, confronted with the fragility of their survival, detailed by a writer with a magnificent ability to ride the interface between internal consciousness and external events on a high philosophical level.But with The Realist (1918), we find Broch expanding and dividing his scope, a stylistic change that offers some relief from the congested format that came before, and allows Broch more perspective and digression. Following Hugenau, an Alsatian war deserter, we arrive at a German wine valley near the battle-front, now inhabited by Esch and his wife, publishers of a local newspaper, and von Pasenow who is the aging Town Commandant. Arriving in the midst of warfare, escaping his past and inventing his future, Hugenau brings fraud and ruin to Esch and his associates in the community.While we see the tragedy of war unfold through the eyes of local citizens, Broch inserts a series of essays on Hugenau, entitled \\"The Disintegration of Values\\", composed by an author who refers to himself as Bertrand, now acting as an adjunct narrator of events. Bertrand might appear to represent the views of the author, but I have my doubts about that. While Hugenau is clearly a monster, he is also a survivor, and Bertrand's claims to moral superiority are not entirely convincing given his role in The Anarchist.Modern readers may feel this chronicle resonating with familiar trends in society today. Broch deftly probes his human interiors, and his observations are resolved and rendered with imagination. But there is little optimism to be found as Broch dwells on the limitations, blunders and self-destructive ways of his characters, as they plant their individual seeds in a rotting garden of ignorance, decadence, lost opportunity, and failure.The translation leaves plenty to wish for, as the Muirs rely heavily on British colloquial forms of speech, and occasionally the rendering of certain passages seems awkward and belabored."},{"Title":"The Sleepwalkers; a Trilogy","review":"Sleepwalkers has shaped up to be one of my most favorite books of all time. Broch acutely depicts the dangerous tendency of modern human behavior to become corrupted and blinded by the world around it. His philosophy describes the 20th century completely as it slowly evolves and matures through each of his stories.A must read for anyone interested in modern works."},{"Title":"The Sleepwalkers; a Trilogy","review":"Since I enjoyed Canetti's Auto da Fe so much and am still working my way through Musil's Man without Qualities, Amazon was insistent that I try this novel. The first part (The Romantic) was slow going at first but by the end I was hooked. The second part (The Idealist) also held my interest in its main character. The last part (The Realist)was readable in parts, especially when the capitalist and swine Hugenau was on stage. Nevertheless, there were too many parts of the third book that seemed utterly boring and needlessly obscure and philosophical. The poems interspersed did not help either."},{"Title":"The Sleepwalkers; a Trilogy","review":"Even better than 'Death of Virgil'. A book that can stand up to Musil and Joyce: a masterwork of stylistics and ideas."},{"Title":"The Sleepwalkers; a Trilogy","review":"I wrote the first review here of _The Sleepwalkers_.Since a subsequent reviewer has mentioned Broch's &quot;political activities&quot;, perhaps it is relevant here to quote something his son (H.F. Broch de Rothermann) told me: &quot;There are many persons who could have done for the United Nations what my father did, but there is no one who can write the novels which for that reason [i.e., because Broch spent his time and energy on the UN instead of writing...] went unwritten.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Sleepwalkers; a Trilogy","review":"I had great hopes for this book: I love almost everything published by Vintage, and I'm a sucker for dead male writers (preferably Russian) and anything hinting at surreal or magical prose. So I thought- especially when I read some of the praise heaped on this guy- that I'd found some gem of the ex-pat age of disenchantment. After all, the guy was friends with James Joyce and has a staunch admirer in Milan Kundera.And the first section was great. Lots of beautiful passages and interesting writing, reminding me a bit of Proust in the bits about Ruzena and Pasenow. And I thought the next section (\\"The Anarchist\\") would be spicy and cool, but it ended up being this random story about a bookkeeper with a (sometimes) temper and some friends who are more interesting than him (the Communist cripple guy, the circus act), who ends up getting married to this restaurant-owning lady he doesn't like very much. There's seriously no anarchy to speak of. And his grandiose gestures are more like random acts that no one cares about (making the reports to the newspaper, quitting his jobs, threatening to move to America, seducing the widow).And the last section- my word. I don't care how smart you are: if you're writing a novel, you need to focus on the WRITING. And in the last 300 pages Broch just goes into these philosophizing nightmares. He doesn't even bother to characterize the thoughts (it's literally written in first person)- he just lays 'em out like a darned treatise. Which is a shame, because there are some really interesting people that crop up in the last section: a one-armed soldier who drinks and charms the nuns in the hospital, a spaced-out wife, and this heartbreaking guy who was literally buried alive and then spends his first months out of the coma surpressing all of his memories because he believes he is a new person arisen from the dead. There are all kinds of opportunities for good stories; I mean, the \\"anarchist\\" from part two turns into a kind of religious prophet and finds himself in this unwitting battle with a war deserter for the esteem and trust of the \\"romantic\\" from section one. Very Flannery O'Connor, no? And yet, my eyes literally glazed over. I was so irritated when I got to the sections about morality. Not to mention the ridiculous parts about the Jews in the boardinghouse and the Salvation Army girl.I dunno- maybe I'm not being fair to the book. I know the author is smart and has got ideas; I'm just not convinced he should write literature. Which is fine. Most people can't. So then- why not just stick to non-fiction, and leave the novel out of it? Because as a READER of literature, I just felt annoyed. Kind of like when Tolstoy just stops talking about Anna Karenina and muses on for thousands of words about what the problem is with Russian feaudalism. Not.... important, right? Anyways, there are some beautiful words in these 600+ pages, but also a lot of unnecessary ones."},{"Title":"The Sleepwalkers; a Trilogy","review":"A member of our bookclub &quot;assigned&quot; this book and warned us that it would be difficult. This book was not only difficult, but also boring, futile, and a general waste of my time. The characters were lifeless, the plot was laborious, and the subtle undertones went well below subtle to nonexistent. Hopefully I'm missing the massive psychological symbolism that so many other reviews and well know authors have mentioned, or else I wasted more time than I care to admit. I would stringently discourage anyone to stay away from this book. However, I do hope someone can help me find some sort of redeeming quality in this book."},{"Title":"Serenity--Basket Case (Serenity (Barbour))","review":"Serenity is a rebellious high-schooler who somehow always finds herself in the midst of some kind of trouble.

I read through the first one & greatly appreciated the ideas & morals presented. We gave step-daughter the first book in this series for Christmas, & she loves it! She bought the third book at Borders, but couldn't find the second one. (She's getting that for her birthday.)The one (possible) drawback is that these books read from front to back, like most western books, instead of back to front, like many Japanime books. I mention it simply b/c step-daughter drew it to my attention.If you've got a teen or pre-teen who loves manga but would prefer they actual read something of substance, this is the series for which you've been waiting. All the flashy artwork with none of the occultic overtones or mystical storylines. Most teens can relate to the stories presented, especially if they attend public school. Step-daughter is eagerly awaiting more releases."},{"Title":"Serenity--Basket Case (Serenity (Barbour))","review":"Billed as \\"inspirational manga\\", the Serenity series from Realbuzz Studios is a full-color comic book series focusing on slice-of-life teenage drama. The stories revolve around the interaction between the title character (a newly transferred high school student with a troubled past) and the school's Christian club (whose members have themselves struggled through a wide range of temptations and who have \\"adopted\\" Serenity as one of their own). Each volume contains two or more interlocking short stories that tell the ongoing tale of Serenity's journey of faith.Story summary of volume 3: \\"Serenity: Basket Case\\"* Someone downloads a \\"purity test\\" from the internet and it quickly passes through the school grapevine. Gossip, guilt, and parental guidance ensure.* Serenity resents being forced to \\"babysit\\" an egg for a class project, but she stumbles upon even greater responsibility when she discovers an abandoned newborn in a dumpster.(Possible parental advisory: \\"Serenity\\" is set amid the pressures of a modern high school, and as such the teenage characters are confronted with realistic issues that range from boredom and jealousy to drug addiction and sexuality.

I OWN 10 of these books and LOVE THEM! You don't have to be into Japanese art or Manga or even know what those terms are...I work with youth full time and THIS is the way that many of them act. The questions presented are ones that they have, the situations are realistic and in REAL LIFE, these are the kind of characters I have in my youth group. They are relational for kids in the teenage and tweenage years, but are not written for Suzie Sunday School as their crowd. They are aimed at presenting the Gospel to kids who would normally not even be interested. Serenity accepts Christ in Book SIX but it is important to see what it took to get her there.BOTTOM LINE: This series IS racey, to reach the \\"right crowd\\" but not inappropriately so. The topics are edgy, but not anything that teens and tweens aren't experiencing in your OWN living rooms and schools. They are also inexpensive and entertaining, but not for us, 20's to 30's.

First, Roosevelt explores the actions of the Stuart kings and how those actions became more and more tyrannical and incompetent. Next, Roosevelt examines the Long Parliament and how Charles I's despotism forced the Members of Parliament to revolt. Roosevelt then studies how Cromwell came to the decision to have Charles executed after the second Civil War. Finally, the author looks at Cromwell's performance as a soldier and leader in the Scotch and Irish campaigns, particularly how he dealt with religious differences in his army. Roosevelt clearly supports Cromwell's actions up to the point of the Commonwealth. But Roosevelt makes his reservations with Cromwell's actions as Lord Protector clear: while Cromwell had good intentions, his manner of enforcing them and his unwillingness to compromise in politics were the causes behind the failure of greater religious, political, and social freedom in England.Roosevelt writes with a passion and wit unseen in many current histories. As a non-professional historian, he is unrestrained by notions of objectivity, and he heaps scorn and insults upon the Stuart kings in a comical manner. Roosevelt obviously admires Cromwell, finding an excuse for almost all of Cromwell's actions, with the exception of Cromwell's actions as Lord Protector. That Roosevelt writes for an American audience is shown by his frequent mention of the American Revolution and Civil War as examples and comparisons. He contrasts Cromwell with Washington several times, although Cromwell did not quite match the character and abilities of Washington. Roosevelt's style is sometimes complicated, but his enthusiasm for his subject and his frequent forays into name-calling make for a highly entertaining biography. There are no citations of any kind, but there is an extremely detailed index."},{"Title":"Oliver Cromwell","review":"Such a turbulent time in English history.TR did a remarkable job of reporting and evaluating for posterity the events and effects of this turbulent time.

I did miss the illustrations by reading this book on kindle."},{"Title":"Oliver Cromwell","review":"What a wonderful surprise this book that I happened upon was! Roosevelt takes us into seventeenth century England. He describes the state of political and religious affairs there and constantly makes things understandable by making comparisons to American history. He views Cromwell from every aspect and what he has to contend with. Struggles around early democratic thinking and religious liberty, what to do with a weak duplicitous King, how to deal with extremists, the vast majority wishing liberty for their own religion only. He describes his great generalship as well as his massive cruelty especially in Ireland. He looks at a people conditioned to obeying an absolute monarchy for centuries and in the end he becomes Lord Protector with absolute powers but he also lays the foundation for a democratic parliament and for real religious liberty which was brought to fruition much later."},{"Title":"Life of General Nathan Bedford Forrest,","review":"Wyeth's biography of Forrest stands as one of the best written about him. It is a 'must read' for any serious student of the civil war as it was fought in the west (Tennessee, Alabama, Mississippi and Kentucky). While other biographies have been written (such as, &quot;Bedford Forrest and His Critter Company&quot;, by Ansrew Nelson Lytle and &quot;First with the Most Forrest&quot; by Robert Selph Henry), they don't have the breadth that Wyeth's book has. Of course, the only biography actually reviewed and approved by General Forrest was Jordan and Pryor's &quot;The Campaigns of Lieut. Gen.

It is subject- rather than author organized, which makes it easier to browse by topic, in my mind, making it more useful for someone seeking quotations for writing or speaking.As a quotation book collector (see my other reviews) owning over 400 quote books, I'd rate this one in the top five percent. When I discovered my 1942 copy in a used bookstore and realized what a treasure trove of new material it contains (lots!-- over 1300 pages of smaller type. I estimate it contains at least 30,000 quotations,) it really made my day. There are only so many really great books which are delicious treats. So many are re-packagings of older ones. This book contains just a super batch of idea nuggets, collected by one of the brightest journalistic minds of the time.Mencken basically took his quote collection and made it into a book which would supplement the popular books of the time-- Bartlett's, Hoyt and Stevenson. His stated goals were to date all the quotes and proverbs, leave out the fluff (platitudes), and add a lot more topics.He comments, &quot; Some immemorial imbecilities have been added deliberately , on the ground that it is just as interesting to note how foolish men have been as to note how wise they have been.&quot;Now maybe it's just my read of him, but Mencken's choices reflect his acerbic wit.I've been working too long on putting my own quotation book together, subject by subject (600+ done so far) and this is one book I always check out for both the unusual and unique thought and the most familiar ones, which he seems to nail very often. As a matter of fact, it is remarkable how often he does this.It's been around along time, and so, unless it has been seriously updated, which I doubt, it is mostly good for more classic quotes. But it is excellent, and always a fun browse.Since it's about the same price as the Burton Stevenson Home Book of Quotations, also called the MacMillan book of Maxims, Proverbs...... or something like that, it's not an easy choice between the two. This book spares you from some pretty sappy, bland and uninspiring stuff you'll find in the massive Stevenson book. But the Stevenson book is soooo much bigger that I'd probably pick it first, over just about any other quotation book. This book is certainly among the top ten though, for someone who wants a comprehensive quotation book library.The day after the W inauguration, here's a line, from this book from Jefferson, That government is the strongest of which every man feels himself a part.&quot; Thomas Jefferson: Letter to H.D.

It contains some good quotes but they are buried in a mass of really commonplace utterances."},{"Title":"Composing a Civic Life: A Rhetoric and Readings for Inquiry and Action (2nd Edition)","review":"There is a fascinating chapter worth perusing for the university reader. It talks about cheating in American universities. Apparently, many lecturers see or suspect this in papers turned in by their students. But there is little reward in the typical college apparatus for a lecturer putting in much effort into proving that a paper was bogus.One positive countermeasure is discussed. The anti-plagiarism search engine websites, that have arisen to combat the scourge of paid-for essays. But the chapter points out serious flaws in these websites' techniques. The matching of an essay against a website's databases is often brittle. An all or nothing comparison that can be easily defeated by some trivial, minimal rewriting of a few sentences.Also, the websites are unlikely to have in their databases high quality [and high cost] essays. Or custom essays that are sold to only one buyer.Another response has been a trend towards closed book, proctored exams. As opposed to weekly take home essay assignments. One problem is that exams can be far more stressful to some students, compared to writing essays. And that each type of assessment tests different abilities.The above is scarcely peculiar to American universities. A global problem. But the chapter also describes a variant probably confined mostly to the US. Where some students are on athletic scholarships, but could be weak academically. The chapter cites notorious incidents where tutors working for a university would write papers for those athletes, who then turned these in as their own."},{"Title":"Cacti, (A Golden nature guide)","review":"Cacti is one of many volumes in the lavishly illustrated Golden Guide series. This book is a survey of the cactus family and includes information on over 200 species. When European explorers brought these unusual plants from the New World to the Old World botanists were unsure how to classify them. Their spines suggested they were somehow like thistles; when Linnaeus founded the present system of plant classification in 1753, he grouped them under the name cactus, from the ancient Greek word kaktos, meaning thistle. Dimensions, flower color, and ranges are provided for each species. In some cases we learn about the uses of cacti; some uses include food, furniture, boxes, picture frames, roofing, and fencing. Cholla, organ-pipe, and saguaro are among the featured species. The book also describes the adaptations for survival cacti have made as well as the classification system of these unique plants. In sum, Cacti is a concise yet informative book portraying some of the most fascinating members of the plant kingdom."},{"Title":"Space-time structure","review":"I've turned to this thin book far too many times to count. It was also a life-saver when I was learning General Relativity because of its clear and careful exposition. Schrodinger was doing this back when nobody was quite sure what the deal was with, e.g., index notation, and he took pains to lay out the benefits -- but also the limits -- of that system. See, for example, his discussion of the derivative operator, something that is almost always glossed over.I'm in the middle of my dissertation now, and every now and then I hit on a subtlety in GR that my advisor has missed but I caught from reading this book.Don't get thinking that this is Schrodinger's book on the unified field. It is more like the lecture notes of a very intelligent man figuring out what on Earth this truly new version of gravity is all about.In the end of course this book is too slim to live on its own as a GR text. You will need to carry around a bigger, more comprehensive tome to get through your studies.

It seems to be a very good book, but the section introducing tensors was not as lucid as it could be. If you already know tensors or have a good book like Shaum's Outline of Tensor Calculus, then it can be a very useful introduction to the affine viewpoint of relativity that Schrodinger promotes.

The main accomplishment was in constructing such a theory from just the connection, with metric derived as a consequence, using no ad hoc assumptions. I extended this work in my 1977 Master's thesis. While this kind of theory has gone out of style, it is still an exciting pursuit and Schroedinger's writing is clear and compelling."},{"Title":"Space-time structure","review":"I'm twelve right about now, and I have my own theory of time.Time (the fourth dimension) is arranged on separate lines, like thefirst dimension. The fifth dimension is arranged in time planes and the sixth in time cubes. The fourth dimension, however, is simpler than those. Imagine infinite lines in space, each stacked one on another. These we will call \\"time lines\\". From these infinite lines spread more infinite lines. We'll call these \\"destiny lines\\". Then there are more and more destiny lines branching from those destiny lines, and so on and so forth. They get very complicated. Time lines are the original paths of time. Destiny lines are the lines of time determined by what happens along the time lines. Sounds confusing? Well, anything you do creates a new destiny line. As I write this, I am creating a new destiny line. The future may be different if I didn't write this at all. Time planes are the collection of one timeline and all destiny lines spreading from it.

Some black parents and students have charged that the book is humiliating and demeaning to African-Americans and therefore is unfit to be taught in school. If there has been a racist backlash in the classroom, I think it is the fault of the readers rather than the book.&quot;Huckleberry Finn&quot; is set in Missouri in the 1830's and it is true to its time. The narrator is a 13 year old, semi-literate boy who refers to blacks by the N-word because he has never heard them called anything else. He's been brought up to see blacks as slaves, as property, as something less than human. He gets to know Jim on their flight to freedom (Jim escaping slavery and Huck escaping his drunken, abusive father), and is transformed. Huck realizes that Jim is just as human as he is, a loving father who misses his children, a warm, sensitive, generous, compassionate individual. Huck's epiphany arrives when he has to make a decision whether or not to rescue Jim when he is captured and held for return to slavery. In the culture he was born into, stealing a slave is the lowest of crimes and the perpetrator is condemned to eternal damnation. By his decision to risk hell to save Jim, he saves his own soul. Huck has risen above his upbringing to see Jim as a friend, a man, and a fellow human being.Another charge of racism is based on Twain's supposed stereotyping of Jim. As portrayed by Twain, Jim is hardly the ignorant, shuffling Uncle Tom that was so prevalent in &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; (a book that abundantly deserves the charge of racism). Jim may be uneducated, but he is nobody's fool; and his dignity and nobility in the face of adversity is evident throughout the book.So -- is &quot;Huckleberry Finn&quot; a racist book? No. It's of its time and for its time and ours as well, portraying a black man with sensitivity, dignity, and sympathy. If shallow, ignorant readers see Jim as a caricature and an object of derision, that's their problem. Hopefully they may mature enough in their lifetime to appreciate this book as one of the greatest classics of American literature.And for those who might be wondering -- this reviewer is black."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"Back during my school days this was still not a book that was considered to be politically incorrect and so I was supposed to read it. As was far too often the case, I got by on little more than watching the movie version and never bothered to read this masterpiece. A few months ago I picked up a copy to put in my library for my grandson to use when he got old enough to go to school. Unfortunately this has been classified as a children's book and so I had little intention of reading it when I bought it.After discussing a book about President Grant and Mark Twain with a friend I decided that I should read this book and I soon found out just how much of an adventure I had been missing. Twain's well deserved reputation as a storyteller is on clear display in this book from cover to cover. The reader is drawn into the lives of the characters to the point of being really disturbed when something bad happens to them. Sure, they steal and they lie but you will love them in spite of everything.The story basically follows the adventures of young Huckleberry Finn and a runaway slave named Jim. Finn is trying to escape has father and the efforts of the townspeople to civilize him while Jim is trying to escape slavery. More to the point, Jim is trying to escape being sold down the river, which was always a worry for slaves in the upper south.There is a strong moral point to this book as Huck slowly learns to love Jim as a friend and not think of his skin color. Early on Huck is worried about helping a runaway slave and isn't sure what to do. Having been raised in Missouri, Huck has been taught that helping a slave run away is one of the worst sins imaginable and that African-Americans are pretty much worthless except as slaves. It takes a while for the truth to come to Huck but he finds that he is determined to help his friend get his freedom, no matter what. Huck ends up risking his own life to do just that.This book is a pure joy to read and I suggest you read it without looking for a political agenda. Just let the story flow and enjoy each word. The dialects used may slow you down a bit at first but they add so much to the flow of the book that they are quite indispensable. This is a wonderful story, full of youthful innocence and backwoods charm. Just one little warning though, once you start reading you won't be able to put this book down."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"Finally, a reading of a classic that is worth the money.This story's narration covers a total of 9 Cds, and each disc has about 97 tracks (each track is only about 30 to 45 seconds). The good aspect of this is that it is quite easy to find your spot and, then pick up where you left off, if you happen to stop reading in the middle of a chapter. The negative aspect of short tracks is that it is difficult to skip around to particular chapters without \\"guessing\\" where a chapter might end (because there is no insert to tell which chapters are contained in each disc).Overall, Dick Hill does a superb job of reading in this unabridged version of The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. Hill's voice personifies Huck's narrative, and he keeps the Southern flavor of Twain's novel intact. What makes this reading particularly great is that Hill has a great ability to not only take on Huck, but other characters as well. Hill changes his voice for other characters such as Tom Sawyer, Jim, the Duke and the king, Pap and others. For this reason, this CD is a great tool for the reluctant readers in classes, and serves as a great supplement for the study of this novel.I have found that buying audios to classic to be a gamble because you never really know what you are getting, but this is one of the best I've gotten."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"Not only is The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn a brilliant and funny story of an adolescent boy, it is the story of an adolescent nation: the United States circa 1885. It raises broad, moral questions whose answers still elude us today, as it addresses the question of slavery in terms that are deeply personal, moral, political, social and economic.Through Huck and the fugitive slave Jim, Twain looks at important issues of marginality, not just for people of color, but for people of all sorts who live outside of social norms, either by accident of race and class, by virtue of fate, or by a choice they have made. Some are outlaws and con men. Others are honest souls whose luck just ran out. Still others are merely independent-minded people who refuse to bend to stereotypes of race, class and gender. All share circumstances that put them outside of the societal norm and onto the road less traveled.The first great novel that was written in the vernacular, this novel has been criticized for its use of slang and pejoratives, especially for its liberal use of \\"the n word.\\" For me, it's important to remember that Twain was reflecting the language of the times and of the social class that Huck came from, as it is he who narrates the story. While I understand the objections, in the end, for me, they do not hold up if the choice is between reading or not reading this great American classic.I adored this book at age 7 and again at age 19 when I read it in college. And I continue to adore it as an adult, for each time I read Huck Finn something different and important is revealed to me. I can't recommend this book highly enough and think that there is no better time to (re)read it than on the occasion of the 125th anniversary of its publication."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"When I first read this book, I was so taken with it, that I read from chapter 18 through the end of the book in one night. I was up until 3:30 in the morning, reading ahead of my 11th grade assignment, and loving every minute along the way. later in college, when I studied the book more, closer, and with a more educated eye (whatever that means) my love for the book increased. Now, as a teacher myself, I look forward to having my students read this book and discussing it in class.But now as for the title of my review:I can't help feeling bad for people who think that this is not a good novel because &quot;we don't talk like that anymore.&quot; Are we to abandon books that are no longer contemporary to ourselves? I also take issue with people who claim that this book is a racist tirade based upon the use of the word &quot;nigger,&quot; or because the escape route Jim took was down the Mississippi instead of up river. While currently offensive, Mark Twain used the term as a literary fact that most, if not all young boys of the south spoke in such a manner. Once more, Jim explained why he was going South before he headed north. the simple fact is that if you are going to criticize a book, then you should read it. mark Twain said as much in his essay, &quot;Fenimore Cooper's Literary Offenses.&quot;From reading a number of the reviews of this book, I have come to the opinion that while many read the book, more than a few are refusing to give Twain credit for subtext and the use of allegory. One reviewer down the line says that the book is racist because Twain makes a young boy to be twice as smart as Jim. Upon closer reading, Twain is showing what Huck feels to be true. Huck only thinks that he is smarter. The reader should pick up on the fact that Twain writes Jim as an intuitive father figure for Huck, one who teaches a true morality as opposed to the morality of the South.Simply put, you get what you put in to the reading of this book. If you think is is going to be a boring read because you &quot;have to&quot; read it for a summer reading list or school assignment, then that's what it will be. If you think it will be a difficult read because you don't want to try and read in dialects other than your own, it will be a hard read. If you are looking to justify the book as racist because of a single word that presentism doesn't excuse, then have at it. This book can be all of those things. However, this book also has the potential to enlighten the reader, give something wonderful to the reader, and teach about the human condition."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"It's shameful and pathetic that any publisher would presume to censor Mark Twain by sanitizing Huckleberry Finn as Barron's has done. I urge anyone who loves literature to boycott this travesty of an edition."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"It amuses me no end to see so many irate reviews, obviously written by spoiled schoolkids resenting their stoopid 'ol teacher making them read this stoopid 'ol book by some stoopid 'ol dead guy.There's rich material there for a cynic like Twain, or even more for one the likes of Ambrose Bierce or H. L. Mencken. Tiny, immature, ill formed minds incapable of grasping a truth deeper than Nintendo or Playstation lash out in outrage at a genius who holds up a mirror to expose their ignorance.The fact is, this is THE American experience of the 19th century, a microcosm of the defining characteristic of our country's beginning and of our national shame and curse. How did a nation, conceived in liberty, holding self evident so many truths about Man's rights, institutionalize the degredation of Black Americans, the utter denial of their very humanity? How could the noble idealistic American eagle ever swallow such a poisonous pill?Huck's bitter determination to &quot;go to hell&quot; in order to save his friend Jim is to me the most moving and courageous moment in all literature. Huck &quot;knows&quot; that Jim is not really human, that he is mere property, that he has no rights and deserves no consideration, and that Huck's social duty is to return the slave owner's lost property. Yet he knows even more deeply that Jim is his friend, mentor, companion, and in not saving him he will lose his own soul, regardless of what his society holds to be true. Thus Huck makes himself an outcast and outlaw in civilized society, and thus he prefigures the cataclysm of the Civil War, in which this vile contradiction nearly destroyed our nation. All the blood spilled during that war, however, has not expunged our Original Sin, and we have been paying for it ever since, and perhaps always shall.So try to expand your mind, at least accept the concept that the past is not a Real World episode in period costume, that people of another time did think and talk and act differently, that what &quot;everybody knows&quot; today will surely be as ludicrous a century hence as slavery may seem to us now. Reflect, also, on the courage of those who recognized evil ahead of their time and stood up to it, even though in this case such a hero is a fictionalized semi-literate boy."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"Look Inside for Collector's Library Adventures of Huckleberry Finn promised an illustrated book. We have a case of a misleading Look Inside: in reality no illustrations; very small format; awful choice of typeface. My impression that Look Inside was made from a different edition.Another thing: it's a little strange when Amazon customers review Mark Twain. Mark Twain does not need it. What is needed are reviews of different editions (quality, illustrations, scholarly or nor, paper, cover and typeface. So one star is, of course not for Huck Finn (100 stars for that boy), but for the awful edition. and misleading Look Inside.Finally, let me repeat it again: the more I read reviews on Huck Finn, the more I am convinced, they have to be separated by editions. If I am looking for a scholarly edition with illustration and a decent cover and typeface, how, in a world, can it be helpful, if someone writes: \\"Mark Twain is not for me.\\" Serious readers will seek opinions on classics from other sources, for example, from Hemingway who said, that the whole American literature had come out of Huck Finn. OK, if Amazon thinks that \\"Mark Twain is not for me\\" phrase is protected by First Amendment, and any football and beer lover has a right to put it here as an opinion, I agree. In this case, still, I think these ones have to be separated from opinions of serious book readers and collectors who are interested in differences of certain editions of classics."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"Whole pieces of the text are missing from the free Kindle edition (this one:Adventures of Huckleberry Finn). So far I've noticed that Hamlet's soliloquy and the end of chapter 23 are missing."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"This review isn't to give a review of one of the most studied works of the English language, but rather to detail what makes this edition special and worthy of purchase.At the most superficial level Huck is the sequel to The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, which had introduced us to these two icons of the printed word. After Tom Sawyer was a big hit the publisher, perhaps understandably, wanted not only a sequel, but one which logically followed Tom Sawyer. They specifically desired for the two works to sit comfortably on a shelf together. Perhaps there was a time when Mark Twain desired the same thing - more of the same crowd pleasing story telling. But I think that perhaps from the beginning he recognized that he now had the audience that he wanted for his masterpiece, so he began writing it.Even in the form which was familiar for 100 years Huckleberry Finn was widely hailed as the centerpiece of American Literature. THIS edition reveals that the masterpiece as originally conceived was even more masterly.Clemens wrote the original manuscript and submitted it to the publisher. I don't know what they thought of the book as it was, but one thing was clear: it was a good deal longer than Tom Sawyer and sitting side by side with Tom Sawyer the two books looked less like a \\"pair\\".So.... the editorial pruning process began and enough was removed from the originally conceived Huckleberry Finn to create both the originally published versions of Huck as well as \\"Life on the Mississippi\\".Now we finally get to see the \\"complete Huck\\". The missing text flows along with the \\"original Huck\\" as mightily as the Mississippi that Huck and Jim ride along in the book of our dreams.As if that weren't enough, we also are treated to original illustrations and facsimile reproductions of several of Twain's original text. I found these pages among the most enlightening of all. Almost as if he knew his handwritten pages would be looked at by posterity, Twain used a unique revision technique. Rather than erasing a word or passage he wishes to replace, he would instead line through the words in a single line, leaving the replaced word legible along with the words which would replace the revised word. By examining these hand-written lines we can see how meticulous Twain was in his word selection. In several of the passages he made slight corrections which were plainly intended to make the runaway slave, Jim, as noble as possible. It has long been a curiosity to me that this book, frequently criticized as \\"racist\\", has as it's two central characters a runaway slave and the \\"poor white trash\\" boy who decides to help him. At one point Huck is memorably torn between what the Southern Society he has been raised in says is right and what gnaws at his conscience. It is obviously an unqualified truth to Huck that Jim is uneducated and so poor that he doesn't even own himself, yet Jim possesses more humanity than any of the \\"civilized\\" southerners Huck meets. Seeing Clemens' own scrawl lets us see how diligently Clemens worked to make that distinction clear - that Jim is easily the most noble adult in the book.I agree with Mr. Hemingway - Huckleberry Finn IS America's greatest novel. Thanks to rediscovering Twain's original text (and an entertaining sequence of events which is detailed in the introduction to this edition) we finally get to read America's greatest Novel the way that the author originally intended.I cannot recommend this highly enough."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"This is one of my very favorite American classics. Billed as the sequel toThe Adventures of Tom Sawyer, this book at first appears to be another innocent and light-hearted children's book. Around a fourth of the way through it, however, you start to realize that you're reading a mature and very serious social commentary that would have been especially relevant at the time of its publication. Exploring themes of slavery, poverty, ignorance, and religion, THE ADVENTURES OF HUCKLEBERRY FINN is certainly no children's book (though it would be entertaining to a child).The entire story is told through the honest and innocent eyes of Huckleberry Finn, and Twain accomplished an incredible feat in telling such a complicated and serious story using a believable and childlike perspective. While at times a bit inconsistent, the entire book is written as though by a semi-literate tween, giving the tale authenticity and really making the story come to life. As Huck and Jim (two of the most loveable characters in any book I've ever read) make their way down the Mississippi, encountering very real dangers but keeping remarkably positive attitudes, the reader is treated to a fascinating glimpse of American Midwest circa 1850. Twain's ability to describe a scene to make it really come off the pages is in full effect here, another big reason this is commonly promoted as his best, most complete, book.The frequent use of the N-word, while obviously offensive today, reflects the apparently common parlance of the time, and wasn't such a shocker 130 years ago. It also served as a useful tool for Twain to make his primary point of the story, pointing out the unfairness, bigotry, and illogic of racism and slavery. And there is no doubt that this books' main focus is on issues of race, and that the moral of the story is decidedly anti-slavery and anti bigotry. Those that fight against this book, saying it is racist or anti-black, are sadly mistaken, being blinded by the use of the N-word and by the representation of uneducated and ignorant black characters. If the N-word has become so offensive that we can't stand its use, maybe we could justify replacing it with another word that carries the same meaning, but changing other aspects of the content of this book to more easily mesh with current-day sensibilities is just plain wrong. Re-writing the classics should be avoided.One of the most enjoyable reads you'll ever find. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"Although Twain's repeated use of the \\"N\\" word and resort to racially-tinged humor is jarring to the 21st Century reader, this is one of only a handful of books that can be called \\"The Great American Novel.\\" Apart from capturing the spirit of the times -- of 1880s as well as of the Antebellum setting of the book via the ironic way in which Twain tells his tale to his own post-civil-war readers through Huck Finn -- Twain is absolutely brilliant in spinning a great moral drama. The inner voice of Huck Finn's good nature and of the good nature he sees in others is pitted against the moral code imposed by society. Huck's conscience mirrors society's voice, and he feels great guilt about doing something as \\"low\\" as helping a runaway slave escape. I can't think of a book that makes a better case against the hypocrisy and evil done in the name of society -- as contrasted to the grace enjoyed by man in the state of nature as embodied by the adolescent hero Huck who resists being \\"civilized.\\"The best passages of the book are where Twain delights in exploring the moral dilemmas and choices faced by Huck -- his ability to rationalize theft as \\"borrowing\\" (on the basis of his father's lessons); his guilt over helping Jim; his complicity with but ultimate rebellion against the scams of the \\"Duke\\" and the \\"King\\"; and his acquiescence with the shenanigans of Tom Sawyer by reason of his own sense of inferiority.As for the humor of the book, it is true that Twain lampoons the ignorance and buffoonery of whites and blacks alike. Nobody is spared his acid tongue. But the easy jokes about the ignorance and superstitions of Jim and the other blacks in the book does leave the modern reader feeling queasy. It's not fair to dismiss Twain's book as racist. It is disappointing that Twain is so comfortable with the racial humor of his time, but, overall, his portrait of Jim and the other slaves celebrates their basic humanity. Twain was much like Lincoln in this respect. Lincoln too has left some embarassing writings opposing full citizenship for blacks and suggesting that they be boated back to Africa. But in the end, Lincoln's insistence on accepting the humanity of blacks and the principle that all men are created equal is what put the country on the path to what it is today. To dismiss the likes of Twain and Lincoln as racists just because they are the products of their times is to ignore how truly difficult -- and heroic -- it was for them to rise above their own prejudices. One should approach the past with a better sense of empathy -- as well as with the humbling sense that 125 years from now (hopefully) our own ignorance and mistakes will be dissected by our descendants.The book is also significant for being written in the vernacular -- which is masterfully done.My only criticism of the book is the final sections, when it assumes a more farcical tone with the appearance of Tom Sawyer. This detracts from the book's previously gripping portrayal of the true horror of Jim's situation and of Huck's moral conflicts. I would have preferred to have seen Huck deliver Jim to the freedom of the North before learning of the deus ex machina of Jim's manumission in the Widow's will. The book would have been better with only a limited appearance by Tom Sawyer -- or by none at all.A great book."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"This version is beautiful, with lots of original pictures in it, you can really see that the publisher did not just want to create a cheap copy of the book, this one is really a success! Very nicely done, very elegant and with love to detail!"},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"I was surprised, when reading Huck Finn somewhat reluctantly on behalf of a Ladies' Literary Club, to find it highly amusing and relevant adult fare.

Huck Finn's father is always getting drunk, locking Huck in their cabin whenever he goes out. One day Huck manages to escape and starts down the river in a canoe he found. Eventually, he meets up with Jim, a runaway slave, and they decide to go down the Mississippi River together. The book is filled with humor and adventure, like the time when Huck Finn tries to return some stolen money. In an effort not to get caught, Huck Finn hides the money in the first place he sees...a coffin! Unfortunatley, before he could retrieve the money the coffin is buried. Now, he has to find a way to unearth the money and return it to its rightful owner. All before the bandits discover what he's been up to. It's a realy good book, you should read it."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"Wow.....wow....I mean, really, this book is just amazing. Abso-f-in-lutely wonderful. It's role as the quintessential American novel is so well deserved you can't help but wonder if this is the best read you might ever have. I m currently going through all the classics of the world, and have such joys as Moby Dick, War and Peace, Robinson Crusoe, among many, many others awaiting me. However, I feel like I ve already found the love for the written word that I felt I may aquire after reading perhaps a dozen or so of the worlds finest.To the novella: He tells the tale with such heart, such character, such life that I will attest that I dont think I ve ever felt so strongly for a character as I do for Huck Finn. He is so vivid and alive and real; its absurd.Yes, it is quite racist on the surface, and during the 250 odd pages of the story you might read more racial slurs and statements than you have in your life, but in the heart there is nothing racist about this story. I ve heard it defended because thats just how it was in Twains time, and alas, that is how it was then, and the reason it is all so blatant, but there is really nothing racist about the portrayal of Jim. He is so loving and deep and pure. Surely one of the sweetest people you could ever want to meet.The charm of this story, the unending humor and delight of all the dialects and wordage, the manner of conversation and the subjects....my loves for this story are unending. Its a must read. I know you ve heard that;I know you know that. But damn it, off your ass and DO IT!Twains masterpiece, and for that matter, a masterpiece of all literature in the history of the world."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"Longer than \\"Tom Sawyer\\" and just chock full of the \\"n\\" word. But the last pages, where Huck poses as Tom Sawyer and Tom as Sid, and they hatch plans, or rather Tom does, to free Jim from the Phelps, is flat-out hilarious. I laughed out loud so many times. Tom has read far too many swashbuckling adventures for his own (and Jim's) good. Twain has amazing command of all the southern dialects, including the slave Jim's speech. Jim may be free at the end, but sadly, his wife and children are not. A wonderful story all around. How much Twain loved the Missisippi is so evident in many beautiful and haunting passages of river life. A word of advice: you do need to read \\"Tom Sawyer\\" first. \\"Huck Finn\\" is really a sequel, and many characters in the first book are referred to in the second. As The Great American Novel, I still think that nothing surpasses \\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\", but \\"Huck Finn\\" comes in at a close second."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"This Great American Novel combines escapist adventure, humor, and biting social commentary. Author Mark Twain (1835-1910) places us squarely on the raft with Huck and Jim as they float down the Mississippi River seeking separate escapes from an abusive father (Huck) and slavery (Jim). The two form a remarkable friendship despite differences in age, race, and upbringing. That bond helps them to survive unforeseen perils and unwanted companions. Huck also secretly wrestles with his Southern-bred conscience about the morality of helping a slave escape. The book's only weakness comes in the last chapters, when the common-sense Huck reluctantly agrees to a foolhardy scheme to free Jim.Censors have tried to ban this novel since it first appeared in 1885. Some disdain Huck's skepticism towards religious and middle class values; others dislike the raw use of a racial slur - ignoring the author's indictment of racism. Please. Translated into 65 languages, HUCKLEBERRY FINN invigorates with escapism, adventure, humor and humanity."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"As the many erudite scholars and their students tell us, Huckleberry Finn is representative of the sweeping influence Mark Twain has had on American literature, form and style. The Mississippi River boyhood adventure story is required reading for any 10-year old who can pull himself away from Game Cube and other modern distractions to wade into Twain's \\"life on the river.\\" Too, adult readers will gain from Twain's insight into human nature with its honesty and cruelty, ideals and reality, innocence and cynicism.I find the everlasting worth of the book to be Twain's underlying social commentary and his capturing of an era of changing values (Civil War slavery issue, in particular) in mid-19th century America. Purely as a work of literature, though, the book falls short of my (perhaps inflated or too modern?) expectations. The plot is sometimes choppy and contrived (e.g., when Tom Sawyer coincidentally reappears late in the book) and the events often too exaggerated (e.g., the many escapades of the notorious king and duke)--however superb Twain's storytelling and final wrap-up may be. Also, Twain's painstaking effort to have all characters speak in their vernacular dialects, while interesting for some adults and linguists, unfortunately poses a barrier for the younger reader, who ironically stands to benefit most from early exposure to the classic.Unlike in other well-known tales, no character in this adventure story qualifies as an all-American hero. Huck is understanding, compassionate and quite the realist, but too much of a follower to be truly a hero. Jim is a good-hearted, well-behaved \\"nigger\\" (controversial language from the text), largely a product of his lifelong enslavement, but nevertheless he seems too simple in outlook and possibly too concerned with money like many other adults we meet along the river (\\"en I tole you I ben rich wunst, en gwineter be rich ag'n\\"). Tom, while a fun-loving, determined and imaginative leader, is too concerned with sophomoric protocol and principles to embrace the broader perspective a hero should.Ultimately, by the author's design I suspect, the book leaves us with an unresolved restlessness. As Huck says at the end of the book: \\"But I reckon I got to light out for the territory ahead of the rest, because Aunt Sally she's going to adopt me and civilize me, and I can't stand it. I been there before.\\" This quintessentially American, youthful \\"spark\\" is what still breathes life into Huckleberry Finn today after more than a century in our libraries."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"This coming of age novel boldly criticizes slavery in America in the nineteenth century. Mark Twain brilliantly voices his opinions of slavery through the characters of Huckleberry Finn. Set in the south, this novel gives clear insight into the consuming racism and discrimination that raged throughout America in the 1800's. Twain masterfully fights for the abolition of slavery through his characters Huck and Jim. Huck, a white child is raised exposed to the ignorance and injustices of the south. Jim, an African American, is separated from his family and is forced to lead the life of a slave. Huck is greatly influenced by the racism of the south. Both embark on a journey as Tom runs from the violence of his home life while Jim escapes the cruelties of slavery in search of his family and freedom. Through Jim's kindness, wittiness, and patience Huck's views on slavery, African Americans and ultimately Jim change. It is the innocence of childhood that allows Huck's views on African Americans to change, allowing him to become a young man. Through their comedic adventures readers are kept turning page after page, but it is through their friendship that gives America a chance for a new beginning. Together Jim and Huck break down racial barriers proving that change is never too late. Together they discover the depth of humanity and the potential for self-growth through others. Twain effectively fights for the abolition of slavery through Huckleberry Finn.

While some think this book is one conveying racism, I do not think so. Though Twain uses the word \\"nigger\\" all too often, we must not forget the fact that the setting of the book takes place at a time where it was normal to use. I am not saying it is right, however, the word usage helps the reader get a sense of the time and place where the story occurs.Throughout the book Jim and Huck are there for each other and they are pretty much the only ones each can count on. At first Huck is reluctant to help Jim and he keeps debating what is right and what is wrong. As the book progresses, Huck learns that Jim is a person and has a heart, despite what many of the time thought about slaves. Jim continually cares for Huck, for instance, when he doesn't let Huck see the dead man, knowing it's his father. Jim also continually lets Huck know that he is his only friend, by saying \\"the only white gentleman that ever kept his promise to old Jim,\\" etc. Huck ultimately decides that he'd rather go to hell than turn Jim in.Even though there may be some questionable occurances in the book, i do not believe Huckleberry Finn is racist. Jim and Huck form a loving friendship in which Huck helps Jim until the end, despite society's discouragement."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"now, before I get flamed for what I put above, let me explain. This certainly is a good book, which a great many people have and do enjoy greatly. I'm not someone who thinks this book is racist, and I understand wholly the reason for twain's use of the n-word. that being said, and maybe it's just me because I have high expectations for everything I read, but I couldn't really get into it. I understand that huck is supposed to be uneducated and maybe a little stupid, but his entire character was completely uninteresting to me. Nothing in this book jumped out and me and grabbed my attention, making me want to read further. Hemingway said that ALL modern american literature comes from this book. Now while this book may have paved the way for such classics as \\"To kill a Mockingbird\\" among others,not to mention influenced a great many writers, I think this is a crock of crap. When I read modern fiction I don't see a whole lot coming from this book. In fact, I'm happy about this. I don't see why twain had to use this book to make political statements, because fiction and politics should have nothing to do with one another. to quote one of my favorite writers, stephen king \\"If fiction and politics ever do become interchangeable, I'm gong to kill myself because I won't know what else to do. You see, politics always change. Stories never do.\\" That being said, I have made my main points for my dissapointment in this book, and maybe I have a lot to learn about literature still, but to think that as some people do, that you can't understand modern literature without liking this book, is bull."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"I decided to read this book after my father asked me to.

If they would of hung him I think the ending would have been better. Not because I hated jim, in fact he was the best character, but because it fits better with the way twain was writing his story.

As a faithful version of THE American Classic, this telling takes jarring liberities (such as changing the ending!) and leaves loose ends (Huck posing as Tom at the aunt's home is suddenly just Huck again without explanation). As a good audio narrative, forget it: Garrison's sonorous delivery doesn't make it. Very frustrating listening while driving - every word is a moan or whisper with consonants that crack and pop, so no volume is comfortable. His character voices meld together in places, making it difficult to follow the give and take between the Duke and the King. And in one spot on the river, it sounds like Guy Noir quizzing Huck! Yuck. I'd advise: pick another version, and you'll like Huck Finn and Garrison Keillor better."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"I am enjoying reading this classic to my son.

But then maybe no books should be assigned to people who are quicker to judge than to understand. Stupid, boring, difficult...hardly.Well--of course it's difficult (like everything that's good), for some good reasons. First of all, it's an illiterate white boy from the deep South--of course he speaks dialect (which is not the same as &quot;he cain't spell&quot;). Second, it's tough subject matter Twain tackles. What would you do in this situation? The right thing, which is what you've been told to do--turn Jim in? Or should you follow your heart, as Huck finally does, thinking it'll send him straight to hell? What would Jesus do?I find this book a rollercoaster ride, one adventure after another. Like many other readers, I am disturbed by the last couple of chapters, but given how Huck is under the influence of Tom Sawyer, it's not unintelligible.However, I have a bone to pick with this particular edition, by the Oxford UP. The introduction by Emory Elliot is less than satifying. For instance, he claims Twain was highly original in making this illiterate character the narrator of his novel, when of course there was a plethora of for instance slave narratives, often told by semi-literate narrators. He goes on to state that Twain was the first American author to explore &quot;divorce, social strife, and violence&quot;--seemingly forgetting all about, for instance, &quot;Uncle Tom's Cabin,&quot; written well before &quot;Huck,&quot; where all these issues are discussed.That said, I am happy to see that this edition features as an appendix the infamous &quot;Raftmen's Passage,&quot; essential to the plot but excised by Twain (really, by his editor), and this restores the &quot;original&quot; structure of the novel, making the turn downstream, down South, acceptable. Also, the explanatory notes are quite good. Finally, this OUP edition is worth buying for the cover alone, which has a detail from a gorgeous Homer-painting."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"I can never understand why some people consider &quot;Huckleberry Finn&quot; to be a racist novel.

I had no direct contact with black people; I only knew what I heard from friends.

I believe that although the language is a little rough around the edges, and at times slightly distracting to me, this book is an amazing tale of friendship and growth. The two boys go through a tremendous amount of change and learning experiences that most people can only hope to endure in a lifetime. I think that the first time I read this I was put off by the excessive use of the \\"N\\" word and couldn't see through to how, in spite of a few 'stereotypical' images that twain paints of Jim, wise and mature he really was.

It takes the reader on an adventure they never would have thought about before. Twain does a good job of bringing the characters to life.

Ironically, Twain depicts American Society through the scope of Hucks care giver Mrs. Watson. Mrs. Watson is religious God seeking lady who illustrates lack of sympathy for the colored race.

I was also drawn to it after reading a comparison between it and Harriet Beecher Stowes &quot;Uncle Tom's Cabin&quot; in Harper's Magazine. This book definitely has its highlights, mostly the descriptive passages of the trip down the Mississippi. But in general, it does not hang together. As pointed out by another reviewer, the pretense of saving Jim doesnt hold... directly across the river was a free state, whereas downriver the states became more and more racist with worse and worse laws. There is a good reason why the underground railroad helped escaping slaves North, not South. At various times Huck betrays his &quot;friend&quot; Jim, and the ending is deplorable. Completely nonsensical, how Jim is kept locked up while the boys play jail with him. This is not man against society, but thoughtless, racist young men cruelly playing with others' lives. Huckleberry Finn himself is often held up to be the epitomy of the free American boy, escaping from the mores of a repressive society, whereas I find him to be the epitomy of a society that finds &quot;adventure&quot; in &quot;taming&quot;, &quot;saving&quot; and just generally using for its own ends every other society and creature around. I would teach this book in schools, but I am afraid that the lessons learned would differ from the laudatory ones generally assumed to be contained in this book.An interesting fact I learned from the Harper's article was that Mark Twain himself put aside this book several times, unsure of the plot, changing the ending, and was in the end not satisfied with it.For a good book on escaping slaves, complete with realistic escapes and comtemporary language, read Uncle Tom's Cabin. For adventures, read Tom Sawyer.

That's where the good stuff ends, i'm afraid. Twain's writing style makes this almost impossible to read, by including either an overabundance of detailed description or none at all, thereby making this almost like a fun puzzle, in which you try to piece the different parts together without any instruction.

They encounter many adventures and in the process of reading these adventures, we are given excellent insight on American culture during the 1800s. The choppy English can make the book a little difficult for children, but ultimately helps to better immerse you into Twain's tale.Mark Twain's original bad boy, Tom Sawyer, makes brief appearances in this book which helps establish an ongoing continuity. As well as with this book, I also highly recommend: The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.The Adventures of Tom Sawyer [ADV OF TOM SAWYER].Darien Summers, author of The Mischievous Hare, a children's book.The Mischievous Hare"},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"\\"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\\" is universally considered Mark Twain's masterpiece, surpassing \\"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer\\". Yet Tom Sawyer's story continuously outsells Huck Finn's for the simple reason that \\"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer\\" is the more enjoyable read. That does not mean that \\"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\\" isn't enjoyable, but that perhaps Twain tried too hard to impress and outdo himself that he muddled his story with unnecessary tangents.Everyone is familiar with the basic outline. Huckleberry Finn fakes his own death to run away from his abusive alcoholic father and finds Miss Watson's slave Jim has run away too. The two construct a raft and take off down the Mississippi River so that Jim can become free, an unheard of action for a white boy to take, even one as poor as Huck Finn. Along the way they face trials and high adventures, pair up with a couple of royal frauds, and find themselves in heaps of trouble when they impersonate the wrong people. Despite these setbacks, readers know that things are going to work out all right for the two main characters and that a happy ending will be had.Yet Huck's story drags on too long, especially the ridiculous plans to rescue Jim in the last several chapters; it seems as if these could have been excised to strenghten the story. Twain's humor is evident and contagious, but his adherence to local color and various dialects is demanding and downright frustrating at times. While many have claimed that \\"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\\" is a racist book, because of one certain word, it is nothing of the sort, especially when its hero is championing for the rights of a poor, misunderstood slave. In fact, that storyline would have been rather revolutionary in Twain's time. While the prose and the language may be dated and sensational for our sensitive, politically correct time, it is a unique and faithful depiction of the time in which it was written."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"Like many people growing up in the US, I read THE ADVENTURES OF HUCKLEBERRY FINN as an obligatory assignment at school. No one likes obligatory reading, and it was like water off a duck's back. Regretting that I remembered nothing of the novel, I recently re-read it, and I found it entertaining reading, and also much more for a grown-up audience than I expected. Of course the book was only started as a sequel to Twain's novel for boys THE ADVENTURES OF TOM SAWYER before being turned towards much more serious themes, such as child abuse and the conflicts in antebellum southern society. But even much of the novel's humour is intended for older readers, requiring some knowledge of European history and of Shakespeare.The book's status as one of the Great American Novels is curious when it paints so bleak a picture of America. Any signs of refined culture among these inhabitants of the Mississippi comes not even for the East Coast but from Europe. For all of Twain's love of the land--indeed, the Mississippi River is itself a character--he was clearly a cosmopolitan figure by this point. Or perhaps the praise of America is subtle, as it is a portrait of a land free of aristocracy (the characters who call themselves the \\"king\\" and \\"duke\\" are scoundrels), and the novel is written in the honest vernacular of country people.The novel cannot in any way be considered a perfect work of literature when it is an arc that soars towards quality only in the middle. The opening pages are still in the realm of children's literature, while the final section reads as a tiresome parody with far too much serendipity to be believable. For that reason I've rated it four stars."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is a novel by Mark Twain, originally published in 1884. It is the sequel to The Adventures of Tom Sawyer. Ernest Hemingway (and many others) called it the greatest American novel ever. Huck Finn picks up right where Tom Sawyer left off - Huck's abusive father appears to lay claim to Huck's fortune, so Huck fakes his own death and goes down the Mississippi River with Jim, the escaped slave.Much like Tom Sawyer, there's not a lot of plot going on here most of the time, and that's okay, because Twain's writing is extremely entertaining. Twain has a good old time mocking social conventions, and the novel is gripping almost all the way through. Hemingway was right: the end of Huck Finn is poor. After Jim is abducted and Tom Sawyer reappears, things just get silly, not to mention highly convenient (And Tom Sawyer here is just as immature as he ever was, reinforcing that no real maturation occurred in Tom Sawyer, and that that book really isn't a coming-of-age story in the truest sense).Twain has made Huck the narrator. On the whole, this works, although it gets tiresome to read Huck's dialect sometimes. Twain-as-narrator is definitely missed here. Nobody could write a clever sentence like Twain, and most of that is lost here, although occasionally Huck will turn one (and by doing so break character, but that's the price you pay).Huck Finn has been exceedingly controversial because of the extensive use of the n-word. So is the novel racist? Certainly the characters have the racism of the day ingrained in them - in that sense, it is racist. But more important to most people is whether Twain was racist; that is, whether he put his own personal racism in the book. That is harder to determine, especially since Twain has made Huck the narrator. Perhaps the fairest thing to say is that Twain was genuinely criticizing racism, but the way in which he portrayed Jim and the other characters contains some residual racism of its own.So is Huck Finn America's greatest novel? Well, maybe not. But it's definitely up there."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"I was down in the dumps I was. Wonderin' when my Huck Finn would come, and wonderin' if it would be righ' on time. But it was, I tell you, it was."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"Mark Twain's The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is a timeless classic that lives up to its prestigious name. It takes place in an array of locations along the Mississippi river around the time of 1835-45. The story is about Tom, a free-spirited boy, and his numerous adventures with a run-away slave named Jim.The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn proceeds Mark Twain's original novel, The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, but within the first page Huck acknowledges this and says reading the first book isn't that important. However, I personally recommend reading The Adventures of Tom Sawyer before this book. While it is not essential, it adds a lot to the book and gives an initial understanding Huck's character.The book starts right where The Adventures of Tom Sawyer ended: Huck is struggling to fit into his new found \\"civilized\\" life with the Widow Douglas. Huck is uncomfortably forced to learn to be proper while his fortune is held for him.It wasn't long till Huck's Pap, the village drunk, came to kidnap Huck for his fortune. After living with his abusive father for a while, Huck decides to escape. One night, Huck feigns a robbery on his Pap's cabin and then feigns his own death. Huck escapes to a nearby island and decides to live there. Soon word spreads through town about Huck's death and the town suspects Huck's father, but then suspicions transfer to a runaway slave named Jim who was living on the same island.Jim and Huck set off on a raft before people could find them. They embark on a series of adventures, including boarding the ships of robbers, murder mysteries, gunfights, family feuds, great storms, mobs, con artists, and other extravaganzas. During their voyages they also come to deal with a series of topics and realizations, such as the irony and hypocrisy of \\"civilized\\" and adult culture, slavery, racism, morality, human nature, and superstition."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is an excellent, easy read that shows the adventures of a young southern boy running away from home and learning a little about himself in the process. Huck, adopted by two widows who try to \\"civilize\\" him, does not like it and runs away with Jim, one of the widows' slave. They escape and travel up the Mississippi river to the \\"free state\\", encountering many adventures along the way. Huck realizes more and more along the way that Jim is \\"white\\" on the inside.I enjoyed this book because it shows Huck, who is being forced to be civilized by society, rebelling because he finds that society has some moral imperfections that are being forced upon him. Jim becomes a father figure to Huck throughout the adventures and is not a servant, which is what society has taught Huck. For example, when Jim doesn't let Huck see the dead man's face in the house floating down the river, it shows us that Jim really cares for Huck and takes responsibility for his protection. In turn to Jim's father-like figure to Huck, Huck takes responsibility to make sure Jim becomes a free man because Huck knows how good of a person Jim really is.This book is a must read for anybody and can teach everyone a little bit about learning who a person really is and not listening to what society has prejudged someone to be. I really enjoyed the gripping adventures Huck goes through and the revelations he has about the prejudiced ways of society."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"I was disappointed after reading this story. Of course the message is important and Mark Twain is a talented writer, no one can deny that. However I found it difficult to read this book with the dialoge and the plot wasn't really holding my attention."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is about a boy named Huck who lives in Missouri in the 1930's where and when slavery is allowed. He has been brought up around slaves and sees slavery as being an acceptable practice because he has never really seen what goes on behind the scenes and how blacks are really treated in the United State at the time. One day Huck decides to escape from the madness of his family and abusive father, fakes his own death, and runs away. Jim, a slave friend of Huck's is blamed for the murder and runs away from the chaos of the town's reaction. Jim and Huck run into each other while being on the run early on and decided to stick together and go down the river together. A part of the reason why they decide to stick together is because Huck decides he wants to free Jim. They encounter different obstacles and adventures along the way. Through their friendship they hope to make it down the river safely together and in one piece in hopes of giving Jim the freedom he deserves and Huck is just in it for the independence and the love of being on his own with no worries or people not letting him do what he wants to do. Huck and Jim also experience many things along the way down the river and run into other people who help them with their journey and other who try to stop it. They get a better picture of how slaves are actually treated in the south and both are shocked by the mistreatment. Seeing this mistreatment of slaves and talking to a few slaves about their situations pushes Huck and Jim to try even harder at making it down the river safely and freeing Jim once and for all.The main theme of this book is friendship and compassion. Through friendship and compassion Huck and Jim go on this incredible adventure together and with compassion and care for one another they look after each other and both want the best possible outcome and result for each other. Major issues in the book include seeing slaves being mistreated, death of friends, and evading capture by the people after Huck and Jim. The style of writing is certainly an interesting one and at times I got frustrated with the way the author presented the story and how Huck and Jim talk. Both are semi-illiterate and say things in a different way then one would say things now and how one would say things correctly at the time. The \`N\\" word is used constantly throughout the book but it makes sense because it was used commonly and throughout the nation by many at this time. While it's not acceptable to be used nowadays, it was more acceptable back then. The author's description of the characters and the south makes the story an excellent one. The detail and description the author provides and even how he present the dialogue makes you feel like you are right there alongside Huck and Jim on a raft sailing down the Mississippi River. I personally think that anyone would enjoy this book and it's definitely a true American classic. Twain is a genius and this story certainly proves that. The man knows how to write ad good story that will make people think and feel for the characters and situations in the book.JLind555 says this book is a controversial masterpiece and I would have to agree with them because while it is in fact controversial with the subject matter of the book it is a masterpiece because of the overall story and how everyone who reads it gets something out of it. Justin Evans claims the book is one that is not meant for everyone, but that everybody should read it. I have to agree with this point too because it certainly isn't for everybody. Some people may not be able to handle some parts of this book, but that doesn't mean they shouldn't read it because they will learn many things from this book. Tessa says this book is dragged out and boring and while it wasn't the most exciting book in the world the entire time, it wasn't boring at all. This book is full of constant action and adventure and I don't see how anybody can claim a book like this is boring. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and could see myself reading it over and over because of it's positive message and story.

Yeah sure, Huck's best friend is a runaway slave, but what are we to make of the fact that Jim is given virtually no voice in the novel? There's something unmistakably childlike (and I don't mean that positively) about Jim; he is hardly a fully-drawn adult character. Twain's views on race are defined in part by the time in which he wrote, but then isn't that true for all of us?

I'd obviously read The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, but not this sequel, narrated from Huck's point of view. Much of the book deals with a trip that Huck and Jim take down the Mississippi River. It's interesting, because they're bound for the North, but they end up going into the Deep South, the heart of slave country. Along the way, they meet with all sorts of people and encounter all sorts of mishaps.Huck narrates in his own voice, so it's very ungrammatical. But he's surprisingly smart; he learns how to read at the beginning of the book, and he has a lot more sense than Jim does in certain areas. And even though he is pretty uneducated, he's street smart (or shall we say river smart?) It's kind of funny, because a lot of times Huck misunderstands things. Like, at one point he says \\"I had learned all of my times tables to six times seven is thirty-five\\". Another time, he thinks the dauphin is the \\"dolphin\\", and that valet is \\"valley\\".At first, the life the two of them lead seems idyllic: floating down the river in a raft, doing whatever they want, frying fish for dinner. But it's not really. They encounter all sorts of strange things.I liked the section where they meet up with two con men, who claim to be an exiled duke and the exiled dauphin of France. They pull off all sorts of cons, and make a whole bunch of money. It was amusing, though obviously the men are criminals, and do a lot of shady things, and are eventually revealed to be pretty nasty people.The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn has a lot of humor in it and a great narrative voice.

This includes the controversial use of racial slurs, commonly heard as a part of the daily conversation of the time. This novel is also a window into a slice of American frontier living which no longer exists, and had mostly disappeared when Adventures of Huckleberry Finn was first published in 1885.Huck and Jim's adventures are the most engaging at the beginning and end of the novel. I feel the middle loses focus somewhat as Huck Finn becomes more of a secondary player as he crosses paths in the lives of other characters.If you find the dialogued difficult to read, then I recommend listening to a good audiobook version which will capture the exact flavor of how the speech is supposed to sound."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"As one of the most discussed books in American Literature - and with over 600 reviews on Amazon alone - there isn't much that I could probably add about the virtues (and sporadic vices) of Mark Twain's Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. All I can discuss is my own experience with the book.I'd read this book before when I was in high school, when I gave it the \\"high school\\" sort of read: giving it just enough of a superficial read to get by on whatever book report or test was required. Now, years later, I was reading it not because I had to, but because I wanted to. As a follow-up to The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, I read the earlier book first.This is a very good book. Coming from an era when much literature is too stuffy and serious for many readers (especially younger readers who can be put off by such works), Huckleberry Finn and Twain's other books are accessible and fun. But is it literature, in the more high-brow sense of the word? Yes. It is very well-written and portrays the antebellum South in both its charm and its savagery. Some scenes are funny, but others are heart-wrenching.He may not have been the first, but Twain's use of dialect in this book was still rather pioneering. This leads to controversy, particularly in the use of a certain racial term, but to ignore or ban this book because of this term is to turn a blind eye to the realities of the period. Twain uses the term not because he is a racist, but to make his book more authentic.In short, this is a great book, worth the reputation it has garnered over the years as a classic."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"While the content of this book has become controversial over the years and it is no longer popular in schools, it remains a personal treasure.I encountered this book many years ago when dealing with my issues as an Adult Child of an Alcoholic. It was pointed out as a book that we might understand and deal with, and even more as one that we could learn from.Any child who has spent time with an alcoholic parent will relate to Huck's decision to go back to his father, his fear of his father, and his final decision to symbolically kill himself so that he could be free of the widow and his father.As you watch the actions of Huck, and as you read his thoughts and feelings, you can deeply connect with your own. His decision not to challenge anyone, his constant blaming himself when things go wrong, and even his subservience to Tom Sawyer when he finally shows up, all speak of a child who has not sorted out what is his fault and what is the fault of someone else.Even though it is written in language that is no longer acceptable, and even though it portrays Jim at times as less than he should be portrayed, it is still a very good case study of its time."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"A classic of American literature.

He meets up with a runaway slave named Jim and they travel down the Mississippi river on a raft. Along the way, they stop at numerous towns and get into difficult situations but always end up alright in the end.I liked this book because it was never dull and always had something new to keep me interested. There were so many different stories within the book that I was never bored. I didn't like how whenever an uneducated person would speak in the story, the words would be written as they were supposed to speak them. This made the text difficult to read and I think Mark Twain could have used this method less if not at all.One major message in this book was loyalty. The dedication Huckleberry and Jim had for each other was a huge part of the story. Early in the book Huck has problems with the \\"immorality\\" of stealing a slave form a poor old widow . However, as time passes Huckleberry says that he would rather go to hell than return Jim to slavery. They never left each other even though there were many times when it would have been easy to do so. When Jim was captured, Huck stayed in the town, lying about his identity until he could find a way to free Jim once more. Jim gave up his own freedom at one point to help Huck. They really cared for each other in this book.People should read this book because it was entertaining and fun. It was a really cute story I would definitely recommend it. It gives perspective on what life was like in the south during this time as well. It had historical facts and displayed the attitudes of the people who lived there.If someone liked this book, they might also like Tom Sawyer or any other book Mark Twain wrote.

Huck escapes from his fathers iron grip into the woods where he is faced with the difficult choice of befriending a slave or turning him in. The two traveling mates go down the river and work together to survive and they become extremely close. The relationship that grows throught the novel between Huck and Jim stands out in my mind. I like the part where Huck realises how much Jim means tohim and even if it means he may go to jail he will do it to save Jim. This reminds me of ignorance and how people teach their kids ignorance, but that child can still rise above and make better judgments on their own. I think that the moral is important. The fact that a child can realise and judge right from wrong better than their parents with their pure mind shows that ignorance can be stopped and racial equality can be spread. I did not like the part where \\"the king\\" sells Jim so that he can have money for alcohol. The author's message is that racism is cruel and unjust and everyone deserves a clean slate to be judged on personal qualities and actions not skin tone.

The price is perfect and the product is fantastic.As for the book, I find the novel to be extremely well written, but also a little dated. Twain is most definitely hilarious, and his characterization is top notch. His control of local dialect, and his ability to portray this effectively on the page, is without any peers. Huck's examination of his surroundings and his own thoughts on everything that happens to him is interesting and heartwarming. However, I feel that a lot of the satire is no longer as powerful as it was when the novel was written. Satire works best when the general population is \\"in the moment\\" of whatever the subject matter may be. Huck's struggle to follow his heart, while his understanding of morality in his pre-Civil War society tells him it would be immoral, is a little harder to relate to in this day and age.

Those who made said decisions clearly strained at a gnat and choked on twelve camels.A favorite quote of mine comes from dear Huck:\\"And got to thinking over our trip down the river; and I see Jim before me, all the time, in the day, and in the night-time, sometimes moonlight, sometimes storms, and we a floating along, talking, and singing, and laughing. But somehow I couldn't seem to strike no places to harden me against him, but only the other kind. I'd see him standing my watch on top of hisn, stead of calling me -- so I could go on sleeping; and see him how glad he was when I come back out of the fog; and when I come to him again in the swamp, up there where the feud was; and such-like times; and would always call me honey, and pet me, and do everything he could think of for me, and how good he always was; and at last I struck the time I saved him by telling the men we had small-pox aboard, and he was so grateful, and said I was the best friend old Jim ever had in the world, and the only one he's got now; and then I happened to look around, and see that paper.It was a close place. I took [the letter:] up, and held it in my hand. I was a trembling, because I'd got to decide, forever, betwixt two things, and I knowed it. I studied a minute, sort of holding my breath, and then says to my self:'All right, then, I'll go to hell' -- and tore it up.It was awful thoughts and awful words, but they was said. And I let them stay said; and never thought no more about reforming.\\""},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"I completely agree with some of the reviewers postings about the fact that this book has been banned by some schools in the past and banned from communities in general, yes it can be racist but it is literary genius on Mark Twain's part by taking this touchy subject of racism and running with it. This is a story about a troubled boy who gets into all sorts of adventures, even with those of different races. Put aside race and open this book and read between the lines on what Mark Twain was actually trying to achieve. Huckleberry Finn has become a literary hero along with his friends in the story, and it is a well known book that should be read!"},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"I agree with previous comments that this novel is both amazing and controversial. But, I dare say we have to give Twain credit for the time period he was writing in and just what things were like back then. Essentially, he was making a political statement by writing this book. Whether we agree with him or not, we have to agree this novel is a piece of art. The way he uses literary style such as dialect and tone is just amazing. He also gives us a far deeper understanding and grasp of African American culture at this time, furthermore allowing us to appreciate what they endured. Twain brilliantly wrote about a boy who saw the world through non-racial eyes, he was not partial to whites or blacks, he associated with everyone. This concept is one I believe everyone should value because it is still something our society struggles with today. Twain had a grasp on what it means to love your neighbor, no matter what color they are. This book is amazing and brilliantly written, full of values that should be passed on for a long time. Although Twain is long gone, his essence and understanding of how the world should be is still very much alive."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"In this follow up to his classic about Tom Sawyer, Mark Twain focuses on Huckleberry Finn. The book has only the loosest of plots. The beginning follows Huck as he tries to adjust to being \\"civilized\\" and then tricks his abusive pappy into think he's dead.The book really gets rolling when Huck and runaway slave Jim take to the raft down the Mississippi River. Even then, it's episodic in nature as they get caught up in a feud and harbor two conmen, the King and the Duke. In the final part of the novel, Tom Sawyer makes a reappearance and helps Huck free Jim, who is being held as a runaway slave.Honestly, that last \\"episode\\" is my favorite in the book. It's so funny watching Tom make things ten times as complicated as needed since he wants to make this a grand adventure. I love it.This book has always captured my imagination more than the first with these characters, probably because I love the idea of rafting down the Mississippi. It's a classic adventure that appeals to the boy in me. I freely admit the episodic nature of the plot makes for an uneven read.Also problematic is the dialect writing. Huck narrates this book first person, and his schooling isn't the best, so the grammar reflects that. It's nothing compared to the poor grammar and written accents of some of the other characters, most noticeably Jim. There are times it's almost impossible to understand what is being \\"said.\\"This book often gets challenged and even banned because Twain uses the \\"N\\" word to talk about Jim and the other slaves. Considering when the book was set (before the Civil War) and written (1870's), that was the \\"correct\\" term to use. I challenge you to read beyond that because what you'll find is that Twain was trying to challenge the views of his day. Jim is the best character, and Huck's growth as a character comes from recognizing Jim as a fellow human being.This is still a fun read that holds a place as a classic of American literature. It's not often you find that combination."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"I'm sure you all remember from your youthful days of yore (always wanted to say that) the colorful story of Mark Twain's, Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. I thought I remembered it, albeit I was a bit rusty on the story. My current memories mostly brought on by the clips in Easy A where Olive discusses how it's not truly relevant to our time period because she can't remember any white guy running off with some \\"huge honking black guy\\". However, at the end of said movie, Olive apologizes to our dearest Mark Twain because that is precisely what happens which is where I laughed hysterically.Now, although this really has nothing to do with my review, I still found it funny. However, to get back on topic, I was asked to review this audiobook in exchange for my honest review, so here is what I've got.I loved it. I'm not much of an audiobook fan because I feel that it renders the speaking narrator as the permanent voice in my head for the written narrator of the book. This becomes annoying because much of the time I find audiobook narrators to definitely NOT fit the character they are portraying. My first introduction to audiobookism would be my mother playing Twilight in the car as we drove to Las Vegas to see my sister. I must say, that I found the narrator chosen for that book horribly dull and bland with no inflections that gave Bella Swan any good characterization, as in my head, she had always had. Many of you may debate this, as I know so many people to feel Bella is as bland as the chosen narrator made her.Nonetheless, Elijah Wood, has given me no such qualms, in fact he has done an amazing job at giving credibility to audiobooks everywhere. I do not say this lightly. But, with Elijah Wood at the helm of Mark Twain's adventurous masterpiece, I felt like I was really listening to Huck Finn tell me the story of his exploratory travels on the Mississippi River. Not only did he hit Huck Finn's voice on the dot he also was amazing when it came to Jim, the runaway slave. I really believed there were two different voices participating in the mesmerizing tale.It made me fall for the characters in an entirely different way than if I would have read it. Mark Twain's English isn't quite the English of today and I felt that Wood gave it a feeling and a loveliness that my own brain probably wouldn't have.The only complaint I have with the audiobook is not against this audiobook in particular, but the same complaint I have for all audiobooks everywhere...they take so much time to listen to. A book that would normally take me five hours to read (or less) takes a good ten to listen to on audio. However, the magnificence of technology today allowed me to download, from audible.com, directly onto my Kindle. How freaking awesome is that!!!!!!!!! (It needs more exclamation points still!!!)So, in conclusion, I recommend this audiobook to anyone who wants to feel like they are traveling along the Mississippi with Huckleberry Finn and Jim. The experience for me was overly enjoyable. Elijah Wood definitely gives it the feel it deserves and makes me believe in Huck's antic's over and over again."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"Huckleberry Finn was a great literary work published in 1885 and written by Mark Twain. One of the most positive things about the book would be that the reading level is not very advanced and that it shows us a glimpse of the past. Along with the reading level not being very advanced, the book itself is extremely well thought out, and brings the stories, characters, and imagery to life. One of the negatives is the amount of cursing that takes place throughout the book. This is a negative because it is at a children's reading level and it does not add any literary value to the book as a piece of history. The ugly but I believe necessary part of the book is the use of the n-word. This is a necessary part of the book because it shows to our children and everyone the meaning behind the word. If anything it makes the reader more understanding of the troubles that the slaves when though and understand the meaning of the word a little more deeply."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"My intent was to purchase this book for my daughter. HA! When it came in, I read it, again. Maybe 3 times in my life so far. It majestically captures the way it really was on the grand ol' Mississippi River in the mid 19th century. The writing is aimed at an audience more experienced than say Tom Sawyer. We claim to have not found yet the great American novel, but, this comes close. This ought to be in every reader's library, school and public libraries, and, I'd argue, it ought to be considered an essential element in American English Literature classes.

It's very deep - exploring the old American west (now known as the American south, along the Mississipi River valley), and the people, places, and goings-ons, through the brave eyes of a young (essentially) innocent - while being just plain fun. It is dated, but that's part of its charm - the language is rustic, the children are freer, the people more trustworthy, and the river was a little wider, the heat a little hotter.

I am sure others his age will enjoy this book as well.Reviewed by a loyal Amazon customer."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"Monumental and fluid, Mark Twain offers this first-person narrative through a young American boy named Huckleberry Finn whose epic journey down the Mississippi River during the slavery era of the south leads him to a greater understanding of human nature and of the blinding misconceptions of prejudice in The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Running Press, 238 pages). The escapade takes Huck through a compelling series of events which relentlessly test his will, morals and conviction. Ravaged by inner-turmoil, he is constantly battling with himself over what his heart tells him to do versus what society tells him to do. The recurring theme of right versus wrong in Huck's eyes is evident with almost all of the acquaintances and relationships he has in this captivating, revealing classic.When encountering a novel it usually takes the reader a few chapters to get into the flow of the book; this is not the case in Twain's artful masterpiece. From the first chapter to the last, the novel keeps its momentum and Twain never bores the reader by slowing down the pace of the story. The plot does not become bogged-down or dull, like so many pieces of literature tend to. Huck's revelations as the story progresses regarding the black race are inspiring and even his view of the white race after spending an extended period of time with the dauphin and the duke show a side of Huck which society did not breed. Twain uses slavery, education and the hypocrisy of society as clear themes which illuminate Huck's true feelings. His intellectual state at the conclusion of the novel is far superior to what it was at the beginning and it serves to demonstrate the profound impact the voyage had on his attitude toward the human race."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"I had never read Huckleberry Finn and am glad that I did.

There is more to this book than than a simple story of a boy and a man floating down the river in a raft.What I loved about this reading of Huck Finn is that we were also to read Toni Morrison's Introduction to it. It was through this Introduction that I was able to see the story in a completely new light - and to understand just what was so \\"wonderfully troubling\\" about it.Morrison talks a lot about silence in the book - the silence in those moments of floating down the river, the silence with regard to learning much of anything about Jim's family, the silence with which Huck treats his friendship with Tom. Then there's the silence of Jim toward Huck - why did he fail to disclose who that man was under the cloth?This is an extraordinarily troubling book, but yes.. a wonderful one as well. It's enlightening - it shows how hard the struggle was to accept the idea that a human is a human, no matter his or her skin color. It's educational, it reminds us of where we've come from in an effort to remind us of where we should not return. It's captured history through the dialect of Jim. It's a look at two individuals escaping slavery - Jim the actual slavery, and Huck, escaping abuse at the hand of his father.I always recommend these books. Tom Sawyer is more suited to younger audiences (although I personally find Tom to be a scoundrel), but Huck Finn is a must read for teenagers and adults."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"This is one of the best books of its epoch!

I think this part really shows how smart Huck is for his age and how well he is able to come up with an elaborate, workable plan with the few items he had on hand to use. He showed amazing perseverance and dedication to hard work in cutting out a hole big enough to squeeze through with the small rusted saw blade. He showed clear thinking when after making it out of the house he did not just run off into the woods where he knew he would soon be followed probably caught. After deciding to fake his own death he paid great attention to detail in not only covering the hole in the wall back up, hacking the door to pieces, and adding the pigs blood but also in thinking to drag a bag of rocks all the way to river to help explain what happened to the \\"body\\".

The book was a great classic, the only reason that I did read it is because we have to read a classic for school, however, now that I have read it I realize that it was a great book. I would read this book two or three times, and I do not like reading books again. The book was really able to portray the idea of childhood innocence and foolishness in the book, especially the end. I thought that this book was really an eye opener for people who may think that life is not worth living or maybe derpessed. Because, as you can see, Huck was a young boy who had an alcoholic father who beat him all the time, even kidnapped him after he was adopted by other people. Huck even decided to run away from his father, yet he is still a young, fun loving kid in the end, especially when Tom reveals to him how the whole trip was just a game.

Not my personal favorite, but a definite masterpiece of American literature."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"I will begin by saying that I loved reading \\"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer\\" also by Mark Twain. I think it is an inspired work of genius and I thoroughly enjoyed it (see my review on that book). Even the introduction to Tom Sawyer, however, describes Huckleberry Finn as \\"Twain's masterpiece, perhaps his only great novel, morally and stylistically above the somewhat fragmentary and anecdotal Tom Sawyer.\\"I cannot agree with this assessment. I had numerous problems with this work which detracted from my full enjoyment of its many positives.First, the outline - This is the story of Huck Finn, Tom Sawyer's colorful outcast friend introduced and developed in that first book. This book recaptures his association with Tom, but very quickly Huck breaks off on his own - he runs away to get away from his drunk and abusive father who has imprisoned him in a desolate cottage. He will not meet Tom again until the final chapters of the book. He picks up on his flight down the Mississipi the runaway slave Jim, and they quickly develop a mutual bond of love, respect and friendship that transcends the social barriers between them. The rest of the book is the story of their many adventures as they raft down the Mississipi river. Central to the saga are Jim's struggle to find freedom and Huck's struggle with his conscience torn between the 'civilized' ideas he recieves during his brief time with the well-meaning widow Douglas and his own previously uncontaminated sense of right and wrong.Using the first person narration in the voice of Huck Finn is a stroke of genius, giving the story a freshness and authenticity that make even the simplest passages a pleasure to read. Each character is given a distinct local accent. The author is obviously proud of this achievement; he specifically describes his linguistic efforts thus in the preface, \\"The shadings have not been done in a hap-hazard fashion, or by guess-work; but pains-takingly, and with the trustworthy guidance and support of personal familiarity with these several forms of speech.\\"Moreover, despite the limitations on vocabulary forced by this decision, he manages to create eloquent and evocative descriptions of life on and along the Mississipi river. In fact, the Mississipi, in all its majesty and beauty and power runs through the entire narrative holding it together and effectively becoming a third major character in the story.Now for the negatives. The first is technical, and takes off where the last paragraph left off. Even for a genius like Mark Twain, it is apparently difficult to consistently maintain the speech cadences of an uneducated boy who can barely read, through the entire course of a full-length novel. And the inconsistencies show through. Frequently. This acts to intermittently spoil the very effect he is trying to create. Also, it can be a little annoying, like the voice of an American imitating a British accent that frequently and unintentionally falls back to American. I will illustrate with two passages. First, the opening lines of the book,\\"You don't know about me, without you have read a book by the name of \\"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer,\\" but that ain't no matter. That book was made by Mr. Mark Twain, and he told the truth, mainly. There was things which he stretched, but mainly he told the truth. That is nothing. I never seen anybody but lied, one time or another, without it was Aunt Polly, or the widow, or maybe Mary.\\"Quaint. Honest. Beautiful.Now contrast this speech peppered with grammatical flaws with the following lines from chapter 9 -\\"The door of the cavern was big enough to roll a hogshead in, and on one side of the door the floor stuck out a little bit and was flat and a good place to build a fire on. So we built it there and cooked dinner.\\"Or these from chapter 12 (except for the colloquial word ain't) -\\"I took the canoe out from the shore a little piece and took a look, but if there was a boat around I couldn't see it, for stars and shadows ain't good to see by. Then we got out the raft and slipped along down in the shade, past the foot of the island dead still, never saying a word.\\"And so on. Maybe a small quibble, but noticeable.Secondly, because the story assumes quite early on a clear moral position (unlike Tom Sawyer), one begins to expect a certain degree of realism and believability in the plotline itself (which is not the case with Tom Sawyer). In Huck Finn, the childlike pranks of Tom Sawyer are replaced by elaborate and convoluted plots spanning many chapters and frequent twists that rely all too much on coincidence. The stories are funny but not convincing. This detracts from the credibility of the underlying message. Crystals of wisdom do not dissolve well in a broth of farce, and they stand out like sunburnt trees on a savannah, somehow diminished, desolate and out of place.The weight of this contradiction becomes particularly telling in the final chapters which stretch credibility to its limit and become tedious to the point of exasperation. This fact was apparently also pointed out by Ernest Hemmingway in his famous critique of the novel. He had high praise for it but urged readers to stop reading at the final third of the book, although he still mostly canonized it as a ground-breaking work of American Literature. (This last bit I obtained from a commentary on Hemmingway's review, so I cannot claim first-hand knowledge of it).Other critics have proposed that the painful slowness of the latter part of the book is a deliberate attempt to reflect the lackadaisical attitude of white people and law makers toward social change during the period. But I cannot accept that to describe a sense of boredom a book must itself be made boring - at least not in the hands of a skilled writer like Mark Twain. Therefore I see it as a shortcoming.Another inexplicable (and in my opinion, unforgivable) anomaly is that Tom Sawyer is used in the story only as a trickster and a foil to contrast with the innocent and innate honesty of Huckleberry Finn. The lovable social rebel of the first novel now takes on a darker character and in fact becomes the embodiment of a fickle and foolish system of social values. His childlike imagination is transformed into a penchant for lying and the erstwhile lighthearted pranks take on a grotesque and somber dimension. In his self-centered desire for fame and glory, Tom Sawyer is willing to put his friends at great risk and comes up with hare-brained schemes and ridiculous ideas to further his ends. I don't see why such a rare and wonderful literary character must be sacrificed at the altar of another in this wasteful manner.As to the more usual criticism of the book for its abundant use of the racially abrasive term \\"nig**r\\", I feel the author has used it for authenticity in the speech of the day rather than with any intent to denigrate. The spirit of his book is squarely anti-slavery. Still, it would probably be painful for an African American to digest the repeated use of the word.Also, the consistent portrayal of slaves as simple-minded and superstitious is hard to accept. Even Jim's character could not be fully developed because of these limitations.Yet, despite my reservations, I am happy to have finally read this great American classic, that I have long wished to tackle. Its positives still make it a worthy read."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"I may be only 11, but I know a good book when I see one and this is one of them!"},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"I just finished reading The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. The book has many controversial aspects, especially on racism. The use of the N word is expressed throughout the novel and is probably the most protested piece of the book But since the action of the book takes place in the south many years before the Civil War, it would be prodigious if they didn't use the word. For example, in one scene Aunt Sally understands that a steamboat had exploded,\\"Good gracious! anybody hurt?\\" she asks.\\"No'm,\\" comes the answer. \\"Killed a nigger.\\"Huck was brought up to know that slavery is natural, but soon realizes that slavery in not natural, but is wrong. Throughout the novel he wonders whether helping Jim escape is the right thing to do. He later understands Jim is just like him.

I remember when I first read it in 8th grade at High School. I was amazed then only by the adventures of the little boy and nothing else. However, when we discussed it again this semester in the college, I realized the plot of the book and its representation of the harsh reality during the slavery period in USA.In \\"Huck Finn\\", Mark Twain satirizes a society, which has no moral issues and which is trapped between its obdurate way of thinking and the rapidly changing reality. He also exposes very important problem as showing us the way for reaching independence as a constant struggle between freedom and slavery. This struggle exists for both Jim and Huck. For Jim this is more physical struggle than mental, while for Huck it is based on mentality and experience. Jim fears the physical slavery of that period in USA and Huck does not want to be \\"civilized\\" by a society without any moral values and chooses to live his own life free and independent.Having read \\"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\\" twice, I strongly recommend it to everyone interested not only in risky and funny adventures, but also to those who think that morality is important in the humans' relationship."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"This was a good book it had its dull parts like when Jim and Huck were going down the river.

This book is about a young boy named Jim. This book has many plot twists to keep the reader busy while unfolding Twain's real motives through this book. The word \\"nigger\\" was just a way for Twain to make his world come to life. Although people think the usage of this word is vulgar and racist, it is a must to read this book and to find it for yourself why this book is highly against slavery. Mark Twain also gave each character their own style of speech to fit there characteristics and intellect. Mark uses this journey of Jim and Huck to emphasize some of his themes and morals that he wanted to teach the readers. Such morals are that of racism and slavery when Huck befriends Jim, a slave, and lies and cons, which is shown through the characters of Duke and Dauphin.

Perry claims that Twain was stumped at the point in his story (at the end of Chapter 16) when Huck and escaped slave Jim had missed in the night their connection north, via the Ohio River at Cairo, and were forced to continue south on the Mississippi River. Twain's conundrum: Why would Jim go south to get free? According to Perry, it was Twain's friendship with the former Union General and President that solved this writer's block and led to the creation of America's greatest work of fiction. Perry tells us that it was because Ulysses Grant went south to win the Civil War, that Twain determined it would be possible for Jim to go south to win his freedom. It's impossible to tell from the book that such a problem existed for Twain. The book is seamless in it's beatiful telling of remarkable adventures. \\"Huckleberry Finn,\\" a gift to me when I was eight, was the first book I ever owned. I read it then and again when it was required in school (Lake Placid, New York, where the \\"n\\" word didn't make this literary classic verboten). I am glad I revisited it a third time, not only for the humor but for the beauty of the language Twain so perfectly captured.

Time to admit something: I never read Huckleberry Finn in school. I'm not sure whether or not we had to, but I never experienced this book until now, in my twenties. What a trip! I had no idea. I was prepared for a \\"racist\\" book, and it wasn't. The \\"N\\" word was used, but not in a hateful way; only as a way that people spoke long ago. Not that that makes it right, but I didn't see what all the hoopla was/is about. And there are so many books that owe a debt to Twain for so many reasons: The use of child narrator voice; coming of age; humor. CATCHER IN THE RYE, TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD, and McCrae's BARK OF THE DOGWOOD are just a few that come to mind. Whatever you do, give FINN a chance. This is a great American classic. No, it's not a short book, but it is fascinating."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is an exciting novel. It begins with the narrator (Huckleberry Finn) explaining that he and some friends (along with Tom Sawyer) are in a &quot;Robber's Gang.&quot; Huck wishes to remain a part of this new gang but Tom Sawyer, who is a life long friend forces him to be respectable and stay in school in order to stay in the gang.The Novel is set in St. Petersburg, Missouri. All is well, Huck Finn has money saved in the bank from treasures he and his friend Tom found. Unfortunately, Huck's father, who is a money hungry drunk, comes back to town and demands Huck's money. Huck was adopted by a lady named Widow Douglas. Huck's dad tries to fight for custody once he comes back to town but fails in his attempts. He then hangs around town and harrasses his son. Finally he kidnaps Huckand takes him to his cabin. In this part of the story the reader feels for Huck. His father locks him in their cabin when he leaves and when he returns home drunk, he beats him. The reader wants to see Huck stand up to his father and do something. Then, the reader gets what they want. Huck escapes from his father by faking his own death. He then sneaks off to an island in the Mississippi while the townspeople search the river for his body.While he's living on the island he encounters another boy. His name is Jim. Huck and Jim become friends and live on the island together. Unfortunately, some townspeople saw smoke coming from the island so the boys are forced to leave. The novel goes on to follow Huckleberry Finn in his wild journey's across the Mississippi.I thought that the book was a wonderful exciting tale of companionship and adventure. I would not hesitate to read this book again. Although the time period and the setting set me off from reading this novel before, when I finally read it I was pleasently suprised. I really liked how Huck Finn tells the story and the humor that is put into it. Mark Twain does a great job of making you feel like you are a part of the story as well. However, Mark Twain sometimes used racism that could be offensive to some. In my opinion, this book wouldn't have a clear setting of time period if he had left it out.My favorite thing about this novel is that it is a story about a young boy and what he overcomes in life. I loved the friend ships and the childhood fasination of the outdoors. I would recommend this book to anyone who read the novel preceding it, The Adventures of Tom Sawyer and also to anyone who enjoys a good adventure themselves."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is an adventure book written by Mark Twain.

The story states Huck's struggles like living with the widow, problems with all of his money and being civilized. He runs away from his home from the widow and then rethinks his situation. Huck soon reconsiders his first choice of running away and soon returns to the widows where he is home again.

Huck takes a raft that he had found down the river to the abandoned Jackson's Island. He soon encounters Jim, one of Miss Watson's slaves. Jim soon tells Huck of how he had escaped from Miss Watson because he had overheard her talking about selling him down in the south. Huck and Jim unite and they both take the stolen raft down the river where they are trying to gain their freedom. They travel up the river and encounter a bunch of robbers that are holding a man hostage. Huck sneaks on to the wreck and listens in on what the robbers are saying. They are threatening a man and are about to kill him. Huck and Jim almost got caught up in the mess but slyly escaped.

Huck Finn, the narrator and main character of the book, constantly rejects society and all attempts by other people to take care of him. He wants nothing more than to leave society behind and live by his own rules. Mark Twain portrays the young boy's adventures exceptionally well and the reader will feel connected to the characters.While the novel may not be a page turner from start to finish, conflicts in Huck's path call to question moral beliefs in today's world. With each new paragraph comes a greater desire for the reader to search for their own adventure. The book can be read straight through solely for entertainment or it can be picked apart and assessed time and again by anyone searching for deeper meaning in the words.I would recommend this novel to any person in search of a vicarious journey. The classic depiction of the \\"hero's journey\\" is what kept my interest. Mark Twain's work should be purchased by people interested in the time period, realistic, epic journeys, or English students looking for writing to delve deeper into."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"This book is a must-have for serious readers of Twain's greatest novel, one well worth the expense. Based on his original manuscript, it provides the ur-text of this wonderful work (including the original illustrations), giving readers the opportunity to appreciate and enjoy the full subtlety of the author's labors.Enhancing the experience is the excellent annotations that the editors provided. While a bit difficult to trace (the editors preferred page-line cites to footnotes, which leaves the text free of supertext clutter), they provide first-rate insight into the details of Clemens's writing and the minutiae of Huck's world. This, along with Clemens's original notes, list of revisions, fascimilies of the original manuscript, and a number of maps of Clemens's Mississippi, make this book an essential addition to the library of any student of this great writer."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"The novel \\"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\\" exposes the reader to many interesting and funny occurrences during the pre-Civil War time.

I remember when I first read it in 8th grade at High School. I was amazed then only by the adventures of the little boy and nothing else. However, when we discussed it again this semester in the college, I realized the plot of the book and its representation of the harsh reality during the slavery period in USA.In \\"Huck Finn\\", Mark Twain satirizes a society, which has no moral issues and which is trapped between its obdurate way of thinking and the rapidly changing reality. He also exposes very important problem as showing us the way for reaching independence as a constant struggle between freedom and slavery. This struggle exists for both Jim and Huck. For Jim this is more physical struggle than mental, while for Huck it is based on mentality and experience. Jim fears the physical slavery of that period in USA and Huck does not want to be \\"civilized\\" by a society without any moral values and chooses to live his own life free and independent.Having read \\"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\\" twice, I strongly recommend it to everyone interested not only in risky and funny adventures, but also to those who think that morality is important in the humans' relationship."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn will always be a classic piece of American literature because it embodies an adventure of immense scale.

This book will amaze you in many ways. This book is wonderful, but hard to read. If you like books with easy words that you can read quickly, then I do not recommend this for you. This book is hard to read because of their southern dialect and bad grammar. This book is very hard to read. If you can get used to thye language, then you will do fine with this book. It is a very adventurous book. There is always something crazy going on, which makes it a lot more exiting and fun to read. Not only is the whole theme and plot and characters wonderful, but there is also a great authors style. Mark Twain did an excellent job of first of all capturing the setting of a hundred years ago in the South, by making sure you got the feel and image in your mind of where this takes place. He also writes from Huckleberry Finns prospective, and does a wonderful job on trying to really become that character, and you can tell in the things he writes. Mark Twain is an awesome writer and makes it half the reason it is so good. If you enjoy books with much adventure then read &quot;Huckleberry Finn&quot;.

Yes, I am white, but the story is set up in such a way as to make Jim, the slave who is repeatedly referred to by that most forbidden of words, the most honorable and reasonable character in the book.The story follows Huck Finn, a rebellious eleven-year-old boy without a mother and with a drunken crook for a father, as he decides to run away when his drunken father returns to town after a long absence and takes Huck back home with him. As Huck runs away, he meets up with Jim, a slave owned by his best friend Tom's aunt, who has also chosen to run away, heading north and seeking a better life. As they make their way down the Mississippi River, they meet a great deal of colorful characters and, most importantly, Huck grows as a person. He and Jim develop a deep, meaningful friendship, and Huck comes to realize that Jim is a man, no matter what the color of his skin is.The book is hilarious and wildly entertaining, but is also tender and sweet. Mark Twain was truly a master author, and it is easy to see why this has been called The Great American Novel. The book never drags or fails to hold your attention. I would suggest that any child younger than thirteen or so would be talked to about the \\"N-word\\" before reading it, but I certainly do not feel that it should be yanked from their hands and forbidden. The book has far too much value to sit on a bookshelf and not be read. A simple explanation that this word was a part of the vernacular at the time the book was written but is now no longer acceptable and that only hateful people use it seems like it would suffice.Don't let this book drown in the controversy that it attracts.

The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is one of those books. Mark Twain is an entertaining part of American history.Most people who have been raised in America know at least Huck Finn's name. He is known for his escapades in early America and his friendship with the well-known Tom Sawyer. If you haven't read the book, you've seen the movie. That might be a bad thing.How can that be bad? Because if you only watch the movies and then years later read the book, you'll be very disappointed in what you read.The movies are so different than the book is. Yes, there are many movies, but the majority veer far from Twain's original works.It also doesn't help that I am mostly used to contemporary writing which is much different that of the writings of the 1800s and earlier. The works are more description of scenes and actions than we are used to today. The style is vastly different. In fact, you might it difficult to read because of that.You might also find it difficult to read where the dialogue is written exactly the way it was spoken. When the slave, Jim, speaks, it is not in formal English. It is written as he spoke it. In reading these parts, you might want to read it aloud so you can hear what he said instead of reading it.I also found reading of Huck and Tom's actions rather difficult. I don't see boys of their age really acting that way, but that is how Twain wanted them to be. I really think the movies ruined it for me. Though I still enjoy Twain's short stories. Maybe that is where I need to stay with him.Please be aware if you have your children read the book for school. Throughout the book, the \`n' word is used. It was a part of the culture's everyday language which makes it important to use in the story. You might want to explain the use of the word then versus now before reading the book.Note: This was a free copy obtained through a public domain venue."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"I remember the first time i had read this classic novel by the one and only Mark Twain...

One of the best books I've read."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"I have just finished reading this book to my two boys (7 and 10). It was a bit long for them really, especially the younger one. And yet it is a very engaging novel that had them periodically laughing, or breathless with their eyes popping out. It is at times a bit grim, and at times a bit farcical. It's also pretty hard to read aloud with all those accents and voices. But it is above all a story of resourcefulness, of conscience and of survival. And, of course, it is sufficiently exotic in time and place for modern Australians, as we are, to add an extra dimension to the enjoyment.If you plan to read it to your children, allow yourself plenty of time, be prepared to pause and discuss some of the issues (such as slavery, which we no longer tolerate and yet it was not necessarily the worst of outcomes for some people). You will enjoy it I am sure (and, yes, we had read Tom Sawyer earlier although that isn't necessary)"},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"I felt that this was generaly a good novel. I really enjoyed the life of huck fin. He is a very creative charctor and very inteligent. I like how he has the ability to set up a life, not be fully satisfied with it and decide to just run away and leave every thing behind.Not only is Huckleberry Finn an adventurous book, it also can be comical and light, though the book has a grave meaning, showing the wrongs in society at the time in the late 19th century. This book was also very good at showing you what life was like at the time. It shows how life was much simpler then.On a negative side i did not like how the book focused so much on racism. I do not reading about it and i would say that it strongly influinces this book. It does provide some good moral value on the subject though.Huck gets a lot done in the short period of time that the book is baised on. Huck is adopted by the well-intentioned but way too overprotective Widow Douglas(needless to say, Huck is none too pleased with the widow's attempts to turn him into an upstanding citizen). Because of this he runs away and soon after finds himself living with his abusive fauther. He enjoys this at first but eventully decides that the abuse is enough. So again he runs away and this is where he meets jim. Jim is a runaway slave and togeather as outcasts they become best friends.I would definitly reccomend this book to any age level.

Twain's imagery puts the reader right beside Huck while he escapes &#65533;sivilization&#65533; and floats down the Mississippi river with his slave-gone-fugitive friend Jim. Huck&#65533;s innocent outlook on the world is both humorous and adorable. Huck&#65533;s respect for Jim is admirable. Even though Huck was brought up with Jim being a inferior slave, he still looks up to Jim. Also, I think that although Jim&#65533;s dialect adds to the effectiveness of the book, it is very difficult to understand. I think Twain writes it a little too much how the dialect sounds.

It offers plenty of excitement and surprises."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"It seems that everybody's initial reaction after reading Huck Finn is to debate if Twain was a racist or not. It's a pity because such a debate takes away from the greatness of the book. Was he a racist? I don't know, I never met the man. History and his own writing would seem to support that he was. Do I think any less of him, despite my opinion that he might have been racist? Not in the least. His racism was born out of a time when racism was the norm and rooted more in fear and culture rather than hate. Perhaps ignorance would be a better term, but I dare not call this man ignorant. I really don't think he was a mean hearted man, but being nice doesn't exclude one for being a racist.

Where they had travel through the heart of America. Mark Twain also makes good little adventures that Jim and Huck run into. They go through the story going from one adventure after another, in the same time they also learn to bond as friends depsite the color of their skin. This is interesting for readers because it was rare to see blacks and whites talk to one another or let alone to even do things together. Though this book uses a derogatory word for African American, I do not find this inappropriate because during the time this book was written, this word was how people looked at African Americans. Mark Twain seems to display the social injustices that were happening America, and instead of following them he turned them around and made the bad seem good. I would recommend this book because a lot of children and maybe even adults could learn how life was like in the past and how there were social injustices. It can also show the meaning of how people can bond, regardless of his or her race, sex, or age. I think highly of this book even though it used to be banned in educational systems because of it's context and I think that this is one of the best books I have read in my life."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"I think that this book is exciting but is too long.

It has many ethical values, and is captivating. It shows Huck being torn over hard desisions, and his friendship with a black slave. I really enjoyed the story, and I recommend it to anyone who likes old english, and adventurous stories!!!SUMMARYAfter Huck and Tom discovered twelve thousand dollars when looking for treasure in Mark Twains previous novel Tom Sawyer, the two boys invested it through Judge Thatcher. After this, the Widow Douglas and Miss Watson took Huck into their home. Huck can't stand how the town is attempting to civilize him, so he ran away. After Tom Sawyer finds him, Tom tells him that he can't join his gang unless he goes back to the Widow's house, so Huck does. Tom's gang meets in a cave at night to plan their next robberies. Many of the members get bored of the fake adventures that Tom makes up off of urban legends, so the gang breaks up.Later on, Huck sees a footprint with a cross in the heel: Pap's. It dawns on Huck that Pap must have come back to take his money, so he runs to Judge Thatcher to \\"sell\\" him his part of the treasure money. In return, Judge Thatcher gives him a dollar. When Huck gets home to the widow's house, Pap is sitting on his bed waiting for him. After being infuriated by the fact that Huck would go to school, and that Judge Thatcher wouldn't give him the money, he takes Huck's dollar, and kidnaps him from the house.Judge Thatcher and the Widow both tried to get custody of Huck, but the new judge in town didn't know about Pap, and didn't want to break up father and son. Back at the log cabin where Pap takes him, Huck enjoys being able to smoke, cuss, and lay around all day again at first, but decides he needs to escape Pap's abuse.The next time Pap goes into town to buy booze, Huck escapes. Killing a pig, he spreads the pig blood around the cabin, then takes an axe and chops through the door and trashes the rest of the cabin, to make people think that robbers came in the cabin and murdered him. Finally, he takes a canoe downstream to Jackson's Island to hide out until the town stopped searching for his body.After a couple of days on the island, he meets up with Jim, who has run away to avoid being sold. Jim, being superstitious thinks that Huck is a ghost, but then Huck convinces him that he's not dead. The two end up traveling together on a raft down the river. Their goal is to reach Cairo, so they can take a steamboat up the Ohio to the free states.After a nightlong storm, an abandon house floats past their camp site. When they climb onto it, they find a dead man. When Jim goes over to see the body, he recognizes Pap; he doesn't tell Huck who it is.Huck and Jim decide that they need to go to town to get news and supplies. Huck dresses as a girl, and goes ashore. He knocks on the nearest house, and meets a woman. While talking to her, he learns that Jim is being accused of Huck's and Pap's deaths since he ran away. Then Huck learns that a search party is going to invade Jackson's Island that night, so he runs off to warn Jim.They continue to float downstream, and during a particularly rough storm, they see an abandoned steamboat. When they go aboard, they soon discover that there are three thieves aboard. Using the thieves' skiff to escape, they watch the boat until it sinks so low the water, that everyone on board would have drowned.After finding their raft, Jim and Huck continue downstream. One night, in a fog, they got separated. During the fog, they pass Cairo.Nights later, a steamboat crashes into the raft, crushing it, and Hunk Huck and Jim to jump off to save their lives. When Huck gets to shore, he is apprehended by search dogs. He is then taken in by the Grangerfords. Huck soon finds out where Jim is hiding. Then a fight between the the Grangerfords and the Shepherdsons, who have been in a 30 year feud, many members of each family are killed. Huck leaves the scene with Jim, and they continue to float on the river.Soon after that happened, two strangers, board Huck and Jim's raft. These partners are a pair of robbers who are escaping from a nearby town. The first man, tells Huck and Jim that he is the \\"dauphin,\\" (the son of King Louis XVI- heir to the French throne). The second man says that he is the \\"usurped Duke of Bridgewater.\\" Since Huck is supposed to be dead, and Jim is a runaway slave, they are forced to deal with the two intruders, in fear of being turned out. The two men invent many scams, one of them being \\"the Royal Nonesuch\\" which earns them tons of money. Then the duke and the dauphin overhear about the death of a man named Peter Wilks, who has left his fortune to his two brothers. They get the man drunk, and he gives them so much information, they are able to pretend to be the two brothers. The Wilks sisters welcome the two men into their home as they present the inheritance as they are in mourning, never suspecting the hoax. The two spend their time selling all the girls' property for even more money. Later, Huck confesses to the oldest of the sisters the entire situation. Later, the real brothers show up, but lost the proof of their identity. After a spout, the townspeople decide to dig up the body to determine who the liars are.Huck runs to the raft and Jim to push off into the river, but the Duke and King are able to get on. Later, the King and Duke sell Jim.When Huck decides to rescue Jim, he goes to the house where Jim is, but the house belongs to Tom Sawyer's Aunt Sally! Huck is then mistaken for Tom. Huck then sees Tom on his way there, and explains the situation. Tom pretends to be his younger brother Sid, and together they decide how to help Jim escape.The two boys then tell the town that a group of thieves is going to attack where Jim is being held. As they run away with Jim, Tom gets shot in the calf. Huck goes to town to tell a doctor, and the doctor returns with Tom on an old mattress, and Jim in chains. When Tom awakens, he demands that they let Jim go free.Aunt Polly came to see them when her sister, Sally, told her that Tom and Sid were there. Aunt Polly informs everyone that Jim is actually free, and tells everyone That Tom is really Huck, that Sid is really Tom, and that Pap is dead."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"I think this book did average for me. I wasn't really all into the book because I guess it wasn't my type. I know that's pretty selfish but other than that, the plot and everything else was great. It really is a great book. I love how Huck was always getting himself out of trouble that he started on his own. it was pretty cool how Jim got involved in the situation with the town thinking he killed Huck. I mean that was such a coincidence how Jim ended up at the same hideout as Huck. I didn't like how the book was so descriptive. That's why I thought that some parts were pretty boring because Huck would just talk about the same thing over and over until the readers get a clear picture of what he was trying to describe. This book was really challenging and funny."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"Mark Twain's masterpiece has withstood the test of time and has remained one of America's finest pieces of literature. I find it ironic that this book was supposed to be nothing more than a follow-up to Tom Sawyer. Huckleberry Finn definitely stands on it's own, as it's themes are much deeper and more mature than it's predecessor. I'm glad I waited \`til I was a little older when I tackled this story. As everyone knows, the southern language in the book is at times difficult and much of Twain's humor might have been lost on me had I read it earlier. For these reasons I have a hard time calling this book a children's classic.The story is simple enough. A boy in his young teens decides to run away from his drunken father and the people bent on \\"sivilizing\\" him. On his adventures he meets up with Jim, a runaway slave seeking freedom. The book follows their escapades as they raft down the Mississippi river.There are frequent racial references that may be offensive to the modern reader, but people need to be aware that Mark Twain's original intention was one of irony. Jim, the runaway at who the slurs are often directed, is depicted as an intelligent and noble man. Twain is making fun of the superstitions, customs, and racist attitudes of the south of that time."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"In this story there is a parentless child named Huck Finn. Huck lives with a lady named Mrs. Watson, and his best friend is Tom Sawyer. One day Huck figured out that he had lots of inheritance money, and his alchoholic father came to claim it. So Huck meets his father, who took him and locked him in a cabin. Huck escaped after a couple of weeks and fakes he was murdered. So Huck took off in a canoe. While hiding, he ran into Jim, Mrs. Watson's slave that had ran away, and Huck was mighty happy. Together they boated down south until they met these two cut throat rapscalions. Huck & Jim were then forced to work for them. They found out Jim was a run away slave and sold him to Tom's aunt and uncle. Huck escaped from the cutthroats, and found Jim at Tom's aunt and uncle's house. They believe Huck is Tom. Eventually Tom and Huck meet and convince the aunt and uncle that Tom is his brother, Sid Sawyer. So Huck & Tom live together, and try to break Jim out. When they get Jim out the gaurds fire and hit Tom in the calf. Tom and Huck boat to an island, but Huck goes to get a doctor and runs into the uncle of Tom. Then Tom gets back and is sick and tells his aunt everything and they adopt Huck, and that is how it ends.I gave this book a four because it's a great book. This book is sort of hard to understand with the southern slang, and accents. This book is great for kids who like adventures. Also it is just the book to learn what it was like in the south in the 1800's. I loved this book because of the characters and the way they acted. Also if you like books with deceiving and conning you'll love this one. so overall this is a great book. This book is a should read book, so get it."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"I enjoyed reading this classic very much. The characters definitely made it a funny, interesting, and exciting book to read. The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn was a worthy read. This is a book I'm proud to have finished and be able to say I have read. I honestly enjoyed it. On a scale from 1-10 I would have to give it a 8.5. Mark Twain really paints a clear picture of the two main characters and how they come to be throughout the book. I would recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a classic read, full of adventure, and a real true friendship lesson. This was a very challenging book but all the worthwhile. This is a book that has made me interested in experimenting other Mark Twain books. I truly think this book should have never been banned; it only prevented children from a great piece of literature."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"Mark Twain's Huckleberry Finn is not only Twain's best work, but is considered by some, one of the greatest novels ever written. Episodic in form (as Twain warns, \\"persons attempting to find a plot in it will be shot\\"), Huckleberry Finn is clearly, along with Nathaniel Hawthorne's The Scarlet Letter and Herman Melville's Moby-Dick, one of the three most ambitious and artistically successful novels of America's 19th century.But what is it about Huckleberry Finn that makes it stand out? Most young people reading it will declare that they thought Tom Sawyer was better, and for them, they would be right. It is a difficult novel to teach. The dialect is actually difficult for some inexperienced readers. The satire and ironies are often lost on some readers, and some minorities are offended by what they think is its racist tone. That, however, is an historical irony if ever there was one. Twain's intent was to belittle and make fun of the racist attitudes of most Americans. The very fact that Jim and Huck were able to achieve a fast friendship and to negotiate together the epic journey down the Mississippi with Jim often showing superior wisdom and a right smart common sense did not sit well with some prejudicial mind sets. Today what offends is the language, in particular the use of the \\"n\\" word.But what makes Huckleberry Finn a great novel is first and foremost the indelible character of the often self-effacing Huck Finn himself and his compelling, lyrical, and ever so beautifully observed narrative. There is only one other novel in American literature that can be considered in the same league as far as first person narratives go, and that is Nabokov's Lolita. Strange to say Humbert Humbert and Huck Finn have one thing in common, an uncommon ability to make their differing worlds extraordinarily vivid through painstakingly clever and absolutely authentic voices. Both Twain and Nabokov achieved this rare veracity because of their command of language, their sense of character, and their fine ear for the nuances of speech.Sense of character is also what makes Huckleberry Finn a great novel. The characters are so real they practically jump off the page. Even the minor characters are Shakespearean in their psychological verity. It is not exactly a co-incidence that the Duke of \\"Bilgewater\\" and the \\"King of France,\\" those ornery rascals rescued by Huck and Jim, were experts in ersatz Shakespeare and various dodges. Twain knew people, and he knew them well. Too well, one might say, considering his low opinion of humankind.The effective--even rhapsodic--use of dialect is another thing that makes Huckleberry Finn a great novel. Writing a novel in dialect is a difficult thing to do well. Many have tried it and many have failed. Most writers are well advised to limit their use of dialect to the speech of their characters. But Twain was a master of dialect of many sorts, and was able to have Huck Finn narrate the entire novel in his voice while at the same time employ the various dialects of the other characters. Nabokov--although I don't think he ever acknowledged this--was undoubtedly influenced by Twain's authentic use of dialect; but because his narrator was a transplanted European professor of literature, he had to narrate in standard English; indeed a most eloquent standard English. Yet, one notices that Nabokov through Humbert took some delight in reproducing Lolita's authentic speech, her mid-twentieth century, New England, urban teenaged dialect.Finally, what makes Huckleberry Finn a great novel is its humor. Twain was a master of all sorts of humor. (He was a great public speaker and story teller.) The language of the novel itself is replete with \\"malapropisms, puns, misquotations, understatement, exaggeration, incongruities, illiteracies, and absurd spellings,\\" to quote from Benet's Reader's Encyclopedia of American Literature, p. 259--most done for comedic effect. Additionally, the yarns themselves, the \\"stretchers,\\" as Huck has it, are wondrous funny, and Huck's commonsensical take on life often contrasted humorously with what he actually saw and experienced.Here's one of my favorite passages from the book to illustrate the master's humorous style. The ragged \\"King\\" is about to divulge \\"the secret of\\" his \\"being\\" to the supposed Duke of Bridgewater and to Huck and Jim. He says, doing the \\"Duke\\" one better:\\"Bilgewater, I am the late Dauphin!\\"Huck writes, \\"You bet you Jim and me stared, this time. Then the duke says:'You are what?''Yes, my friend, it is too true--your eyes is lookin' at this very moment on the pore disappeared Dauphin, Looy the Seventeen, son of Looy the Sixteen and Marry Antonette.''You! At your age? No! You mean you're the late Charlemagne; you must be six or seven hundred years old, at the very least.''Trouble has done it, Bilgewater, trouble has done it; trouble has brung these gray hairs and this premature balditude. Yes, gentlemen, you see before you, in blue jeans and misery, the wanderin', exiled, trampled-on and sufferin' rightful King of France.'\\"It is the sheer density of Twain's artistry that most impresses me. I wish I had room to quote the rest of the page as Huck goes on to describe how they \\"majestying\\" him so that it \\"done him heaps of good.\\" There is so much on practically every page. I know of no other writer except Shakespeare who can reveal so much in so few words, and who could use words so creatively.This is a great novel and anyone who cares about American literature has read it or will."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"An absolute masterpiece. This book should be required reading for every American schoolboy and girl. An uproarious account of Huck and Jim's adventures as they travel by raft down the Mississippi river. Jim is a runaway slave, Huck the delinquent teenage child of an alcoholic father. Although outrageously funny, Twain's work is a scathing indictment of statutory slavery. Some will be offended by the casual use of the work \\"nigger\\", but at the time this story was written the term was in widespread usage. Incredible as it may seem, people of African descent were owned by their white masters in the same way as they might own livestock. In this context, saying that one owned five or six \\"niggers\\" would have drawn no more attention than stating the same of five or six chickens."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"This book proved to me its title of \\"Great American Classic\\" the first time I read it. It is an American story full of adventure, good laughs, and excellent social views. Combined with a tough, yet relevant writing style that is fun to read, this novel is very enjoyable. It starts off where Tom Sawyer's story left off, and moves quickly to the huge Mississippi River, where Huck teams with runaway slave Jim to escape his abusive father. As they ride their raft down the current, they encounter many challenges that steathily frame what America has dealt with as it grew as a country. Huck must overcome moral issues of slavery, lying, deception, his misunderstanding of religion, and the fact that his new best friend is black. Despite these challenges, Huck and Jim form an amazing friendship in which they would do anything for one another. Mark Twain keeps the story exciting by continuously giving Huck and Jim new adventures and problems they must deal with. Huck grows to have a greater sense of himself and ultimately must decide between following the norm, or helping the person who needs him the most."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"Huck escapes town and goes to a cabin and takes an axe and smashes the door down. He brought a pig with him. He took the pig back to the table and haked in his throat with the axe. Then he laid it on the ground to bleed. Then he pulled out some of his hair and blooded the axe good and threw the axe in the corner. Then he pulled out a bag full of rocks and puts the pig inside. He ran down the river and threw the pig into the river. Then he gets in his canoe and goes to Jackson's Island. Huck and Jim find a dead person in a boat. He had been shot and dead for two or three days. Huck meets Tom and then Jim gets locked up. So the boys come up with a plan that they think will work. Then they go talk to a man.

All American writing comes from that. There was nothing before. There has been nothing as good since.&#65533; When I first read this on the back of my book, I thought to myself, yeah right, this book is going to be the biggest snore fest, and that I&#65533;d be needing a dictionary to get through it. However, once I got into it, Ernest proved me wrong. I found the novel to be filled with just the right touch of humor that offered perspective into what life used to be like. I also felt that this novel was also a bit controversial with its dealing with such topics as racism, slavery, cruelty and injustice. Twain then balanced the controversy with the perfect dosages of friendship and loyalty. The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is a timeless classic, everyone should read this novel if given the opportunity."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is a novel written for enjoyment, the adventures that Huck has are somewhat comical and enjoyable for everyone. There is also a more serious side to the novel where Twain uses Huck to learn the evils of society that the story takes place in. Through Huck, Twain tells his opinion of slavery and shares his own moral values. Because this is a realistic book, Twain can convey his thoughts and morals to readers of every level, not just highly educated scholars. Using realism, Twain lets people know how he thinks and shows that people can change. Realism is utilized to allow all people to be able to relate and understand what is going on in the novel. I believe everyone at one point in their life should read this novel."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is the classic pre-Civil War tale of a young boy, Huck, and a runaway African-American slave named Jim. Huck leaves because of his abusive father, and Jim has escaped his owner to become a free man in the North. On their raft, swiftly traveling down the Mighty Mississippi, Huck and Jim come across many southern towns along the river, bringing them to meet many interesting characters, and many adventures.In this book, many southern dialects are used, and although it may be difficult to read at times, the overall effect created by it makes the story more lifelike. Being pre-Civil War, some of the language is outdated, and it may be difficult to read over some of the terms and ideas used and expressed, but the only reason for their use is to show Mark Twain's overall motive of the book that proves the negative effects of slavery in the United States.If you liked The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, you'll love this book, because of their similarities in background, and the fact that they share the same main characters. Both books are Twain's masterpieces, and should both be read by all generations, young, old, and still to come."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"Mark Twain's Huckleberry Finn is darker and more serious than Tom Sawyer, and also, I think, better. Many people, after reading Tom Sawyer, seem to think of Huck as Tom's little sidekick. This book shows that Huck is very much his own man. After hanging around on the streets for most of his life, Huck is adopted by the well-intentioned but way too overprotective Widow Douglas(needless to say, Huck is none too pleased with the widow's attempts to turn him into an upstanding citizen). Eventually, Huck is kidnapped by his own father, a drunk and negligent man. Huck escapes and joins up with Jim, a slave who escaped after overhearing that his owners were planning to sell him.As Jim and Huck float down the river, they have many adventures. Huck, who at first was very much against aiding Jim's escape, slowly comes to realize that slaves are people.Huck's comments about how Jim seems to be just like him or any other white person are not dumb or rascist, they are part of Huck's relearning, and breaking of the stereotypes he has grown up with.That is not to say this book is only an exploration of serious matters. It has Mark Twain's usual jokes and funny sequences, during which Huck fakes his own death, Huck and Jim cross-dress,Huck impersonates Tom and Tom impersonates Sid, and Huck and Jim rescue each other many, many times and become friends, something that Huck didn't think was possible."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"Civilry\\"The Old Southern Code\\"Organized SocietyAnd ReligionAll of these are cast down and demolished by America's greatest humorist ever Mark Twain. This book primarily follows the adventures of one Huckleverry Finn as he escapes his home, his father and reality on a raft floating down the Mississippi River. On these journeys he is in the company of Jim, a house slave who at first appears to be an ignorent slave. Then we find out that this guy has a wife and a family and that he also has his own personal demons to settle just like Huck. Jim can sometimes be a bit steriotypical but even that serves its purpose in the end. In the process they discover things about each other, Jim discovers that not all white people are bad, Huck discoverers that Black people aren't stupid and savage as has been taught to him since birth. This book is a perfect example of society(and Twain in particular) triyng to come to terms with himself in the latter half of the 19th century. All this is done in the vernacular and with great humor. It is a great bookNow, this book has taken a lot of heat over the last few years for a few words that some people have deemed offensive. Well yes I agree that the word is very offensive when taken in a negative contex, however that is not what Twain wanted to exhibit. Do not draw the conclusion that since the word is in the book that automatically makes Twain a racist. If you do your research you will see that Twain was probably the most non-racist person of his era. He only included the word because he wanted hwat people would have said to be as accurate as possible. This book should not be taken off of selves just because that one word of because of the way a certain character is portrayedOverall-Great book, the only thing I never liked was the last chapter, I mean what the heck?

The novel is set in the pre-civil war era of the south. Through the eyes of main character, Huck, the reader is able to see how Twain is satirizing this society. Characters such as Pa demonstrate the ignorant \\"white trash\\" in the society, and the widows Douglas and Stevens are examples of the Christian women in the society. Through Huck's thoughts, the reader is able to find the irony that Huck the \\"uncivilized\\" character in the book, may have the most civilized attitude and ideas of all the characters in the story. Twain uses Huck's friendship with Jim, the runaway slave, to deal with the issue of slavery and suggest that slavery is wrong. Twain's strong take on issues in the story are evident and create a powerful novel told in an innocent manner through the eyes of a boy."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"When I read The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn by Mark Twain in high school, it was possibly the first book I enjoyed that was assigned by a teacher. Twain's imagery puts the reader right beside Huck while he escapes &#65533;sivilization&#65533; and floats down the Mississippi river with his slave-gone-fugitive friend Jim. Huck&#65533;s innocent outlook on the world is both humorous and adorable. Huck&#65533;s respect for Jim is admirable. Even though Huck was brought up with Jim being a inferior slave, he still looks up to Jim. Also, I think that although Jim&#65533;s dialect adds to the effectiveness of the book, it is very difficult to understand. I think Twain writes it a little too much how the dialect sounds. I would recommend this book to anyone. It offers plenty of excitement and surprises."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"As a child I always dreamed of going on adventures to new places. In some ways these dreams were realized while reading this book. I was swept into Huck's life and became a part of his adventures throughout the story. For such a young boy, Huck has many experiences that most of us will only encounter in our dreams, and this is why the book is appealing to me and people of all ages. Everyone at one point or another in their lives has longed to go on an adventure, and this book satisfies that longing. Mark Twain is an amazing writer who is able to spur your imagination, because his choice of dialect and visuals make everything seem real. At times it was a little hard to understand what was going on when Jim (Miss Watson's slave) was talking because of his strong southern vernacular, but I know that if I was there I would have a hard time understanding what he was saying. This book grabbed my attention from the moment I picked it up. I read it for the first time in eleventh grade and now as a college freshman I was required to read it again. Unlike many books that I have had to read over the years, this book was not a chore, because I fell in love with the story all over again. I recommend this book for people of all ages. If you're just looking for a good book to read for yourself or maybe even to a child, I definitely recommend Huck Finn. Or, if you have to read it for school, give the book a chance, and you might just fall in love with it like I did."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"As you might have already known, &quot;The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn&quot; is one of Mark Twain's classics. It was written based on Mark Twain's best friend when he was a child. I have written a review on it because I think this book should not be forgotten.Huckleberry Finn is only fourteen when he runs away from his brutal father........Yet another one of Mark Twain's classics, Huckleberry Finn amazed me with its plot. On the previous book about Tom Sawyer, comes Huckleberry Finn; Tom's best friend.Young Huckleberry Finn was adopted by a widow and all was going quite well until the footsteps Huck saw on the snow...... The footsteps on the snow were in the way that his father always leaves behind. So, this means that Huck's cruel father has come back! The six thousand dollars Tom and Huck found in the previous book was safe in the bank but not anymore. Now that Huck's father is back, he wouldn't leave until he got the money.Huck's father has tried many ways to get Huck's money but fails every time. Soon, Huck's father captures Huck and locks him inside a wooden cabin in the woods. Huck's father now wanted both his son and his money.....Luckily, before long Huck plans an outstanding escape to Jackson Island and meets up with an old runaway slave; Jim. There, the two starts an amazing trip down the great Mississippi river. They're destination is freedom, Cairo; where Jim could be free. Unfortunately, while traveling on the river both of them meets many strangers and must outwit them to stay uncaught and alive.This book is highly recommended for those who thirst for excitement, action and adventures. The plot in this story is indescribable; it's full of breath-taking adventures and the way that Mark Twain could describe the feelings of a child is unbelievable.This book would be a perfect book back in the days Mark Twain wrote it; however, the slang in this book might be hard to follow for people nowadays. Even though that the slang he used might confuse us, the writing in this book is still excellent and would be recommended.Even though that I judge this a good book, I do feel that once in a while the book would suddenly skip from one adventure to the other. Overall, I do think that this book is worth reading and I would give this book; five &quot;Stars&quot;. (See the rating chart below for more details)If you compare Mark Twain's previous book; Tom Sawyer with Huckleberry Finn, I would say that Huckleberry Finn contains much more action, adventure and excitement. However, if you like more of psychology and more of a calmer plot, Tom Sawyer would be a better book for you. However, my final recommendation would be for you to read Huckleberry Finn as it is fit for the whole family to read and enjoy.If you have already read this book and liked it, I would also recommend you readingThe author of this book, Mark Twain was a famous writer and had many other jobs as well. Mark Twain was a very superstitious person since that he was born on the day that Halley's Comet was passing the earth and died when it returned. Mark Twain's actual name was Samuel Lang-Horne Clemens, he was born and raised in the state of Missouri. His father died when he was only twelve and so he left school to earn a living. He traveled around America as a journeyman printer. Later, Samuel went back to the Mississippi river to be a steamboat pilot. During the Civil War, steam boating was put to an end forcing Samuel to join the Confederate army. However, he soon extracted himself from it and became an extremely successful journalist.He was sent to the Mediterranean to do a series of articles after the war. This inspired him to be a writer and so he started to write books about his childhood which made him a fortune."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"This particular edition does not claim to be abridged, but in relation to the audiobook version available on Audible.Com, there is at least one &quot;adventure&quot; (story) missing from this edition of which I'm aware.

Not under any pressure to write a book report, you can enjoy this for what it is.I can imaging Mark Twain writing this book in long hand at his desk--the words flowing off his fountain pen.

He wants to have adventure, live his life to the fullest, and can't seem to stay in one place for too long. The strong ties of family that are shown in the people Huck encounters on his journey and are reflective of the American way of life as well. Along the way in his adventures he comes into contact with a runaway slave, Jim. Huck goes through moral struggles in this book, but decides that Jim is his good friend and that he can't turn him in. The power of friendship and the desire to be on his own propel Huck through his adventures along the Mississippi and he proves to himself that he just can't seem to be \\"sivilized.\\" This novel brings out the adventurer in all of us and proves that Americans just can't be held down without seeing what's out there in the great wild frontiers of our lives."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"If you haven't read Huck Finn in decades (possibly when it was assigned to you in junior high), pick it up again and be amazed. (If you've never read it before, pick it up and be thunderstruck.) Hemingway wasn't wrong when he said that all American literature came from this book. It was the first novel that truly captured one strain of American vernacular (actually, several), and the character of Huck is so quinetssentially American that you're bound to recognize all sorts of American literary first-person characters who have directly followed (Holden Caulfield and Augie March, just to name two). Forget the PC issue -- when you read fiction, judge words in their contexts, not by their politics beyond the page. If you're too young to do that, perhaps you're not ready for it anyway. I was force-fed Huck Finn at 14 and remembered it with only bitterness until I picked it up in my 30s and was amazed (see first sentence)."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"Want a book with an adventurous twist? Then Huckleberry Finn is the book for you. Not only is Huckleberry Finn an adventurous book, it is also can be comical and light, though the book has a grave meaning, showing the wrongs in society at the time in the late 19th century.The book The Adventures of Tom Sawyer precedes Huckleberry Finn, where in the beginning of Huckleberry Finn, Huck lives with the widow Douglas, though doesn't like the high class living, and frequently leaves to see his father, who's always drunk, or just hangs out in the woods. While in the woods, Huck meets Jim, a slave who escaped and needs to cross the Mississippi River to the freedom on the other side, in Illinois. Although this book portrays a serious meaning, it can also be funny and witty.I liked this book because it was witty and comical, though it had an important message at the same time. I really liked this book because of this, though the southern accent complicates the understanding of the book. Overall, I thought this book is definitely a classic and a must read for all age levels."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"This book is very funny, adventurous & creative.

A must read for any one looking for a fun read"},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn was one of the best books that I have read in a long time. The way the Huck lives his life is very interesting in ways that I can relate. Whether Huck is sneaking out of the house or talking to his best friends about big plans they have, it all makes sense to me. Mark Twain did an excelent job with all the characters and how they all have different problems at home or with some of their friends. He also shined in this book when he came up with all the ideas for the kids to get in trouble with, like starting a gang or running away and taking off down the river and getting caught up with con artists. In my opinion the best part of the book is right off the start when the Widow adopts Huck and tries to clean him up and get him to study and learn new things, and huck wants absolutely nothing to do with any of it. Then right when Huck gets to the point of losing it, he runs off until Tom tells him to come back so they can start their new robbery gang, which meant that Huck must return. When Huck returns the Widow Douglass' sister Miss Watson is living their now with Huck and the widow and the head servant Jim. Overall, I would have to say the this book was very well written and explained and I would have to give this book 4 out of 5 possible stars for my grade. So if you like funny books with some action in them, this book is for you."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn by Mark Twain, is dated back to the pre-civil war era. It is also classic American Literature. The story is about a boy named Huck, whose father is a drunk. Huck lives with a lady who wants to &#65533;sivilize him.&#65533; Eventually, his own father kidnaps him. He then escapes and joins up with Jim, a slave who escaped from Miss Watson. Jim did this after overhearing talk about him being sold. As Jim and Huck take on their journey and float down the river, they have many adventures. Huck, who did not want to help Jim escape at first, slowly realizes that slaves are people. Mark Twain jokes a lot and has funny sequences. This happens a lot during Huck&#65533;s faked death, and also when Huck and Jim cross-dress.Huck impersonates Tom and Tom impersonates Sid. Huck and Jim rescue each other a lot of times through out the story. This book has many plot twists to keep the reader busy while reading this adventure. The word \\"nigger\\" was just a way for Twain to make Jim&#65533;s world come to life. Some people think the usage of this word is crude and racist, but it is requirement while reading this book. It is also used to find out why this book is against slavery so much. Mark Twain also gave each character their own style of speech to fit their individuality and intelligence. Twain uses this voyage of Jim and Huck to emphasize some of his themes and morals that he wanted to teach the readers. Such morals are that of racism and slavery when Huck turns on Jim. Huck lies and cons, which is shown through the characters of Duke and Dauphin. You are sure to like this book if you like pre-civil war era books."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is the classic pre-Civil War tale of a young boy, Huck, and a runaway African-American slave named Jim. Huck leaves because of his abusive father, and Jim has escaped his owner to become a free man in the North. On their raft, swiftly traveling down the Mighty Mississippi, Huck and Jim come across many southern towns along the river, bringing them to meet many interesting characters, and many adventures.In this book, many southern dialects are used, and although it may be difficult to read at times, the overall effect created by it makes the story more lifelike. Being pre-Civil War, some of the language is outdated, and it may be difficult to read over some of the terms and ideas used and expressed, but the only reason for their use is to show Mark Twain's overall motive of the book that proves the negative effects of slavery in the United States.If you liked The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, you'll love this book, because of their similarities in background, and the fact that they share the same main characters. Both books are Twain's masterpieces, and should both be read by all generations, young, old, and still to come."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"Despite the fact that The Adventure of Huckleberry Finn has been the subject of conflict and controversy since its publication over a century ago, it has remained a favorite for a wide range of audiences. Between the rollicking humor and a series of outrageously unexpected adventures, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn could be categorized as a Dennis the Menace style epic. Mark Twain uses local dialects and detailed descriptions to recreate each of Huck's extraordinary experiences. However, beneath the quaint language and good humor that characterize small town life in antebellum Mississippi, Mark Twain reveals the horrors of the slave trade. The book has been banned in a number of schools and libraries on account of Twain's straightforward treatment of such a delicate topic. Huck's growth and development throughout the novel lead him to reject the culturally predominant attitude toward slaves and he eventually embraces Jim not only as person but also as a friend. Though the words Twain uses to refer to slaves are offensive, his portrayal of the deepening relationship between Huck and Jim is a harsh critique of the attitudes and practices of the slaveholding class. Whether it is read as a purely entertaining tale of juvenile mischief or a biting criticism of slavery, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn will continue to excite and inspire audiences for decades to come."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"I would recommend this book to 15 year olds and up or if you have a good vocabulary.

Through the careful construction of the two main characters Huck and Jim, Twain explores the questionable moral values and hypocrisy of society. Against all odds Huck and Jim form an honest relationship that rises above race, slavery, and southern society. Twain's story is told through the voice of boy who has not yet been \\"sivilized\\" by society, and is still able to live outside of convention. This novel combines the strong language that Twain has been remembered for, and a message that is as relevant today as it was in the early nineteen hundreds.

Mark Twain does an outstanding job in constructing the sequence of events in this book. The adventures that Huck encounters happens almost immediately after the preceding adventure. This type of plot allows the reader to stay interested in the feelings and trials that the characters had to endure. Mark Twain also related situatins that were currnet in his time and applied them to this book.

It's also a book that continues to be both entertaining and controversial (two qualities that not all &quot;classics&quot; have). I must admit: as much as I admire and am enriched by this novel, I also find its final chapters to be not wholly satisfying.Twain is brilliant in that the heroes of this book, set in the pre-Civil War American South, are two of the most marginalized members of that society: Huck, a poor white boy whose single parent is an abusive alcoholic father; and Jim, an escaped African-American slave. Their relationship is beautifully written; Twain's vision of an interracial friendship is a significant milestone in U.S. literature, and is comparable to such relationships in Cooper's &quot;Last of the Mohicans&quot; and Melville's &quot;Moby Dick.&quot; Twain depicts Jim as a master of African-American folk traditions.Twain evokes the vernacular speech of the American south; this literary technique has been continued by generations of U.S. writers, both black and white. Twain's merry riffs on Shakespeare are also worthy of note. I also continue to be fascinated by Twain's analysis of the twisted interrelationship among racism, institutional Christianity, and oppressive biblical interpretation.In my opinion, the novel's weak link is the plot material revolving around Huck's pal Tom Sawyer. Tom is a wonderful character, but his antics seem out of place in the structure of the narrative, and ultimately cheapen the arc of the story. Despite its problematic aspects, however, &quot;Huckleberry Finn&quot; is one of the truly indispensable classics of the American canon. It is a crucial junction in a literary tapestry that immediately encompasses such works as &quot;Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass,&quot; Alice Walker's &quot;The Color Purple,&quot; and many other great books. If you haven't yet read Huck Finn, put aside any preconceptions you might have and discover the book for yourself; if you've already read it, read it again."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is a really interesting book about a boy and his adventures. The main character, Huck, narrates it. This gives it a certain amount of intimacy that it would not otherwise have. One of the things I found most interesting about this book is that Huck befriends a slave, Jim and helps him escape to freedom. This presents a large moral dilemma for him, because he does not want to be considered an abolitionist, but Jim is his friend. In the end he decides to help Jim and they raft down the Mississippi together. The description of their friendship is the best description I have ever read. Another aspect of the book that makes it all the more interesting to read is the colorful characters they meet along the way. Mark Twain has an incredible imagination and you then find yourself becoming attached to the characters as you move through the book. This is one of Mark Twain's greatest strengths. In the end I would recommend this book to readers of all ages because I think someone of any age could get something from it. Whether you read The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn as a means of entertainment, to gain a life lesson, or to understand the social pressure associated with befriending a black man prior to the Civil War, you will definitely be able to gain something from reading this novel."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"This book is about a teenage boy name, Huckleberry Finn.

Surely one of the best known and most readily acknowledged American classics, there is more to this book than all the tame discriptions and virulent hate mail imply. It is a rather bleak, desolate tail about two people running away from the world. The only problem is, they have no where to go. Let's ignore the so-called contoversy surrounding this book. It is idiotic, as nowhere in this book is it implied that the racist attitudes of some of the characters is a good thing. Twain was a master of dialect and speech patterns and this was, ultimately, a story about the evils of slavery and the hopelessness of many who tried to run away. Huck grows to truly love Jim. In the end, he is his only friend, the only person he trusts, the only person who has ever been good to him. Cherished characters like Tom Sawyer are distorted into manifest destiny oriented monsters, politicians of the day always trying to trick people and bend them into their will for a laugh or a selfish end. Yet Huck remains a conscientous person, seeing the evils of slavery, the cruelty of Tom's behavior, the ills of the world, the pointlessness of what his own life has thus far amounted to. A word can be used with many meanings. The controversy of this book, raging since its publication, is based solely on the USE of this word, not its context, not its implications within the narrative. This book is one of the most savage indictments of institutional racism one could ever hope to come across, yet people who refuse to read it out of fear of getting their feelings hurt or their political agendas ruffled, are missing out on this point. Twain suffered through this book. He set it aside for several years after a certain point, not knowing how to end it, getting more and more unhappy with the state of the Reconsruction. There is a rather bleak punch-line at the end of the book. Huck still wants to live his brief happiness w! ith Jim, run away again to escape society's expectations of how people are supposed to be. He thinks about &quot;light(ing) out for the territory ahead of the rest&quot;. Twain knew, by the time he wrote the book, the territory was no more, already plundered by the government and the corporate interests. Huck's next journey would be just as pointless, just as ultimately meaningless as this river ride down the Ole Miss."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"I have probably read this book 10 times, but this time was different. i'm older and can easier appreciate the social commentary twain made than i could when i was a child.This book is a classic, and if you haven't read it, you should."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"This novel is mainly based on a character named Tom Sawyer, who is living in St. Petersburg, after two decades before the Civil War.

I read this book and loved it. I think this book shows a friendship between a black slave and a white boy during a time when that was considered an unusual thing.This book takes place during a time when blacks were not treated equal. Blacks were thought of as property not as humans. An example of this takes place in the down town slave market.&#65533; Cheap niggers, get your cheap niggers,&#65533; a slave driver called out from on top of the stage. Families are being separated and children are crying while they are standing in shackles and cuffs. This is hatred.In this book, there is a lot of action. Every time you turn the page somebody is getting into trouble. It even goes as far as to put on a play to rip people off.&#65533; Come see the Play of Nonsense, the best in the world,&#65533; the duke yelled to the listeners. The duke and so called king are going to put on a play. Their idea is to rip people off and run with their money. It is a smart idea but later on they pay for it. The next night the play starts. Hundreds of people walk in and hand their money to the duke. Right when the play starts, the duke comes out and announces that there have been some misunderstandings and rushes off withthe money he collected from the audience. This book&#65533;s plot is awesome.In this story the main characters are laid back and have a great sense of humor. An example this happens when Huck and Jim, a runaway slave, are rafting down the huge river. Jim is in great danger, but they always have time to play tricks on other people.Also, there is a lot of dirty tricks and cheating. All four characters have a good sense of humor and a mind that is made to get into trouble. An example of this takes place when Huck fakes his own death and fools everybody while he lives on a raft for two years. He left his Aunt Polly behind to mourn about him and fooled everybody else. For a while he stayed on a little island but then decided to raft down a river. He made his own camps and caught his own food. All this to him was a fun vacation. He loved it!In conclusion, this book is awesome! My four beliefs are: there is a hatred toward blacks in this story; the plot is filled with all kinds of action; the characters are happy, laid back, and have a great humor; and there is a lot of bad trick playing and a whole bunch of cheating in this story. I think Twain was trying to show us an ideal example of friendship."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"I am very happy with PlumCircle, LLC.

Get ready for an adventure and have fun, fun, fun!Davis Aujourd'hui, author"},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is a novel by Mark Twain, originally published in 1884. It is the sequel to The Adventures of Tom Sawyer. Ernest Hemingway (and many others) called it the greatest American novel ever. Huck Finn picks up right where Tom Sawyer left off - Huck's abusive father appears to lay claim to Huck's fortune, so Huck fakes his own death and goes down the Mississippi River with Jim, the escaped slave.Much like Tom Sawyer, there's not a lot of plot going on here most of the time, and that's okay, because Twain's writing is extremely entertaining. Twain has a good old time mocking social conventions, and the novel is gripping almost all the way through. Hemingway was right: the end of Huck Finn is poor. After Jim is abducted and Tom Sawyer reappears, things just get silly, not to mention highly convenient (And Tom Sawyer here is just as immature as he ever was, reinforcing that no real maturation occurred in Tom Sawyer, and that that book really isn't a coming-of-age story in the truest sense).Twain has made Huck the narrator. On the whole, this works, although it gets tiresome to read Huck's dialect sometimes. Twain-as-narrator is definitely missed here. Nobody could write a clever sentence like Twain, and most of that is lost here, although occasionally Huck will turn one (and by doing so break character, but that's the price you pay).Huck Finn has been exceedingly controversial because of the extensive use of the n-word. So is the novel racist? Certainly the characters have the racism of the day ingrained in them - in that sense, it is racist.

It is the sequel to The Adventures of Tom Sawyer. Ernest Hemingway (and many others) called it the greatest American novel ever. Huck Finn picks up right where Tom Sawyer left off - Huck's abusive father appears to lay claim to Huck's fortune, so Huck fakes his own death and goes down the Mississippi River with Jim, the escaped slave.Much like Tom Sawyer, there's not a lot of plot going on here most of the time, and that's okay, because Twain's writing is extremely entertaining. Twain has a good old time mocking social conventions, and the novel is gripping almost all the way through. Hemingway was right: the end of Huck Finn is poor. After Jim is abducted and Tom Sawyer reappears, things just get silly, not to mention highly convenient (And Tom Sawyer here is just as immature as he ever was, reinforcing that no real maturation occurred in Tom Sawyer, and that that book really isn't a coming-of-age story in the truest sense).Twain has made Huck the narrator. On the whole, this works, although it gets tiresome to read Huck's dialect sometimes. Twain-as-narrator is definitely missed here. Nobody could write a clever sentence like Twain, and most of that is lost here, although occasionally Huck will turn one (and by doing so break character, but that's the price you pay).Huck Finn has been exceedingly controversial because of the extensive use of the n-word. So is the novel racist? Certainly the characters have the racism of the day ingrained in them - in that sense, it is racist. But more important to most people is whether Twain was racist; that is, whether he put his own personal racism in the book. That is harder to determine, especially since Twain has made Huck the narrator. Perhaps the fairest thing to say is that Twain was genuinely criticizing racism, but the way in which he portrayed Jim and the other characters contains some residual racism of its own.So is Huck Finn America's greatest novel? Well, maybe not.

They lived off very well without him; Huck went to school, learned to read and write and was overall happy. Then out of nowhere Huck's father returned and took Huck away. His father was a drunk and treated Huck very badly, and he had to get out. Huck faked his own death and was ready to leave his life behind in order to start over. He builds a canoe and paddled to the island on the other side of the river. There he found Jim a run away slave. They became friends and traveled up north to get a new life for Huck and freedom for Jim. Huck and Jim traveled at night on the raft and slept and hid during the day. Along the way they met up with frauds and learned many things good and bad from them. The frauds were convinced they were royalties, even though they know it wasn't true. After they stole a large amount of money from very good people Huck and Jim knew they should not associate them. They were final caught but then got away and met up with Jim and Huck down the river. From there to make some more money one of the frauds they took Jim and sold him back into slavery. Huck was furious because he had befriended Jim and saw him as a regular person, not as a slave. He went to the home where Jim was being held and had a plan for escape. While he was there Huck met up with an old friend of his Tom Sawyer. Together they came up with a plan to free Jim. Does this plan work for them? Or does it backfire in their faces? To find out read the Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.This was a good book, it covered an abundant amount of topics that interest me. Some quotes that give the book a good feel as are follows, also these quotes gives you some sort of inside look to the book.\\"The Widow Douglas she took me for her son, and allowed she would sivilize me; but it was rough living in the house all the time, considering how dismal regular and decent the widow was in all her ways; and so when I couldn't stand it no longer I lit out. I got into my old rags and my sugar-hogshead again, and was free and satisfied. But Tom Sawyer he hunted me up and said he was going to start a band of robbers, and I might join if I would go back to the widow and be respectable. So I went back.\\" This was Huck talking about this first family.\\"It was a close place. I took . . . up [the letter I'd written to Miss Watson], and held it in my hand. I was a-trembling, because I'd got to decide, forever, betwixt two things, and I knowed it. I studied a minute, sort of holding my breath, and then says to myself: \\"All right then, I'll go to hell\\"-and tore it up. It was awful thoughts and awful words, but they was said. And I let them stay said; and never thought no more about reforming.\\" This was Huck thinking about his friendship with Jim and whether he was doing the right thing or not.These quotes can give a feel for what the book is about and an idea if you would like some of the thing that are discussed in the book.I would recommend this book to a large group of different people. It contains a lot of material that will appeal to many different people making it easy for more people to enjoy it. It has everything from adventure, human suffering, family problems, to robbers and much more. If you are interested in a particular topic it is probably discussed in this book."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"Whoever wrote the review titled &#34;where theres a will theres a way&#34; got a couple of things wrong in his review of the book The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.First of all the book doesnt say that Tom was really close to his aunt Polly.He cares for her but usually doesnt show it.

This was for the student who would have trouble reading on his on or for the class to listen to certain parts of the book read to them."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"I can't say more on the plot because it's quite obvious what the plot is just from illustrations of the novel. But on the \\"controversial\\" aspect of the novel involving the excessive use of the N word, people have to think of the time period that Twain is writing about and when the novel was published.The novel takes place in Missouri (a slave border state) in the 1830s. We use the term African-American or black now. Before that it was Afro-Americans, coloreds, Negr--s. The list goes on and on. The overall attitude was that as the terms changed the previous one was seen as more offensive than the progressive current one. Yes, that meant there was a time when the word \\"colored\\" was used by people who considered themselves progressive in terms of racial attitudes. But in the Antebellum South the use of the N word was thrown around quite easily. And persons added positive as well as negative adjectives to it. It's strange to imagine that. We today only think of it in a totally negative way. But even when Twain published the novel in the 1880s the word was unfortunately not yet out of fashion.Also consider the way Twain writes of Jim, the runaway slave. While the knee-jerk reaction is that Jim is a total vaudevillian caricature of what the perception was of blacks in the Antebellum South, his relationship with Huck Finn was something to be viewed as progressive. Remember that a decade before the novel came out; Reconstruction was over and left things a mess in terms of race relations. There was a lot of bitterness in the South over the Civil War (probably the most destructive war at the time until WWI), and a whole generation of southern white men took it personally when they were expected to be on the same level in terms of voting rights and other things with men that was formerly human property. For us today \\"all men are created equal\\" is a statement of truth provided we all have a level playing field. But for many southern whites at the time this was hard to swallow. In an aristocratic agrarian society, some men are just superior to others. And in the Antebellum South, just below poor whites were blacks. This was the way things were in their society for over two hundred years and the Civil War didn't suddenly end that sentiment among the many. But for Twain to write of a kind of comradeship between a slave and a young white boy was definitely progressive.Maybe Twain was hoping to reach a young generation raised by their bitter parents and discover that they could have friendships with blacks and not succumb to an entrenching separatist animosity that developed into the Jim Crow Era. Huck and Jim work together in schemes and have fun. This friendship (which is why Huck decides to do what he does on the journey) is what Twain emphasized in the journey down river. This was counter to the way whites were acting with and around blacks at the time (1880s).I think it's clear based on a certain reading of the novel that Twain believed whites and blacks could and should get along. While today it may not be seen as \\"progressive\\", it was when it was first published."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"Everyone should read or re-read this classic. Most of us read it in school, probabaly not in its entirety. Schools struggled then and now with the use of the N word, although teenage boys in the 1830's clearly would never have heard a synonym.These adventures are a classic. The royals were a hoot, how many failed fraudulent enterprises could they invent before the inevitable tar and feathering. Huck and Jim are on the run from an abusive father and the law, respectively, and Twain shows all people have a great deal in common, in spite of theories prevalent in the antebellum era.I'm not sure why Tom Sawyer needs to show up to conclude this thing. The ending could work without him, maybe Twain not sure that Finn could carry the book or film alone."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"Huckleberry Finn is a classic. Simple as that. It provides a look into what life was probably like for a 19th century boy. It was different than the life of children today, because today life centers around education. Back then, it was a regular thing to play hooky, even though they got in trouble for it when they were caught. And when they were punished, usually it was with a beating instead of \`You're Grounded!'.The book shows us how badly slaves were treated. They weren't even considered humans! It was like they didn't have feelings, and didn't see things the same way white people did. They way the slaves actually did think was odd. It was sad to see that they could slap a slave for no reason, and the slave would accept it either because they were used to it or they thought that whites were better than them.Huck Finn is rather unrealistic in the aspect of adventure. I'm guessing most boys back then didn't run off with an escaped slave to Cairo. The way that Mark Twain wrote the book was different than other first/second person books I've seen. The dialogue was very much like the 19th century southern Mississippi talk. Sometimes it got hard to decipher what a paragraph in slave-speak meant because it was so obscure.All in all, Mark Twain's writing style is different than the traditional Southern book, but that doesn't detract at all from the story. I liked it!"},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"Wonderful book. Everybody should read it. Mark Twain is a genius. I don't care at what age you read this book whether a child or studying it in college you should read it. Read it for the story line, the literary technique and the deeper meaning."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"It has been said that all American literature begins with The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. Reading this book for the first time was a delight. Though I was thoroughly familiar with most of the story, I still found the book to be a page turner. The character of Huck, the manchild, has to be one of the most fascinating in all of literature."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"Mark Twain's The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn was a great piece of satire, that is, all the parts I understood. This book is incredibly difficult to understand. For those of us that are literary scholars, feel free to purchase and dig away at the complex plot that at times seemed to go absolutely nowhere. Be prepared, because this story is not as fast paced and exciting as Tom Sawyer. Unlike Tom, this is an adult book that wrestles with themes of prejudice and severe elitism that plagued the antebellum south and was Mark Twain's response to the lynchings and other cruel acts committed against African Americans. So while it deals with serious issues concerning Americans even to this day, it contains half the excitement. If you're going to buy this book, devote every iota of your concentration power to it. The seemingly pointless tangents in the plot ultimately come back to enforce Twain's more important themes. The plot focuses on Huck's desire to escape civilization and eventually is accompanied by Jim, the runaway slave accused of murder. Jim has been the subject of intense controversy. I was completely turned off by his representation as a complete idiot who completely depended on his white master. Some may argue that it was in the best interest of the slave to appear ignorant so their masters would never grow suspicious of them. Yet considering that Twain once owned slaves and was a southerner himself, I have my doubts. I guess that's part of the enjoyment provided in the novel; we'll never be completely sure what Twain thought of blacks and social equality. Modern readers beware of the n-word, as it is used quite frequently. But also pay attention to the way Twain criticizes the south's complete support for slavery when in fact it was an institution that hurt the majority of southerners. I recommend the book, but devote a lot of time to it."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"This is my first time reading a Mark Twain classic, but it will not be my last! This book was an adventure all the way through. Like when Finn ran from his dad. I found it to be on of the most was awesome sections of the book, in my opinion, because it is like most kid think about it but he really had the guts to do it.I think Huck is just scared to be a civilized citizen not that he can't be, he just doesn't chose to be like the rest of the world or the rest of the people around him.Overall, I believe the reason that I liked this book so much was because I felt as though Twain was Huckleberry and I was a character in the book the whole time I was reading it. If you want a wonderful book to read then pick up Mark Twain's Huckelberry Finn."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"Mark Twain is one of the world's greatest literary figures. He's taken the simple story of a young man and a runaway slave escaping their respective lives for greener pastures and has turned it into a tale of adventure, humor, and social commentary. This story has been argued over from the first day that it was published. Of course, today most people who attack or criticize this book focus on the use of the word \\"nigger\\" throughout the book. If these people could actually get beyond their own hypocrisy, they would see that Twain takes Huck out of an abusive atmosphere with his drunken, no-good father, and places him into the loving hands of one of the most caring characters in literary history, ol' Jim.Jim essentially becomes a father to Huck Finn. He loves the boy with all of his heart and often mentions to him that he can't get over the fact that Huck is trying to help him get to freedom. Sure, Jim might be rather superstitious and not the most intelligent of men, but it's in his heart where his true strength lies. Keep in mind that Jim is a runaway slave in this story. Slaves weren't given much time to read, write, socialize, or do pretty much anything to further their intelligence along, so it should be understood that Jim isn't a very intelligent man as far as booksmarts go. However, Jim knows his way around the river and uses his common sense to try and make Huck do the right thing.Huck refers to Jim as \\"nigger\\" throughout the story, as well as all of the other slaves in the book. Remember that this story takes place in a time when that particular word was used to address blacks. Does that make the word okay to use? No, but it was the word used in Huck's time. Get beyond that word, and you'll see that Huck loves Jim perhaps more than anyone else in the world. Jim is Huck's friend and mentor and either of them would die for the other. Ironically, rappers and hip-hop performers of today use the \\"n\\" word almost as a badge of honor at once and then as a derogatory term, whereas Huck simply called Jim that word because that's what he was raised to believe.Few books have caused so much controversy as \\"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,\\" but the book itself isn't controversial, it's the idiots who can't look beyond their own noses who've made it what it is today, and I have to thank them for it. Why? Because as soon as you label something wrong or forbidden, human nature makes a person want that something even more. Tell a teen that they can't have beer if you don't believe me. Please \\"enlightened\\" individuals, keep banning books like \\"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,\\" films like \\"Song of the South\\" and the Bible, you're only destroying your own cause."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"Since the first day that \\"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\\" was published, it has been denounced with racial controversies. When released to the public, it was banned by different committees, stating the book to be racist and rude.The way Twain uses the racial term \\"nigger\\" in Huckleberry Finn, is read with offense to some people. In my opinion, reading the story with terms offensive like \\"nigger\\", made the book more realistic. The book is supposed to make people feel as if they are experiencing the times of Hucklebeerry Finn.In chapter 34, the quote \\"Tom told me what his plan was, and I see in a minute it was worth fifteen of mine for style, and would make Jim just as free a man as mine would, and maybe get us all killed besides. So I was satisfied, and said we would waltz in on it\\", implies that Tom still sees Jim's worth as less than his own. When Huck accepts Tom's plan, it surprised me and made me realize that even though Huck beliefs have matured, he still has alot to learn about racial equalities.I vigorously support Mark Twain for the message he was trying to communicate to his readers, through the book \\"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\\"."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn has been argued as a racial controversy since the first day it was published. Shortly after it was accessible to the public, multiple committees banned the book, proclaiming it to be racist and \\"trash\\". To this day, Mark Twain's Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is banned in several school districts.In my personal copy of the Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, there is a helpful and informative introduction and notes throughout the text written by Robert O'Meally. He clearly states that the intent of Twain's word usage is needed in order to properly and vividly describe the setting and tone of the book. His usage of the racial slur \\"nigger\\" can be seen as offensive, but I believe it was necessary for it to be realistic. The dialogue that Huckleberry uses throughout the book stays very true to his character, time, and place, at which the slur was used casually.Besides the usage of the word \\"nigger\\", characters in the book often loudly express their racist mentality. In the begining of Chapter 14, Huck and Jim are talking about all sorts of topics, both of them speaking their mind. Twain describes Huck's thoughts: \\"Well, he was right; he was most always right; he had an uncommon level head, for a nigger.\\" Obviously some would perceive this to be intolerable and crude, yet I believe that Twain is simply describing the way Huck thinks of Jim. The growing friendship between Huck and Jim is the basis of the entire novel. The book depicts the way Huck feels and thinks about several ideas and concepts about life, the way he feels about his friend must be present and elaborate.I strongly support Mark Twain's the Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. The book wins people over with it 's dialogue, plot, originality, and capability to express a realistic story that takes place in a racist and unjust America."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn by Mark Twain is a wonderful novel that is adventurous, humorous, and fun.

He recently made a large fortune. Because of this Huck is confined by schooling, shoes, and ,worst of all, manners. Huck had enough of this so he runs away. His small town assumes that he is dead, so he enjoy's the life on Jackson's island. When Jim, an escaped slave, runs away to the island.

Yes, it's a classic. Twain in his introduction says it best, (paraphrasing) anyone attempting to find rhyme, reason, or a moral to this story will be shot. Well, two out of three ain't bad. The story hopscotches through a series of sharply drawn minis and vividly realized characters. The moral - Huck coming to accept the slave Jim's humanity and protecting him against his socially conditioned \\"better judgement\\" - is blunted by a meandering and needlessly cruel plot to \\"save\\" Jim concocted by Tom Sawyer toward the end of the novel.But how fresh and envigorating this novel must have been when it appeared, a truly American voice expressed for the first time. In true American fashion, it's style became much copied, softened, and cheapened over time (think The Andy Griffith Show some 90 years later) that it's easy to overlook how remarkable achievement it was.

He tells the truth about what was going on a long time ago during the time of slavery. This book is anti-slavery because if you really understand Twain's point of view, he wrote this book so that many people would accept each other as equal. The young boy in the book did the unthinkable by becoming a friend with a poor slave. In the book only two people were innocent and the majority of them were lynchers, robbers, murderers,and thieves. Huck and Jim have a great sense of human diginity and sympathy. They fight for their freedom and finally got out of the mess that they were in.This book is one of the American masterpieces.

Without the introduction, The book would have received the five stars it deserves."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"I had previously only read this novel in a translated version (Norwegian), and after reading it in \\"proper English\\" I am quite amazed about what gets lost in translation... Among the major strengths of this adventure tale is its language, which, I must admit, also made it quite strenuous to read at times. I often had to read out loud various passages in order to understand them. In retrospect, just for this very reason, this might have been a good book to listen to on tape to fully appreciate the proper pronounciations.This classic coming-of-age story is quite good, and the characters stay with you long after the book is finished. I especially enjoyed all the delightful superstitions that Twain weaves into his characters - among the black folks as well as the white. Also, the tender relationship between Huck and Jim is delightful reading.As a sidenote, the version I was reading did not have a map and I quickly came to miss the ability to visualize the locations that were described along the Mississippi. I eventually found a different copy of the book (an abridged version, nonetheless - ugh!) which had a map that clearly showed all the action. Afterwards, I had a much better appreciation for the geographical nuances...I am glad this is a required high school text - its themes are still highly relevant, and it has the potential to start great debates about race relations - then as well as now. I almost wish that I could have read it as part of a class. This is the kind of literature (kind of like Shakespeare) that I would be able to appreciate even more if I could pause at regular intervals with some class-room discussion. However, even if you are battling it alone, it is well worth the effort.Recommended!"},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"Huckleberry Finn is a classic piece of American literature.

The various moral issues that influence the story are often ignored while the masses focus their energies on the well-known issue of slavery.I firmly believe that one cannot fully appreciate this novel without acknowledging how much child abuse influences this story. Huck wouldn't have been living with the Widow Douglas in the first place if his father were not an abusive alcoholic who neglected and abandoned his son. When Pap returned to \\"claim\\" his son, who he views as his property, the town doctor makes a half-hearted effort to protect Huck's fortune. However, none can stop Huck's father from kidnapping his son and dragging him to an abandoned cabin in the woods. Huck secretly enjoys not having to deal with the restrictive rules of society that he had to live by at the Widow's house. However, he soon tires of the ritualistic beatings that occur more and more frequently. Huck fakes his own death, and takes off to a small, uninhabited island. Jim, an escaped slave, and Huck travel on the Mississippi River and take turns protecting each other from the dangers of the world. Jim is eventually freed after narrowly avoiding death by a lynch mob. In all respects, Jim is more of Huck's father than Pap ever was.This story remains a classic novel that nearly all readers can relate to. Each generation has its own moral issues to address.

A MUST READ!Also recommended: THE LOSERS' CLUB by Richard Perez"},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"Mark Twain has done a spetacullar job creating the character of Huck Finn. Huckleberry Finn is developed into a wonderful character, and the book is full of many elements of high drama, starting with Huck's escape from his wicked father, and going on to a series of adventures with the runaway slave named Jim. Along the way, he meets an assortment of memorable characters, including a murderous feuding family and a couple of con men. He even gets to meet up again with his old friend, Tom Sawyer. All of these characters have a lesson to teach or a moral to show the reader. You won't realize it though, which is one of the main reasons the story still remains enjoyable.This book has a long history of being banned in schools because of its depiction of Jim, as well as the liberal use of the \\"n\\" word that will always make my skin crawl, to describe African Americans. However, reading of the book will quickly show you that the author had a deep rooted dislike for slavery and the treatment of African-Anericans during his lifetime. Why else would the character Jim keep his dignity throughout while the white men are shown as cruel and or foolish? The character of Jim also shows that he has a big heart and the reader cannot help but want his story to end well. Jim is only one of the characters that I mentioned earlier that will teach the reader without the reader being aware.I loved this book much to my surprise and found it very hard to put it down. If a person reads nothing else in life but one or two books, this should be one of them."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn was a fun book to read.

Because of this it made it hard for me to get into the book. All in all I think this was a great book to read and give it 4 stars."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"Mark Twain's seminal novel is a fine tale of high adventure, calamity, and profitable chatter. Gives you a good sense to recall your moments as a youngster, and jump right into a sense-making kids head.Huck Finn, abused by his pop and dog-tired of being \\"sivilized\\" by his Aunt, decides to pick his feet up and thrust out on the Mississippi for adventure. Faking his own death, to prevent his pop and other folk from giving him a good chasin', Huck hops aboard a raft and sets himself free.Jim, a slave Huck knows, takes to running from his owner. Eventually Huck and Jim decide to travel together (even though Huck suffers from pangs of conscience that explain that things like aiding a runaway slave are a clear path straight to hell) and head straight for Orleans--the place where Jim can claim his freedom, it not being a slave owning area.Along the way, Huck and Jim have a might good time finding heaps of adventure. This includes a Duke, not really a Duke at all, and a King, who is also not much of a real King, who are bonafide rapscallions set on defrauding the world of all of their possessions.All the while, Huck and Jim manage just fine, with an eventual ending that is happier than most.The book is as ironic as its author, and as subtly humorous and satirical of religion, 'society', being well-bred, and so on, as you could expect and hope for.Huck just can't understand what all the fuss is about with respect to things like religion, for instance. His view is that it wouldn't profit him to go to heaven anyway if folk like his Aunt were there to bother him. All the hoopla seems plain old misplaced.The contrast to this is Huck and Jim's devout belief in what the rest of us would consider naked superstition. All manner of things portend of bad luck in the novel. From touching a snakeskin to spilling salt to looking over your left shoulder at the moon, the whole lot of it is marked with the certainty of future ills.These superstitions seem to make a lot of sense to Huck who concludes that Jim must know quite a bit about such things. Each prophesy is, of course, fully revealed--being ambiguous enough to stick a cow through.\\"Bad luck\\" will be the consequence--of what sort and what kind they never say. Which is why such beliefs tend to last. Anything ambiguous enough can be read into, and confirmed.Thus being bit by a rattlesnake is what you get for touching a snakeskin. And having a hairy chest will certainly result in being wealthy--especially when wealth is defined broadly to cover both actual wealth, and relative wealth and, one supposes, emotional or spiritual wealth.Both Jim and Huck, however, hold it up as truth unconfounded and of the highest certainty. The comparison here to religion seems, in my eyes, to be somewhat obvious. The convictions of a Christian being compared to those of a superstitious and child-like lot.To Huck, the things that make a mountain of sense are a paradigm the rest of us easily sink into. The language, a crippled Southern dialect from back in the day, is addictive enough to irritate the people you are close to (just ask Ollivia, my girlfriend, what she thinks of my drawl and she'll tell ya she ain't glad about it one bit, I reckon).In conclusion, the book is a fine tale. A thread and yarn worthy of the praise and reputation heaped on it by others."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"Huckleberry Finn is an American classic. I'm sure you have heard this a thousand times but I took it upon myself to find out the truth behind this statement. In my readings I found that the term classic was nearly an understatement. In this brilliant piece by Mark Twain you find young Huckleberry Finn and his Companion Jim being a little more then mischievous. They find their way traveling down the Mississippi by raft. They travel mostly by night, trying to avoid being caught. However they manage to find themselves in many troublesome situations.I really liked this book for a few reasons. One I feel like I can relate to Finn in my childhood, although I didn't have the family problems at home I was very adventurous and curious of the world around me. Second the way that Twain uses the interesting world view of Finn to tell the story makes it not only easy to follow but adds humor to the story at the same time.I would recommend this book to anyone who likes adventures, humor or just likes to read for that matter."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"If at some point in your life you haven't read this book then you must have come from another planet. I've personally read it as both a child, a teen & as an adult and it still has lost none of it's punch. The witty narration of Huck and Jim's adventures are truly a timeless tale. Twain is not only making fun of Huck and himself, but also the reader. After all, how many 12 year old boys in literature have captured the imaginations of so many worldwide over a span of more than one hundred years...? The charges by some libraries and school districts over the years of racism is itself ludicrous and narrow-minded. Twain is merely using the dialect and voice of his times rather than making harsh judgements about blacks. None of his other works come anywhere close to the scope and entertainment value of this one, but we as readers are fortunate to have it. Huck and Jim's journey down the mighty Mississippi river is no less than a metaphor for the journey of the U.S., it's changing culture, and it's indigenous people at large. T.A.O.H.F is especially fun as a summer read. The overall development of characters (and there are many here) also strikes me as exceptional. The beauty and lasting value of this work will surely last far into generations yet to come. More than being a simple work for the young, this book reaches out to the big kid in all of us."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"I can honestly say that this was a great book. I strongly advise that if you are into adventurous books then you should give this book a try. Just the idea of running away from your old life to make a new one is so appealing to me. Sorry I'm getting ahead of myself here. You see Huck was living in a foster home, because his deadbeat dad abandoned him. I guess that you could say that it was a comfortable life, but it wasn't quite comfortable by Huck's standards (I think there was too much bathing involved). Then along comes his dad and suddenly he's living with him again. That wasn't very fun at all because Huck's father is a bit insane so Huck just up and leaves one day. He ends up traveling down the Mississippi. That's when the adventures start. He meets up with a couple of con artists, two feuding families, and travels the whole way with a runaway slave who becomes his best friend. Believe me this book is great stuff. Give it a try, even if you only read the first five or ten pages, I have a feeling you'll like it."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is a GREAT novel by Mark Twain. It's about a boy, \\"Huck\\" living in the deep south in the 1800's during the time of slavery. Huck does not fit into the life that is aunt or father or anyone else imagines for him. Instead, he lives a life based upon his everyday adventures. During some parts of this book, I was so excited, I couldn't put it down. During some other parts, I just wanted to fall asleep.

First of all the book clearly shows the reader what is taking place in the U.S. at this time and it helps set the plot of the story. The second reason I gave it this rank is because throughout the whole book there is always something exciting taking place and plenty of action. This helps keep the reader focused and into the book. Another reason for my ranking is because even though the book is mostly serious, Mark Twain adds some comedy into the book to help reveal some of the more serious times in the book. The length of the book is just about perfect, because the author doesn't try and drag on a certain part of the story. This makes the book more interesting. Finally, the reason I didn't give this book a perfect five out of five is because of the ending. I feel that the ending doesn't fit the book. This is cause throughout the whole book there is always action taking place, and then at the ending of the book it kind of stops at a dull point. I think the ending could have been changed or something a little more exciting could have took place."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is a novel written for enjoyment, the adventures that Huck has are somewhat comical and enjoyable for everyone. There is also a more serious side to the novel where Twain uses Huck to learn the evils of society that the story takes place in. Through Huck, Twain tells his opinion of slavery and shares his own moral values. Because this is a realistic book, Twain can convey his thoughts and morals to readers of every level, not just highly educated scholars. Using realism, Twain lets people know how he thinks and shows that people can change. Realism is utilized to allow all people to be able to relate and understand what is going on in the novel. I believe everyone at one point in their life should read this novel."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"... The main character in this story is Huckleberry Finn. He has a pretty sad life because he doesn't live with his parents. His father who is abusive beats him up. Although Huckleberry is a troublemaker and a \\"bad boy\\", I think he has a good heart. He is a wreckless boy who seems to like adventure and likes to observe the world. I also think that he lacks good judgements, but he means well.I do not particularly enjoy this book because it is very long and boring. It uses too many confusing words and it is difficult to understand. Although this story is adventurous, it doesn't meet the needs I required for this book. It took me a very long time to understand what was going on in this book. Also, I don't really like stories that revolves around the 1800's.

I have to return it."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"...tale of a racist teens' transformation.N word issues aside, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is an action packed story about a barely-teenaged boy named Huck who fakes his own death, disappears downriver, and, after running into a runaway slave with whom he is acquainted, travels together with the man (who he refers to as N[ ] Jim) by raft down the Mississippi River, gets involved in numerous escapades, dodges several scrapes, and, in spite of his racist tendencies, carefully weighs whether or not to help Jim gain his freedom.It wouldn't be right to share much else about the story (as George Saunders does in the Introduction to this version, and in his essay collection, The Braindead Megaphone), but I can safely say that the writing is great, the tale is fast paced, and the message the author seems to be trying to get across is an important one. That being said, I confess I was almost (but not quite) glad that, after learning too much about the ending, I lowered my expectation to such a level that I was able to successfully suffer through it. Parents of students assigned to read The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn should, I believe, preview the book beforehand.

Unfortunately this is the only thing these critics talk about when they read the book. Huckleberry Finn is more about looking at a society which did believe in the cruelty of slavery not supporting it. On the same note even today we ignore human right issues and I think this book should be taught at Secondary school level. If people are going to change their attitudes about racism this is the last time that they will do so. But as well as critise society it does look at it from a humourous point of view and will keep you interested. I personally found it occasionally a bit childish at points but it is the overall story of friendship and overcoming socities rule in the greatest of odds which will keep you interested.

END"},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is a classic American novel because it encompasses many topics, and still manages to say something significant about all of them. Huck Finn is a young American growing up without a family and a home. He runs away from home to find happiness somewhere else where nobody knows him. This emphasizes the importance of going on the frontier, which in many respects is at the backbone of American society. Along the way, Huckleberry meets Jim, a runaway slave. The moral dilemmas that the main character faces concerning Jim are symbolic of the struggle between the social norm and inborn human kindness and represent Mark Twain's criticism of society at the time. All of these ideas are wrapped up in an exciting, funny plot that's guaranteed to keep you reading. Overall, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is a must for anyone living or interested in American culture."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"The novel of Huckleberry Finn, by Mark Twain is the epitome of the American novel. The main character, which is the title's namesake, takes literal and symbolic journey down the Mississippi River in order to find his place in the hypocritical and stifling nature of civilization.It is out on the river that through the escapades of witnessing a murder, dressing up like a girl, aiding a runaway slave, and engaging in fraud, (to name a few) that Huck is able to establish his own moral values and code. This is embodied in Huck's decision to help his friend Jim, a slave, escape to freedom even though the code of his \\"civilization\\" would require that he turn Jim in or risk damnation. It is ironic that this sense of self and ethical standards is found outside the boundaraies of the society.Through Huck, America is personified. America is young; it is a dichotomy between the institution of the past (slavery) and the ideals of the future (equality). Hopefully, our moral code will follow in the mavericks of our literature, which challenge the current system and find our own truth down the river."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"I thought that this was an exciting book, and I would recommend it to anyone who likes adventure. Southern dialect is used throughout the entire novel, and it was difficult to understand at first, but once I had read a little ways into it, the language added tremendous reality to the story. This book is about a young boy who runs away from his dad, the town drunk, and is later joined by a slave, Jim, who is running aways at an attempt for freedom. It questions a lot of the values that Americans had when it was written (before the Civil War), and it's message is timeless. It was an awesome book, and you should definitely check it out!"},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"This book is the American classic. It isn't simply a children's book, or a simple adventure tale, but a vision of a battle between individuality and conformity through the eyes of one of the greatest characters in American literature. The point that this book is racist is absurd. In fact, it is quite the opposite, with Twain indicating that it is more natural for Huck and Jim to be equals. Every time Huck stops along the river and enters a town, Twain satirizes the faults and gullibility of society. The ending is there to provide a sharp contrast between Huck, a strong individual and a realist, and Tom, a total conformist and a romantic. Overall, this book is a pivotal piece in American literature, and most of the points made in the book still hold true today."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"This is truly one of the great American novels, but not only is it popular with critics and academics, it is a great story for the everyday reader. I was originally assigned to read this book over the summer before eigth grade and thought it was a terrifically fun story about a young boy on an adventure down the Mississippi River, but now several years later I can still relate to it, but on a new level. This book contains fabulous social satire, excellent use of the vernacular, wonderful characters such as the Duke and Dauphin, and several lessons in morality presented by a savvy young boy who doess not realize how intelligent are his instincts. Mark Twain is a marvelous author, this being only one of his fine novels and short stories, and I envy his ability to get in touch with his childhood and create such a genuine and accurate character as Huck Finn. This is a terrific book, and I feel that anyone who has not had the privilege of reading it is missing out on something wonderful."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"The book, The Advenures of Huckleberry Finn, written by Mark Twain in 1834 is said by many to be the closest and most realalistic discription of what the banks of the Mississsipppi were like at that time in history. The words Twain uses came across strongly to me, but the strength of the words is what kept me reading because it made me feel like I was a shadow of Huck, along with him every step of the way. The two main characters in this book are Jim, who is a black slave who has escaped from his owner to find family and freedom, and Huck, a thirteen year old boy who is running away from the burden of his abusive and drunken father so he dosen't have to worry what might happen when his dad comes home from the bar. Huck and Jim come across each other on a island outside of town where they become friends. Huck and Jim run all along the banks of the Mississsipppi where they are wittnesses to murder, thievery, and more. They put themselves at risk and danger so they won't be caught, My favorite part of the story is when Huck steals his dad's canoe and runs off. The next day the whole town is out on searching boats looking for Huck. Huck watches from a distance as he laughs away knowing that he put the whole town in an uproar. I believe Mark Twain wrote this book for people like us today to be able to get a little taste of how things were back then. I also believe he wrote this to make you feel like your on an adventure of your own ecscaping into a fun adventurous world where things don't matter what you do as long as you keep on reading. This book reminds me of &quot;The Adventures of Tom Sawyer,&quot; also written by Mark Twain, but still has the same feeling of going out on a ride for an adventure. I think its a pretty darn good book."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"This book is my very favourite of all time.

It's not just for kids that's for sure. It's rich, warm, complex and just simply wonderful!"},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"\\"Huckleberry Finn\\" by Mark Twain is the greatest American novel. Because it is our greatest novel it has been reviewed, analyzed, admired and vilified probably more than any book in American literary history.Everyone knows the story. Huckleberry Finn is a character introduced in \\"Tom Sawyer\\". He's the neglected son of the town drunk. After discovering a small fortune with Tom at the end of Tom Sawyer, Huck is given a home with spinsters. The idea is to \`civilize' Huck. That means bathing regularly, going to school, church in order to elevate him above the level of poor white trash.(Forgive me for using the term. But author is unsparing in his use of language considered to today to be politically incorrect. We'll discuss this more later.)Huck's father's paternal instincts are stimulated by the smell of money. He wants custody of his son. Unfortunately the law is on his side. Huck decides to run away. Inadvertently he takes one of the household slaves with him a runaway named Jim. They ride down the Mississippi River on a raft and sail into the annals of literature.The single largest misconception about \\"Huckleberry Finn\\" is this is a children's novel. It is often given to children as a gift or taught in junior high English class. Twain was master of American dialects. His characters speak as they should for their time and place. Consequently, the n-word is used extensively. If you're the only black kid in the class, constant use of this word could make things uncomfortable.This one of the reasons this book this book keeps winding up on the banned lists. But to put this book on the banned list in the name of political correctness is short-sighted and ignorant.Another reason this is not a kids book is it tackles issues and situations far beyond the junior high level. The average 13 year old simply does not have the life experience to fully appreciate the book.Huck and Jim represent the dregs of pre-Civil War southern society. All their lives they've been reminded of this. They must always listen to the counsel of their \`betters', be it con men, childless old ladies or noble families hunting each other to extinction. Most of their \`adventures' are because they yield their better judgment to idiots.But there is a notable exception. Jim ran away rather than be sold away from his children forever. He's not as interested in freedom as much as he is in taking care of his family. Huck is conflicted because he's stealing an old woman's property. However he begins to see this \`property' as a human being.The point where Huck decides he will go to hell before he returns Jim to an uncertain future is one of the greatest moments in the history of American letters.Huck and Jim may not be the smartest people in the world. But they both show presence of mind, loyalty, devotion and love in abundance.In short, they represent the best of humanity."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"I got this book for my 8 year old because he's been bored with the reading materials given to him at school. The problem with finding more challenging reading materials is that they usually have too mature content. Something not appropriate for an 8 year old. So, I decided to find some classics that would challenge his vocabulary and still be of interest to a young boy. This one is PERFECT! He loves it, it is a bit of a challenge and I don't have to worry about what he's learning at too early an age or answer questions that he shouldn't be asking just yet.Going back to some classics was one of my shiniest moments."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"\\"Come here, Huck,\\" Aunt Polly called from the front porch where she was washing the clothes, \\" Don't you dare talk to that nigger again, you hear me, Huck, never!\\"\\"Alright, I am coming I was just making a bargain,\\" Huck yelled back as he slipped the money in his pocket.My essay is on the book Huckleberry Finn. I read this book and loved it. I think this book shows a friendship between a black slave and a white boy during a time when that was considered an unusual thing.This book takes place during a time when blacks were not treated equal. Blacks were thought of as property not as humans. An example of this takes place in the down town slave market.\\" Cheap niggers, get your cheap niggers,\\" a slave driver called out from on top of the stage. Families are being separated and children are crying while they are standing in shackles and cuffs. This is hatred.In this book, there is a lot of action. Every time you turn the page somebody is getting into trouble. It even goes as far as to put on a play to rip people off.\\" Come see the Play of Nonsense, the best in the world,\\" the duke yelled to the listeners. The duke and so called king are going to put on a play. Their idea is to rip people off and run with their money. It is a smart idea but later on they pay for it. The next night the play starts. Hundreds of people walk in and hand their money to the duke. Right when the play starts, the duke comes out and announces that there have been some misunderstandings and rushes off withthe money he collected from the audience. This book's plot is awesome.In this story the main characters are laid back and have a great sense of humor. An example this happens when Huck and Jim, a runaway slave, are rafting down the huge river. Jim is in great danger, but they always have time to play tricks on other people.Also, there is a lot of dirty tricks and cheating. All four characters have a good sense of humor and a mind that is made to get into trouble. An example of this takes place when Huck fakes his own death and fools everybody while he lives on a raft for two years. He left his Aunt Polly behind to mourn about him and fooled everybody else. For a while he stayed on a little island but then decided to raft down a river. He made his own camps and caught his own food. All this to him was a fun vacation. He loved it!In conclusion, this book is awesome! My four beliefs are: there is a hatred toward blacks in this story; the plot is filled with all kinds of action; the characters are happy, laid back, and have a great humor; and there is a lot of bad trick playing and a whole bunch of cheating in this story. I think Twain was trying to show us an ideal example of friendship."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"I still have not recieved the book after waiting over a month, i needed it for school and so i am already supposed to be 1/2 way done reading it, but i dont have a book."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"This book had many subplots within it, and really did not make much sense.

Stay away from this audio publisher."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"Ever since Hemingway's unfortunate comments about HUCKLEBERRY FINN the book has been required reading for the literati. Like most people, I read it as but a lad. I had finished TOM SAWYER and was swept up in the stories of lost treasure and endless caverns and Injun Joe. I thought HUCKLEBERRY FINN would be more of the same, and was disappointed to find it was about a boy abused by a drunken father who runs away in a bildungsroman where he meets all sorts of unengaging characters. Even the Duke and the Dauphin come off better in the movies than on the original page.Before continuing, I suppose I ought to give my bona fides. I have nothing against &quot;classics&quot;. They've been my principle study for nearly thirty years -- Proust, Dostoevsky, Dickens, Tolstoy, &amp;c. all are great chums of mine. I'm unafraid of dead while males (oddly enough, unlike Huck, who says, &quot;After supper she got out her book and learned me about Moses and the Bulrushers, and I was in a sweat to find out all about him; but by and by she let it out that Moses had been dead a considerable long time; so then I didn't care no more about him, because I don't take no stock in dead people.&quot; I get a grim satisfaction knowing Sam Clemens is now among their number, as everyone will be who criticizes what they've produced.I've recently turned 40, and just read TOM SAWYER again for the first time in a quarter century. It's still a solid book, exciting, well-written, and funny. It's a swell book, and great for imaginative children, as it was for me at Tom's age. I'm now fighting Huck again, and it's rough sailing and choppy seas. I wish I was back with Swann and Baron de Charlus! Huck's aimless drifting down the river is less interesting than seven volumes of Proust.The &quot;racist&quot; accusation is fraudulent. Twain is careless with his use of certain verboten words, but one must not judge a writer by modern standards of racial sensitivity (as with Twain) or plot development (as with Smollett) any more than future -- and I hope more rational and well-centered -- generations that come after modern writers are dead like Moses, that some of their books are not written off simply because of the twentieth century writers' rabid obsession with sex.One reason young people don't like to read is because in schools, which is unfortunately the first place many young people face anything to read, force them into areas over their heads. Tom Sawyer's story would be a better start. It's a book written by a man who hasn't forgotten what it's like to be a boy. Huck's book is written by a man exploiting a child's voice as a mouthpiece for his own prejudices and petty dislikes. It's written above the heads of youths.Perhaps its appeal is more like MOBY DICK or LES MISERABLE. As the vision of Ahab after the white whale is more powerful than can be contained in a book, as the vision of Javert after Valjean transcends a magnificent novel, so perhaps the image of Huck and Jim on the big river simply couldn't be expressed by a writer of Clemens' fine humor but rather limited abilities."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"It's hard to imagine how anyone could read Mark Twains hillarious satire and social commentary, and so completely miss the point.

And the ending is so forced and tacked on you'd think the editor just added it on to make the book more than 200 pages. It's too coincidental, even more so than Les Miserables. Truthfully, I had to read this book for school, and I couldn't get past page 30, it was that boring. And the Cliffs' Notes put into perspective how utterly ridiculous and childish this book really is. For those who think this is a classic, I urge you to read Moby Dick, a true American classic. Or maybe The Mayor of Casterbridge, or Crime and Punishment, books by authors not hampered down by the lack of culture in America."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"This book really sucked ass. Ever have trouble sleeping? Pick up this sad excuse for an adventure novel and you'll be out in 15 minutes tops. Now don't be fooled by my one star rating... I would have given this 0 stars if that was an option. I'm not even going to fully review this book out of fear that I will pass out on my keyboard. Sure, the idea of this book was good, but it's not as though we never knew slavery in the south existed 150 years ago and the book was an amazing eye-opener. Teachers have been drilling that fact into our heads since fifth grade. Ultimately, this book was a massive waste of my time and brain cells."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"This book is boring!!!!!!

The audio version was very good with the narrator using very different voices for the various characters so there is no confusion about who is speaking - a weakness with less talented narrators. The reason that I gave this product 4 and not 5 stars was the packaging - which I found to be inadequate - the case is cardboard and each CD comes in a paper envelope - not good for storage over the years, especially if it is used on a consistent basis by multiple persons. But the actual narration was first class and brought the well known book to life."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"Huckleberry Finn is truly a classic, and an indispensable part of the American literary canon. I put off reading the book for many years because I had - a many of you may have - an inaccurate preconception of the book: i.e., \\"I don't like that kind of country humor\\", or \\"I don't like those old-fashioned novel\\", or \\"I just don't like that kind of book.\\" If you yourself have this kind of feeling about the book - let me assure you, friends, you should READ THIS BOOK. It is much, much more than that. It is a rich, stunningly accurate portrayal of the pre-Civil War South. It is also an enduring portrait of childhood. It is, quite simply, a masterpiece. Huck Finn is a character that, no matter who we are or how far removed from him we are, we can all relate to. It is also, in its use of particular American dialect, a very influential book. A quote you often see is the one Ernest Hemingway himself made about this book being the very archetype of the American novel. And it is true. Tom Sawyer was the first step, but this book is the culmination - it is the masterpiece. It is here that American literature found its voice, and stepped out from under the shadow of its neglected step-child relationship with English literature. It has a voice distinctly its own - distinctly American, and couldn't have come from anywhere else - and its immense influence on subsequent American lit is enormous, and cannot be overestimated. It is an absolutely archetypal novel. Also, its heroic portrayal of slavery was a very immediate thing as well. Its influence on such writers as Alice Walker and John Steinbeck - as well as, in some form, literally all great literature to come out America since - is profound. For this reason, and for its sheer adventure and narrative drive, it is an essential read for simply everybody."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"Looking for a good book to read? Well, just pick this one up, because The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn by Mark Twain is a great book. This is a very interesting piece of literature and is not like anything else I have ever read. Listen and you'll see why. This book is written in first person, and the story is told from the view of Huck Finn, a twelve or thirteen year old child of St. Petersburg, Missouri. The English used by Mr. Twain does not seem very good. He meant to write in this way, though, to give it a little more southern flavor and sound like a young teenager. The language itself makes the story interesting, and somewhat of a challenge to try and figure out what the characters are saying. Some words used, even in the first couple of pages, are \\"whippowill\\", \\"didn'\\", \\"gwyne\\", and \\"sumf'n\\". As you can see, Twain is very good at speaking in old American and southern talk. Another aspect of The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is the satire Twain uses. This helps us learn about the people of the time, as well as add to the entertainment value of the book by showing things that we find ignorant, which can be funny. Twain also uses satire to show weaknesses in society and look to make a point. Twain criticizes how gullible people are, how you can't trust everyone, and how some things that could be easily done are overdone. The gullibility of people keeps coming up in the book. First, they don't see the capability of everyone, especially the young. This can be seen on page 33 where Huck portrays himself as dead after using an ax and a pig to put the cabin in ruins with blood and his hair. Another instance is in Chapter 21. Huck dresses up as a girl and goes into a cabin to get some things for Jim and him. He calls himself \\"Sarah Williams\\", and even when he slips and calls himself \\"Mary\\", the lady still has no clue. Finally, she figures it out, but it takes her a while. A third and the most noticeable instance of how people are gullible is on page 132. The duke and the king, two people that come along with Huck and Jim, hold a play of Shakespeare. \\"To be, or not to be; that is the bare bodkin, That makes calamity of so long life....\\" The audience was wowed by these words, and have no idea that they aren't really reading Shakespeare except a little here and there. This also shows that you can't trust everyone you come in contact with. The last aspect that makes this story interesting is all the motifs in it. A motif is an idea, phrase, object, or element that keeps appearing in a story. In Huck Finn, the motifs are money, superstition, trust, and freedom. Money keeps occurring in the story. There is a reward for Jim and Pap, Huck's dad, Huck and Tom Sawyer find $6,000, he goes and sees a couple of wealthy families, and the foursome, with the duke and the king, try to raise money. Superstition happens with Jim. Huck goes to Jim to hear about his dad, Huck and Tom play superstitious tricks on Jim, and there are a number of other occurrences. Huck wants to have freedom from everyone and the town and Jim wants to be free from slavery. Trust, as I already mentioned, is a big motif. Characters find that they can't trust each other. These motifs are interesting because we all want money and want to see how people earn it, superstition is interesting to see if it is right, and we would like to know what kind of people we can trust. Also, the motifs keep us interested in the story by seeing if we can understand what they are talking about and by them giving clues to help us read the book, while at the same time keeping it challenging. The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is a good, well thought out, and plot-filled book. It is as good as anything I've ever read and you will have fun reading it. If you don't read anything else, read this because it is worth it."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"Mark Twain- The Adventures of Huckleberry FinnThe Adventures of Huckleberry Finn was first published in 1884 .

I mean, a kid might enjoy Huck and Jim's mischief, but they wouldn't really appreciate the quality and wittiness of this book. I also can't understand why some people say this is a racist book; the impression I got is that Twain was actually mocking the narrow-mindedness and prejudice of white society at that time. Anyway, I think this book is funny and satirical, and the characters are very well defined and charismatic; their combination of naivete and wisdom is really endearing. Okay, some of the situations are quite absurd, and sometimes Huck's penchant for criticizing everything that doesn't sit well with him are somewhat tiring, but on the whole this is a great story, and I reccommend it to everyone that can keep an open mind while reading, because I believe this book is definitely not an easy read, despite what others say, or at least not as easy as it seems on the surface."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"What I appreciate most from this book is its ability to create rollercoaster sensation, in which the reader participates aside with the characters within the novel. The life seems unimagineable but it's that very reason that makes it memorable.Mark Twain's The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn explores the human flaws of an American society through the eyes of Huck Finn, who ultimately triumphs over societal expectations; Twain argues that in order for one to genuinely perceive flaws of a body of people, one has to be truly detached and thus objective of that group. Huck Finn is the epitome of an intrepid individual, who ignores societal expectations, when he learns that it is not he that is abnormal, but the others that are unusual. It is not until then that he truly assumes an objective stance and investigates and analyzes the slave-oriented society. Able to prevail against the initial despairs of isolation, Huck Finn ultimately overcomes through his eventual apathy towards the people's views. He does exactly what the others do not expect him to do so. Instead of diminishing, Finn firmly stands even stronger than before, an attitude that irate the rest. It is then that the individual truly undermines the established norm and understands societal flaws. Following one's moral compass, anyone can rise against and unjust conformity, upholding one's genuine beliefs.The reason you should read this book is that it becomes good source, as it is cited and referred to in allusions."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"What Ernest Hemingway called, \\"the best book we've had,\\" The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is written in a southern slang that is initially difficult to follow, yet, once you learn to follow Huck's voice, it becomes a revelation of the human spirit. Huck Finn is a derelict boy on the run from his drunken, abusive father in the late 19th century. Along with his friend, Jim-a runaway slave-Huck travels down the Mississippi on a raft and learns about the ironies of life in a pious yet oppressive society. Twain uses Huck's ignorance to reveal the truths that were tearing America apart, and he does so with such grace and flare that I found myself indignant with laughter at the follies of a national doctrine. Even though slavery has been abolished, the book is still relevant today, describing a boy's awakening to the world around him, and how he-morals, judgement, and upbringing-fits into that world. A moving, fun, and insightful read, I found some of the most impressive moments in literature within the covers of this book; I hope you will too."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"The book is well laid out and organized, but there are around 3 pages missing from Chapter 21. There are a few other occurrences throughout the book where paragraphs are excluded. They are not excluded for any reason that I can see, (censorship, copyright, etc.) they are just missing at random."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"I read this fine book long ago as a child, and while Mark Twain's condemnation of slavery/racism did not escape me then (and was refreshed by this re-reading), it was truly gratifying as an adult to fully appreciate how genuinely nefarious was his pair of swindlers, the Duke and the Dauphin. As a kid I thought their little plots were merely amusing, but after getting out into the world and encountering the sorts of folks who make their living by ripping other people off, I could understand how any citizens of that era would have had no qualms whatever about dipping such a duo in hot tar and then feathers. The young American West must have been rife with such con artists, and their ilk was marvelously presented in \\"Huckleberry Finn.\\"And as for the word we're not allowed to say, it's amazing that \\"Huckleberry Finn\\" is banned in many places for its literary use of that word in a serious work of social satire/commentary -- while a film like \\"Pulp Fiction,\\" with its own liberal use of that word, and no serious purpose beyond entertainment via plot and violence, is roundly praised. Odd indeed."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"It is difficult to know what to say -- Mark Twain/Huckleberry Finn ... such enjoyable reading ... simply fun!

Twain masterfully creates an interesting story line while staying true to the times, setting, and language. Huck's tale of his adventure down the Mississippi will keep you turning the pages. It is very interesting because things happen when you least expect it. This is an amazing story full of adventure and fun.But of course, you will find the way the characters speak is either annoying or downright confusing. But remember this takes place in the past! It was normal for people to talk like that. Also you think this book is not good because the use of the N word in describing Jim. Although use of that word is offensive and insensitive now, it was not like that in those days. And most of the young boys of the south spoke in such a manner then. If you read this book then you will find this is really a good book. I am sure that you will appreciate this book as one of the greatest classics of American literature."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"Have you ever known anyone who went back and forth between an abusive parent and a guardian that wanted you to do things you didn't want to? Neither of those choices sounds very appealing but Huck didn't have any choice except to run away.The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is a fictional story by Mark Twain. Twain also wrote The Adventures of Tom Sawyer which I recommend that you read before reading this because you wouldn't understand some of the parts if you didn't read it.Huck is not exactly a normal kid, sometimes he goes to school but sometimes he doesn't. He lives with either his father or Widow Douglas. He is not school smart but when it comes to survival he knows exactly how to stay alive when he is alone with no food or anything. He knows how to fish, makes rafts, start fires and can hunt fairly well. His father abuses him often but Huck seems to stay with him until he couldn't stand it anymore.Huck was living with Widow Douglas when his father took (it seemed like kidnapped) him away to an island where there was no one there. His father takes Huck's money and buys whiskey or other alcoholic beverages and gets drunk and beats Huck for no reason. Huck couldn't stand it anymore so one night when his father went to town and got drunk he sawed his way out of the cabin(which he was locked in) and then the real adventure began. I would definitely recommend this book. Its fun to read and nearly impossible to put down. If you like adventurous books about kids our age than you would probably enjoy reading this book.I had read a couple of Mark Twain's books and I have enjoyed each one. Reading this book made me want to read even more books from this talented author."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"This book has been called racist from the very begining and still is banned in many schools today for it's \\"racist\\" content. My school system believes that to. So I went to get a copy because everyone said it was so better than Tom Sawyer which was what I was reading at the time.It really, truly is.This is agreat book not only for it's numerous metaphors, but for it's evolution of it's characters. Huck and Jim are extremly passionate about their beliefs and grow on eachother so much that Huck would rather \\"go to hell\\" than see Jim back in slavery. Even though that is the main plot, two other characters play a pivitol part in the story. The are the king and the duke. At first they seem like greedy but harmless con-men but as they stay whith Huck and Jim for a while we see from Huck's view how evil and greedy people can be. It is sort of sad to see this plotline not really remembered well, becaus it is very interesting.So who is the main villian in the story? Not the king and the duke, but the system of slavery. And because of that Huck and every other white person in the book calls slaves \\"niggers\\" without any thought of remorse. Is this a racist book that uses terrible language and metaphors that try to make black people look ignorant and evil?No.This book shows a point of view in a time that we can somewhat relate to. It's unfortunate that this book is pushed away by hasty critism and is not allowed to be read is some public schools because this doesn't only make observe an age in time. It Makes You Live It."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"I agree with the reviewers who say that this is the best of American literature.

I was supposed to read it again in college, and I did read it again, even though I knew I could've passed the test without doing so. Huckleberry Finn was different because it was about a kid who thought more the way I did and acted the way I would have liked to, most of the time anyway. That's what made it great for me. Most of the characters and thinking described in this book are timeless, for good and bad reasons, and that goes a long way in making the book great literature.If you want to read more by Mark Twain, I recommend checking out A Conneticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, and Roughing It."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"I really enjoyed this book, it's one of the few that we've read in english class that has intrigued me to keep reading and find out what happens next.

I think that it is going overboard to have ever banned this book, and was almost an unintelligent move.

I recommend to this to anyone and everyone."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"I had previously read the book \\"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\\" during a project in third grade. I grew up very close to St. Petersburg, Missouri, where the story takes place. This made the story more interesting because I know what the area is like. I could not comprehend the story as well then as I now can, and it was fascinating to reread. It was also much better this time because I was not being forced to read it in class.The story held my focus throughout, and I found it hard to put the book down. I loved the constant action of the book. The boys were always coming up with sly or cunning ideas, as they had done in the prequel. It was quite humorous, while still creating a great deal of suspense and drama. It gives people who have grown up in recent years a chance to imagine what it would be like to grow up at the turn of the century. That is probably my favorite aspect of the book. It has an overabundance of action while remaining very believable and somewhat realistic.The main characters are my favorite part of this series of books. Huck is my favorite character because he overcomes so much adversity. He could very easily give up on life after what he put up with against his father, but continued to aspire a good life elsewhere. Also, he acted as an older brother figure for Tom and taught him a lot during their experiences. I also admire Tom because he shares in Huck's action, as well as teaches him to be booksmart. They do well in complimenting each other. They also are very cunning but stay within their morals, and I admire that. Jim is an example of how the boys were far ahead of their time and befriended not only a black man, but a slave. They were very mature, despite ignorance because of their young age. None of the main characters ever seemed to be selfish when it came to helping each other; they would always put their neck on the line for one another.Overall, I loved this book, and would suggest it to anyone. I do think, however, that males would enjoy it more than females simply because the adventures tend more to a male imagination, but it can be enjoyed by all readers."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"The novel \\"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\\" exposes the reader to many interesting and funny occurrences during the pre-Civil War time.

This book is an exact reprint(including misspelled words and missing page numbers), except for 2 things. First, the outside cover is brown not green(Not a big deal. I like the brownish leather look better anyway). Second, there is one mistake that was not reproduced, someone apparently messed with the printing plate on a few of the first editions and added male sex organs to one of the pictures.

It is still one of the best pieces of literature I have ever read. Even now at 32 I get lost in it and hold it as one of my all time favorite adventure books. I can't wait to re read Tom Sawyer."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"The book was great and it's a shame to see blacks (such as Jim) reffered to as the N-word. Other than that though the book was really good to read. My favourite part was when Tom and Huck are reunited. The worst part (to me) was when Huck killed the snake and Jim was bitten by it's mate. Well done to Mark and I would really recommend the book to children and adults alike."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"This book gives a wonderful picture of Huckleberry and Jim's adventures in towns along the Missippi River in the 1800's. Huck is a young boy about 13 years old, who was very poor and abused by his alcoholic father, leading him to run away. He meets up with Jim, a runaway slave, who was about to be sold to another master. Together, Huck and Jim join up with a couple of con artists and have a series of encounters with people in towns they pass. I finished the book with a much better view of how brutal life was then. This book is a good read for children and adults."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"Let me clarify a little; this is more like...a 3.7/5. I don't want to label it as \\"okay\\", because I thoroughly enjoyed the novel, but I wouldn't put it up there with books like Avalon High, Gone, or Matched, since I didn't enjoy it that much.I read this for my Honors American Literature class, and we're just now finishing it up. I had never read Huck Finn all the way through before (maybe a Great Illustrated Classics version when I was much younger), but I found that I ended up really enjoying the book. Especially discussing it in class and all that, and learning more about the characters than I would have normally. The book was incredibly insightful, and I can only imagine the buzz it must have caused when it was actually published.Read the specifics?[...]~Thalia Anderson"},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"This was a great product.

I wanted the version of Huck Finn that had the original artwork inside to show my students. However, I still can use the book I received--the Dover Thrift Study Edition because of the commentaries and study guide included."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"Many people consider Huckleberry Finn to be a classic children's book about a young boy's adventures on a raft with his befriended slave Jim. The first and last third of the book are exactly that. Huck is up to his trickery in the beginning of the book and resumes his mischevious ways with his cousin Tom at the end of the book. But in the middle, Huck has many realizations that go directly against his Mississippi upbringing. Huck learns the evils of racism and Jim's humanity, along with the value of friendship. In this part of the novel, Huck matures into a free-thinking individual, leading him to his destination as the novel's conclusion."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"\\"Huckleberry Finn\\" reflects very accurately the thinking and culture of the time. I was shook by the part where Huck recognizes that which many adults would not for years to come: that the African American is a human being worthy of that which all humans are entitled. It is a contemporaneous account of history, albeit fictional; it is typical of many accounts of the time, told as only Twain could tell it: so vividly that you feel Huck's adventure is your own.I found this edition very well done. I do admit, however, that I spent most of the book reading \\"chile\\" as \\"chilli\\". P.S. chile = child."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"I don't need to tell you what this book is about: everyone is familiar with it. I started reading it for the first time at age 25, fully expecting it to be the greatest novel I've ever read. I was not disappointed. I've never laughed so much with one book. The dialects, the events, the people: they're all so priceless. A masterpiece!"},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"Quote: \\"All modern American literature comes from one book by Mark Twain called Huckleberry Finn... All American writing comes from that. There was nothing before. There has been nothing as good since.\\" -- Ernest HemingwayWhy has 'Huckleberry Finn' been on so many lists of banned books? Because many readers (and many people who never bothered to read it) considered it indecent and racist. Yet, even with its frequent place on the lists of America's most challenged books, it's become a classic. Although many consider that Twain's depiction of the runaway slave, Jim, was demeaning and racist, the story shows the hypocrisy of American society towards slaves and African Americans. The story follows Huck and Jim - both runaways - as they travel down the Mississippi River, with Huck slowly changing his views about blacks and working to help Jim to freedom."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"This classic is worth reading several times. We need a book like this for the times we live in now...what Twain could do with politics of today!"},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"After reading the book after it was written some 120 years before, I enjoyed the historical concept of the book and how America played out with the bigotry and views of slavery of the times. I found the dialects and the manner of speaking in the 19th Century annoying and hard to follow, but again in historical perspective, it was a good read, slow, probably authentic, sometimes annoying, and overall a good review of Huckleberry and his black friend Jim, floating down the river and experiencing endless adventures. The larger print of this edition was great for an older reader with fading eyes. In many ways, Huckleberry is an obnoxious, rebellious character, and probably nowadays would be on medication and maybe visiting the counselors for some behavior modication. Overall, worth the time and effort to read a Twain classic."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"This was the least expensive of the available editions. It was excellent as the print was large making it easy to read.It is a classic book and was well presented."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"This is my favorite novel of all time. Although often assigned to middle school children, this book requires a certain level of maturity to appreciate it fully. At surface level, Twain's novel is engaging. One can't help but laugh and revel vicariously in the adventures that Huck and Jim get into. On a deeper level, this novel explores a more serious theme: the conflict between individual freedom and the corrupting influence of society. Huck resists being \\"civilized\\" by the Widow Jenkins, and readers cheer him on in this regard. He is resisting what many of us would like to resist---the boundaries set by society. To be \\"civilized\\" means to lose one's self in some way; it means to relinquish childhood.This book has always reminded me of J.D. Salinger's THE CATCHER IN THE RYE because of its completely honest first-person narrator and the theme of individual vs. society. So, if you like Salinger's novel, you'll probably enjoy this one."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"This one's for Huckleberry Finn. I first read this is high school and forgot everything about it a month later. A while back I read it again and now my memory is much better. This is about the travels of the boy Huck Finn down or up the Mississippi River with a slave named Jim. Huck had previously escaped from his drunkard father and from \\"civilized\\" society as well. The book chronicles their travels and the many adventures that ensue. Mark Twain was a supremely talented writer and uses his skills in an impressive way here. The attention to detail is astonishing and I felt like I was right there with the protagonists every step of the way. There is also a great deal of humor as is to be expected to Twain. And also, there is an uplifting message about the nature of racisim towards the end that could be said to be the cenral theme of the novel. Now that's what was good, so what was bad? Well, Twain goes on and on about boring minutae many times throughout this thing. Two characters named the Duke and King (I think) are introduced and are basically criminals. Almost to a letter they are boring every time mentioned, but I wouldn't call them filler though, I just didn't get into them. They get Huck and Jim into all sorts of trouble and meet their end in time. Other than the long-windedness there isn't much wrong with this novel. Alot of people have said that this is the best ever novel by an American writer, but I don't agree. Oh, one more thing. There is a certain word tossed about quite often here that some people find offensive. I won't mention it here, but most people will be able to guess what it is. Get over it people, It's just the language of the times. I'm someone who could choose to be personally offended by that word in this book but can look past it to see what Twain was doing. If you can't do that then you'll be missing out on the novel's greater message of tolerance and understanding and doing yourself a disservice in the long run. This novel is definitely one of the best ever written and deserves a go by every man woman and child."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"Let's begin by noting that this is a remarkable work for two reasons. First, it's written in vernacular, from start to finish. This makes the book raw and lively, humorous, and honest. It has a far truer ring to it than a thousand other books from the 19th century. Second, Huck rises above his pro-slavery upbringing and comes to see Jim as a man and a friend.Both remarkable features guarantee this novel a place in American lore. However, a good deal of its genius is in working against the sentiments of its age. The racial politics of the day are very different, and thus the novel--like Uncle Tom's Cabin--loses much of its traction.With its humor and plain-talk it is superior to almost any American novel from the 18th century. It remains an exceedingly funny novel. Twain is masterful in his depiction of boyhood and the comedies that arise from childish misunderstandings, mischievous shenanigans, and the art of the con. And it is a vital historical document. That will never change.I do think the book has some racist and classist moments. Despite Huck's sympathies with Jim, Jim and other Negroes do not come off as terribly intelligent or well-rounded people. In Huck's eyes, Jim is a man worthy of friendship and freedom, but he is woefully nave and gullible.The lampooning of Blacks and poor Whites takes away from the greatness of this book, even if Twain's political sympathies lay with both groups. And given the changed nature of \\"race\\" in the 21st century, some of what made this book brilliant is only recovered with an effort. These are reasons to phase Huck Finn out of the high school cannon. I say this while hoping that college students, and all adult Americans, will continue to read and love Huck Finn for many more centuries."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"Tom Parker is a masterful reader and proves that one can improve upon a time-worn classic. I listened to the novel to refresh my memory, as I had assigned it to be read and followed-up by over 45 high school freshmen. Even though I was to have read it in high school and college, I had never read the entire novel from start to finish. That mission is now accomplished!"},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"Great book; everyone should read at least one time. I read this when I was only 15 and had to reread to appreciate it."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"Wonderful, adventurous, witty and wise old Mark Twain! This book, although not politically correct, is just as much for adults as for young people! He shows us how petty and silly we are about our relationships with others and describes life in that time so well!"},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is a very exciting book. It starts out in Missouri right on the Mississippi River. Huck Finn was a young boy who was adopted and was taught manners and how to live like a proper person. He never like this much and to be quite honest, he hated it. Huck's father was a drunk and one day kidnapped Huck and took him out to his cabin. Whenever Pap would leave, he would lock Huck in the cabin. Huck fakes his own death to get away from his father who abuses him. He hides on an island in the middle of the Mississippi river. While there, Huck meets a kind African American man named Jim. Jim and Huck develop a good relationship and begin on a long adventure together. They come across some tough times when they come across other people because they think Jim is a runaway slave. They encounter some con artists who sell Jim as a runaway slave. Jim was sold to Tom Sawyer's aunt and uncle. Huck and Tom device a plan to get Jim freed. Their plan works to free Jim and they realize later that Jim has already been a free man. The book ends with a good ending and Huck continues his adventurous ambitions by heading out west. I gave this book 4 out of 5 stars. It was a great book but not my perfect book to read. Overall it was great."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"One never tires of Huckleberry. His sense of humor, his care and concern for others, his many adventures appeal to all ages and age groups.

We actually experience Huck's activities through his eyes, with his thoughts and the reasoning behind his actions. Twain captures perfectly the thought process of a (13 year old?) young man. Yes, it takes place during slavery period, and, though some of the language may be objectionable by today's standards, it is a story worth reading and enjoying. There is a lot more than what is ever shown in any of the movies made from this book."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"I've enjoyed this reading more than my original boyhood reading of the timeless classic.

What fun!"},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"An old fashioned tale of marvellous adventure based around the breakdown of a family and a boys efforts to make his own way with his true friends."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"This book has earned the right to be called the great American novel. It is well writen and has a great plot."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"It's not called \\"the great American novel\\" for nothing.Huck Finn is by far one of the greatest fronteir adventures ever written.Mark Twain is brilliant, witty, and real.There is nothing else like it; it's a must-read."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"I read Huckleberry Finn as a young teenager and beyond question this was my favorite piece of fiction (my version is 1985). I will confess I had only a limited scope to compare with as I was not a first-rate bookworm as a child; however, this will not diminish the timeless quality of Twain's work.I remember absorbing myself in this book quite fondly and having difficulty putting it down. At an age when I could closely relate to Huck's level of maturity, Twain presented his novel in such a congenial fashion it was almost as though I remember Huck as a personal friend. This is perhaps the genius of the book, a book I highly recommend."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"Once in the Mississippi river, a boy named Tom and his slave friend Jim were going down a stream to go to the Free states to get a fresh start. It was summer time and the two boys were running away from the trouble they left behind their old life. The two boys weren't just going to the Free states to get a fresh start, they were going there, because this way Jim could be free and Tom could stay away from his abusive dad. This is the only way that Jim and Tom could find a resolution to their problems.My favorite part of this book is when Jim and Tom were going down the Mississippi and they were both asleep and a steam boat ran over their raft causing the boy's to separate from each other for a very long time. This event caused the boy's to be more united and to go through a lot more cool adventures.The message that the writer wants to show here is that it is not ok to lie, to face trouble, no mater how bad it is, and to always say the true. The things that I like about this book were that it was really exciting and there were a lot of adventures in the story. But the only thing that I would like to change about this book is that is too much trouble going on, and it makes it really hard to understand. I would recommend every one to read this book because it is really exciting and it paints a picture in your mind making the reading really exciting."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"This book is hilarious. I laughed all the way through it. It's also very educational as it goes along with the time period of whites/blacks segregation. In this book, you see a world though a little boy's eyes and how he has to deal with many obstacles and help Jim, his slave. In his day, people weren't likely to help blacks so it's a very touching and worthwhile story/novel. I highly recommend this to all of you book-lovers. This is my FAVORITE Mark Twain book."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"I read Huckleberry Finn just this year! Of course I heard about the book and references to it all my life. I guess I had to take the plunge. And what a joyful ride it was! I liked these two chaps- one white and free another black and slave- on the run so alone under the sun and stars. At the same time they are chasing their own wild dreams and adventures.Humour is spread all over the book and it often takes quirky turns. I can laugh at some very small bits from the beginning of the novel where Tom Sawyer makes an unsuccessful attempt to form a gang of robbers, towards the end of book where impish Tom kisses his own aunt on the lips under disguise of some other boy and Jim being supplied with all sorts of insects and snakes while in captivity.But what makes this story great is the noble theme that runs throughout the book. Society's inhuman and exploitative nature and human heart's own capacity for love, compassion and friendship, above all. As we see in the book human compassion and friendship triumphs over greed, malevolence and injustice of an unjust and small hearted society."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"Huckleberry Finn, best friend of Tom Sawyer, runs away from his brutal, white-trash father for an easy-going life of floating down the Missisippi river on a raft. But just as he sets out he meets up with runaway slave Jim. Their escape and adventure they have together as with each mooring of the raft they encounter a new problem, friend, fued or foe. Each and every time Huck manages to worm out of the situation by telling huge lies so he can get back to the raft, escaping one fine mess to end up in another.Huckleberry Finn speaks volumes of the era it was written in. There's no such thing as political correctness here as the 'N' word is thrown around so casually and frequently you might have to stop yourself from repeating it after putting the book down. To justify this, one might consider that Huck and Jim are considered to be the most common and ruffian of black and white so would naturally go together like peas in a pod. Jim's role as a surrogate father cements this theory also.The only ongoing plot thread is that of Jim evading his captors. Other characters and story arcs come and go. I do realise that Mark Twain wrote the book over a period of many years so this may account as to why it has a stop/start feel to it. It does seem as meandering as this Missisippi river itself.Some have voiced dismay at the cop-out ending. But you can look at like so many movie plot-holes of today. Without suspension of disbelief or some necessary contrivances there simply wouldn't be a story or, ultimately, any adventures to tell of.It's written in many different dialects and can be a bit tricky to get ahold of. But if you stick with it, the effort will pay off. I don't consider Huckleberry Finn to be a life-changing book but it does deserve its status as a classic and has huge amounts of drama and character.This edition features a lengthy introduction by George Saunders, a lost chapter and critical reviews."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"I read this book recently, for my 10th grade American Literature class. I think possibly the most accurate description I can give for it is that it's a sort of pre-Civil War-era 'Catcher in the Rye'--both novels are journeys of adolescent self-discovery, told in an informal, gritty first-person narrative voice. If you liked 'Catcher', chances are, you'll like 'Huck'. ('Huck' is also lacking in most of the teenager-y whining and moaning that put people off 'Catcher').I will admit that the novel has attributes that will make it a boring or valueless read, for some. It's told from the perspective of an semi-literate Southern boy and is filled with digressions and anecdotes. It's very episodic and I can't say it has one centralized plot.Still, I enjoyed the book for the vibrant, colorful portayal of the American South, the dark humor and most of all, for the characters. Jim, the slave man, while often a figure of humor, has quiet dignity and nobility. He provides a father figure for the abandoned and parentless Huck. Huck, himself, is an utterly unforgettable character--the humble country boy with \\"a sound heart and a deformed conscience\\", he is impossible not to like. Seriously. My one complaint with the book are the segments in which Huck goes into dry-exposition and detail-mode and doesn't give his own unique insight into what's going on. Also, the end of the book, when Huck and Jim become secondary characters and the extraordinarily irritating Tom Sawyer dominates, is rather boring.Other than that, this is a solid masterpiece and probably the finest American classic I've ever read."}]`),x={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:S},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:F,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},E={class:"card-container"},M=["disabled"],B={key:0},C={key:1};function P(n,e,s,c,r,i){const m=y("PoemCard");return t(),a("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=o("div",{class:"top-banner"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),o("div",E,[(t(!0),a(g,null,w(i.visiblePoems,(h,f)=>(t(),p(m,{key:f,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),a("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(t(),a("span",C,"Loading...")):(t(),a("span",B,"See more"))],8,M)):b("",!0)])}const q=u(x,[["render",P],["__scopeId","data-v-ca21802b"]]),O=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"drive/33.md","filePath":"drive/33.md"}'),W={name:"drive/33.md"},j=Object.assign(W,{setup(n){return(e,s)=>(t(),a("div",null,[v(q)]))}});export{O as __pageData,j as default};
