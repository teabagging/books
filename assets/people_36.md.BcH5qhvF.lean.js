But since he simply posits that the media is there to protect the country, promote unity, and a whole list of other (about 10 total) roles of the media, and then fails to explain why this is the media's role.....I sit there questioning this expansive role of news.I see the newsmedia as a source of information. They are to provide the people with the who/what/where/how and why of what is going on in the world at large and locally. They are NOT to be ideology machines, whether good or bad ideologies.Fenton observes how foreign news has drastically declined since the Cold War and how disastrous this has been. Here, describing the ins and outs of his field he excels, and does not spare any administration or political position. Yet he fails to notice that the reason why it was so much easier to report news in the Cold War era, and why his goals of unifying the country blah blah were so much more attainable is because we had an obvious enemy in front of us. In today's society, what foreign threat do we focus upon? Terrorism, the middle east, n. korea, chinese economic expansion, resurgent russian and japanese nationalism? Its unfortunate and a very valid point that the newsmedia seems to focus on NONE of these, at least with their own correspondents abroad. But Fenton's attacks often draw upon the sympathies of a post-911 world. Of course the news, like the government should have paid more attention to Bin Laden and company. We now that NOW. But hindsight is 20/20."},{"Title":"Bad News : The Decline of Reporting, the Business of News, and the Danger to Us All","review":"Fenton's plaint is well-taken: Americans need to be better informed. But, as humorist Dave Barry once noted, try to get them to read a four-part newspaper series on bauxite mining, and they'll flip to the sports pages. What to do? As the cliche has it, there are No Easy Answers here.Fenton blames the news media's corporate ownership for the decline of the news. Maybe. But it was a CBS marketing exec, not anybody in the news department, who first sounded the internal klaxon on the fake Air National Guard memos. The newsies wanted so badly for them to be true, they couldn't be bothered to properly verify them.What's truly remarkable is the mention made of liberal media bias, and the advent of bloggers. These are noted in passing, and are basically \\"of-course\\"d aside, but it's still startling to see a major media figure even acknowledge their existence. Maybe the MSM is coming out of denial on this score. I guess they'd have to, sooner or later. You can't be a gatekeeper when the walls are down.Throughout, Fenton casts the Bush Presidency as a calamitous consequence of the failures of the news media. Sorry, not buyin'. This is merely a retread of the liberal notion that the American public are too stupid to vote in their own best interests, unless liberals tell them what those interests are. As for Bush being culpable for 9/11, as he insinuates at one point, the reader is galled anew at the cheek of liberals, who hold their guy Clinton blameless for his eight years of dithering, yet point fingers at the Bush team for not sorting out the muddle in eight months.Fenton's conclusions are pessimistic: TV news needs to be expanded, and fortified, but how can extended news programs draw a viewership? The public probably isn't up to it, is the glum conclusion. Fenton is right that if internet gossip replaces hard news, then the citizenry will suffer. But the success of substantial major blogs, which have caught out major media outlets in errors, distortions, and downright fabrications these past few years, bodes well for the public's appetite and capacity for hard, informed news. If TV can't deliver it anymore, then that's hardly the public's fault."},{"Title":"Bad News : The Decline of Reporting, the Business of News, and the Danger to Us All","review":"I remember that I thought, at times, that American news shows would do better if they watched BBC or listened to NPR.

The U.S. disregarding the U.N.'s inspection/judgement was enough at least for some of us to doubt any yet-coming-out proof of existence of WMD's. It is a piece of news, indeed informative one, if we hear a simple truth like it's too risky for reporters to go into certain regions and don't really know what's going on there or the U.S. goverment didn't allow reporters to go to certain areas, etc. Again, some of us figured anyway because we never heard iraqis talk on TV--even now we do rarely on radio (to tell you the truth i haven't had a TV for a long time).

Retiring foreign correspondent Tom Fenton is canny to jump on the issue right now, when it's fresh in a lot of minds. He offers a lot of insights into what's wrong now. But in the end he lacks a clear vision of how the industry used to be and how it got to be where it is now.Fenton points out that the major American TV networks have exactly one foreign bureau these days, in London. At home, \\"news\\" often consists of repackaging press releases from the government or Big Business, and abroad, news is regularly purchased wholesale from the BBC and other sources, international bureaus have withered to a few stringers, and many networks (Fox News in particular) have fallen prey to creating \\"spectaculars\\" with celebrity newsmen like Geraldo Rivera.The author is correct to point out that this represents a major decline from the heyday of Edward R. Murrow and Walter Cronkite. News is on the skids. But as early as page twenty-seven, he reveals why things used to be better back in the Golden Age of newsgathering: the Cold War. Fear of the Soviets justified massive outlays that can't exist in the absence of a monolithic enemy. Any Noam Chomsky acolyte would point out that this means the news was NEVER really about facts, but rather about nationalist propaganda.And Fenton is contradictory about how things stand today. For instance, he suggests that many news veterans are still stuck in a Vietnam-era liberal mindset and that's why they're eager to let slide on hard news gathering, tossing softballs to world leaders like President Bush and Vladimir Putin. Let me repeat that for you: he thinks that it is old-line leftism that is causing the news to give a free pass to right-wing nationalists like Bush and Putin. Need I explain why this is a ridiculous notion?Still, there are a lot of ways Fenton is correct. Because newsgathering is toothless today, we have no context to understand forces like Islamist terror and Russian neocolonialism. Frivolous attitudes toward Chinese industrial expansionism and Venezuelan saber-rattling leave the average American unequipped to prepare for what may be our next big national struggle. And our highly overpaid news anchors have a moral responsibility to push their correspondents and stringers for a higher standard of reportage.Even the solutions Fenton suggests are valid. An hour-long prime-time news show every night would be a good idea, and the success of shows like Dateline and 60 Minutes proves that people would watch them. An FCC willing to enforce the networks' responsibility to the public good would bring news in line with what it should be, and what we certainly need, to grasp our place in the world.For all this good, Fenton's appeal to false nostalgia and his oddly contradictory view of how things are right now undermines how we see and understand his arguments. (And all this is not helped by odd typographical quirks that suggest the publisher was in a real hurry to get the book out and move on. I think we should expect higher quality from a HarperCollins imprint.)Fenton is canny to spot a real need and throw his weight behind solutions. And with a little time and consideration, I suspect this book could have been a major contribution to real improvements in the state of affairs. But as it is it's a near miss, a selectively useful and alternately odd book that clouds the issues as much as it clarifies them. If you want to participate in the push for a more responsible press, this book is not the one for you."},{"Title":"Bad News : The Decline of Reporting, the Business of News, and the Danger to Us All","review":"Tom Fenton worked for many years as the senior European correspondent for CBS News. From 1966 to his retirement in 2004, Fenton covered almost every major European and Middle Eastern story. Nearly a decade before 9/11/01, Fenton tried (in vain) to convince his bosses at CBS that CBS should do an interview with Osama bin Laden. As a journalist on the ground and in the field where news happens, Fenton received four Emmy Awards, a Columbia University Dupont Award, and numerous other awards for his reporting. Fenton currently lives in London, England.In Bad News, Tom Fenton starts a campaign to galvanize Americans to demand more from their news media, especially the networks. He offers a \\"fiery indictment\\" of how far the news has fallen since the conclusion of the Cold War. The book reveals a news-gathering environment destroyed by corporate employees obsessed with the bottom-line, staffed by producers and executives more concerned with ratings than with the news, and \\"dangerously dependent\\" on information gathered by news agencies instead of ferreted out by correspondents.The era of foreign correspondents is over and with it is gone the time when network news covered the important stories as a public service. Now, the network news has been taken over by corporate parents who have turned it into a \\"cash cow.\\" Critical issues and stories are abandoned by producers because the American public might think they are too boring, distant, or depressing.Fenton argues that news media working with the mindset of entertainment instead of education is more than irresponsible: it is dangerous.A great read and interesting inside look at the news and what's wrong with the media today."},{"Title":"Bad News : The Decline of Reporting, the Business of News, and the Danger to Us All","review":"Tom Fenton has a bone to pick.As a veteran foreign correspondent for CBS News, he watched as his industry gave up investigative antagonistic independent journalism for \\"puff pieces,\\" Barbara Walters/Geraldo Rivera-style entertainment, and rebroadcasting corporate and/or government packaged reports masquerading as \\"news.\\" He's completely right that for at least 20 years the evening news has been a sham.Economics is part of it, as Fenton describes how a couple tenths of a percentage point in the ratings means millions in advertising revenue. By pandering to the lowest common denominator, the major networks have guaranteed that the LCD is the only demographic served.Also part of it, as Fenton takes great pains to point out, is the coziness of news bureaus with the current administration, which freezes out journalists who do not toe the party line. When lying to the public has become such an art, exposing the man behind the curtain is a sure trip to the Nowhere Idaho beat, or an IRS audit, or both.Fenton has stern words for the current Bush Administration, as well as the Clinton and Bush Sr. Administrations before it. He seems rather soft on the Reagan Administration, even though this was when the run-up to Wall Street tyranny began.The first third of the book is a little annoying, as Fenton takes every opportunity to place himself on a short list consisting of \\"Cronkite, Brokaw, Rather & Fenton.\\" Frankly, I don't think he belongs on that list.Nevertheless, having established his credentials the second third of the book details the failings of the TV news industry, how foreign bureaus were trimmed or eliminated completely after the fall of the USSR, and how American news turned inward and downward -- to our great detriment. In large part the developments in the world-at-large went unreported for two decades so the events of 1998-2001 caught many of us by surprise.The last third of the book explains why this situation is so dangerous. In a nutshell, with nobody trusted & respected to report world events accurately, the Administration is free to contradict facts bold-facedly and the public either buys the lies or is willing to entertain the notion. In a state where the \\"Fourth Estate\\" does not function, the truth is a casualty and becomes open to interpretation -- or spin -- or outright political manipulation. You can't have Democracy without an informed populace.Tom is right, this is unacceptable.His book is unusually forthright, startlingly direct, and surprisingly it names names. That it came to print at all is a glimmer of hope that a free press still has a chance to resurrect itself, and the tide may yet be turned.We can only hope."},{"Title":"Bad News : The Decline of Reporting, the Business of News, and the Danger to Us All","review":"Fenton cites many instances of important events brewing that were never reported, so that when the situation exploded, it seemed to come out of nowhere. An early one was the impending fall of the Shah of Iran, a situation that Fenton personally reported but which was dropped from the broadcasts as not sufficiently interesting. The most spectacular was the news of 9/11 which the New York Times had two days in advance. It chose to put the news on its website but not print it in the newspaper that prints \\"all the news that's fit to print.\\" (p. 6) Fenton's reporting of this long list of unreported news is the major reason for reading this book. \\"Had there been a drumbeat of segments on network news showing the steadily rising Islamist threat abroad, we might be living in a different world now.\\" (p. 5)Fenton's message is that entertainment trumps hard news every time. The causes of this include \\"underfunding, arrogant insularity, contempt for the view's attention span, loss of mission, corporate greed.\\" (p. 191) News media are now owned by corporations that own many other businesses. Profit, or the bottom line, is their mission, not informing the public. This has led them to close foreign news bureaus and to take their \\"news\\" from local feeders. At the same time, salaries for anchors and other stars of the news media have risen from $36,000 for each in the mid-1960s to 12 or 15 million apiece today.\\"Anyone accustomed to watching CNN abroad, or the BBC in England, cannot believe what those channels offer in the U.S. market.\\" (p. 223) \\"They manifestly assume that American tastes simply cannot be raised.\\" Fenton admits that this could be true. \\"Perhaps Americans, particularly younger Americans, have become too fluff-happy, too incapable of concerted attention.\\" (p. 233) (Virtually every book and article on the American education system confirms this.)Bias or \\"spin\\" also is discussed, and Fenton says that it is getting worse. Much of it is corporate in origin, advertisers, etc. However, \\"No one ever mentions the influence of ethnic lobbies or affiliations on American media.\\" (p. 99) \\"Yet neither will you see much on network news about the influence of Saudi money in Washington\\" (p. 103)Fenton mentions blogs and ezines but contends that they are mainly pushing a point of view rather than reporting hard facts.As one solution, Fenton recommends the formation of a news pressure group, perhaps composed of retired newsmen and anchors. The group's first job should be to \\"out\\" news executives who turn down important news stories. The group \\"should run a weekly register of egregious news shortfalls.\\" (p. 236) It should also feature \\"comparative lists of how the media in other countries reported stories differently from ours, or showed us up in reporting what we didn't.\\"Perhaps we could add that a good place to get the news you're not getting is to read the many nonfiction books available here on Amazon.

In a time when so many people have become mental couch potatoes and easy, minimialist sound-bites are sold as \\"fact\\", this book sheds the light on the depth of real world events and affairs and the American role in them--and how it impacts us directly. Once you read this book, you'll never view broadcast and print media \\"reporting\\" the same way."},{"Title":"Bad News : The Decline of Reporting, the Business of News, and the Danger to Us All","review":"In writing this book, Tom Fenton confirms what a lot of us have known for quite some time: the state of the TV news media is pathetic. In this sense it is nothing new. However Fenton supports his allegations with the sort of hard evidence only a reporting insider like himself could. And this is why Bad News is such an essential read.Reading this book, we get a look at the news media with the unique perspective of a 30 year veteran of foreign reporting. Not surprisingly this vantage point provides loads of hard facts proving the decline of substantive reporting on TV. We see the corners cut in Middle East reporting. We see the bottom-line, moneymaking attitude of the networks' top brass. We see the dearth of new talent in foreign news reporting. In short, Fenton argues that the TV news business' unwillingness to invest in foreign newsgathering and real investigation is going to cost us in American lives. A chilling thought.Everyone with a brain knows that something isn't right with our news media. And most of these people have a nagging suspicion that they should know more about the increasingly more dangerous world. Fenton agrees, and with this book will confirm the worst fears of many ordinary Americans."},{"Title":"Bad News : The Decline of Reporting, the Business of News, and the Danger to Us All","review":"After 34 years as a roving reporter for CBS News, Tom Fenton has put his guard down and written a blistering book about how the three networks have failed to provide the American public with the news they deserve. It isn't exactly a groundbreaking topic, but his insider position lends credence to a valid perspective even if he is frequently didactic about it. Fenton justifiably states that the decision makers at the network news regularly kill or downplay unpleasant news from outside the United States, leaving Americans uninformed and consequently unprepared for global trends, such as those that led to our current war with radical fundamentalism. It's a worthy tenet to explore and illuminate, but Fenton just doesn't seem to go far enough to address his claims. He says the problem is a complicated mixture of profit motive, limited vision, skewed ideas about what is good for audiences, and kowtowing to those in political power. That is certainly believable, and the founders of the political watchdog Web site, Spinsanity.com, covered this last point more thoroughly in their enlightening treatise, \\"All the President's Spin: George W. Bush, the Media, and the Truth\\". But Fenton's argument seems rather narrow given the breadth of his argument. He believes that if only the profit-driven executives who control the TV networks would fund some serious reportage -- particularly overseas reportage -- they could revive the media and educate the public. Fenton recognizes the ties of extensive news coverage to the spread of democracy, but he falters in drawing realistic solutions that would appeal to the programming chiefs. Ideas such as extending the evening news to an hour are honestly half-baked in his narrative, so we are left with a valid opinion with no tangible call to action.There is nobility to Fenton's old-school ideas and certainly a passion in his attempt to galvanize America to receive the news they must have in order for our democracy to survive. Yet I am left to surmise that the problems with how citizens receive information in a democratic society are deeper than anything the media can be expected to solve on its own. Even if Fenton articulated that finding, there is little for the reader to think could be done to alleviate this increasingly dire situation. One would have hoped there was beacon of hope with the advent of the 24-hour news channel, but as Fenton rightly states, this has not turned out to be the case, as each network fills their schedule with programming targeted toward the bottom line. Fox News Channel is the most cited offender of throwing logic and balance to the wind, but MSNBC, CNN and all the rest are equally guilty of dropping their commitments to serious reporting. The real value of this book, though, lies not in Fenton's discussion of the lack of foreign correspondents, but rather in his revealing interviews with Dan Rather, Peter Jennings and Tom Brokaw, obviously due to his insider status. Their individual personalities come across vividly in their responses - Brokaw comes across as relatively distant from the topic; Rather is thoughtful but still defensive about the quality of reportage on terrorism pre-9/11; and Jennings is more forthright in his disappointment with the coverage during the same period, unsurprising given his fifteen years as an ABC News foreign correspondent. These perspectives, especially Jennings', provide a look at global news coverage that makes this a worthwhile read."},{"Title":"Bad News : The Decline of Reporting, the Business of News, and the Danger to Us All","review":"Never met Tom Fenton but, both of us being in the same business - network news - I certainly knew of his work and therefore when I became aware of Bad News I just had to own it. Sadly, Fenton hit the nail on the head as he accurately described the decline and fall of quality, straightforward, no holds barred reporting on every level. Quoting other well known colleagues, he relates their personal concerns over the drive for ratings, celebrity and sensationalism over \\"the way it used to be.\\" Not much more to add to this picture nor could I, after a mere 57 years in broadcasting, offer a solution. Not to say there isn't a lot of damn good reporting going on at all the networks, even Fox manages to get it right now and then, but I don't think we'll ever see what we grew up reading and watching. Money talks. Got the book at a wonderful price via Amazon and it arrived in mint condition."},{"Title":"Bad News : The Decline of Reporting, the Business of News, and the Danger to Us All","review":"Fenton's long book title is misleading. His main issue is the lack of US foreign policy coverage on US broadcast television. He ignores issues with domestic and local news. He briefly deals with print journalism. And just casually mentions journalistic blogging.He wants his old job to reclaim the importance and respectability it had during the Cold War. He credits the Cold War days as the reason foreign news correspondents were revered and coverage was at its professional heights.After the Cold War, America lost its fear and vigilance, and the broadcast networks degenerated into profit-seeking infotainment. He also claims that the fall of broadcast news is intimately linked to the earlier fall of foreign news coverage.Fenton wants a national consensus among the public on the importance of foreign news. And he wants journalists to not just present the news, but to push it; doing less is to shirk journalistic responsibility. He ties his arguments for increasing foreign news coverage as bettering the national security of American soil and the international security of American citizens.In Chapter 4, \\"The Culture of Spin\\", Fenton confronts the biases in journalism at all levels. He notes that a majority of it is partisan politics and corporate interests, but other factors are more personal, like a journalist's desires to cling to socioeconomic or \\"ethnic solidarity\\". Fenton also complains in this section that liberalism as a philosophy (and not a party or a political entity), has taken the gumption out of news coverage.Overall, the most useful thing about Fenton's book is that it gave me a strategic historical overview of all the countries relevant to the foreign news still occurring today. And the little insights peppered throughout the book are eye-openers in other ways. Page 171 is particularly singed to my brain, where a mention of \\"the oddly straight-line borders of Iraq\\" highlights the fact that the country didn't develop organically, but is \\"an essentially artificial space.\\" Just by giving me a handy historical rundown, Fenton's lessened my apathy towards foreign news.But despite Fenton's hopes, I feel that the causes of audiences' apathy towards news reporting are bigger and beyond the problems Fenton claims are plaguing journalism. Reviving foreign news coverage might be a step towards the cure, but the apathy runs deep and is intertwined with too many other factors.ULTIMATELY, his huge nostalgia for the Cold War leads to a radical conclusion: what he's essentially calling for, but doesn't say outright, is to elevate US foreign reporting to the level of military intelligence gathering.To the publisher: WHY ARE THERE SO MANY TYPOS AND STRAY WORDS IN THE TEXT? GET A BETTER PROOFREADER!"},{"Title":"Bad News : The Decline of Reporting, the Business of News, and the Danger to Us All","review":"Tom Fenton was a reporter for a broadcast network for four decades, covering Europe and the Middle East. He says much of America depends on the network broadcasters for news about the world. [No mention of news about America.] Since the fall of the Soviet Union networks drastically cut back on foreign news, replacing it with sensationalistic and meaningless news. Fenton doesn't understand the purpose of this: to keep citizens ignorant of the events whether in Washington or in foreign lands. People who know little, like children, are easier to manipulate and exploit. The owners of a network can do as they please, and they please the Government that controls their money-making machine. Do Clinton and Bush really want the American people to know what they're doing overseas? Don't broadcasters want a larger audience, no matter what? Fenton is arguing for a system that would reduce profits and the credibility of the US Government, and that won't happen soon. If Fenton were serious, he would recommend short-wave radio to hear foreign broadcasts in English. But that has its drawbacks. A good solution would be a weekly newspaper devoted to foreign news. But who would own and control it? Was the foreign news broadcast back in the 1970s and 1980s all that great?The bottom line is this: do the networks, and the Govt., really want us to know there were no \\"weapons of mass destruction\\" in Iraq? That the 1989 invasion of Panama was not needed for America?That \\"globalization\\" is a fraud to impoverish the American people? That Reagan and Bush I supported Osama Bin Ladin?The American public was not informed ahead of time for many big stories (p.3). This is by design of the networks (p.4). The real truth is that most Americans will not waste their time listening to \\"talking heads\\" in a foreign land unless it is relevant. And that eliminates most of the background news that Fenton would want broadcast. You could ask how much of this news is shown on British, French, German, or Italian TV. Could it be that the American voter is irrelevant in a system of fixed and rigged elections, where the Corporations and the President do as they wish? Why did it take so long for the media to break the story of prisoner abuse at Abu Ghraib (p.10)? Has outsourcing damaged the credibility of TV news (p.12)?There is no entry in the index for \\"Westmoreland\\". After CBS successfully defended itself against the General, it was sold to new owners. What changes did they make? [See pages 71-72.] Did the FBI fail to follow up the connections to the 1993 WTC attack (p.21)?. Are the network news the equivalent of junk food (p.22)? Was there really \\"a massive and damaging cutback in military and intelligence funding\\" (p.27)? Fenton summarizes the events in Russia on page 30; was this so reported on TV? Fenton says America last saw the horrors of war in 1814; he had overlooked the Civil War, the Indian Wars, even the incursion into 1916 Texas. Fenton uses \\"60 Minutes\\" as a showpiece; but you should know that the questions asked are often created in editing to add drama to the subject's answers! Fenton tells about foreign bureaus (p.65), but not of their work product. The events noted on page 81 can be best covered in a magazine article, not in a few minutes of TV. Chapter 4 documents the use and abuse of the press (p.97). Does the rest of the world get better news (Chapter 5)? \\"Voices Inside the Industry\\" say the reporting of world news is inadequate (p.143). Chapter 7 says we know little of what our Govt. is doing around the world, and its not in the nightly news. Censorship of foreign news is Washington's policy (pp.207-213). What can be done?Chapter 9 has his \\"Solutions\\". Like other special-interest pleaders, he claims that what benefits him is good for the country. My experience is that 30 minutes with your local newspaper will tell you more than TV news.

This book is not a normal Dilbert book either, rather then being just a collection of about nine months worth of daily and Sunday comics it's full of big ( one taking up a full page ) origninal strips specially made for this book featuring the master of wit and sarcasm Dogbert as he explains basic human ediquit in a hillarious and true to life manner. ( let's see how many times I can write the words &quot; Hillarious &quot; and true to life &quot; ) Even though this book was obviously made as a clever market ploy by Scott Adams to get the strip off the ground and get a little more cash in his pocket ( in the early days the strip was not phenomana that it is today, infact sales were less then mediocre ) it's still clear that he had alot of fun making this book and you'll have alot of fun reading it. This book was made before Dilbert became a comic strictly composed of workplace humor so it focuses on all sorts of topics. Personally I wish the strip would be more like that now. I mean I think the office gags are really funny, but now that Scott has achieved his maximum popularity I wish he would go back to some of the old formula's again and have Dogbert make some clever sarcastic shemes again that don't have to do with bussiness consulting. So in short, if your a Dogbert fan or you've never even read the Dilbert comic or your a fan of sarcastic humor, or you just plain like buying stuff because it's out there then buy this book and prepare to be cheered up for about thirty-five minutes.Hillarious and true to life!"},{"Title":"Clues for the Clueless (Dogbert N' Dilbert's Humour at Work)","review":"This is the book that got me originally hooked on Dilbert, and I still think it is Scott Adams' best work. The Dilbert strip, over the years, has gotten to be less about life as a well-meaning nerd, and more about the workplace, and I think a lot of very good humor has gotten lost. The humor here covers everything from dating etiquiette, to explaining why the extra fork is there, to dealing with insurance companies. Much more amusing than simply complaining about incompetent managers !"},{"Title":"Clues for the Clueless (Dogbert N' Dilbert's Humour at Work)","review":"While the Dilbert comic strip lampoons the business environment, this collection of cartoons does the same for social situations, although some of the socializing is done in a business environment. The main characters are those of the Dilbert strip and each page covers a topic that is a social situation, where the situation is established in the caption in the upper left corner of the page. The remaining three images of the page put forward \\"solutions\\" to the problem. Some of the topics are:*) Voice mail etiquette*) Complimenting another's spouse (wife)*) Discouraging a serial talker*) Excusing yourself from bores*) Pregnancy and weightThe solutions to the problems are almost all in the category, \\"I have so often wanted to do that.\\" They generally involve executing some rather rude actions; the combination is what makes them funny. While no socially intelligent person would react the way people are depicted in these cartoons, that does not stop you from fantasizing that you did and this book will help you do that."},{"Title":"Clues for the Clueless (Dogbert N' Dilbert's Humour at Work)","review":"Once again, Scott Adams has made it.

Before, I didn't understand the office jokes, but these jokes were simpler, but still, very funny. These comics weren't printed in newspapers. It's a guide on being polite, told by the all time most sarcastic dog of the comics, Dogbert. He guides you into proper etiquette, with cynical insights on what to do when you don't want to offer the last donut to anyone, or when you're in an office elevator. These jokes are just as humorously fresh as the business jokes, but totally different. I recommend this book for Dilbert and Dogbert fans, or for people who want to start becoming one. This book introduced me to Dogbert, and lead me into becoming a huge Dilbert fan. Excellent book."},{"Title":"Clues for the Clueless (Dogbert N' Dilbert's Humour at Work)","review":"Wow.

It was a required book for a psychology class and the information was just what was needed to get me through the course."},{"Title":"People and places","review":"This work first came out in 1954. It is that edition that I am reviewing here. This 262 page volume contains several hundred prints and drawings, halftone reproductions, black and white of some of the best prints and drawings in the world. This collection was put together and edited by Paul J. Sachs and of course has been around for years, and is thankfully still in print, or at least, easily found. I must admit that this work hold special place for me, as it is the first \\"art book\\" I had access to as a child. I spent hours and hours pouring over the pictures and text. The old hardback copy I have now is getting pretty ragged, not unlike myself, but still gets a going over every time I go into one of my nostalgic moods. (I also have to admit, that in 1954 the nudes featured in this work were pretty heavy stuff for a ten year old boy..even better than National Geographic!)The book is divided into several chapters, David and the Great Moderns of the Past, Cezanne and Post-Impressionism, The School of Paris, Matisse and the Fauves, Cubism, Surrealism, Expressionism and the Abstract Art in North Europe, Italy, England, Mexico and the United States. The works of approximately 115 artists are represented here. Sachs (more about him later) has made a short comment on each work. He, Sachs has included works that he felt were important, but fully admits that it is far beyond all inclusive. He has given us a brief history of each artist in the back of the book.As a side note; the story of Paul J. Sachs himself is quite fascinating (it is not covered in this book) as he was one of the members involved in the \\"Albertina Affair,\\" when the Archduke Alberecht of Hungry tried to sell off the entire collection of prints and drawings from under the Austrian Government's noses. This is probably the finest collection in the world. Fortunately (for Austria, I suppose), the plot was foiled, the art work nationalized, etc. etc. This would make a great story within itself.Anyway, this work has brought a lot of joy to me over the years, starting when I was a very small boy. I realize there are many, many volumes of this ilk out there, and I am quite sure some of them are better. I do know that this particular volume certainly meant a lot to me, and still does. I cannot see how anyone with the slightest interest in art would not enjoy it and find it useful, even today. Recommend this one highly.D.

This book totally altered my view of death, and of how I might better live my life until the moment of death. It wasn't the easiest book to read, with the ideas being so new, so profound, but I am glad I stuck with it. Reading this book requires concentration, but the subject was so fascinating that I found myself wanting to understand and if necessary reading some passages again.

The author, Bill Thomas, is an unabashed enthusiast about his subject, and this has produced a peerless book. The color photography is simply awesome, and copiously covers each selected wetland. It proves beyond doubt that not all swamps are alike, or even closely akin. The text is enjoyable, easily read, and dovetails closely with the many photographs. In each instance, the location, ecology, and human history of the subject wetland is thoroughly addressed. You will be amazed at how much you learn, and how pleasurable it is to do this.Thomas covers 21 American swamps, ranging from the Everglades, to the Great Swamp of New Jersey, to the Dismal Swamp of Virginia/North Carolina, to the swamp atop Mount Waialeale in Kauai, Hawaii. I would like to have seen some coverage of some of the swamps of Northern Minnesota and Michigan, however.The book is also a powerful argument to preserve our wetlands, and offers a multitude of sensible economic and aesthetic reasons in support of this plea. Thomas ends this book with a delightful chapter on how to build a swamp in your own backyard. This does not include how to educate your neighbors on the virtue of this endeavor, though!I thoroughly enjoyed this book, and, as it is written for anyone with a love of nature, recommend it highly to all."},{"Title":"War, Peace, And The Social Order (Foundations of Social Inquiry)","review":"Although Brian Fogarty's War and Peace and the Social Order probably is intended for sociologists and for classroom use, I fall into neither category and read and enjoyed the entire book. It's interesting, well written, and flows smoothly. Fogarty understands the basic principle of writing: he begins each paragraph with a topic sentence and follows it with several supporting examples. These illustrations are one of the great strenghs of the book: they include comparisons between older, traditonal societies and modern ones, movements such as civil rights and the women's equality movement, and the cooperation of the German people with the Nazi's during WW II, etc. The second chapter is heavy on theory and the fifth chapter on the military industrial complex is mindbogglingly complex, but that seems to be the way things are with military mathematics.These chapters are necessary, however, and the reader shouldn't ignore them just because they require effort. The book as a whole is an excellent mesh of theory and concrete examples. The author provides a wide variety of illustrations on ways to achieve peace through non-violent social justice movements i.e. Ghandi's &quot;change of heart.&quot; Fogarty handles a big topic in a small book. He does it well. His book is an excellent tool for a citizen who cares about his or her society to become educated on an imporant subject and to learn how to act congruent with that that knowledge."},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"This work was translated and written by a basically uneducated farm boy, Joseph Smith Jr. It contains archeological facts and methods of ancient times that scholars are just finding out about now, such as written histories on metal plates.

God made this book possible through his servant and prophet Joseph Smith.

The book is truly what it claims to be, another testament of Jesus Christ."},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"I grew up Catholic but after I graduated from grade school I stopped practicing Catholicism. I was actually ignorant of Catholic teachings, because I always thought that they knew that God was three separate and distinct beings.But when I was in the eighth grade, I heard a Catholic priest say that God was a being who, at any given time, could manifest himself as either the Father, or the Son, or the Holy Ghost. He stated that God only manifested himself as one of the three when the need arose and that the three did not exist separately. I pointed out that during the Savior's baptism, the Father spoke from Heaven while the Holy Ghost descended in the form of a dove. I also said that Jesus prayed to his Father in Heaven. He didn't pray to himself. The priest got angry, and I knew that Catholicism was not the truth.In 1980, at the age of 22, I confessed my sins to God, and knowing that my sins had been forgiven, I considered myself to be a \\"Born Again Christian.\\"I started trying to find a church to join in October 1997. It would be nine months before I would meet with success. I did, however, discover for myself that an apostasy had taken place and that the churches had \\"fallen away.\\"I first had quite a negative experience with a certain church in November and December of 1997. After attending several of their meetings and hearing them talk about Jesus Christ, I found out that they did not believe in repentance. Even when I told a group of them that forgiveness of sins comes by confessing to God that you are a sinner, they still did not have a clue as to what I was talking about.In January 1998, I saw ad on television for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints that said they would send a free copy of the King James Bible. Since I took my Bible with me to read when I rode the bus, I thought it would be a good idea to have a second one just in case I lost the one I had. I called the 800 # and ordered it, but I moved in February and never received it.I continued to search for the right church, always praying to our Father in the name of Jesus Christ that He would give me guidance. With each church that I tried, the Spirit would tell me to keep looking.By the second week of June 1998, I was getting somewhat desperate. I began fasting and praying to find the right church. I would go without eating every Tuesday and Saturday from midnight to midnight.Around the second week of July 1998, the Spirit told me to call that 800 #. I didn't have the 800 # and I got rid of my television when I moved. So, I looked in the phone book, called the Washington DC Temple, and asked for the 800 #. After I called it, they said that the Bible might take up to 4 weeks to get to me. Well I didn't want to wait, and I thought I would just go to the Temple and pick one up. (I didn't know at the time that Bibles were not given out at the Temple. Mormon Missionaries will bring one to you, or you can go to an LDS chapel on Sunday and get one from the missionaries who are there.)I checked the bus schedules and found out which bus I needed to take to get to the Temple. I went about my business of trying to expose corruption in the government and, in the course of doing so, I needed to take the very bus that would take me to the Temple. I was actually going to drop off some information with someone when I got on that bus.As the bus traveled down the street, I could see the huge trees far off up ahead looking nice and sculpted. I could see something barely sticking up over one of the trees. (It was the very top of the angel Moroni!) It grabbed my attention and I couldn't take my eyes off it. I had to know what was there. Of course, as the bus got closer, it wasn't getting any easier for me to see.The bus continued down Stoneybrook Drive and as it went around the turn I tried to look to see what was there but I couldn't see anything through the heavy foliage. Then the bus passed the signs for the Temple and the Visitors Center and I thought to myself, \\"That's where it is! I just have to get off at that bus stop.\\"I continued on to where I was going that day, and the next day I went and got on that same bus and got off at the Temple. As I walked across the parking lot, I prayed, \\"Father, in the name of Jesus I pray that I will know if this is the truth.\\"I went into the Visitors' Center and told Elder Rich, who was serving a senior mission, about not wanting to wait for a Bible. He said, \\"No problem. I'll have the missionaries over there next week.\\"Regarding the Church and the Book of Moromon, he said to me, \\"Now, you are going to have to ask God if this is true.\\" I immediately started thinking I was in the right place because I had just done that.I watched a movie about the First Vision, and I took home a pamphlet entitled \\"Testimony of the Prophet Joseph Smith.\\"Elder Kevin Mills, a missionary from Jamaica, handed me the Book Of Mormon on Tuesday, July 21, 1998. I didn't know anything about the missionary \\"discussions\\" at that time and after we chatted for a bit, I said, \\"Well, I have to get started reading.\\"Elder Mills said, \\"Oh! You have some reading to do?\\"I said, \\"Yeah. The Book Of Mormon.\\" I started reading it right away.I had read the New Testament twice in my 9-month search for the right church {God was preparing me to be led to the church}, and I knew the criterion for true prophets and false prophets. It is in 1 John, 4:1-3; \\"Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world. Hereby know ye the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God: And every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God: and this is that spirit of antichrist, whereof ye have heard that it should come; and even now already is it in the world.\\"The Book Of Mormon is all about Jesus Christ coming to Earth and dying for the sins of man, and the way to find salvation is to confess to God that you are a sinner. In fact, it goes into detail on it by page 19, and it keeps getting better after that.On Thursday, July 23rd, two days after receiving the Book Of Mormon, I called Elder Mills and said, \\"I know this to be the word of God.\\"I could feel the spirit at the other end of the phone line. He mentioned something to me about lessons (there were 6 missionary discussions needed before someone could get baptized), and I thought, \\"I've got the word of God in my hands! I don't need lessons.\\" I told him I would get back to him on that.I prayed about it as I continued reading the Book Of Mormon and the spirit told me to get the lessons, so I called Elder Mills on Friday and said I was going to get the lessons. He asked me if I wanted to go to church on Sunday and I jumped at the chance, as I knew I should go to church on Sunday and I hadn't been checking out any other churches.On Sunday, July 26th, I attended my first Sacrament Meeting and I was very far into the Book Of Mormon at this point. There happened to be a baptism that day, and Elder Mills and I went to it. We were both filled with the spirit and the excitement about my already having a strong testimony of the Book Of Mormon.Elder Mills said, \\"We're going to get all those lessons in this week and I'm going to baptize you next week!\\"As I took the lessons, the spirit was prompting me on things to read in the Bible while I was at home. I read John 5:19 and Revelation 3:21, and when I saw the Elders again, I pointed out that in Revelation 3:21, the Savior said, \\"To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne.\\"Then I pointed out that in John 5:19, the Savior said, \\"The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father do: for what things soever he doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise.\\"I said that if the Son can't do anything unless the Father has done it, and the Son overcame and was set down in his throne, then our Heavenly Father overcame and was set down in his throne. The Bible says so, and Jesus Christ said so.\\"Does this church teach that?\\" I asked. And the Elders nodded with wide-eyed astonishment.The subject of the church not having any paid priests came up. Now, they had told me about the apostasy early on, and I had been prompted by the spirit to read Micah 3:10-11 the evening before the subject of paid priests came up. I pointed out to them that in Micah 3:10-11, it says, \\"They build up Zion with blood, and Jerusalem with iniquity. The heads thereof judge for reward, and the priests thereof teach for hire, and the prophets thereof divine for money yet will they lean upon the Lord, and say, Is not the Lord among us? none evil can come upon us.\\" Not having priests who \\"teach for hire\\" was just more proof that the true Gospel of Jesus Christ had been restored.They brought up the laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost, which would happen after I was baptized. I, again, had read it in the Bible the night before. It is in Acts 8:14-17; \\"Now when the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John: Who, when they were come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Ghost: (For as yet he was fallen upon none of them: only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.) Then laid they their hands on them, and they received the Holy Ghost.\\" More proof that the restoration of the Savior's church had taken place.After attending my second sacrament meeting on August 2, 1998, I was baptized that same day. I've read the Book Of Mormon from beginning to end more than twenty times since being baptized, and I will continue to do so for the rest of my life.And I should add that the Book of Mormon was not written \\"by Joseph Smith.\\" It was written by ancient prophets and brought forth by the power of God when the only true gospel of Jesus Christ was restored in 1830. Joseph Smith was the prophet through whom Jesus Christ restored his one true church. He is not the \\"author\\" of the Book of Mormon."},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"this book, a companion to the bible, offers me hope in an often hopeless world. it answered many spiritual questions and provides comfort and guidance each time i read it! i encourage you to explore the wonders of the Book of Mormon for yourself!"},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"I hear all of these people talk about whether this book is true or false.

In my childhood, I went to church every Sunday and there I developed a love for the word of God. I have read the Bible cover to cover and I have read the New Testament several times over. How couldn't I? The truth that it teaches about the Savior, Jesus Christ, and the exemplary life that He led have led me to know that he is my only Savior and Redeemer.I have also read the Book of Mormon. I just finished reading it for the thirty-sixth time, and I know that it too is the word of God. It teaches and testifies of the Savior Jesus Christ. It teaches that He is the only Person through whom anyone can be saved. I know that because I've read it. It is inspired scripture of God, written by God himself through His prophets. In fact, the majority of the Book of Mormon was written before Jesus Christ's birth. Furthermore, just like the Bible, the Book of Mormon teaches that God answers prayer. I have prayed and asked God if the Book of Mormon is His scripture and He has answered my prayers by the power of the Holy Ghost. I know that God will answer the prayers of anyone who reads it and prays about it with a sincere heart and real intent. I know that because I've experienced it.

The book makes two extraordinary claims: first, that it is an authentic ancient text that was recovered and translated in the early 1800s by Joseph Smith; and second, that both the writing of the original text and its translation by Smith into English were directly inspired by the God of the Judeo-Christian Bible. Thus the Book of Mormon claims to be both a reliable historical record of ancient American civilizations and a supplement to the Bible--a truly new testament for the modern era.Consequently, most criticism of the Book of Mormon has focused on these two interconnected claims. Is this book an authentic divine revelation? True believers have, over the last 170 years, united themselves to the Latter-day Saint religious movement. Disbelievers have condemned the book as either an audacious fraud or a demonic deception. The invective over the book has often grown quite personal, particularly between the main body of Latter-day Saints (also known as Mormons) and evangelical Protestants who view Mormonism as a heretical &quot;cult.&quot;In all the fuss and furor over the Book of Mormon, however, few people seem to take a truly honest view of it as literature. Whether one views it as a divine revelation written by ancient prophets or as a work of fiction by a 19th century American, I think that all can agree that the Book of Mormon is a work of literature which bears the marks of purposeful construction on the part of any human who had a hand in its creation. Even the belief that the author (or authors) was a prophet does not erase the possibility of human creative agency. After all, a divine being may inspire an author, but that inspiration must be channeled through that author's abilities as a textual craftsperson.And so the question thus arises: Apart from the Book of Mormon's value as a spiritual guide (or, if you prefer, danger as a spiritual counterfeit), is it a great work of literature? And where does it fit in the vast library of human literature? Personally, I think it's a pretty good yarn with some fascinating touches in the areas of form and style. And with regard to its place in world literature, I place it among the great body of works which consciously respond to, rewrite, or affirm the Judeo-Christian Bible: the Qur'an, John Milton's &quot;Paradise Lost,&quot; many of the poems of William Blake, other &quot;American Bibles&quot; like Mary Baker Eddy's &quot;Science and Health,&quot; novels like Zora Neale Hurston's &quot;Moses, Man of the Mountain,&quot; biblically-inspired horror films like &quot;The Omen,&quot; and many other texts.As I said, I found the Book of Mormon to be quite compelling as a story. It is truly a narrative with an epic vision: it tells the story of two great migrations from the Old World to the Americas, and of the great civilizations that rose and fell from the seeds thus planted. The overall narrative spans many centuries of war, political intrigue, and cultural clashes. It is a vast tapestry whose scope calls to mind the &quot;Star Wars&quot; saga or similar multigenerational science fiction epics.Within this greater narrative are embedded many gems of localized storytelling and poetic imagery. Check out, for example, Lehi's vision of the tree of life (1 Nephi 8), the parable of the seed (Alma 32), or the story of the Jaredite ocean voyage (Ether 6). That last story contains a marvelous description of ancient submarine-like vessels being lit by a strange phosphorescent element.The construction of the Book of Mormon should excite literary scholars interested in theories about narrative. The text has multiple narrators, some of whom comment on the other narrators. Furthermore, the book's progression moves back and forth chronologically (yet another similarity to some of my favorite science fiction sagas).Of course, the Book of Mormon has its drawbacks. While the overwhelming focus on the person of Jesus Christ makes the book priceless to the Mormon faithful, this element presents a stumbling block to the faithful of other &quot;Abrahamic&quot; religions which clash with Mormonism. And secular readers will probably find the book's Christocentricity tiresome and preachy. The book's relative lack of strong female characters has been a point of criticism. Some of the book's racial and ethnic themes (see, for example, 2 Nephi 5) are disturbing. And many will find some of the narrative voices' direct addresses to the reader to sound like spiritual blackmail of the &quot;believe me or you'll be sorry&quot; variety.Moreover, this edition of the Book of Mormon is explicitly geared towards the faithful of the Utah-based Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (and potential converts). It is thus not really an appropriate edition of the Book of Mormon for a pluralistic context (such as a literature course in a public university).These concerns aside, I believe the Book of Mormon to be an important and fascinating work of American literature--a true hidden classic. I found it interesting that one of the great American plays of the 1990s, Tony Kushner's two-part epic &quot;Angels in America,&quot; draws deeply from the Book of Mormon with regard to the play's themes, plot, and characters. If an artist of Kushner's stature can give the Book of Mormon such serious consideration, perhaps it is time for the Book of Mormon to enjoy a wider audience that can finally appreciate and discuss the text as a work of literature, and not merely as a lightning rod for sectarian controversy."},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"Congratulations to Amazon for carrying the new addition of the Book of Mormon. I have read this book at least 20 times and find it to be a fasinating and inspiring account of the early inhabitants of the American continent. It's primary purpose is to be a second witness for Jesus Christ, and it accomplishes that goal in a magnificent way.

You can read the selected passages they give you and the well or not so well writen arguments to suport their positions. This book is definitely one that has had an inpact on american society and westward expansion. It has also been the linchpin in the expansion of one of the fastest growing world wide churchs. Any book that can spark such a motion of contraversy or make such change on the world seen is atleast going to be a good read if nothing but from a secular point of veiw. Once read you will have the information from the sorce and not have to rely on my or anyone elses bias opinion of the book. From a spiritual side once again there are many arguments on both ends, I can assure you that there are many that would point to the Bible and say that is the end all of revelation. A litle history of how the Bible was formed and its cronology would go a long way in dispelling this but I don't wish to get into that. Suficient to say that reading this book in no way will damn you as Paul encourages you to test all things and hold to that which is of God. You can not test this book if you don't read it. There are too many acusations flying to get an unbias opinion so form one for yourself, read it cover to cover and not litle paseges with selective use of quotation marks. As for myself, all the dots conect. I've found that its true and that combined with the bible it puts things into a simpler and complete perspective... spiritualy speaking.

And no matter who we are, We all need something bigger than ourselves to help us through. Yes, my friends..this is indeed a book review. But it is also more than that, because it's something more than a good book I've read. There are books that have made me laugh, question my intentions, remember good and badtimes in my life and brought me to tears...but the Book of Mormon has done more than that. It's brought me peace. There is so much hate these days. So much trauma, and drama and ugliness. Amidst all of that, is our Savior Jesus Christ. Our Elder Brother and our Friend. This, my friends, is a book about Him. And He brings me peace. I feel that peace when I read the Bible as well. I feel that peace when I see people serving each other and loving each other..of all different religions and backgrounds. I feel that peace when I pray. I feel peace. In this world, at this time, I need that. Someone who loved me enough to give His life for me. Because He loves me. He loves each one of us no matter who we are, what we believe, where we've been or where we are going. A book that reminds me of Him, that reminds me of who I am and who He wants me to be..and who He knows I can be...is a blessing. Yes, I am a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. The Book of Mormon has brought me closer to Christ...through Him I have found peace in my life.

Such arguments have been going on regarding the Bible for thousands of years. To this day half of the Bible (the New Testament) is disregarded as an unauthorized addition by Jews who reverence the Torah. See, Deut 4:2.The Book of Mormon from its title page purports to be one thing--Another Testament of Jesus Christ. New scripture from a God who is following the same pattern He has followed for generations; new scripture to complement the old. The Book of Mormon is for persons who wonder why the Bible stopped--who wonder where the prophets have gone. For a good long time the world wasn't ready to have a prophet. In the 1830's, in a country with unlimited possibility and unprecedented religious freedom, God again revealed Himself to a prophet. I find it curious that people who revere prophets such as Moses, Abraham, Daniel, the Apostle Paul and others will not test claims of a modern prophet. I wonder if Isaiah had trouble distributing his book--it demands a close reading, was doctrinally controversial and probably disturbed the governing orthodoxy. But that is the way God works, He allows us to decide whether to read the book.The Book of Mormon is the means given by God to test the veracity of the man who brought it forth--Joseph Smith. It is a test--no more no less. The Book of Mormon itself at Moroni Chapter 10 (the last chapter of the entire work) at verses 3-5 is instructive: \\"Behold, I would exhort you that when ye shall read these things, if it be wisdom in God that ye should read them, that ye would remember how merciful the Lord hath been unto the children of men, from the creation of Adam even down until the time that ye shall receive these things, and ponder it in your hearts. And when ye shall receive these things, I would exhort you that ye would ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these things are not true; and if ye shall ask with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ, he will manifest the truth of it unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost. And by the power of the Holy Ghost ye may know the truth of all things.\\"So, instead of engaging in argument, test the Book. Read it and ask God whether it is true. I have. It is."},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"First, I'd like to say that I feel like comments from the bigots who worship the Bible more than their God are a personal attack and inspired by hatred. They might even inspire hate crimes. God certainly has never taught men to hate each other. Second, the book is wonderful. It does change lives, but will not changed lives of those obsessed with hatred and seeking more religious persecution in the world. Read this book as a sacred text, objectively, but with God (if God is biased with literature, then I guess you'll just have to deal with that). This is the most important part. Read it in the context given, and not by any of the archaeology or genetics that will neither prove nor disprove it. Don't read literature that would encourage our extermination or the complete destruction of our religion. Also, how many times does the church have to repeat its name? It is the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in English. A Igreja de Jesus Cristo dos Santos dos &Uacute;ltimos Dias in Portuguese. La Iglesia de Jesucristo de los Santos de los &Uacute;ltimos D&iacute;as in Spanish. What more do you want? That is the correct name of the church. Unlike a select and sociopathic few who claim to be Christian, Christians worship God through sacred texts, but we do not worship the texts themselves above God.

Harold Bloom, an eminent Yale scholar, said it was the work of an \\"authentic religious genius.\\" (The American Religion, ISBN 0671867377).But Mormons believe the Book of Mormon is much more than an interesting story. They believe it is scripture, a companion to the Holy Bible.Why does anyone need more scriptures, when we've already got the Bible? In the Bible, Paul said, \\"In the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established\\" (2 Corinthians 13:1). Mormons believe the Book of Mormon complements the Bible, and that by studying one you can better understand the other.Joseph Smith claimed he translated ancient records by the gift and power of God, and then published it in 1830 as the Book of Mormon. He also claimed to be a modern prophet and to receive revelations from God. Isn't that blasphemy? Yes, unless Joseph Smith really was prophet. For this reason, Mormons say the Book of Mormon is the keystone of their religion. If Joseph Smith lied, then the Mormon church was founded on a hoax. If the book is true, Joseph Smith was a prophet and the church he founded was the work of God.Millions of people have read the Book of Mormon, and have felt the Holy Spirit testify to their hearts that its words are true. I encourage you to read it with an open mind and an open heart, and decide for yourself. I have read it many times, and this book is amazing. It gives me spiritual strength and it helps me try to follow the teachings of Jesus, as taught in both the Book of Mormon and the Bible. I have felt the witness of the Spirit that this book is true.Just as you can't prove God exists, you can't prove the Book of Mormon is authentic. Ultimately, you must take these on faith. That's the point of this life's test - to walk by faith. However, this does not mean there is no evidence that that the Book of Mormon is authentic. For starters, I recommend you look into these two books by Hugh Nibley: Since Cumorah (ISBN 0875791395) and Lehi in the Desert and the World of the Jaredites (ISBN 0875791328 or ASIN 0884940225). Also read the essay on the Book of Mormon in this book: Storyteller in Zion, by Orson Scott Card (ASIN 1573458082).As you read the Book of Mormon, ask yourself, \\"Could this have been written by a barely educated, 25-year-old farmer in the early 1800's?\\" The narrative and the cultures described are complex. The events span 1000 years of history. The language is rich and often literary. The ideas are profound, yet in harmony with the Bible.Mormons believe the purpose of both the Bible and the Book of Mormon is to lead a person to Jesus Christ and His teachings. The central theme of the Book of Mormon is Jesus Christ. It contains many witnesses of Him. Here are a few samples:\\"We talk of Christ, we rejoice in Christ, we preach of Christ, we prophesy of Christ, and we write according to our prophecies, that our children may know to what source they may look for a remission of their sins.\\" (2 Ne. 25: 26, page 100.)\\"For three days and for three nights was I racked, even with the pains of a damned soul. And as I was thus ... harrowed up by the memory of my many sins, I remembered to have heard my father prophesy unto the people concerning the coming of one Jesus Christ, a Son of God, to atone for the sins of the world. Now, as my mind caught hold upon this thought, I cried within my heart: O Jesus, thou Son of God, have mercy on me, who am in the gall of bitterness, and am encircled about by the everlasting chains of death. And now, when I thought this, I could remember my pains no more; yea, I was harrowed up by the memory of my sins no more. And oh, what joy, and what marvelous light I did behold; yea, my soul was filled with joy.\\" (Alma 36: 16-20, page 299.)\\"And now, I would commend you to seek this Jesus of whom the prophets and apostles have written, that the grace of God the Father, and also the Lord Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost, which beareth record of them, may be and abide in you forever.\\" (Ether 12:41, page 511.)\\"And the angel spake unto me again, saying: Look! And I looked, and I beheld the Lamb of God going forth among the children of men. And I beheld multitudes of people who were sick, and who were afflicted with all manner of diseases, and with devils and unclean spirits; and the angel spake and showed all these things unto me. And they were healed by the power of the Lamb of God; and the devils and the unclean spirits were cast out. And it came to pass that the angel spake unto me again, saying: Look! And I looked and beheld the Lamb of God, that he was taken by the people; yea, the Son of the everlasting God was judged of the world; and I saw and bear record. And I, Nephi, saw that he was lifted up upon the cross and slain for the sins of the world.\\" (1 Nephi 11: 31-33, page 21.)\\"O how great the goodness of our God, who prepareth a way for our escape from the grasp of this awful monster; yea, that monster, death and hell... Hell must deliver up its captive spirits, and the grave must deliver up its captive bodies, and the bodies and the spirits of men will be restored one to the other; and it is by the power of the resurrection of the Holy One of Israel.\\" (2 Ne. 9: 10-12, page 73.)"},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"what a wonderful book this is! in companionship with the holy bible it is a wonderful way to learn abot God and the meaning of life. it truly is another testament of Jesus Christ."},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"How can a book which brings people closer to Jesus Christ be anything but great.

COMDecember 25, 2004My appreciation of the BOOK OF MORMON as a volume of scared scripture is based upon a personal relationship with God. Varied experiences throughout my life have led me away from Him or toward Him. As I have read and studied the BOOK OF MORMON at different times in my life I have learned a lot about myself. I have learned a lot about my Savior, Jesus Christ.For me the BOOK OF MORMON is \\"another testament\\" of the Savior and His work on behalf of His Father. It is a modern-day, comforting, motivating witness of God's love for each and every one of us on the face of this earth. I know the BOOK OF MORMON as a companion volume to the BIBLE. The BIBLE is the stick of Judah. The BOOK OF MORMON is the stick of Joseph. (See Ezekiel 37: 15-19.)It makes sense! The BOOK OF MORMON does not negate the BIBLE. The BOOK OF MORMON answers important questions and makes the BIBLE more meaningful and clear to me. The BOOK OF MORMON affirms the truths to be found in the BIBLE.At this season of the year, most of us have once again read the Christmas story as recorded in one or all of the New Testament gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John? (I.E., Luke 2:11-32...) Yet, just as awe-inspiring, if not more so for me, are BOOK OF MORMON prophecies regarding the Savior's birth--and the events leading up to it. \\"Christmas in Zarahemla\\" is a glorious story recorded in the Book of Helaman, Chapters 14 & 16, as well as in Third Nephi, Chapter 1.I consider myself lucky to have a copy of the BOOK OF MORMON and the BIBLE! I trust the words I read in both--for both tell me that God lives and that Jesus Christ, His son, is my redeemer. As I \\"exercise faith\\" I am happy and reassured. To know that God is the same yesterday, today, and forever is one of the most profound correlates I have found between the BOOK OF MORMON and the BIBLE. What an impact this has on my life! In this fast-paced, unpredictable, often unsavory world, I have God on my side. God is reliable. God is someone upon whom we can all depend--no matter what.I highly recommend the BOOK OF MORMON to you if you wish to deepen your relationship with God.

Quite frankly, I love the book. I know that the Bible is the word of God. I know this because of how it makes me feel as I read from it's pages. I know that it persuades mankind to believe in God and to love each other. I believed that the Bible was the ONLY word of God until I actually READ the Book of Mormon.What an amazing experience. As I read from it's pages for the first time, I felt a warm feeling inside each day as I read it, as if I was being filled with energy. I read it as scripture, but also as history and philosophy. The teachings make so much sense. And many things that aren't very clear in the Bible (evident by the thousands of religions that believe in the bible, however ALL believe different things) became so very clear upon reading the Book of Mormon. The Book of Mormon testifies to the truth of the Bible. I understand why the phrase was added &quot;another testiment of Jesus Christ&quot;, because like the Bible, the Book of Mormon testifies that Jesus Christ is the Son of the Living God. This book has brought me so close to Christ and answered questions that I wouldn't normally have been able to have answered.I recommend reading the Book of Mormon and contacting the missionaries from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (the fastest growing church in the world) to learn more about the Book of Mormon and other scriptures that God has revealed to men on earth.God does speak to mankind in our day, just as he did in the time of Noah and Moses. If you listen, you can hear.I know that the Book of Mormon is true. That it is the word of God and was translated by Joseph Smith a true prophet of God. I know that these things are true because I have prayed and asked God if they are true and I have received answers to my prayers. And you can too."},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"The Book of Mormon, written by Joseph Smith, is a perfect example of the perceptions and views of people living in the early 1800's. It claims to be an historical record of the Native Americans. The book describes the dark skin of the Native Americans to be a curse from God. It teaches that the natives changed their skin color at different times depending on their righteousness. The Book of Mormon claims that white skin is desirable over dark skin, or it's own terms \\"dark and loathsome\\" to describe dark skin and \\"white and delightsome\\" to describe the lighter skinned people. This is a perfect example of the racial opinions and attitudes of the people in the 1800's.Even though Mormons claim that the Book of Mormon is an historical document, written by prophets, it is very problematic in it's descriptions of the Native Americans and their way of life. Apart from calling them \\"dark and loathsome\\", the Book of Mormon also claims that the Native Americans had horses, steel swords, metal armor, chariots along with a host of old world flora and fauna. It is commonly known that the Native Americans did not have Horses, the wheel, steel swords etc. until the Europeans arrived.I recommend reading this book if you enjoy reading a piece of history. Joseph Smith convinced many people that the book was a real historical record written by prophets in the Americas. Many people even today ignore commonly known facts so they can still believe in it.I find little value in the Book of Mormon as spiritual guide, but it can be fun to read to see what the prevailing opinions and views of religion were in the 1800's that is why I give it 4 stars"},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"This book has changed my life. And one of the greatest things about this book was that it contains a promise that to anyone who reads it and if they ask God whether it is true or not, that God (not friends, family, or any other man or woman) will let you know whether it is true or not - by asking through prayer. If you ask in all sincerity, you will get an answer to your prayer. I did, but that was my own experience. The Book of Mormon promises that anyone who reads the Book of Mormon and asks God whether it is true or not will receive their own answer (Moroni Chapter 5, verses 3-5; on p. 529)."},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"This book contains aditional testimony about out Lord Jesus Christ, it is truely a marvelous work and a wonder.

The \\"missionary\\" version, handed out by the guys with the white shirts and black name tags, has a soft cover that is dark blue in color.The free book, the standard LDS Church edition, on just about every page, has up to half of the bottom of each page full of little footnotes and also references to the other books of scripture had by the LDS Church (the King James version of the Holy Bible, the Doctrine and Covenants, and the Pearl of Great Price). Most of these footnotes and references are probably useless to anyone who is not a member of the LDS Church, who just wants to know what this book says.This edition of the book, which was authorized by the LDS Church a few years ago, leaves out all of the distracting footnotes. What you get here is just the text, and it makes reading this book much easier for people who are new to it and simply want to know what it says. Even members of the LDS Church who don't care for the numerous potentially-distracting footnotes might prefer this version of the book.Mormonism's foundation is this book, and the book is even called by Church members the \\"keystone\\" of their religion. A central doctrine of the book is that God reveals truths to mankind and anyone can learn to be recipient to this revelation. The last chapter exhorts the reader to sincerely pray to God and to let God be the ultimate authority, confirming the truth (or not) of the book.Whether or not a person is willing to take this test, this version of the book is very helpful for anyone who seeks to truly understand the foundation of Mormonism and Mormon doctrine. I would argue that reading the Book of Mormon is essential to understanding Mormonism.This review is written by a former agnostic, who converted to Mormonism in 1998 after reading this book in its entirety. In my opinion, as with many others who adhere to Mormonism, this is the most important book on Earth and it is absolutely true."},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"It seems like the majority of the other reviews are concerned with attacking/defending the text and theology of the book itself. I'm not really concerned with that, especially as a non-Mormon who has no inherent hostility towards or sympathy with the LDS Church and/or its variants, just an interest in religious literature.For non-specialists or casual readers, there are essentially three different versions of the Book of Mormon available:* the softcover copies distributed by the Church's formidable missionary network.* the Penguin Books edition (also softcover) of the 1840 printing.* the Doubleday edition here, in hardcover.Each has its merits and liabilities.The Doubleday edition is a hardcover copy, far more durable than the Penguin paperback or even the official Church copy. Also, Doubleday's edition uses a finer quality of paper--this makes the book a little bigger in size, but gives it a heft that suggests quality. The text of the Doubleday edition, unlike that of the Penguin, conforms to the divisions and content of the most current LDS Church printing.The presentation of the text itself is something of a compromise. Unlike the official Church edition, the Doubleday version does not contain a substantial interpretive apparatus--that is, the footnotes and cross-references, along with much of the book introductions, are omitted. This deletion could be a problem for newcomers, especially those looking to understand how the LDS Church believes the Book of Mormon relates to the Bible and to their own internal canon of scripture. However, unlike Penguin's novel-like format, the Doubleday version retains the LDS Church's present versification and double-column format, making this a usable work for believers who want a somewhat heavier, higher-quality edition of their sacred book.The font, line spacing, and general page design make this a highly readable version, especially as opposed to the Penguin edition's almost interminably dense paragraphing. Discreet headings that summarize or prefigure chapters give a nod to the Church's official interpretations without being too imposing.Penguin's version includes a lengthy introduction placing the Book of Mormon in the context of Joseph Smith and American religious experiences. The Doubleday version includes only the Church's official preface (\\"The Book of Mormon is a volume of holy scripture comparable to the Bible...[et al].\\")In sum, the Doubleday version is a careful and respectful repackaging of the Church's official version in a somewhat more secular wrapper. Unlike the Church missionary copies, this edition is not primarily concerned with proselytizing; unlike the Penguin edition, it conforms nonetheless with the Church's official teachings and text. It occupies a middle ground, and will likely appeal to believers wanting a nicer copy for the bookshelf and to non-readers who would like a \\"genuine\\" copy (it does bear the Church's imprimatur, apparently) without being proselytized in the process."},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"The title states clearly what the book is.

Let's get the facts straight! The record clearly shows that Doubleday approached the Church requesting permission to publish the book.3. \\"The book is dull and boring, don't waste your time\\" To the dull and boring in society this review is very appropriate.4. \\"This book mentions almost nothing about Christ\\" Amazing! This individual is in dire need of a literacy course or is such a fast speed reader that he or she only retains the punctuation marks!5. \\"Much of this book is copied almost exactly from the Bible\\" Hmmm. Let's see now according to item # 3 above , it would appear that when judged by the SAME standard, both the Bible and the Book of Mormon are dull and boring.6. Some of the negative reviews are not a review, but are a personal attack on Joseph Smith. Please remember that our dear Lord and Savior Jesus Christ was and is today also the victim of some of the most vile and defamatory false epithets hurled at any man! If you claim the authority and right to exercise judgment over your fellow man, then please let your judgement have the SAME standard for all.7. \\"The church boasts of 12 million members, but most are inactive\\" Yeah Right! I will be the first to admit that we like any church has inactive members. I am a little puzzled though. How come this book has produced a church that has such an amazing vitality, organization, and growth rate that it now requires one of the largest constuction projects in the world? Currently we are constructing 451 new quality chapels per year. Our world wide humanitarian aid donations alone, exceed the entire operating budget of many churches. All of the church's growth, construction and operating functions are conducted in the divine wisdom of DEBT FREE status.

Regardless of debaters for both sides, I just want to say how this book affected me. I read it for the first time 4 years ago, and it effect still hasn't left me. When I read it I was amazed at the complex literary style - it surprised me how much of a real story it told. Of course, if I read it when I was sleepy or not interested it was really boring, but in that aspect I place it next to the New Testament - it has a message that is understood only by people who are willing to understand (that's why there are so many people who don't get it). Anyway, this book gives a fresh view on Christianity without debasing it - instead of getting the story of Christ from the Middle East, this tells the story of Christ from somewhere in America, where Christ visited. It is a very interesting read, a gem.

Even though I don't agree with the other things they say, they're right about the book being boring. Of course it's boring. Aren't all religious books boring? I read the Bible, and I consider it to be boring too.Readers have to realize that these religious books weren't meant to entertain. Just the opposite actually. They were meant to educate and enlighten. Just like school. Is school entertaining or fun? No way. But is it important? Absolutely. So, for what the Book of Mormon is- a text book of sorts- it's very good.Readers from any faith, whether they believe in the divinity of the Book of Mormon or not, can learn from this book. For a second, let's just pretend that it was written by man (it was actually translated, but let's just pretend.) Even if it's actually an elaborate work of fiction, it's still a good, moral primer. It teaches values that are important not only to Mormons, or Christians, but to human beings.If you're looking for an entertaining book, I'd be glad to recommend one. If you want to become a better person, read this one. And once you get into it, you just might start enjoying it. There are a lot of wars and conflicts that take place, and some of the people in it(good and bad) are entertaining, on a certain level. Anyway, if you want to read it, go ahead.

This angel told him of a record of the ancestors of the American Indians who were descendants of the house of Israel. Smith claimed to receive several other visitations from this personage and many others who gave him a basic understanding of the history of these people. Smith also claimed that through the power of God he was able to translate this record which was written on golden plates into the English language and that a person could know that he was a true prophet and that the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints which he founded was God's kingdom once they gained a witness from God that the translation of this record (which is the Book of Mormon) was a true record (i.e. not fictional) of these ancient inhabitants of the Americas. The leaders of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints have also consistently encouraged anyone who can show that the book is false to do all they can to correct the wrongs and frauds of the Church. These leaders make this claim because they seem to have been quite certain that the Book is truly what it claims to be.The historical setting for the book starts in the tower of Babel approx 2300 BC with a group of people called the Jaredites who cross the sea in barges where they carry all sorts of grains, animals and honeybees with them in their barges and come to the Americas which was given exclusively to them by God after the great flood in the days of Noah. These people spread throughout the whole continent and eventually become very wicked and God lets them destroy themselves around 600 BC and the Americas are then given to a new group of people who are all Israelites. Church leaders have consistently taught that the American continents were given exclusively to these group of Jews and that a knowledge of it would be kept hidden from all other people until about the time of the coming of Columbus. Therefore Joseph Smith and the rest of the Mormon church leaders were quite certain and confident that all of the Native Americans were descendants of these people and full-blooded descendants of Israel.In recent years scientists in the fields of archaelogy, anthropology, linguistics and most recently genetics have concluded conclusively that the principal ancestors of the Native Americans were individuals who descended from migrators over the Bering Straits from Mongolia and/or Siberia several thousand years ago. They've also found no evidence at all about any such Israelite groups as described in the Book of Mormon. Scientists who are defenders of the Mormon faith now generally support the claims of these scientists and now claim that the Church never really taught that the principal ancestor of the Native Americans were these Book of Mormon people or that what Joseph Smith and other early Mormon leaders said was just their opinion based on incomplete information. The most common hypothesis of the defenders is that the groups who came to the Americas around 600 BC from Jerusalem mixed with the natives of Mongol descent. Yet this hypothesis directly contradicts the teachings of Smith, others and the text that the Americas would be kept hidden from all other people. Another common hypothesis is that the Hebrew groups who came around 600 BC came to some obscure place and we just haven't yet found their descendants. Yet this hypothesis directly contradicts the teachings of Mormon leaders that all or almost all of the Native Americans are of hebrew blood and descent. The reader should be reminded that Smith claimed to get his information from heavenly messengers and that Smith and other Mormon leaders claimed several times in the &quot;thus saith the Lord&quot; tone that indeed the American Indians are indeed Jews. The reader should also be reminded that Mormon church leaders are recognized by the church membership as being God's authorized representatives to give the world a fulness of truth and to learn firsthand from God about his plan and all truths.The current church leadership has never addressed this issue and in fact they refuse to let third parties examine many early documents that might help scholars better understand the issues involved. Instead they encourage people everywhere to pray to God for guidance and to gain a testimony that they are telling the truth and that the Book of Mormon is true. The assumption is that those who don't gain this special testimony witness from God are not living according to God's commandments and they need to repent in some way in order to really know that the Book of Mormon is true. The Church to this day has always stated that its truthfulness rests on whether or not the Book of Mormon is honestly true. The Church has a massive missionary program in place with the hope that the honest people of the world will come to know that the Church is true and that they will join the Church. I encourage you as you study this book that you consider these things and ask yourself if the Church is really being completely honest and truthful so that you can know for yourself whether or not its true."},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"The Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ is a great companion scripture to the Bible.

Doubleday has worked with The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints to put together this edition. It is clean, easy to read, has enough information to help the unfamiliar understand what the Book of Mormon is and what it represents. It is divided into chapters and verses exactly as the edition published by the Church. The difference is that there are no footnotes or cross references to other books of scripture. There is a pronunciation guide at the back as well a short guide to doctrinal subjects that point the interested reader to relevant verses.I understand that this book upsets many people. It has ever been so. For millions of us, the Book of Mormon, along with the Bible, the Doctrine and Covenants, and the Pearl of Great Price, is scripture that was brought forth by the gift and power of God through the Prophet Joseph Smith. People who would never consider defaming the Koran or the Bhagivad Gita will go out of their way to attack the Book of Mormon. Why they can't leave it alone is a further evidence, to me at least, of its divinity. But I am perfectly content that others regard this belief as deluded and demonstrably false. I thank them for their concern and urge them to keep on the path they feel to be true.If you have ever wanted to read the Book of Mormon, but didn't want to meet with any missionaries or a member of the Church, this is a perfect edition for you.

It was written with a definite purpose-a purpose to be felt by every reader. From the title page we read that it was written \`to the convincing of the Jew and Gentile that JESUS is the CHRIST, the ETERNAL GOD, manifesting himself unto all nations.' The message it contains is a witness for Christ and teaches the love of God for all mankind. Its purpose is to bring people to accept Jesus as the Christ. The book tells of the actual visit of Christ to ancient America and records the teachings and instructions He gave in clarity and great power to the people. The Book of Mormon substantiates the Bible in its teachings of the Savior, speaks of Christ more than any other subject, and teaches that our Savior is the Redeemer and Atoner of mankind, constantly emphasizing that He is the central figure in God's plan of salvation. This divine record makes converts to its message and to His Church, which teaches it\\" (\\"Joseph Smith, the Prophet,\\" Ensign, Dec. 2001, 28).\\"Hinckley also said, \\"Its appeal is as timeless as truth, as universal as mankind. It is the only book that contains within its covers a promise that by divine power the reader may know with certainty of its truth.Its origin is miraculous; when the story of that origin is first told to one unfamiliar with it, it is almost unbelievable. But the book is here to be felt and handled and read. No one can dispute its presence.All efforts to account for its origin, other than the account given by Joseph Smith, have been shown to lack substance. It is a record of ancient America. It is the scripture of the New World, as certainly as the Bible is the scripture of the Old. Each speaks of the other. Each carries with it the spirit of inspiration, the power to convince and to convert. Together they become two witnesses, hand in hand, that Jesus is the Christ, the resurrected and living Son of the living God.Its narrative is a chronicle of nations long since gone. But in its descriptions of the problems of today's society, it is as current as the morning newspaper and much more definitive, inspired, and inspiring concerning the solutions to those problems.I know of no other writing that sets forth with such clarity the tragic consequences to societies that follow courses contrary to the commandments of God. Its pages trace the stories of two distinct civilizations that flourished on the Western Hemisphere. Each began as a small nation, its people walking in the fear of the Lord. Each prospered, but with prosperity came growing evils. The people succumbed to the wiles of ambitious and scheming leaders who oppressed them with burdensome taxes, who lulled them with hollow promises, who countenanced and even encouraged loose and lascivious living, who led them into terrible wars that resulted in the death of millions and the final extinction of two great civilizations in two different eras.No other written testament so clearly illustrates the fact that when men and nations walk in the fear of God and in obedience to his commandments, they prosper and grow, but when they disregard him and his word, there comes a decay which, unless arrested by righteousness, leads to impotence and death. The Book of Mormon is an affirmation of the Old Testament proverb, \\"Righteousness exalteth a nation: but sin is a reproach to any people.\\" (Prov. 14:34.)While the Book of Mormon speaks with power about the issues that affect our modern society, the great and stirring burden of its message is a testimony, vibrant and true, that Jesus is the Christ, the promised Messiah. The book bears witness of him who walked the dusty roads of Palestine healing the sick and teaching the doctrines of salvation; who died upon the cross of Calvary; who on the third day came forth from the tomb, appearing to many; and who, as a resurrected being, visited the people of the Western Hemisphere, concerning whom he earlier had said: \\"And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd.\\" (John 10:16.)For centuries the Bible stood alone as a written testimony of the divinity of Jesus of Nazareth. Now, at its side, stands a second and powerful witness to lead mankind to the Lord.\\"Also, Another leader, the late President Benson, said, \\"From the Book of Mormon we learn how disciples of Christ live in times of war. From the Book of Mormon we see the evils of secret combinations portrayed in graphic and chilling reality. In the Book of Mormon we find lessons for dealing with persecution and apostasy. We learn much about how to do missionary work. And more than anywhere else, we see in the Book of Mormon the dangers of materialism and setting our hearts on the things of the world. Can anyone doubt that this book was meant for us and that in it we find great power, great comfort, and great protection?\\" (Ezra Taft Benson, \\"The Keystone of Our Religion,\\" Ensign, Jan. 1992, 2)The Book of Mormon is a great book for those who want a great testimony of CHRIST, the Savior."},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"Initially, I was impressed by its use of the King James style of the English language, and when I prayed about it I thought it might be true.

I am not qualfied to define what constitutes a \\"good\\" guide to discipleship, but I am qualified to declare this: My cumulative experience in reading and applying the teachings found within this book causes me to believe very (oh my, how words are inadequate!) strongly that Jesus is truly the Savior of the world and that becoming more like Him is the most important thing any human being could ever do.Nephi, a prophet and the first writer in this book, declared, \\"For the fulness of mine intent is that I may persuade men to come unto the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob [all of which are references to Jesus Christ], and be saved\\" (1 Nephi 6:4, words in brackets inserted by me).Towards the middle of the book, there is an account of the conversion of a king. In this account, the following was attributed to that king: \\"O God, Aaron hath told me that there is a God; and if there is a God, and if thou art God, wilt thou make thyself known unto me, and I will give away all my sins to know thee, and that I may be raised from the dead, and be saved at the last day...\\" (Alma 22:18).In this book, there is an account of Jesus Christ's appearance to a group of people on the American continent after His resurrection and ascension. As He addressed those He had called to lead this people spiritually, Jesus said, \\"...what manner of men ought ye to be? Verily I say unto you, even as I am\\" (3 Nephi 27:27).The prophet Moroni, the final writer in this book and he who buried it for a future generation (i.e., us), counsels the reader: \\"...I would commend you to seek this Jesus of whom the prophets and apostles have written, that the grace of God the Father, and also the Lord Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost, which beareth record of them, may be and abide in you forever. Amen\\" (Ether 12:41).Finally, from the Introduction, we read, \\"Concerning this record the Prophet Joseph Smith said: 'I told the brethren that the Book of Mormon was the most correct of any book on earth, and the keystone of our religion, and a man would get nearer to God by abiding by its precepts, than by any other book.'\\"These brief passages are some of my favorites! They help give a glimpse of why I feel The Book of Mormon is a splendid guide to discipleship of the Lord. Without reservation, I recommend this book to that end."},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"I have read this book and prayed to know if it was true.

I would not advise that anyone read or refuse to read this Book based on those critical comments (or, for that matter, based on my praise for this Book!). I would suggest that you consider reading this Book if you truly want to know if God lives, if Jesus is his Son and the Savior of Mankind, and if the Gospel provides answers to life's most vexing questions (i.e., who am I, where did I come from, where am I going, etc.) The Book of Mormon will answer these questions.

It has been translated into dozens of foreign languages. Millions of people have read it, many receiving free copies from Mormon missionaries (the LDS church - the largest of the Mormon churches - has a full-time missionary corps of over 50,000). Many of those have accepted its claims and joined one of the many Mormon sects which accept it as divinely revealed scripture. Many others - probably the great majority - have read it and recognized it as a fantasy tale written in the early nineteenth century.The book purports to be a translation - made with divine assistance - of gold plates on which the ancient inhabitants of America wrote their own religious and secular history. It describes these inhabitants as Israelites, having been divinely led to America at the time of the Babylonian destruction of Jerusalem six centuries before Christ. It describes their culture, their prophets, their many wars, a supposed post-resurrection visit by Jesus to America, and the final destruction of the more civilized inhabitants about 400 C.E. by the more savage ones, who are the ancestors of the American Indians.No non-Mormon historian, anthropologist, archaeologist or other expert in pre-Columbian America accepts the Book of Mormon's (non-religious) claims. Rather than being an accurate description of ancient American culture, it describes what a relatively uneducated person in the time of Joseph Smith might suppose it to be - similar to his own American, European-based culture, with steel, horses, chariots, glass, compasses, coins, wheat, cattle, flocks, and so on. None of these things were known to the ancient Americans. Nor does it accurately reflect how Jewish immigrants to America might have lived, since it shows a great ignorance of Jewish religion and culture. More than that, the book shows no indication of familiarity with genuine ancient American life or history.The book is filled with many other anachronisms. Much of its religious material is merely copied almost word-for-word from the King James English Bible translation, putting many words of the New Testament writers into the mouths of American prophets who lived supposedly hundreds of years before Christ. The supposed historical material is largely a reflection of commonly held ideas in Smith's time about the origins of the American Indians, and mostly based on a book published by a New England pastor just a few years before Smith wrote the Book of Mormon, called \\"A View of the Hebrews\\", by Rev. Ethan Smith (no relation), first published in 1823, with a second edition in 1825. (See David Persuitte's book \\"Joseph Smith and the Origins of the Book of Mormon\\"). That notion - that the Indians are descendants of ancient Israelites - has been so thoroughly disproven by science that even many Mormon scholars now admit that Smith's claims on that issue were wrong. (See Simon Southerton's book \\"Losing A Lost Tribe.\\")Hundreds of books have been written by Mormons to support the claims made in the Book of Mormon. Hundreds of others have been written to expose the book as a work of fiction. Interestingly, the defenders of the book's claims generally urge readers of the book not to read anything ABOUT the book - especially anything negative - but rather they urge the reader simply to pray to God and ask whether its claims are true. Unfortunately, it seems that God sometimes tells readers that it is true, but apparently he tells many other readers that it is a hoax. Why else would one find dozens of copies in the ten-cent bin at every thrift store in the country? Or perhaps most people feel that they do not need God's help in confirming that they are reading a fantasy tale - however religious it may sound - and not a description of real life or real events in a real place."},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"Is this book worth a look to someone not a member of the LDS faith?I recommend The Book of Mormon for a variety of reasons. First, it provides a fascinating look at unique personal and national histories with a moral focus; how does a culture thrive (or not) based on its keeping Universal Truth? What builds, and destroys, a nation? What builds, and destroys, a person's soul?Second, this book provides layer upon layer of meaning. High reread value. You can find meaning on every (and I mean every) single page, regardless of the occasional challenge to get through it due to its Old Testament-like language. It covers very personal issues and how those things we struggle with on a day-to-day basis can build (or unravel) an entire civilization.Lastly, it is a rare book that challenges the reader to know for themsleves if it is true. The book has the guts to claim it is Universal Truth. It claims anyone can know it is real. The criteria is provided and, by the hundreds of testimonies on this site, plenty of people can attest the formula works.The book is worth your time for its rich look into a unique culture--and those truths that make or break people and the nations they create.

No library is complete without it.Mormons accept the book as scripture, even more \\"perfect\\" than the Bible since they claim it was written directly and only by ancient prophets living in the Americas from 600 BC to 400 AD, hidden from the world, and then revealed to and translated by the first modern prophet, Joseph Smith.Those who believe the Bible to be God's word and draw inspiration from its passages will want to see if God also speaks to them from the Book of Mormon. Proclaiming itself a \\"second witness for Jesus Christ,\\" the Book of Mormon principally recounts the history of a family and their descendants who, at the command of God, leave Jerusalem prior to its conquest by the Babylonians in 600 AD, travel along the Red Sea, build a boat, sail to the American continent and develop into two societies often at war with the other. The \\"righteous\\" organize churches and practice baptism, awaiting the promised earthly ministry of Jesus Christ who appears and ministers to them for several days following his crucifixion and resurrection in the old world.Students of antiquity know that many of the historical criticisms heaped on the Book of Mormon when first published in 1830 proved false over time -- for example, it is now known that ancient societies did write on metal or even gold plates and that boat travel from the Middle East to America was possible during 600 BC.The greatest value of the Book of Mormon is to persuade the reader to \\"come unto Christ.\\" Sure, the 1830 language, which compares with the King James Version of the Bible commonly used at the time, is somewhat stilted. Yes, Mark Twain called the Book of Mormon \\"chloroform in print\\" (as if the Bible does not possess the same attribute). Still, the Book of Mormon contains passages as powerful and moving as any found in the Bible. No passage in the Bible explains the meaning of life as fully as the second chapter of II Nephi, the second book in the Book of Mormon."},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"Joseph Smith, the author of the book, was a convicted conman who eeked out a meager existence as a scryer, hiring himself out as a treasure hunter.

The Book of Mormon is not intended to be some great work of literature or fiction. It is meant as, and is, scripture and revelation that has come from God to man. Yes, there are many parts that are not gramatically correct and even a part or two that is a little tedious. But the book is the Word of God. It is another testament of Jesus Christ. It would have been impossible for Joseph Smith, having a third-grade education, to write a book of this style or magnitude without divine help.I can gurantee that those who have read the Book of Mormon and have not recieved anything from it have not sincerely opened their hearts and pondered on the possibility that it might be true. Even if you doubt, you can always ask God:\\"If any of you lacketh wisdom, let him ask of God, who giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not.\\" ~ James 1:5 (New Testament, King James Version)All you have to do is sincerely ask, and you will be answered.

Finding it incredible that the Indians could have made such a civilization on their own, the author imagined that a group of exiles must have come over from the Holy Land centuries earlier.Just who wrote the Book of Mormon is hard to say. I tend to think Joseph Smith did. Yes, he was uneducated, but he was certainly a smart young man. Considering his later writings, I don't see that the Book of Mormon was beyond his abilities.As far as the merits of the book itself, certainly it has some. The plot takes some interesting turns. As literature, though, the book is frankly dull, especially in the last half. The Book of Mormon deals in black and white: the characters are either wicked or righteous. Real people aren't like that. Whatever Smith's merits as a writer, creating believable and interesting characters wasn't one of them. Unlike real history, the plot of the Book of Mormon also tends to follow a neat path of \\"wickedness leads to destruction\\" every time. At best, taking the Book of Mormon as scripture tends to be a distraction from the real problems of society and our planet.Most scientists who are not historians of 19th century America tend to dismiss extreme religious books like the Book of Mormon as beneath their notice. In a way you can hardly blame the scientists, because the Book of Mormon is contrary to pretty much everything that is known today about Native American civilization. However, I think the scientists are wrong to ignore religious works. The Mormons are today a group with serious political power; they are well represented in Washington, especially in the intelligence community. No matter what your own beliefs are, in my opinion it is important to read the works of people you disagree with.

There is no doubt that the Book of Mormon has made an enormous impact on the lives of millions.There is also no doubt that it fails abysmally in what it purports to be. It purports to be a record of the history of early America during the millenium covered by 600 BC thru about 400 AD. Absolutely NO archeological evidence has ever been found to support the claim that a band of Hebrews left the Middle East and settled in the New World, becoming the ancestors of native Americans. Some Mormon apologists have disingenuosly claimed that the Smithsonian Institution has used the Book of Mormon in archeological research. Since 1951 the Smithsonian has issue a point blank, catergorical denial that they have ever used the Book of Mormon as an aid to archeological research. See their website.This lack of evidence for the historicity of the Book of Mormon contrasts sharply with the wealth of archeological evidence that exists in support of the historicity of the Bible. Biblical scholars might debate issues like dating and chronology but none dispute the actual existence of the evidence. The issue for Biblical scholars is not, do these places exist but how do we interpret the data in the light of the text, and vice versa? Mormon scholars on the other hand have to deal with the fact that they have absolutely NO data with which to work, other than the Book of Mormon itself.The only conclusion one can come to is that the Book of Mormon is what it is, namely a 19th century work by Joseph Smith. As such, it is creatively innovative and clearly the work of a religious genius and will continue to influence the relgious lives of millions. The true believers among them will be unswayed by the fact that there is no evidence for its claim that it is an ancient text. This lack of evidence will keep the rest of us in healthy skepticism re its claims of antiquity, we will continue to recognize that it comes from the fertile mind of Joseph Smith. It is a book reflects the ferment of religious ideas current in early 19th century America.Two stars as nothing more an interesting read of religious and historical fiction."},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"On November 16, Thomas R.

I happen to be an atheist, and so I cannot see the Book of Mormon in the same way as a believer can. On the other hand, my perspective gives me some unique insights, as well. So does my background in history (a B.A.) and my having read other religious texts such as the Bible, the Koran and the Bhagavad-Gita.Disclaimers aside (and, I know, the faithful are going to hate what I have to say no matter how many disclaimers I lay down), I must report: I did not like The Book of Mormon.As a religious text, it is a disappointment: it seems to encourage racism, as God makes people black as a punishment; the work only touches on morality lightly and superficially (people who agree that Jesus is/will be the Son-of-God are good, those who disagree are bad).As an entertaining read, it is a disappointment: for the most part, the Book is a collection of sand-dry war records with almost no color or detail. This is an example of how the Book reads: \\"And then, behold, Group A made war upon Group B and there were many men slain in Group A because they opposed liberty, but Group B remained almost untouched. Yea behold, 420 men in Group A were slain, but only 10 were slain in Group B. And behold, the next year Group C made war upon Group B and Group C was destroyed save for a small number, for they had opposed liberty.\\" Seriously. This is what it is like for hundreds of pages.As a historical record, it is a disappointment. Frankly, the Book of Mormon is fradulent. It claims to be the records of Israelites who fled Israel before the Babylonian Captivity--the \\"lost tribes\\" who wound up coming to America; the forerunners to the Native American tribes. However, the book throws around concepts like \\"liberty\\" as though these were fully developed concepts at the time. It also throws around the name \\"Jesus Christ\\" as the ancient Mormon prophets supposedly knew of his coming. It is strange that the Book of Mormon contains no sketchy hints requiring explanation or special pleading, as can be witnessed in people's explanations of Daniel or Isaiah or other Old Testament prophecies. No, the prophets in the Book of Mormon are direct, to the point, and accurate. Eerily so. Tellingly so.Further, the Books explanation of the existence of Native Americans runs contrary to the modern evidence of the Asiatic landbridge and DNA, etc. Also, and despite the fact that the Book of Mormon has reportedly several authors (of the various books, like the Bible), the style of each book seems remarkably similar. It is unlike the Bible in this respect; Ecclesiastes is very different from Chronicles which is very dissimilar to Jeremiah which is very unlike Exodus; John does not resemble Matthew stylistically. The Book of Mormon feels like one consistent voice spinning one narrative. This is because one man--Joseph Smith--did write the entire thing, and then he claimed that he found it buried in upstate New York with the help of an angel.You see, that is what accounts for the knowledge of modern politcal concepts such as liberty. That is what accounts for the similarity in narrative styles by the \\"different authors\\" of the Book of Mormon. That is what accounts for the knowledge of Native Americans, but lack of knowledge as to their actual origins or DNA evidence, etc. It is because one man wrote this book on the American continent before the discovery of DNA and other forms of evidence. You see?As I said, I'm an athiest. It was never very likely that reading The Book of Mormon would convict me, or convince me, of much. On the other hand, I enjoyed reading the other religious books I'd read much more than this one. I think that those other works are more entertaining, more important morally/religiously, and more important historically. However they might be mistaken, I do not believe that they were written with the same intentional fraud out of which was born the Book of Mormon.The faithful Mormon will love the book, and will hate me (or if not, at least what I say); that's fine. I understand. But this isn't a good book in any sense. It is a waste of time, energy and effort, and I rather grieve for those who are told from their infancy that it has some relevance to our world."},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"This is a fictious book written originally by Larry Spaulding but stolen by the printer and surfaced as the Book of Mormon.

So the Jesus of whom they are speaking must be the Biblical Jesus.The first paragraph of the &quot;Introduction&quot; to the Book of Mormon reads:&quot;The Book of Mormon is a volume of holy scripture comparable to the Bible. It is a record of God's dealings with the ancient inhabitants of the Americas and contains, as does the Bible, the fulness of the everlasting gospel.&quot;Here we see the Book of Mormon being 'linked' to the Bible, therefore, our assumption that they mean another testament - besides the Bible, is obviously correct. [As an aside: notice the above introduction says the Bible also contains 'the fulness of the everlasting gospel'. The Mormon Church teaches that parts of the Bible are missing, and that which remains is largely corrupted. Since that is what they believe, why does the Book of Mormon introduction say otherwise?]Imagine you wrote a biography of Elvis Presley and it became world famous; a standard reference work for anyone wanting to study the life of &quot;The King.&quot; Then, years later, I wrote another biography of Elvis Presley - However! The Elvis Presley of whom I wrote was not the famous singer but somebody quite different who just happened to have the same name. Now, if I put on the front cover of my book:&quot;Another biography of Elvis Presley.&quot;I would be giving a false impression. Because those words would suggest I was speaking about the same Elvis Presley as you, since I claim it is 'another' (a second) biography.A different Jesus?For many years Christians have claimed that the Jesus of the Mormon Church is a different Jesus than He of whom the Bible speaks. This claim has been denied by LDS Church leaders who have insisted they worship the same Jesus. The Jesus of the Bible.Hinckley's admission:On June 4, 1998 whilst on a visit to Paris, France. President Hinckley bore his testimony of Jesus Christ. While doing so Hinckley spoke of those outside the church who claim Mormons do not believe in the traditional Christ, he continued:&quot;No, I don't. The traditional Christ of whom they speak is not the Christ of whom I speak. For the Christ of whom I speak has been revealed in the Dispensation of the Fulness of Times. He, together with his Father, appeared to the boy Joseph Smith in the year 1820, and when Joseph left the grove that day, he knew more about the nature of God than all the learned ministers of the gospel of the ages.&quot; Church News. Week ending June 20, 1998Throughout the centuries Christians have believed in the Jesus Christ who is presented to us in the Bible. He who was, and is: &quot;...God ... manifest in the flesh, ... preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory.&quot; (1 Timothy 3:16)The &quot;traditional Christ&quot; who is rejected by Mormonism.Hinckley is not the first to reveal Mormonism's rejection of the real Lord Jesus Christ.At the 147th General Conference Barnard P. Brockbank stated:&quot;...the Christ followed by the Mormons is not the Christ followed by traditional Christianity.&quot;&quot;It is true that many of the Christian churches worship a different Jesus Christ than is worshipped by the Mormons or The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.&quot;If the Christ of the Book of Mormon is the Christ in whom Mormons believe then, clearly, he is a different Christ from the Jesus Christ of the Bible, in whom Mormons don't believe.Therefore, the Book of Mormon cannot be:&quot;Another testament of Jesus Christ.&quot;but rather, it is:&quot;A Testament of another Jesus Christ.&quot;And Jesus answered and said unto them, Take heed that no man deceive you. For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many. (Matthew 24:4-5)But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed.

There are EXACT verses that say \\"the messiah is God in the flesh.\\" The Book of Mormon teaches one Heaven and one Hell. There are never any Degrees of Glory talked about. At least not until Doctrine and Covenants. Yes, reading the Book of Mormon will make you think that the LDS believe what Christians do, but once you get into their other books of scripture (Pearl of Great Price and Doctrine and Covenants) this all changes.

If you are looking for a Christian religion to believe in and you want to try Mormonism, you'll have to read this book. You'll only have to read a couple passages near the end, though, that tell you to pray to God asking if the book is &quot;true&quot;. The text says that if you receive a warm, fuzzy feeling, that means it's true. After that, you can contact the missionaries and get yourself baptized. You don't need to read the whole book; lots of Mormons never do.If you are looking to study Mormonism as a religion, culture, cult, or some other type of organization, you'll need to read this book at least a little. But also read the original version (you can buy it on Amazon, apparently), because there seems to be a difference between the current and past versions. Also, read lots of other books about Mormons, and make sure you know the agendas of the writers, so that you know how biased their information is. I would say that authors have a tendency to be biased when it comes to religion.If you are looking to be entertained, I have no idea if you'll enjoy it. The writing is rather crappy (that is my opinion as a writer). It can be quite repetitious. It has little stories that can be entertaining, in a mythical-folklore-larger-than-life kind of way.

There are at least two good books on the market, \\"An Insider's View of Mormon Origins\\" by Grant Palmer, and \\"Losing a Lost Tribe\\" by Simon Southerton which provide excellent summaries of the problems faced by those who believe the Book of Mormon is some sort of actual historical record.

It's as awfully scripted as the book is, only much shorter. Watch for mormon members reading their Book of Mormon \\"scriptures\\" on buses or airplanes. Mormons themselves usually nod off after 5 minutes or so of reading.The strange thing is that after re-reading and re-reading this book of fiction and receiving endless \\"testimonies\\" that the book is true, people actually believe it's real (after all, it must be true if all these people say it is, right?) . It's like self hypnosis. Or like a group of Star Trek fans (trekkies) who spend much of their lives attending endless conventions and discussion groups delving into the mysteries of the mini-series that are not explained in the episodes aired (i.e., just how do they achieve warp power?\\" What exactly is a dilithium crystal and where can you find them?). A good portion of the book is plagiarism of the Bible, perhaps explaining the familiarity and comfort that those who convert from christianity find in the book.The truth is, the book was written in the early 1800's by a charismatic man (Joseph Smith) looking to start his own following...in search of wealth and prestige after many failed attempts at mysticism (searching for gold through peep-stones and divining rods). As his movement grew, so did his lust for power and women (beginning his practice of polygamy which was carried on by succeeding \\"prophets\\" indulging their own lust for the ladies). Many members left the fold at that time due to disgust (well, a lot of men stayed...hmmmm, wonder why?).Modern day mormonism has distanced itself from it's sordid (polygamy) and bloody past (mountain meadows massacre...where some odd 100 to 200+ innocent pioneers were butchered by faithful mormons while crossing Utah...the scapegoat of the massacre, John D. Lee, a sort of godson of Brigham Young, vehemently claimed to his death that the massacre was ordered by The \\"prophet\\" Young). Blood Oaths in secret temple rituals were abandoned only in the last ten years or so. Blood \\"atonement\\" still exists in Utah, where convicted murderers have the \\"option\\" of death by firing squad. But now even that practice has a movement for abolishment to coincide with our more civil times. Also take note of the issue of full fledged memberships for the \\"black man\\" and their view of the American indian. It was only in the 1980's after much political pressure that a convenient \\"revelation\\" from their \\"prophet\\" that the african american and black people across the globe have been allowed full rights and privileges of membership. Prior to that, they were viewed as lesser human beings...offspring of Cain (of Bible fame) that were cursed and less valiant. Up until the last few years, the language of the \\"most true and correct book on earth\\" (as it is often referred to), referred to american indians past and present as \\"a dark and loathsome\\" people. Whites of course were referred to as \\"white and delightsome.\\" Naturally, those descriptions have been recently changed to something more politically correct.So why bring all this up in a simple book review? Because it is important to note that the book is a constantly evolving work of fiction, re-written to suit the day and age we live in. Also noteworthy is the effect the book has on faithful mormons. Critical reviews of the book are met with responses such as \\"I testify this book is true.\\" \\"God revealed the truthfulness to me\\" and so on and so forth. Sane and compelling arguments and evidence by skeptics of the book are not answered with logical explanations or sanity, they are responded to with accusations of persecution, apostacy, heresy, sinful disposition, or accusations of satanic conspiracy.Truth is often sought by people with a real quest for knowledge. Others fall to what comforts them or removes the arduous task of finding truth. Some fear the consequences when truth is discovered. The mormon faithful fall into the latter category. Other \\"small\\" and \\"gramatical\\" revisionsP.S. Yes I have actually read the book...and many other scholarly and \\"spiritual\\" mormon books and scripture.

At the time Joseph wrote this book, there was both in America as well as Europe a trend to idealize past societies and James MacPherson's Ossian legends he wrote in Scotland were an early example. Joseph Smith was much influenced by Solomon Spaulding, who like many people were influenced by the Ossian legends. The Book of Mormon is a purported history of native americans, postulating that they were descendents of the inhabitants of Israel, descending from a prophet named Lehi. In general, the protagonists in Joseph's book end in \\"i\\" (eye) such as Lehi, Nephi, Moroni, etc. Many of the antagonists end in \\"hor\\" such as \\"Corihor\\", \\"Nehor\\", etc.An over-riding theme of the book is the early nineteenth century wisdom that \\"pride preceeds the fall.\\" Many stories within the book talk about a humble people gaining wealth through their righteousness only to turn against God and to become prideful. This pridefulness results in their downfall and only becoming humble again results in the material and spiritual blessings of God. This theme is consistent with many New England calvinist philosophies about gaining wealth through righteousness and losing wealth or status through wickedness.This book is important in American literature because of these morality lessons and what they say about America. Those values spread throughout the country in the puritan diaspora of which Mormonism is an important component.No serious scholars actually believe the Book of Mormon to be an actual history of the peoples of the Americas. DNA, linguistic and other evidence clearly contradicts those claims (for more information, read \\"Insider's View of Mormon Origins\\" by Grant Palmer). True believers of the religion will \\"bear testimony\\" with tremendous sincerity and the book plays an important role in their religious life. But when the book is looked at in the perspective of showing the morals and outlooks of Americans in the early 1800s, it is a significant work for historians to study. Also, the volume being advertised is very nicely bound with a very attractive cover and will be an attractive addition to your book collection."},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"When Jesus Christ came among the Jews, His own people, the great majority of them rejected Him. To the true follower of Christ, this fact would hopefully seem extremely surprising. How could the very people who had the prophecies of Christ, who knew of His covenants, who knew of His characteristics, and who knew of His future condescesion among the children of men, possibly reject their very Redeemer when He stood before them in the flesh? Please stop and really think about that for a moment. God's own people, who should have known Him best, not only rejected Him to His face, but murdered Him.However, there was a small minority of Jews who recognized their Redeemer. How? What was different about them? The Bible gives us the answer. Consider Matthew: he was a Jew who was well acquainted with the Old Testament. In his book, he repeatedly \\"proves\\" that Christ is the Messiah by quoting the words of the prophet Isaiah, among others. Isaiah prophesied wonderful things about the First Coming of Christ in Jerusalem, and each was fulfilled. However, this was not all that he prophesied about. He spoke many words about the last days, saying \\"In that day\\" again and again. He prophesied clearly of a time when a sealed book would be brought to an uneducated man. He spoke clearly about truth coming out of the earth, about messengers traveling to the islands (continents) of the world, gathering the house of Israel, God's covenant people, before the SECOND Coming of Jesus Christ.When Christ utters a prophecy through His prophets, such as He did with Isaiah, all of them will be fulfilled. The question remains, then: Are these prophecies being fulfilled, and if so, how? Are we like Matthew, who knew and recognized the fulfillment of all these glorious things happening around him and took part in them, or are we like the Jews, fulfilling the roles of the ignorant and decieved, rejecting the very source of light and salvation as it stands before our face?I promise you that the Book of Mormon is in reality the very work and word of Jesus the Christ. I also promise you that the Bible is the very work of word of Jesus Christ. I promise you, PROMISE you on His behalf, that if you will read the Book of Mormon and sincerely ask God if it is true, He will manifest the truth of it unto you, as the prophet Moroni promised, by the power of the Holy Ghost. You will then KNOW, as I and a rapidly increasing number of God's children know, that miracles still continue today, because you will literally experience one. All of your struggles, all of your pains will be soothed and swallowed up in incredible joy: every noble hope and dream you have will be answered upon your head. Fear will leave you; life will finally make full and perfect sense. You will come to know your God and His Son, our Redeemer Jesus Christ, in a way that you never could have conceived, even if you already know the Bible very well. Matthew knew the Old Testament very well before the coming of His Reedemer, but there were even more glorious things the Lord wanted to tell Him. I proclaim these promises fearlessly: as members of the true Church of Jesus Christ in the last days, we know who we are and we know what we know. We know who we follow; we were invited to do so, and now we invite others in love. Matthew had to have faith to know that Jesus was the Christ; seeing was not enough, as evidenced by the rejection of the Messiah by the majority of the Jews, all of whom saw Christ with their physical eyes just as clearly as Matthew did. We too must have faith, even when the majority and possible even those closest to us do not believe. Yet I know that if we try, if we TRULY want to know, we WILL be blessed to know. I give that as a promise on Christ's behalf.

Read the Book of Mormon for the Nephite point of view, but also read the Book of Zelph to get the Lamanite side of the story.

Besides, it makes for dull reading. My suggestion is that you first evaluate Joseph Smith's translation skills by viewing 3 facsimiles and Joseph Smith's explanation of same in The Book of Abraham (BOA). The facsimiles were copied from Egyptian papyri buried with four mummies. Unlike the gold plates which were taken back by the angel Moroni, parts of the papyri are still around in the vaults of the Mormon Church. According to Egyptologists, Joseph Smith's interpretations and translations of the Egyptian characters on the facsimiles are incorrect. The Egyptologists say the facsimiles are part of a standard burial document and have nothing to do with the biblical Abraham.You can get the BOA by ordering the paperback version of the Triple Combination from Deseret Books for $5.95. The Triple Combination includes 1) the BOM, 2) Doctrine and Covenants and 3) The Pearl of Great Price.

He was very happy with his find and set it on display so that everyone could could admire the natural beauty in the diamond. After a time, people came and began to refute the diamond. Many said that it was not possible that he could have found a daimond and that is was a fake. Finally many jewelers who were considered experts on diamonds were brought in to test the diamond. Some firmly believed it was a true diamond. Others denounced it. And still others said they didn't want to say one way or the other lest they tarnish their reputation. Then one jeweler proclaimed taht is was, in fact, a synthetic diamond. An incredibly made synthetic diamond. But a synthetic diamond nonetheless.It was then pointed out that to have made such an incredible diamond in the technological state the world was in 175 years ago, was even more unlikely and incredible than if the farner had indeed found the diamond.I know this book is the truth, and was inspired of God.

It's important to remember that Joseph Smith was a contemporary of Charles Taze Russell (Bible Students/Jehovah's Witnesses),Ellen G.

The Protestant Reformation had its rebirth on American soil.\\"The Book of Mormon\\" is the least juicy of the Mormon texts compared to \\"Doctrine and Covenants\\" and \\"Pearl of Great Price.\\" Still,it's foundational. \\"The Book of Mormon\\" tells the story of the lost tribes of Israel. Leaving Babylon and Jerusalem, they set out to the New World. There is the good son, Nephi, and the treacherous Laman. The Nephites become a virtuous tribe. On the other hand,the Lamanites are depraved. The racist undertones of the passages were expunged in the 1954 edition.\\"Book of Mormon\\" is a creative rehash of the Bible set in the Americas. At the time,there was much speculative fiction about Israelites in the Americas. Interestingly,it would be Mormons who'd discover the cliff dwellings in Mesa Verde and Chaco Canyon,as well as Aztec and Incan ruins.\\"The Book of Mormon\\" has prophets, battles, conversion stories. The Christian Nephites have their own church after Jesus comes to the Americas. What's interesting is that the words of blessing over the bread and water are still used today at the Sunday Sacrament service.\\"The Book of Mormon\\" also copies entire passages from Isaiah and Matthew's Gospel.

It is a literal history of a group of Hebrewic Jews who taversed the Atlantic and landed in the America's about 600 years before Jesus. The American Indians are the 'literal' descendents of these Hebrewic people, yet DNA evidence have disproven the foundation of this premise. Indeed the entire book is the history of these people who never existed. The archeological inconsistancies abound. In the BoM we find horses, elephants, steel, domestic sheep, and many other animals and plants that were not found on the American continent in the time period.The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints lately refers to the BoM as 'spiritually true'. Many scholars and apologists for the church no longer hold the book as being 'literal' or a factual history, but rather an inspired book that contains truth on the nature and spirit of Jesus. This seems to be an admission of the FALSITY of the book, yet these same people can stand up and say without reserve that &quot;I know the Book of Mormon is true&quot;.

I delight in such passages as 3 Nephi 11:29 \\"For verily, verily I say unto you, he that hath a spirit of contention is not of me, but is of the devil, who is the father of contention, and he stirreth up the hearts of men to contend with anger, one with another,\\" Though I have very deep convictions about the truth and what is right or wrong, and sometimes disagree strongly with the ideas of others, this book encourages me to be meek.I also enjoyed a gem that I discovered in Alma 34:37-38, \\"And now, my beloved brethren, I desire that ye should remember these things, and that ye should work out your salvation with fear before God, and that ye should no more deny the coming of Christ; that ye contend no more against the Holy Ghost, but that ye receive it, and take upon you the name of Christ, that ye humble yourselves, even to the dust, and worship God, in whatsoever place ye may be in, in spirit and truth; and that ye live in thanksgiving daily for the many mercies and blessings which he doth bestow upon you.\\" Now isn't that just beautiful? What a cure for the ills of human conditions and relations.I will try not to belabor the point. But please forebear to hear one more of my favorites from 2Nephi 2, \\"Adam fell that men might be; and men are that they might have joy. And the Messiah commeth in the fulness of time, that he may redeem the children of men from the fall. And because that they are redeemed from the fall, they have become free forever, knowing good from evil; to act for themselves and not to be acted upon... And they are free to choose liberty and eternal life, through the great Mediator of all men, or to choose captivity and death, according to the captivity and power of the devil; for he seeketh that all men might be miserable like unto himself.\\" I think that is the epitome of Christian thought beautifully expressed in the elevated and susinct literary language of scripture.Now detractors have been raging against this book and its believers for a long time. Four generations of my family have faced mockery and scorn and sometimes persecution. It doesn't really bother me much. It's somewhat old news. Since the last reviewer quoted Mark Twain, I would like to quote him also, in one of his better moods, just to remind us all not to take ourselves too seriously. He wrote upon the occaision of meeting Brigham Young, the prophet after Joseph Smith was murdered. \\"The second day, we went and paid a state visit to the King (Brigham Young). He seemed a quiet, kindly, easy-mannered, dignified, self-possessed old gentleman of fifty-five or sixty... He was very simply dressed and was just taking off a straw hat as we entered. He talked about Utah, and the Indians, and Nevada, and general American matters and questions, with our secretary and certain government officials who came with us. But he never paid any attention to me, notwithstandng I made several attempts to 'draw him out' on federal politics and his high-handed attitude toward Congress. I thought some of the things I said were rather fine. But he merely looked around at me, at distant intervals, something as I have seen a benignant old cat look around to see which kitten was meddling with her tail. By and by I subsided into an indignant silence, and sat until the end, hot and flushed and execrating him in my heart for an ignorant savage. But he was calm. His conversation with those gentlemen flowed as sweetly and peacefully and musically as a summer brook. When the audience was ended and we were retiring from the presence, he put his hand on my head, beamed down on me in an admiring way and said to my brother, \\"Ah - your child, I pressume? Boy or girl?\\""},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"While I am not a 'believer' in Mormonism in any sense, I have often looked at the book of Mormon with fascination in the secondhand bookstores here. Quite often it is tucked away in the religious section like a Gideon's New Testament, alluring yet strange.I would agree with Harold Bloom that Smith is a Gnostic religious thinker. His visions have much in paralell with William Blake, though Smith believed he was receiving his visions by angels and Smith's works are not poetic as Blake's were. Looking at his biography Smith was clearly a charismatic man, a man of the people, and genuinely believed his revelations were true. In this sense he belongs to other prophetic figures such as Mohmamed, Jesus, and more recently, the Bab of the B'Hai faith.The Book of Mormon tells the story of the expulsion of the Twelve Tribes of Israel after the destruction of the Temple. In Smith's belief system, these tribes set sail for the Americas and settled there, constructing a number of civilisations. The most recent aspect of this diaspora was the Mormon movement itself, whose place in the world was given providentially by God and revealed to him by Joseph Smith.Mormonism contains many beliefs which from the viewpoint of the older branches of Christianity, are heretical or heterodox. These include seeing God as a finite rather than infinite being, seeing the Trinity as essentially three different persons but not as one being, and various other beliefs which make little sense to the outsider. The book itself is styled on the King James Bible and is probably best heard aloud rather than read.Clearly some of the claims of the book conflict with archaeological and historical evidence, but then so does the Bible and other religious scriptures. The key to a religion is not whether it conforms to scientific history but the spiritual life of the religion itself, expressed in the life and hearts and minds of believers, and no doubt to beleiving mormons, Smith's works contain the same power and beauty that the Bible does to mainstream Christians, or the Qu'ran does to believing Muslims. Clearly there is a point where 'unless you have faith, you will not understand', but one doesn't need to have faith to be interested in Mormonism and its texts."},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"The Book of Mormon will bring you closer to Christ then any other book.

Try it. What do you have to lose?"},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"First of all, let me state that I am a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS), or Mormon Church, as it is sometimes called. As such, I believe the Bible to be the word of God. I study the Bible faithfully and regularly, but I also believe the Book of Mormon to be the word of God. I believe that just as Jesus taught the people who lived in and near the city of Jerusalem during his life, he also visited and instructed others around the world after his death and resurrection. I believe the Book of Mormon to be an account written by men who were called by God. Most of these men were prophets, just like Noah, Abraham, and Moses.The Book of Mormon begins with the writings of a prophet named Nephi, who lived in the city of Jerusalem with his family, around 600 years before the birth of Christ. Being led by the Lord, he and his family were directed to leave Jerusalem and travel through the wilderness until they reached the sea. Once there, Nephi was instructed to build a ship and sail to what would later become America. These people, who were called \\"Nephites,\\" believed devoutly in Jesus Christ. In fact, Nephi wrote of a detailed vision he had of Christ's birth several hundred years before the event. The Nephite civilization continued for hundreds of years until Christ visited them in the Western Hemisphere, after his crucifixion and resurrection in Jerusalem. Their society persisted for another 400 years after Christ's appearance, until warfare destroyed their entire population. We do believe, however, that a remnant of the initial group, called \\"Lamanites,\\" whose leader, Laman, first sailed with Nephi from Jerusalem continued to thrive and are the ancestors of some Native American peoples.The metal records kept by Nephite prophets and other important men of the time were buried in the earth around 400 A.D. and were later discovered by Joseph Smith in the early 1800s, after Joseph was directed to their location by an angel. By the grace and power of God, Joseph was able to translate the ancient language contained on the metal plates into English, and subsequently the first copies of the Book of Mormon were printed in 1830.At this point I could choose to offer my rebuttals regarding what I believe has falsely been reported by several nay-saying reviewers, who have suggested that the Book of Mormon may be proven false based on some loosely defined historical and geological \\"facts.\\" I doubt anything I might say could change the opinions of those who believe their convictions are rooted in their subjective evidence, when even a cursory Internet search or a modest understanding of ancient North American history might allow an individual to consider the veracity of the Book of Mormon's premise.Instead, let me simply say that I believe the Book of Mormon to be true in its teachings and declarations. I believe it to be scripture, inspired by our Father in Heaven, and is indeed another witness and testament of Jesus Christ's divinity as our Savior and Redeemer. Though I appreciate how difficult it may be for anyone who has not had personal experience with the book to believe such claims, I still do not hesitate to say that I believe my family and I are blessed with greater peace and happiness and added direction and strength when we study it earnestly together. I honestly feel that these blessings are tangible and realized each time we seriously read, ponder, and apply its teachings to our lives.Much like a person who eats adequate daily servings of fruits, vegetables, and grains and partakes in regular exercise experiences greater health and vitality, I earnestly feel a lifting and strengthening and a genuine sensation of peace and serenity when I read the Book of Mormon. I can't state my feelings about this book more plainly, or more honestly, than that.My one hope is that if you are considering reading the Book of Mormon that you will do so with an honest, sincere, humble, and open mind. If you combine your reading with prayer, I believe your experience with this book will be as grand as mine."},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"If you're like me, you will read many books in your life.

Clearly, most are from partisans (either strongly for or against) and not about the text itself or as holy writ of a significant world religion to be accorded the kind of respect one would for sacred writings of other religions.I am among those who (many years ago) received a free copy and read it, both as religious text and as literature. It is not the kind of reading one takes lightly or for fun (altho' apparently some read it for ridicule). But then, neither does one do so for the Bible or Upanshids or Koran, etc. As religious text I found it very interesting and worthy of study, as suggested by some major religious studies scholars, e.g., the eminent Jewish scholar Jacob Neusner and a prominent professor at Harvard Divinity (whose name escapes me for the moment). I found reading the Book of Mormon to be much more akin to the Bible than to such things as Calvin's \\"Institutes\\" and other systematic theologizing.It is something one should read for oneself rather than decide on the basis of critics or supporters. It has many beautiful poetic passages and inspiring moral sermons, like some of the best sermons I have heard delivered by a few Protestant preachers.Is it historically accurate? Is the Bible? Who knows? But the jury is still out on both of those. However, one should not read it as a history text but as a human story, as something that portrays principles about the human condition and human society as people pursue various values and beliefs.What I do wish is that the publishers would provide a little more background for understanding its origin and its place in an expanding world religion and as part of global diversity of belief systems, not just the text itself.Finally, I'm not sure why I would buy this particular edition rather than get another free copy from the Mormon Church.\\"Lament\\"Ithaca, NY"},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"For the record, I read the entire text.

Yet, it seems to me the major consideration is to gain some minimal understanding of the diverse concepts that influence different groups at variable levels. It has been recently reported The Church of the Latter Day Saints is the fastest growing denomination of Christianity. That alone is justification enough for me to spend some time with the basic text to their belief system.The Book Of Mormon is best understood with a conversational familiarity with the Christian bible. For the Mormon, it is Scripture, another testament of Jesus Christ. I am not sectarian, however even if I did subscribe to a specific religious theory, it would be difficult for me to dismiss another based exclusively on the premise at some point in time, the heavenly Father chose to terminate direct communication with his progeny. If the idea Noah could receive divine instruction to build an Ark offers concordance, it seems perfectly plausible alternative blueprints could be proffered to Nephi to cross the expanse of what we now know as the Atlantic Ocean. The New Testament is a new covenant, indicating God is susceptible to a modification of guidelines, who am I to state he didn't hedge his bets at a much earlier juncture?The book is tedious but so is the Old Testament. It is shortsighted to criticize or dismiss without taking the time to explore. I may not agree yet this holy testimony deserves the same amount of respect and reverence as we typically offer to the wider held beliefs."},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"The age-old adage, \\"Don't knock it 'till you've tried it,\\" applies here. Many will post their disgruntled views here about why you shouldn't read the Book of Mormon. Only you can decide whether or not it is true or powerful in your life. I read the book for an assignment as a teenager and prayed about it with no heavenly response. I attended Stanford University and married. I attended law school. I had a child. I was very unhappy in my marriage and in life. I didn't know what I believed in anymore. I read the book again, but this time I did a \\"critical\\" reading in the literary sense. What was in those pages and could they help me? I had read the New Testament in high school and had come to love Jesus Christ. I needed more direction in my life than I had. I read the Book of Mormon searching for answers - not to criticize it, not to condemn it, not to judge it. When I finished the book, I put God to the test. I had such an overwhelming feeling of love, light and power come over me after that prayer that stayed with me for at least 20 minutes. In that period of time, I knew that the Book of Mormon was true and that Jesus Christ was alive and my personal savior. From that point in my life I committed to follow Him and help and bless as many people around me as I could. I am still on his path. There are remarkable conversions to the knowledge of Christ in the Book of Mormon, like Saul's conversion in the New Testament. I feel that I had one of those experiences; but, it required a real desire to know with a willing heart to believe what was written. The Book says that those who believe in Christ will believe in these words (the words of the Book of Mormon) because they are his words. I encourage you to read with a believing heart and put God to the test. He always keeps his word."},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"I have read this book for the past 24 years. I first read it when I was 18. During that time, I've lost count how many I've read it. Like all great books, classics included, each time I've read it, I've learned something new. I've always walked away a better person.The book is a history of a people who fall in and out of love with the God of Heaven. These people are taught of Jesus Christ and His eventual coming to this earth to redeem all that believe on His name. Some believe and act on those beliefs while others choose not to. Those choices create a vivid picture of how belief and faith in Jesus Christ or lack thereof shape a nation.A historical pattern existing in every culture that has ever exists is again reaffirmed in this historical text. Faith, prosperity, pride, and destruction are experienced over and over again. Like all eternal truths or laws which govern all of existence, the principles taught in this book by the lives of these people help me to stand watch in my own life reminding me that Jesus Christ is the only Light by which I can safely be guided."},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"I was given the Book of Mormon to read about twenty five years ago by my father and I read a chapter or two and put it down.

Over a period of a year I read this book until I had completed it. By the time I finished to Book, I knew that it was the word of God. My scientific training had taught me to be skeptical. My spiritual training had taught me how to be open to the promptings of the Holy Spirit. Through these two, I came to know beyond a shadow of a doubt that this was the true word of God. It changed my life. I joined the LDS Church. It brought me closer to my dad and my family. It made come to understand the power of my dad's testimony of the LDS Church which is documented in his book, [...] Since reading the Book of Mormon in 1995 and 1996 I have read it many times and read it almost daily.

People will be willing to pay the shipping cost for you. You could order it for free. The Mormon church is not out to get you, to brainwash their members, to fool around with history.

It provided insights that led to questions about life, God and religion that I was afraid to ask myself. Is much of it the same as the Bible? Yes. That's because the source that inspired its authors is the same that inspired the Bible. There are four Gospels in the New Testament; are they fradulent because they repeat?The Book of Mormon is so valuable because it restores many things that were lost from the bible during centuries of translation. The Bible has been rewritten so many times, what we currently have can not be considered all that has been revealed to man from God. Ancient scrolls discovered in the Dead Sea show differences, ommisions, and additions when compared to the modern King James text. Does the Book of Mormon fill all the missing gaps? No. But it does certainly provide valuable insights into Christianity. This book is a powerful witness for Christ, it's what the whole book is about.Read the negative reviews of this book here, and observe the language and tone with which they are written. The anger and bitterness is obvious, and damaging to the claims with which they are made. In fact, some of the claims made against the Book of Mormon and Joseph Smith are almost identical copies of the accusations and claims made against the Savior during His ministry among the Jews.Read this book, it won't hurt you. You just might come away from the experience with much more then you would of thought possible.This book changes lives, it did mine.

Understand that the very nature of this book demands that the reader make a choice to either accept it as the Word of God and therefore be under obligation to join The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints or see it as fiction and avoid the often dramatic change in lifestyle that membership in the LDS Church demands. Of course if one is a member of the LDS Church and no longer wishes to conform to the strict standards of conduct espoused by the Church they must somehow find a way in their mind to disavow the divinity of The Book of Mormon or forever see themselves as hypocrites.I have read the book of Mormon numerous times, I have no doubt that it is divine in its origins and I accept it as Scripture, revelation from God. I have also read many of the current antagonistic works concerning this amazing book and on a purely intellectual level find virtually all of them to be contaminated by the author's bias and subjective views. The honest scientist or historian recognizes that conclusions are almost always contaminated by subjectivity and does not pretend otherwise. It is my own subjective judgment that most antagonistic works only fain objectivity. Of course apologist works also lack objectivity however they typically do not pretend to be objective.There are many good honest people who believe the book of Mormon is a fallacy and there are millions who believes it is revelation from God. Where might one find an objective answer to the book of Mormon question? I suggest that you consider accessing the only review that is truly objective, the only review that finally matters, in the words of the book it self;Moroni 10:3-5...when ye shall receive these things, I would exhort you that ye would ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these things are not true; and if ye shall ask with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ, he will manifest the truth of it unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost."},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"I have read the Book of Mormon many times.

I don't need physical evidence that this book is true. I don't need physical evidence that Joseph Smith was the translator. I don't need physical evidence that President Hinckley's sayings are true. I believe in this book. People have said that all answers to life are in it. I agree it's not word for word, but an idea to solving problems is in there.I can go on and relate why I said what I did, but it doesn't go with this book. It's full of wars, peace times, social problems and acceptance, calming warm fuzzy moments and a whole slew of other feelings you can get. It will make you mad. It will make you question things. It will help you understand that not everyone is perfect and we all need to work on ourselves.Don't prejudge. Don't hate something because a couple people have negative feelings about it. Try it for yourself. This is a spiritual book and NO ONE can have control over your spiritual life except you!As a friend has written to me about this book (with support from a bunch of other friends)...As someone mentioned before, there are two types of people who will post here- those who believe the truthfulness of the Book of Mormon, and those who hate it with a passion.Instead of taking everything anyone says on these reviews as absolute truth and undeniable wisdom, look at your own experiences with a Mormon you know. Now, NOBODY is perfect, but Mormons are taught to be hardworking, honest, upright and decent individuals. If you know a Mormon who is active in the church, and does read the Book of Mormon, chances are good that you have a good impression of them. I know some Mormons, however, who leave a bad impression...but if you were to ask them and they answered honestly, they would probably not be active or have a testimony of the Book of Mormon.So ask yourself who you're going to believe when it comes to what the Book of Mormon is or isn't about- someone who lives their life by it? Or someone who hates the church and all it stands for? Look at your Mormon friends, if you know any. See what they're about, but again, don't judge the church by the exception; the Mormon who celebrates anti-Mormon principles by the way he or she lives.To get a summary of what Mormons really believe, read their \\"Articles of Faith;\\" 13 tenants of the Mormon faith that can be found at www.lds.org.And read the Book of Mormon yourself if you want to know for sure. The reason why it is being sold here on Amazon while you could get it for free from a missionary is simply so more people can have access to it. It is being sold in places like airports, where travelers can pick it up and read it if they have an interest in it. This is not a scheme for the church to make money- there is some profit in it for the publisher and the distributor, but money is not the focus for the church.If you have any questions on the Articles of Faith, or any other questions about Mormon belief, www.lds.org is the official church website.

I read it daily (along with the Bible), because it brings God's Spirit in my life. It inspires me to make better choices, and gives me the power to resist temptations. It leads me to repent and have faith in Jesus Christ. The words of this scripture lead men, women, and families to Christ. I have been brought closer to God's Holy Son through a study of it's pages. I know MANY people, and have read many reviews of people who have had similar life-changing experiences!Those who are critical it seems look at Mormon doctrine through the window of their own religious beliefs. Is it any wonder then that it doesn't make sense to them? Have these men ever read the Book in its entirety, and then did as exhorted by the prophet Moroni, to ask with a sincere heart and real intent? Or do they simply read with the intention of finding evidence to support their own narrow views and agenda? Below is the promise made in the Book of Mormon, to pray and ask God as an individual son or daughter if the book is true. Could there be a more sure witness than one received from God?3 Behold, I would exhort you that when ye shall read these things, if it be wisdom in God that ye should read them, that ye would remember how merciful the Lord hath been unto the children of men, from the creation of Adam even down until the time that ye shall receive these things, and ponder it in your hearts.4 And when ye shall receive these things, I would exhort you that ye would ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these things are not true; and if ye shall ask with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ, he will manifest the truth of it unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost.5 And by the power of the Holy Ghost ye may know the truth of all things. (Moroni 10:3-5)There are deceivers, and there is truth. The scripture says \\"by the power of the Holy Ghost you may know the truth of all things.\\" (How do you know if you are feeling the spirit? Galatians 5:22-23) The scriptures also say \\"by their fruits ye shall know them.\\" Faithful Mormons endeavor to draw close to God by obeying his commandments. Bending our will to God's instead of the other way around will yield the spiritual growth and progression that others only speak about.There is a power in the Book of Mormon, which for me does not only come through the story line (although it is worth studying, and filled with analogies for our day), but rather from how I feel when I read it. Many righteous men and women, both anciently and in recent history, made great sacrifices for us to have this book. Take advantage of the opportunity to read it, and have that power manifested for good in your life.

The \\"author\\" of this book felt he was better than Jesus Christ.The inside pages of this book provides a written testimony of \\"Three Witnesses\\" and then another \\"Eight Witnesses\\" as to the truthfulness of the alleged \`translation'.Let's take a closer look at each of the \\"Witnesses\\":1). OLIVER COWDERY - He signed his name as witness to the book in 1830 at the age of 24. Cowdery and Smith were third cousins. He was EXCOMMUNICATED from the Mormon Church on April 12, 1838. In 1841 the Mormons published a poem which stated \\"... Or Book of Mormon not his word, because denied by Oliver...\\" -- Seasons and Times, Vol 2, p482. In 1848, ten years after he was excommunicated, Oliver re-applied for membership in the church and was re-baptized. He never again held office within the Mormon church.2). DAVID WHITMER - He heard about Smith through Oliver Cowdery, while visiting Palmyra NY, on a business trip. He served as a scribe to Smith during the alleged translation period in 1829 at the age of 24. He left the church in 1937 and was labeled an \\"apostate\\". He was subsequently EXCOMMUNICATED in 1838. He wrote: \\"... I tell you that in June, 1838, ... [God] told me to 'separate myself from among the Latter-day Saints'... [Address to all believers in Christ, p27, 1887.]3). MARTIN HARRIS - He met Smith in 1827 at the age of 44. At the time he was married to Smith's first-cousin, Lucy Harris. Harris served as Smith's first scribe for the alleged Book of Mormon translation in 1828 at the age of 45, but was removed shortly thereafter, for making sarcastic remarks. He was later re-instated as a scribe shortly after providing Smith with $3,000 for expense of printing the first edition of the book. He was excommunicated AGAIN for the SECOND TIME, in 1842. He was subsequently re-baptized in 1870, 28 years after his second excommunication. During his life span, Harris changed his religious affiliation over 13 times. The Mormons stated of Martin Harris, \\" ... The very countenance of Harris will show to every spiritual-minded person who sees him, that the wrath of God is upon him.\\" [Latter-Day Saint's, Millennial Star, Vol 8 pp124-128.]4). CHRISTIAN WHITMER - Died 6 years after his testimony to the book BEFORE his other family members were Excommunicated.5). JACOB WHITMER - VOLUNTARILY LEFT THE CHURCH6). PETER WHITMER, JR. - Died 7 years after his testimony to the book BEFORE his other family members were Excommunicated.7). JOHN WHITMER - EXCOMMUNICATED in 1838.8). HIRAM PAGE - In 1838 he VOLUNTARILY LEFT THE CHURCH when members of the Whitmer family were excommunicated.9). JOSEPH SMITH, SR. - [Father of Smith - Author] - Stayed in the Mormon church until his death in 1840.10). HYRUM SMITH - [Brother to Smith - Author] - Died in 1844 Carthage, Illinois with Smith.11). SAMUEL H. SMITH - [Brother to Smith - Author] - Stayed in the Mormon church until his death on July 30, 1844.What I have always found fascinating with how this book came to be, is that there is NO written confirmation from anyone who surrounded themselves with Smith [author] during the writing of this book, that said they actually viewed the alleged \`Gold Plates\\" supposedly in his possession. A few of the witnesses did say they saw them with their \\"Spiritual Eyes\\".... they were shown to me by a supernatural power\\" (John Whitmer - History of the Church, Vol. 3, p. 307).The angel took the record and turned the leaves, and showed it to us by the power of God ...\\" (David Whitmer Interview with E. C. Briggs and R. Etzenhouser at Richmond, Missouri, April 25, 1884. Saints' Herald, Volume 31, page 396.)\\"I never saw the gold plates, only in a visionary or entranced state.\\" (Martin Harris - Anthony Metcalf, Ten Years Before the Mast, n.d., microfilm copy, p. 70-71).William Smith stated ... \\"I did not see them uncovered, but I handled them and hefted them while wrapped in a tow frock and judged them to have weighed about sixty pounds. ... Father and my brother Samuel saw them as I did while in the frock. So did Hyrum and others of the family.\\"Each of these men above, were related either by blood or marriage. The only ones who remained with Joseph in the Mormon church were his father and two brothers. If you also notice in the book, there is no original copy of the \\"Testimony\\", only a typed version is provided. If this book is so holy in nature, where are copies of their original signatures with their testimony?If you want to read this book for entertainment, go for it. If you are looking for deep scripture there are too many flaws to count in each and every printing. To date there have been more than 3,000+ changes made to this book.If you are buying it for historical reasons, you might want to hang on to your copy, as in 100 years or so, it will probably be one of a kind, as the \\"brethren\\" no doubt will change it again."},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"The Book of Mormon is either a real description and account of the early inhabitants of the Americas, or it is not. There is no other position one can logically take. One cannot take a position that part of it is accurate, and another part was written by a frontiersman as a hoax. If any section is true, then Joseph Smith had to have translated it, as such knowledge did not exist in 1820s. He did not have a library to search and find such information.Given that any section is true implies that the entirety is true, then the next logical conclusion is that Joseph Smith was telling the truth when he said that an angel gave him the inscribed plates. This same angel gave him the tools whereby he was able to translate these inscribed plates into English.If this is all true, (again you only need to be convinced that even one section of the book is accurate), then this book is the most important find in the last 200 years. It describes a being named Jesus Christ visiting a different culture and civilization than the Jews in Jerusalem. Everyone will want to know if this is the same Jesus Christ that was born in Bethlehem, and did he tell this vastly different civilization any thing different than he taught in Israel? On top of that, it would seem that if he did in fact visit these civilizations that he was resurrected in Jerusalem and not still dead.This is very significant.

These writtings were written by the spirit and can only be understood by the spirit. It is amusing to hear critics complain that Joseph Smith took verses of scripture right out of the Old Testament. The truth is, these prophets had access to the Old Testament by way of brass plates they brought with them across the ocean to the American continent. In their writtings they loved to quote scripture, especially Isaiah. Other critics offer similar complaints but it is clear they do not understand the Book of Mormon. What was written by the spirit must be understood by the spirit, so it is no wonder there is such a great division in peoples opinions about this true book."},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"I was going to write a long-winded review of this work of fiction, but I see that the ground has already been largely covered. Instead, let me simply add my witness that Mormonism hurts families. The Mormon church is racist, money-hungry, power-hungry and absolutely corrupt.No worries though...the Internet has allowed the dirty truth about Mormonism to reach the masses. The implosion has already started and cannot be stopped. The LDS corporate bosses are powerless to stop it...God bless the Net!!"},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"As a child I had heard the story of Joseph Smith and the golden plates after reading \\"Meet the Mormons.\\" I found the story of a boy who was searching for a true church and found an answer from angels and God to be blueprint for my own search - as I too was confused about the many denominations and sects that existed.Pretty much I assumed that the Book of Mormon was indeed true although I had never read it. One day, a few decades later, I found a Book of Mormon in a used book store and was excited to finally read the book. By that time I already knew Biblical Hebrew and Ancient Greek. I also was extensively educated in ancient religion so I knew a lot about ancient Judaism.I must admit I was sorely disappointed when I finally read the book. There was just NO WAY that these Book of Mormon characters would have foreknowledge of Hellenistic Judaism centuries before the fact! I was also amazed that Book of Mormon prophets could quote St. Paul before Christ was even born! Amazing. All with perfect Koine Greek syntax and idioms! Somehow \\"Reformed Egyptian\\" had Greek influence - even before there was any historical contact between Hellenes and Egyptians or Jews! Wow! Furthermore, some of the names were laughable. There is no way that a Hebrew would name anyone Amulek or Amleki. That is like naming your kid \\"Satanne\\" or \\"Devilman.\\" And these were supposed to be good guys. Joseph Smith obviously didn't understand much about how roots work in Hebrew when he was making up names.Despite the glaring theological and linguistic anachronisms (laying aside anachronisms such as horses!), I still took the \\"Moroni Challenge\\" to pray about the book. The answer always comes very strongly - a glaring NO. This book is NOT true and I bear you my testimony of this.Actually, I am rather disappointed because I like Mormons and think that other aspects of their religion are nice. Mormonism would have much more credibility if it ditched the Book of Mormon. As a Christian, I am aware of the danger of spiritual deception. In true Christianity, one is very suspicious of visions and instructions by angels. Many have been led into perdition because of this. Satan knows how to quote scripture and demons know how to transform themselves into angels of light.I see little difference between the spiritual deception of Joseph Smith and that of Islam's prophet Muhammed. Both were instructed by angels and revealed faiths that led people away from the true Christianity. I pray that Mormons will someday see that they have fallen for one of the many wiles of the evil one who knows perfectly well how to hide falsehood under a cover of righteousness."},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"This is a remarkable addition to the cannon of available Judeo-Christian scripture. Written by numerous Israelite authors who imigrated to the New World six hundred years before the birth of Christ, the Book of Mormon is inspired by Christian and ancient Israelite wisdom, doctrine, hope and prophecy. One of the many intriguing parts of the book includes an in-depth view of how these ancient Israelites practiced the Law of Moses and how those beliefs directed their faith toward a vibrant hope in the promised Messiah.The book covers a period from 600 B.C. through 400 A.D. and provides an eye-wintess account of one of numerous civilizations that populated the New World---written as it was by multiple authors of the time. The Book of Mormon chronicles the rise of an ancient society believed to have inhabited a relatively limited geographic region along the Yucatan Peninsula in southern Central America. Included in its pages is an in-depth record of doctrines that provide a fascinating window onto ancient Israelite views of salvation, faith, repentance, pre-mortal and post-mortal life, earth life as a probationary period of mortal testing designed by the Creator, and effectively joins Israelite and Christian beliefs in a seamless doctrinal view that includes valuable teachings about the saving role of the atonment of Christ in the lives of believers.About three quarters of the way through the book, in a section titled \\"Third Nephi\\" after one of the many prophet-authors, is an account of the appearance of Christ after his crucifixion and resurrection in Jerusalem. This portion of the book details a thoroughly captivating addition to the accounts of Christ's ministry in the Old World and is an informative read for anyone interested in the spread of Christ's ministry throughout the anicent world.The book is accepted as scripture by members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (Mormons) and, like the Old and New Testaments, incorporates a complex interweaving of the writings and religious teachings of numerous prophet-leaders who lived prior to and after the advent of Christ. It also touches on the wars, government and economics of these ancient Israelites living in the Americas, but to a much lesser degree than matters of faith.The Book of Mormon is the book that informed the rise of a world wide religious movement---The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints---and is listed by Book Magazine as one of the twenty most influential books that changed America since its founding, standing alongside other classic American works like Uncle Tom's Cabin by Harriet Beecher Stowe and John Steinbeck's Grapes of Wrath (see Book Magazine online listing: www.bookmagazine.com/issue29/twenty.shtml).The events surrounding the discovery of the Book of Mormon are, in some respects, as fascinating as the book itself, since they include the visit of a resurrected being---the angel Moroni who as a mortal was among the last prophet/authors to write on the gold plate record and who was responsible for depositing the final draft of plates in a stone box buried in the ground sometime around 400 A.D before his death. This resurrected prophet appeared to Joseph Smith Jr. 1,400 years later and a detailed account of his appearance can be found in the preface written in the straight forward language of Joseph Smith Jr. the translator of the Book of Mormon.Moroni instructed Joseph Smith Jr. where he could unearth the gold plate record buried in a hill not too far distant from his home in upstate New York. The finding and translating of this ancient record established Joseph Smith as a modern-day prophet for members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints and in the years following these angelic visits, Joseph Smith Jr. restored numerous ancient covenants promised in the Bible as well as establishing the Church of Jesus Christ with priesthood authority from heaven and organizing the restored church with prophets and apostles similarly to how the church of Christ was organized when Jesus was on the earth.The unearthing of the ancient gold plate record marked the beginning of a prophetic call for Joseph Smith Jr. to do a work unlike any clergy in the modern world. Early in the morning of September 22nd 1827 Joseph Smith ushered into existence aditional Judeo-Christian scripture apropriately sub-titled \\"Another Testament of Jesus Christ\\" and began a dispensation of revelations destined to reach beyond his farming community of Palmyra Township and touch the lives of men and women across the earth who would listen to this new prophet tell of a latter-day restoration when God remembered again his ancient covenants with Israel. Joseph Smith Jr. translated the record from its ancient Semitic dialect and published the translation as the Book of Mormon, fulfilling ancient biblical prophecies that in the last days of the earth God would do a marvelous work among men.If you're interested in religion in general or if you're looking for a spiritually uplifting read (like I am), the Book of Mormon is worth the purchase price.

I desperately learned to manipulate myself into feeling as I read it have veto authority in my otherwise rational epistemology. But that was before I acquired the guts to critically and honestly examine my beliefs, and now that I have untangled myself, perhaps a blurb on this book's merits from someone with my background would be helpful to someone.Now that scientists have established beyond doubt through DNA analysis that all native Americans are descended from east Asians that crossed the Bering Strait land bridge during the ice age and haven't got a drop of Semitic DNA in their bodies (not to mention the fact that horses, silk, steel, chariots (hell, wheels themselves), 7-day weeks, asses, bulls, cows, domesticated sheep and goats, breastplates, etc. did not exist in this hemisphere prior to the European colonization), it is hilarious to watch how the Mormon church backpedals on its claim that the Book of Mormon, which describes an enormous Hebraic civilzation in ancient America that took all these things for granted, is real history.Now we are to believe that the characters in this charming book of fiction were of a negligible number among a large number of preexisting natives who somehow never actually get mentioned in the book, and that the founder effect somehow wiped out their DNA imprint on the archaeological record (did those FARMS dudes really pay attention in their evolutionary biology classes?).Right. So Lehite DNA was diluted into oblivion by mixing with preexisting natives, but on the other hand, the natives completely abandoned their established ways and adopted the Jewish ways of this genetically negligible population so much so and so quickly that they were willing to fight wars and risk their lives to take sides in said negligible population's silly family feud. Yeah, the Lehites arrive in the New World and almost overnight they are fighting wars, either with only a literal handful of people on each side, or with the help of thousands of natives who despite not even speaking the invaders' language, just dropped what they'd been doing for untold generations to fight over who gets to take over their own government? And no mention of whether any of the oldtimers thought, \\"hmm, we were here first, maybe WE should run the government. Nah, let's completely abandon our traditions and make the newbie foreign invader our king.\\" HAHAHAHAHA!!!!!A classic technique of the disingenuous: when reality gets in the way of your dogma, retreat into ostensibly nonfalsifiable gibberish, no matter how convoluted. This is why the religions with the oldest traditions are the hardest to prove wrong...or right. Mormonism, being still quite young, has its value in showing us how myths form.Hence my belief that Mormonism can only improve at the expense of its credibility. If it does the honest thing and squares with its history and the numerous points at which it fails to connect with reality, it will of course have trouble convincing anyone of its monopoly on God's authority, let alone that it was not an outright [...]. On the other hand, if it continues its 174-year-old trend of rewriting its history and doctrine ad hoc, it can gradually distance itself from unpalatable elements of its past that it has not apologized for (racism, misogyny, violence), but only shield the truth from the uncritical.So, study this cult if, like me, you have a perverse fascination with how crackpotness can go mainstream over time. Otherwise, go live your life and don't waste your time here."},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"And it came to pass that this book doth stinketh, even doth it stinketh exceedingly.

The Section of the Book known as 3rd Nephi, is as awesome a description of the love, concern, and mission of the Son of God as will be found anywhere in Holy Writ. When one reads the Book of Mormon, in light of the recent natural disasters that have beset our globe, one is comforted with the peace of a loving God and loving Saviour.

As you see from the various reviews of this book here on Amazon, you will notice that there are two general opinions: (1) This book changed my life, or (2)This book is evil and false. It seems amazing that the same book can elicit such divergent opinions. But it is actually appropriate that a book that adds another afirming testimony of the divinity and reality of the Savior, Jesus Christ should receive the same polarized reaction the the Savior himself received during his life on this earth? Christ was either hated or loved, beaten or embraced, crucified or exhaulted--there was no middle ground. So too, the Book of Mormon leaves no room for indifference. The only way to know who is telling the truth is to read it for yourself. Read it with an open heart. Ponder what is being said. Then humble yourself enough to sincerely ask God to help you to know whether it is true or not.As for my personal review, I have no doubt of it's truthfulness and it's ability to make me a better person, husband and father.

Many words used in the BOM by Joseph Smith Jr. were not even \\"invented\\" or used in languages, 600 B.C. when the purported man Mormon and his son Moroni supposedly \\"scribed\\" these works! Let's look at further evidence that \\"Moroni\\" supposedly lived as a man (human being) and then died in the flesh and came back as an \\"angel\\" in 1823 to give his \\"divine\\" revelation to Joseph Smith Jr.!

I submit that the Bible actually prophesies of the Book of Mormon.Several biblical authors speak of a voice of truth coming out of the earth, or speaking from the dust:Psalms 85:8-12\\"I will hear what God the Lord will speak: for he will speak peace unto his people, and to his saints: but let them not turn again to folly. Surely his salvation is nigh them that fear him; that glory may dwell in our land. Mercy and truth are met together; righteousness and peace have kissed each other. Truth shall spring out of the earth; and righteousness shall look down from heaven.\\"Isaiah 45:8-9\\"Drop down, ye heavens, from above, and let the skies pour down righteousness: let the earth open and let them bring forth salvation, and let righteousness spring up together; I the Lord have created it. Woe unto him that striveth with his Maker! Let the potsherd strive with the potsherds of the earth. Shall the clay say to him that fashioneth it, What makest thou? or thy work, He hath no hands?\\"Isaiah chapter 29 is a very exciting prophesy for Latter-day Saints (i.e. Mormons). I don't know of any other religion that can explain with exactness the meaning of these verses. Here are a few verses of particular interest:Isaiah 29:11-12\\"And the vision of all is become unto you as the words of a book that is sealed, which men deliver to one that is learned, saying, Read this, I pray thee: and he saith, I cannot; for it is sealed: And the book is delivered to him that is not learned, saying, Read this, I pray thee: and he saith, I am not learned.\\"We believe that this prophesy was fulfilled in February of 1828. The sealed book is the Book of Mormon; the learned man is professor Charles Anthon of New York, and the unlearned man is Joseph Smith.Isaiah 29:14\\"Therefore, behold, I will proceed to do a marvellous work among this people, even a marvellous work and a wonder: for the wisdom of their wise men shall perish, and the understanding of their prudent men shall be hid.\\"We believe that the marvellous work referred to here is the restoration of the fullness of the gospel after centuries of apostacy and confusion. God lives! He has not fallen silent. He will not leave faithful believers without His continuing word.Ezekiel speaks of two sticks. Think of wooden writing tablets which were common in that day.Ezekiel 37:15-17\\"The word of the Lord came again unto me, saying, Moreover, thou son of man, take thee one stick, and write upon it, For Judah, and for the children of Israel his companions: then take another stick, and write upon it, For Joseph, the stick of Ephraim, and for all the house of Israel his companions: And join them one to another into one stick; and they shall become one in thine hand.\\"We believe the stick of Judah to be the Bible, and the stick of Ephraim to be the Book of Mormon.Finally, consider the words of Jesus Christ:John 10:16\\"And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd.\\"Ever wonder who are these other sheep? They are the righteous inhabitants of the Americas. You can read about how they heard Jesus' voice in the Book of Mormon.You may say that this is all a great stretch of the imagination. It isn't perfectly clear to the sincere Bible student what these verses are talking about. This wouldn't be the first time that someone used a bunch of disjointed biblical verses taken out of context to try to prove something. ...I just hope that your curiosity will be piqued enough for you to read the Book of Mormon and see for yourself.I add my witness to the many others found here: This book is from God. It is the keystone of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which I believe to possess the fullness of the gospel restored. The only way to know for sure is to do what Moroni says: Ask God. Don't forget to \\"remember how merciful the Lord hath been unto the children of men, from the creation of Adam even down until the time that ye shall read these things, and ponder it in your hearts.\\" (Moroni 10:3) This attitude of gratitude will invite the Holy Ghost. Then when you ask, you will receive your answer the way I did, by the power of the Holy Ghost.

I've tried a number of times to read from cover to cover. I just don't find it that interesting. As a historical document, things seem a little too neatly packaged. All the prophecies are true because they all happened by Joseph Smith's time. And the lack of cultural and physical evidence doesn't help either. As a testimony builder, I'm not sure if it is to ensure a testimony of Christ, Smith, or both. What it is supposed to do is elicit joyful emotions. If it feels good, then it is true. I don't have a testimony not because it didn't make me feel good and give me a sense of valiance. It just didn't hold it's water in the fields of history, archeology, or even metaphysical works, in my opinion. I have read better and more profound books.This book is filled with incredible faith promoting tales of great prophet-generals, sagely kings, political turmoil that makes Beirut look like Disneyland. I can't understand a few things about the greatest part of the book, the part of Christ's visit to the Americas. He destroys all the wicked people there, but why did he never destroy the Roman empire? He speaks of the Jews not having as much faith as the Nephites. But anybody would have faith in Jesus as the Christ if he floated down from the sky on a beam of light.So, my overall opinion of the book is, read it, but if you want to find out more about Mormonism, pick up half a dozen church pamphlets. They'll tell you everything you need to know."},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"But if you are looking for spiritual enlightenment, this isn't the book for you."},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"I have been around for a long time and through my decades of life,travel and schooling,one thing shines forth-you can't prove a faith-based item in a purely objective fact-based manner.I read tons of info on the latest research into ancient America.I do NOT find contradictions to this vol.Why do the Mormon-haters ignore so much that is spot on with the BOOK?I,unlike many who believe,have read a lot of anti info.Most of it is like a Chuckie Schumer or Harry Reid press party-NOTHING new here,you've heard it all before.It's just hate hate hate.That doesn't mean ol'Joe Smith was perfect,or even the Book perfect.Was Thomas Jefferson perfect?NO.Was Ben Franklin perfect?NO.Was G.Washington perfect?NO!(he coveted his friend's wife,the lovely Sally Fairfax.)God raises up the best he can get and uses them to accomplish his will with men.The founding fathers were great but not perfect,but what they wrought changed human history and made all our future lives better.There are those who want to stand around and throw stones at these great men,tear them down,take their names off the public edific.They might as well try to empty the ocean with a tea cup.Same with Brother Joseph,Brother Brigham and the others.They were raised up by God for the restoration and spread of a great work.Working with a smug and superior attitude to destroy these men and their works only diminishes the attacker.Moroni 10:4 & 5 does work.The record of the LDS movement in the last few decades is one of overall excellence and progress.They do not hide from the world,seperate families,condemn others;no,they go forth selflessly all through the world to improve lives,give hope,teach people skills to insure progress,advance education and democracy.I love this Church love seeing its enemies babble in frustration at its growth and power.The Book of Mormon,along with modern prophets is the underpinning of this great movement.I would like to add a suggestion to any person reading this that actually is really seeking truth,as opposed to confirming their current prejudices.Google \\"foundation for ancient research and Mormon studies\\"It is a BYU thing.Scroll down to the right and click on \\"censoring the Joseph Smith story\\".Dr.Hugh Nibley really lays it out.Read it if you dare.This site also is chuck full of BOOK OF MORMON stuff,including the fad of the month,DNA studies."},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"This book has changed my life.

It became like Gone With the Wind for me. I never tired of its message. I told no one, for years. I believed in the Bible, so how could I believe in this modern day sequel. I personally hate movie sequels. I DID BELIEVE, HOWEVER. The Book of Mormon enchanted and warmed me with things to come for our future and exlained the not to distant past, not thousands of years ago, but close to when my Grandparents and Great-Grandparents were around. It was a doctrine of relief for a child of nineteen in 1982. Why did all the \\"Miracles of God,\\" and extreme lives and unconditional love and tender caring, have to haved happened so many thousands of years ago? Why could there not be a display of affection from God now? So many people suffering. World War II, the Jewish Holocaust, typhoons in Bangladesh, the clock tower sniper, (too much glory in mentioning names) in the 60's on the campus of University of Texas. Why not now or not too long ago. Is it so far-fetched? Read the Book of Mormon, from a complete, bible-belt raised, looking for nothing advocate. Form your own opinion, if you dare to let go of some acient doctrines just long enough to see the future. It certainly is not 100% convincing, neither is the Bible, or the Koran, however, it is heartwarming food for thought. Open your heart/mind...The Book of Mormon, as well as my first love the Bible teaches us not be afraid of the unknown, we owe it to ourselves, and to God to search out, study and sometimes embrace the unkown. Do not accept what others expect you to accept. Be brave. I truly do not feel God intended things to be accepted because someone \\"taught\\" you that this was right. I like to think He expected us to learn His word on our own. That word does not necessarily mean the \\"Bible\\" only. On an life importance scale of 1-10 I would score a 10. The knowledge about where we are going after our lives are completed, not to mention what we should do with our beautiful, short lives while we are here, does not get any more important. What you do with the knowledge is your own personal path. There is no right or wrong. Only what we believe, if those beliefs lead us to more fulfilling lives, nurturing one another on this planet,not intentionally causing harm to anything or anyone, and living our lives to their fullest potentials.Who can say, honestly that they lived in vain.

It is a testament to the truth promised to be revealed along with the truths in the Holy Bible. It is the book of Joseph spoken of in Ezekial to go hand in hand with the book of Judah (the Holy Bible).

Whether as literature or as Holy Writ, the Book of Mormon is an absolute inspiration to anyone who approaches it with an open mind.

For those who are closed off, it will provide little inspiration, though it will prove marvelous literature. The same may be said of the Bible. If you were to read the Bible with an adamently and dogmatically atheist approach, you derive little inspiration from it as well.Truth may be found in many places, and it is truth above all that should be important.

The Book of Mormon is filled with half-truths, distortions, and outright lies. The author, Moroni, is hardly unbiased. He was a Nephite whose father was killed by Lamanites. That's like reading a book about the Allied Forces written by Hitler's son. Moroni obviously has an agenda. He hates the Lamanites for killing his father and all his Nephite friends. I can't say I blame him for that, but it damages his credibility as an historian because he has a personal vendetta and an axe to grind against the Lamanite nation. Moroni further damages his credibility by handing off the translation duties to Joseph Smith, a known con-artist, and frontier philanderer. Joseph Smith had absolutely no experience or training in translating ancient documents. He was an uneducated hillbilly. Before translating for Moroni, Joseph Smith's resume consisted of \\"farm-hand\\", and \\"glass-looker\\", hardly the type of experience that would inspire confidence in the Book of Mormon translation. Why did Moroni choose Joseph Smith, a guy who spent more time chasing skirts than reading books? Maybe because no serious scholar took Moroni's one-sided view of history seriously. Maybe Moroni's buddy, Joseph Smith, was the only person who would make himself a willing co-conspirator in creating this abominable and defamatory dime store novel. The bottom line is this: The Book of Mormon was created by a vengeful Nephite in an attempt to smear the Lamanite nation. With the help of an adulterous \\"glass-looker\\", he created a rabidly anti-Lamanite book, filled with slanderous lies, white-is-right race baiting, and distortions of half truths. All I have to say is look at the scoreboard. The Nephite's lost the war, end of story. Moroni is a sad, pathetic little man trying to make sorry excuses for the loser Nephites.

Mormonism teaches man (not woman) can in fact become a god and rule over their own earth. It also teaches Jesus is the same as you and I except he was the 1st born. It teaches Satan is the spirit brother of Jesus (not biblical). Mormonism is a works based religion vs. salvation by faith (Eph 2:8-9). At the end of the bible (Gen 22:18), it tells us not to add to or take away from this book ... which is exactly what Mormonism does. Mormonism is filled with deception, racism, polygamy, and false prophesies. There are no historical documents to support the Book of Mormon. According to the founder, Joseph Smith, ALL other faiths are an abomination. Study up. He was a con man and swindler. After his \\"vision\\" that \\"told him not to join any other church but to start his own\\", he tried to join another church.

If you have been taught the lie that the Bible was somehow \\"corrupted\\" and is \\"untrustworthy\\", then you owe it to your eternal salvation to seriously challenge these false claims. Make it an easy project initially. Start with just the following handful of verses from the Word of God. Seek the truth. If you honestly believe that these verses have somehow been \\"corrupted\\" or are \\"untrustworthy\\", then conduct some honest and unbiased research in search of the truth and try to prove that they are false. You will discover that the Word of God is worthy of your complete trust.Hebrews 4:12 For the word of God is living and active, sharper than any double-edged sword, piercing until it divides soul and spirit, joints and marrow, as it judges the thoughts and purposes of the heart.Note: Satan always attacks the Word of God and tries to portray it as in error or otherwise corrupted and in need of additional \\"revelation\\" which then contradicts the Bible.Matthew 24:11 ...and many false prophets will appear and deceive many people.Note: Christians are not being warned that false prophets may appear and may deceive many people, but that they will appear and will deceive many people. There have been many false prophets that preach lies that contradict the Word of God.Galatians 1:8-9 But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach a gospel other than the one we preached to you, let him be eternally condemned! As we have already said, so now I say again: If anybody is preaching to you a gospel other than what you accepted, let him be eternally condemned!Note: Seriously consider the very strong warning in these verses, which was repeated for emphasis.Muhammad claimed to be a prophet of God. Muhammad claimed that the angel Gabriel appeared to him and provided new revelations contained within the Qur'an, which contradict the Word of God.Joseph Smith also claimed to be a prophet of God. Smith claimed that the angel Moroni appeared to him and provided new revelations now contained within the BOM, which also contradict the Word of God.There have been many false prophets and there is no reason to believe that they will not continue to appear and to deceive many people.II Corinthians 11:14-15 And no wonder, for Satan himself masquerades as an angel of light. It is not surprising, then, if his servants masquerade as servants of righteousness. Their end will be what their actions deserve.Note: Is it any surprise that Satan masquerades as an angel of light in order to deceive people? He is the father of all lies.Ephesians 28-9 For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith--and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God-- not by works, so that no one can boast.Galatians 2:21 I do not set aside the grace of God, for if righteousness could be gained through the law, Christ died for nothing!John 14:6 Jesus said to him, \\"I am the way, the truth, and the life.

I won't spoil the end of the story by telling you how it ends.Although the Book of Mormon follows a story line throughout (similar to The Bible), much of it is doctrinal in nature. Different prophet's, leader's, and teacher's sermons and teachings are recorded. The reading in the Book of Mormon is very much like The Bible. The language is similar, the doctrinal concepts are similar, and it is made up of chapters and verses like The Bible. I appreciate the Book of Mormon because it teaches Christianity in a powerful and clear way. Different passages won't leave you with two different interpretations of the same concept. I have not yet found it to disagree with the teachings in The Bible, in fact, it seems to support and reinforce The Bible.If you want to learn the details of the Mormon(LDS) church, this is not your book.

It is conceivable that some inventive person could have written a book that reads something like the Bible, with familiar theology taught and lived in a different historical setting. On the other hand, what if the Book of Mormon is what it claims to be, a historical record of Jesus Christ's ministry to the Americas following his resurrection? The implications would be significant. It really couldn't be a mistake of some kind. The Book of Mormon is either deliberate fiction or truth. How to decide?One could reject it out of hand as implausible. From a \\"modern\\" point of view it does seem implausible, as does much of religion from this perspective. But is someone who honestly wants to know the truth really comfortable with the circular reasoning of rejecting something because it doesn't match preconceptions? A popular guide to writing book reviews begins a key chapter with: \\"First, read the book.\\" This is good advice.What then? Should one weigh historical evidence to determine the Book or Mormon's worth? This is an honest approach and can be followed with discipline and objectivity. But before relying on it completely, consider the inconclusiveness of historical criticism of the Bible. Our knowledge of all history is underdetermined by the incomplete evidence available. There is insufficient information about the Bible--and the Book of Mormon--to determine their worth this way. Would a just God expect us to decide what to believe on this basis? Isn't there too much chance of an honest mistake and lost opportunity?So--how? Consider a passage fromThe Holy Bible: King James Version: \\"If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.\\" (James 1:5) For something important, it is reasonable to expect God to answer if we make our best effort to ask. The Book of Mormon closes with a similar passage: \\"And when ye shall receive these things, I would exhort you that ye would ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these things are not true; and if ye shall ask with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ, he will manifest the truth of it unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost.\\" (Moroni 10:4) Here is straightforward guidance, consistent with the New Testament.But what about our modern perspective? Wouldn't we feel self-conscious about asking? Isn't it silly to think there is actually a God who would answer in some way we could recognize? Consider one more thing. There is a story in 2 Kings 5 about a Syrian king named Naaman who had leprosy. He was told by Elisha to wash seven times in the river Jordan and he would be healed. This seemed to him--quite understandably--to be a silly thing to do. So he didn't do it and grumbled about how silly it was. Fortunately for him, someone pointed out that he ought to try it because the effort was small and the potential benefit was great. According to the story, he was healed.Whether or not you believe Naaman's story, its implication is useful. If you want to know if the Book of Mormon has value, first read it. Then go to the small effort of asking God to tell you whether or not to believe it. The potential value of an answer is worth the small effort or any self-consciousness. Ask by yourself, away from well-meaning social pressure from family, friends, missionaries, or anyone. Ask: What is the value of this book?[Reviewer's Note: The Book of Mormon is available for free download from www.lds.org.]"},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"As a convert to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints I read this book before my conversion. The message it contains is so powerful and reassuring. Read it, ponder it and pray."},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"This is the translation of a journal that was kept by a tribe of Native Americans that contains documentation that Jesus appeared to them after His resurrection and taught them the gospel. This would explain why there are so many similarities between the ceremonies seen in the Native American Sweat Lodge and the Jewish Temple rituals. This may also be the reason why, in the 1700's, Captain Cook was greeted by the American Natives as \\"Quetzequatal\\", the \\"Great White God\\"; because Jesus told their ancestors that He would return again, coming from heaven in clouds of glory, and the primitive tribespeople may have mistaken Captain Cook's ship sailing in from the horizon as being the return of the legendary \\"Great White God\\"."},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"When you have read the stories of Christ, the preaching of his existence by Paul, John and others who knew him, you get a very special feeling in your heart--if you are worthy of it. There's a lot of wickedness in the world, there always has been. That is because there is a God in Heaven, His son is Jesus Christ, and there is an adversary. When you deny the existence of these things, you have either not had the time to observe, study and pray, and thus you are innocent by ignorance, or you have gone down the path of the adversary, who does NOT want you to believe he exists. As you read the words of these reviews, a stark difference in the feelings of your heart is apparent. You can tell who has had the Spirit of Christ in their life and who has not, by the tone of there messages, and the peace that you do or do not feel in your heart as you read them.The same is true of the marvelous Bible and the Book of Mormon. You will feel in your heart a peace when your read the New Testament and 3rd Nephi chapters of the teachings of Christ. It is EASY to know whether the Latter-day Saints, who believe in the Bible and the Book of Mormon, are good people--follow the admonition of Christ: \\"By their fruits ye shall know them.\\"That means, call your local Latter-day Saint organization. Meet them, listen, see what you feel in your heart. The Book of Mormon has helped me know that the Bible is true, and vice-versa. It also has helped me beyond words, in raising six children as a single Mom. I couldn't have done it without the guidance of the teachings in this book. I have peace and confidence in KNOWING what to say when my children ask me the difficult questions in life. Five of my children will be college graduates, I have a pilot, a NICU Nurse, a loan officer, an advertising executive/artist, a musician. My youngest child isn't in college yet. One of my sons is a U.S. Marine who served in Iraq in 2003. He loves his country, he loves the Book of Mormon. All my children are virtuous, clean, intelligent, kind, responsible employees, good athletes. If you need help raising your family, buy the Book of Mormon, read it with the Bible prayerfully and contact the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I'm so thankful I did."},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"This book contains a true account of the ancestors of the Native American Indians who came from Jerusalem about 600 BC. On page #438, verse 21, those early Native Americans are identified as being the \\"other sheep\\" the Lord talked about in the Bible in John 10:16. A favorite recording in this book is found on page #441. It tells about Jesus blessing the children when he appeared to these people (his \\"other sheep\\") after His resurrection. On page #529 (Moroni 10:4), there is a special promise given to all who read this sacred book.This book is a second witness to the Bible that testifies of the divine mission of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. We know that He lives and that he atoned for our sins and was resurrected so that we could repent and have eternal life. We hope this authentic, ancient record will bring as much inspiration, insight and joy to your family as it has to ours.Thanks to Doubleday for seeing the value in this publication."},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"I was not a member of any church.

(Just inquiring minds will not get it.......)"},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"Simply, the Book of books. It is true, and testifies unequivocally that Jesus is the Christ."},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"This is a beautiful book. And it's everything it professes to be. I've studied this book, weighed it in my mind, questioned, searched, and prayed, and nobody can make me deny the powerful, personal witness I receive each time I read it.While a lot of critics hoot and holler about all sorts of things they don't like about the Book of Mormon, no one can deny that the purpose of this book is to bring people closer to Jesus Christ. And that's exactly what it does, but ONLY if you aren't approaching it from a skeptical point of view. How can you expect the Spirit to testify truth to you if your heart is closed off? Read this book sincerely looking for the beautiful, inspirational truth it contains, and God will help you see it.Second, if you have questions about anything in the Book of Mormon, which you will, go the LDS church for an answer. It doesn't make sense to look anywhere else. If you're in the mountains looking for pure water to drink, do you drink downstream from the spring, or do you go to the source? The purest water comes from the source. If you have questions about, say, Catholicism, would you look to anti-Catholic material for answers? Of course not. You'd go to the source. Same thing goes here. If something in the Book of Mormon doesn't make sense, don't expect to find any real answers in anti-Mormon materials. Their goal is obviously not to build faith. The LDS church can answer any question you have, better than anyone else can. After all, is there anyone who knows about their doctrine and scriptures better than they do? Don't drink from downstream. Go to the source.Ultimately, God is the one who really knows whether or not this book is true. Why not ask HIM? I'm sure that God, more than anybody, is anxious to help us all know the truth."},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"The greatest Book I have ever read. Written by the ancient prophets from the House of Israel on the American Continents. Translated by the American Prophet Joseph Smith. The world is crying out for such a message, and yet the principles and doctrines, prophecies and warnings are largely going unrecognized by those whom it was written for.It contains a message of hope for all, an invitation to repent, and come unto Christ.

The book is a complialtion of the writings of several prophets who lived over a period of about a thousand years on the American continent.

I would recommend the book to anyone."},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"I was disappointed, to say the least, to come here and find this book has a cumulative 3 star rating; HOWEVER, the fact that it is comprised solely of 1 STAR RATINGS and 5 STAR RATINGS tells you in itself that they're something here. The opinions concerning this book are so stratified that it would be ridiculous to take ANYONE'S word for it. The only solution as I see it, is to read the book for yourself.To anyone truly desirous to learn and discover the truth behind the skepticism, this has to tell you something. Take the time to read the book, and you will have every opportunity to discover itself falsehood, or truthfullness, for yourself.I have read the Book of Mormon many times and found it to be much more than just another book. I have carefully considered its pages and prayed over their content. And most importantly, I have received a witness from God, just as the book says you can, that it is true. It has strengthened my faith in ways I could not have imagined. Along with the Holy Bible, it has helped me gain an understanding of the nature of God, and the doctrine of Christ.Again, don't take my word for it, but if you are interested in a sincere understanding of the Latter-day Saint faith, I can think of nothing more beneficial than a thorough study of the book upon which it is founded."},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"I have read the Book of Mormon well over two-dozen times, cover to cover; and innumerable times in part.It deserves five stars because of the following reasons:First, because it forms the central scripture of a major religion, whose members view it as literal truth and a literal historical account as written thousands of years ago on the American continent.Second, because other than the Bible, the Book of Mormon has been translated into more languages than any other book of scripture.Third, because the book is COMPLEX! Really, far more so than anything the Bible relates chronologically. Some readers get lost trying to keep all those migrating people and political diversities straight; then they accuse the Book of Mormon of not being clear and consistent. But the problem lies with those who only \\"skim\\" the book and think that they are now expert enough to judge its merits. This is a big mistake. The book cannot be fathomed in one careful reading, much less a skim of its contents. I only began to clearly understand the chronology of its interrelated stories after at least three complete readings: and then only when I mapped out the timing for myself. The chances of Joseph Smith being able to put that whole thing together seem awfully remote, imho (despite what B. H. Roberts, et al, said or may have said to the contrary). It is a far more complex plot and prodigy of timing than The Lord of the Rings, and has far fewer mistakes in it than that worthy classic (and most of the very few \\"mistakes\\" the Book of Mormon contains can be blamed on Joseph Smith's later editing - without authority to do so, imho - and misunderstandings on our part).Fourth, because it is not badly written. It is very competently written, though I agree that the style (as it comes across in English) is very staid and utilitarian. The final author of the book's contents worried about this quality in fact: that the \\"Gentiles\\" would mock at his and his ancestors' poor writing powers. But God assured him that their words were sufficient, and that those who mocked them were fools who would mourn. As a work of literature it is similar in *boring* style with the Bible, so it shouldn't be compared with great works of the literary art. (And why should it be well written anyway? The authors were warrior/priests not artists, so far as we can tell at any rate.) Actually the stories are fascinating in and of themselves, equal to anything people find interesting in biblical stories, and in some cases superior. Characters are more *alive* in the Book of Mormon, generally, than characters from the Bible; the Book of Mormon possesses the only known scriptural character portrait (that of general/captain Moroni), and the dialogue is much more involved and revealing of characters' personalities than anything in the Bible (with the possible exception of Elijah and his duel with the priests of Baal).Fifth, because the controversy surrounding its truthfulness continues, mounting in intensity rather than abating, as the years go by. Some think the book already disproven; others at least allow that it isn't proven; others still accept it as literal history; and finally there are those (as with yours truly) who believe that Joseph Smith wrote it under inspiration outside of himself, and may have even really had at one time the famed \\"golden plates\\" from which its pages are supposed to have been translated. So because the Book of Mormon remains the center of a great deal of argument, it deserves a star for being unique that way too."},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"The title says it all; this is another testament of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.

They looked forward to the time when Jesus Christ would be born and live on earth. They lived through times of peace and times of war, times of belief and righteousness and times of rebelliousness and turned away from God. Sounds a lot like our world today doesn't it?

Not knowing what chloroform was, I looked the word up on Wikipedia and found the following description of its use as an anesthetic:\\"Chloroform was once a popular anesthetic; its vapor depresses the central nervous system of a patient, allowing a doctor to perform various otherwise painful procedures\\"Mark Twain got it bang on, if one considers that extracting 10% of your lifetime income, 2 prime years of your life, half of all your weekends, temple oaths of obedience and deference to church leadership, and any skeptical inquiry aimed in the church's direction as an \`otherwise painful procedure' requiring \`depression of the central nervous system'.So what is the secret of this book's success? The book consists of pretty standard religious mythology. We see larger than life heroes, over the top villains (who always get their just desserts), fantastical divine interventions aplenty, and a heavy constant theme of prosperity theology. Much of the doctrinal content is either borrowed from the King James Bible (translational mistakes and all), or else it clarifies doctrinal controversies of the day (such as infant baptism) in Joseph Smith's favor. It is no better and not much worse than the Bible or Koran in these regards. Like those books, it probably owes its success to the conformational biases of its believers, which has more to do with what the book symbolizes than what the book contains.The book (as fictional books often do) does have its share of inspiring quotes and stories. To mention a couple, I always liked Nephi's example of a positive attitude in the wilderness (1 Nephi 16). King Benjamin's address contains some wonderful gems of wisdom of the \`Sermon on the Mount' variety (Mosiah 4).The book also has it share of decidedly disturbing teachings. To mention a couple, I don't see how the attribution of the dark Native American complexion to the sins of their ancestors (2 Nephi 5) can be construed as anything but racist. At one point in the book, a diabolical atheist (*gasp*) is cursed with permanent loss of speech by our prophet hero for daring to challenge the religious orthodoxy of the day (Alma 30). The Mormon God (of course) happily obliges.For its (sometimes) inspirational content, the author's obvious talents as a story weaver, and its effectiveness as \`chloroform in print' I give the book three stars. For its (often) troubling ethics and its daft assertion (Alma 32, Moroni 10) that any warm fuzzy feelings the reader experiences while reading or contemplating the book is proof of its historical and metaphysical truth (contrary archeology, linguistic, and genetic evidences notwithstanding), I give it no more."},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"I consider myself a lifelong student of the teachings of Jesus Christ the Holy Prophets and like most good Christians I try my best to put into effect the principals that Jesus taught. As I've studied the Bible trying my best to learn what was taught by the prophets and Jesus Christ himself, I've come across many areas that seem to be vague or missing and are left unanswered.

This globalization and interconnectedness is very likely to continue into the foreseeable future.In such an increasingly connected world, it is very interesting to consider the Book of Mormon, which in 1830 described an extensive society in which Jesus Christ made visits not only to Jerusalem in the Old World, but also to a city called Bountiful in the New World, as well as to other parts of the world.The Book of Mormon describes a series of ancient families (Lehi, Nephi, and their descendants) trying to preserve their social structures (familial and communal) and their religious beliefs despite tremendous opposition, even armed reprisals and governmental persecution.Oddly enough, those who criticize the Book of Mormon fail to consider that the persecution described in the Book of Mormon was, in a prophetic sense, also the shared fate of the Mormon people as a whole: after the book's publication, they were driven by mob violence from New York to Pennsylvania to Ohio to Missouri to Illinois, and finally to Utah.Most of this mob violence was whipped up by narrow-minded bigots who nevertheless claimed to be Christians. Most of the negative reviews of the Book of Mormon I've seen are likewise narrow-minded and infused with a brand of \\"Christian\\" zeal that most true Christians would be embarrassed by.It seems impossible to me that a charlatan, however charismatic and charming, could have written the Book of Mormon. Why? Because the book was published in 1830 and describes many instances of religious persecution, yet the Mormons themselves did not suffer most of their own persecution until after the book was published. What accounts for this prescient view of the fate Mormons would suffer? It seems there had to be more than a little divine inspiration involved in such a book.Although the book contains many new names, there is a pronouncing guide at the back that provides clear assistance. Lehi, for example, rhymes with Levi (you know, like Levi jeans, or Levi the priest). Similarly, Nephi rhymes with Lehi. Most of the names, when studied carefully, exhibit a remarkable linguistic similarity. For example, the terminal \\"i\\" at the end of a name is always a long \\"i,\\" as in Abinadi, Lehi, Nephi, Moroni. Learning the pronunciation helps in understanding the text.In the end, it is fascinating to think about the implications of a religious text that talks about a society that knew about Jesus Christ, by name, centuries before he appeared in Jerusalem, and who also enjoyed a direct visitation from him, and which delivers the basic message that any believer, at any time, in any place, might be the recipient of a similar event."},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"I have read this book many times and each time am reminded of the amazing stories contained inside.

It claims to be the word of God, on par with the Bible. That is a big claim that sets it up for a hard fall. Most people in Christian countries no longer believe that the Bible is the word of God, so belief in another book, translated from an ancient record, as the word of God alongside the Bible, is a very, very tall order.What proof is there of this enormous claim? Not much. The more you dive into the origin and historical context of the Book of Mormon the more confusing it becomes. There is not \\"irrefutable\\" evidence one way or the other. You can either believe or not, and find plenty of evidence to back your position up. The book itself invites the reader to pray about its authenticity. So by its very claim and its proposed method of investigating that claim, the book sets itself apart as not for the casual or curious investigation. To approach the book sincerely, one has to confront its claim, and to investigate the claim, one has to believe that God can and does steer people toward truth.I have read, studied, and yes--prayed about the Book of Mormon. I sincerely believe that God is light and good and that he helps me recognize the things in my life that are light and good. I firmly believe, even know, that the Book of Mormon is the word of god. I believe it so strongly that I've patterned my life after it. I still lead a fairly \\"normal\\" life--I'm a software executive who likes to enter triathlons and ski in my spare time--but the light and knowledge I've gained through the Book of Mormon has made all the difference for me. I'm truly happy, and that's something I want everyone to experience.If you buy the book, read it. If you read it, pray about it. I wish you the very best. You will be so happy to have discovered this book!-db"},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"It's startling that the Mormons have decided to try to a sell a religious rag that they have had a hard time giving away for the last 100 years. Tithing revenues must be down and the edges of the kingdom must be starting to unravel or this uninspired marketing ploy may never have arisen in the heads of the good old boys leading the Salt Lake City religious corporate empire.The fact is there is not a single shred of scientific, metallurgical, archeological, linguistical, or genetic evidence to support the outlandish and racist claims of the Book of Mormon. After 175 years, not a trinket, not a sword, not an inscription, not a wheel, not a single artifact of any kind has been unearthed to coroborate the asserted legitmacy of the Book of Mormon. None!While the book has its proponents in the form of professional Mormon liars employed at Brigham Young University, there isn't a legitimate scholar in the country that supports its authenticity.No peer reviewed work in any accepted journal of history or science endorses it. Can all these non-Mormon, non-BYU employed scholars be wrong?Positive reviewers bear testimony that the book has changed the lives of millions of people across the planet. There is no more dubious accounting engaged in than when Mormons try to count their numbers or hide their money.Without question the book has had an impact on the history of the United States, particularly the west. 120 innocent members of a 1957 wagon train were slaughtered by Mormons at a place called Mountain Meadows, hundreds of Mormons died tragically when their religious arrogance became intolerable to their gentile neighbors in Missouri and Illinois. Even more died when Church leaders promised them they could use handcarts to travel west to Salt Lake City despite building them out of shoddy materials and leaving too late in the season to make the journey safely. The Mormons introduced America to modern polygamy, a blight that has continued to plague the country nonstop since Joseph Smith first decided it would be a good idea to have sex with young girls.Can the Book of Mormon be believed? Sure. If you have a lot of faith and a lot more gullibility. I know, I bought the whole shebang for more than forty years and the Church was able to extort more than $50,000 out of my pocket by using my faith as a weapon against me.Don't bother buying this book. You don't need to. It will only be a matter of time before some guilt ridden Mormon offers you one for free."},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"It's sad when a majority of those writing a review of this book do so under the guise of subjectivity. They pretend to have read the book as it was 'intended' to been read - when in reality all they have ever done is (mostly likely at best) skimmed thru it; or they rely on others who claim to have read it. I am not a Mormon, but I've read the book. Could it be true? Possibly. At the very minimum, it is no less difficult to prove or disprove than the bible. The only hard evidence of the bible is that some of the cities actually exsisted, that some of the people were real, other than that - What proof is there that Christ actually lived? Just because the Bible 'says it's so' doesn't make true. Faith - that old tricky word, I have Faith that the Bible is true - I don't need anyone to dig up a rock with the name Jesus Christ scrawled across it to 'prove' to me that he lived. I have faith that he lives - based on many many reasons. Now - - whether or not the Book of Mormon is true...... That I am working on. Regardless, the words of the book ring true, they do not contradict the Bible, the do not confuse the situation (at least for me) at all. After all, when Christ lived, walked the Earth ( and I have faith that he did) there was more to this world than just the Lands of the New Testament - there was a whole world out there.... the Apostles were told to go to all points of the earth and teach the Gospel of Jesus Christ...... why couldn't it have happened? No one today can conclusively say that it didn'thappen - a simple lack of evidence does not mean that it didn't happen, nor that it couldn't have happened. It just means in due time we'll know. So, for me - I'm not looking for signs in the heavens, I'll let the Holy Spirit whisper to me, I will let the Lord lead me home - at least I hope so. Until then, I would love for Amazon to switch out their soap box platform for something a little closer to the ground. I would hate to see anyone fall as the pontificate about the evils of a book that they know so little about.Merry ChristmasGG"},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"I've read the Book of Mormon many times, and continue to study it daily for inspiration.

I spent two years pushing this \\"book\\" door to door and in city plazas. We charged 50 cents and had to beg people to buy it. I have since come to realize that the BoM is a lie. I see no reason for anyone to buy it, except to fill a hole in your personal library. Why help finance a cult that already extracts 10% from its members for the promise of eternal life?Since so many mormons are bearing their testimonies about the BoM and their cult, I would like to bear my testimony, as well:Through the crucible of study, I know that Joseph Smith was not a prophet of God. [...]I know with every fiber of my being that the Book of Abraham papyri contained a common Egyptian funerary text. [...]I know that the Mormon Church has taught for the greater part of its history that the Native Americans descended from Jews, that the DNA evidence conclusively proves otherwise, and that FARMS is in the process of the largest backpedal the Church has ever seen.I know that the Church has taught that the highest realm of the highest degree of postmortal glory can only by attained by those engaged in polygamy, that Joseph Smith and Brigham Young each had over 30 wives and that Joseph Smith sired children outside of even the historically-recorded marriages. I also know that the Mormon Church is still responsible for letting its polygamous offshoots go unpunished in Utah and Arizona.I know that the Church taught that the Negro was inferior from the pre-earth life and that most Mormons still think that blacks are inferior.I know that the Church taught that some crimes and sins fell outside the realm of Christ's atonement and could only be atoned for by the shedding of blood. I also know that the Church carried out blood atonement regularly.I know that that First Presidency, the Quorum of the Twelve, and the upper levels of the Seventies all draw salaries from the Church and that the higher salaries are all quite substantial.I know that the temple [...] without connection to ancient Hebrew temple rites and that it mimics and borrows from 19th-century Masonic rites.I know that the Church's tithes are huge and that it profligately is in the process of wasting money consolidating its ownership of central Salt Lake City, Utah.

I have found that the Book of Mormon supports and enlightens my understanding of both Old and New Testaments. The Book of Mormon's doctrinal expositions on the Fall, the Atonement, the plan of salvation, the resurrection, the judgement, etc. are clearer and more profound--they provide added understanding to that gained from the Bible.The Book of Mormon makes clear the personal path to God.

Could a twenty something man with a 3rd grade education guess right about so many civilizations? Impossible. This has to be a true translation from someone living in the period. The dates, arrivals of peoples, rises and falterings of groups, etc. all sync up with the Book of Mormon with amazing precision (amazing that current anthropologists came so close to the true dates and times).This is a history written by prophets who clearly had a religious perspective. A secular historian living at the same time would clearly have a different perspective but as you'll see when you read it, the purpose of the book was to help others gain a personal relationship with God. This relationship is far more valuable than the history used to convey that faith.After reading the book dozens of times and continuing to do so, I believe more in its authenticity now than at any other time in my life.

Even though it was mostly boring, it had some cool violent parts where people get heads chopped off, arms chopped off, and there were some good lessons. Just ignore the boring Jesus stuff and focus on the killing and other fun parts and you might kinda like it. Here are some of the important lessons I found in this book:If you own brass plates, don't show them off. Keep it low key, especially around the local street preacher guy. If the local street preacher asks you about your brass plates, just lie. Say, \\"Brass Plates? What brass plates? I don't own brass plates.\\"If someone orders you to hand over your brass plates, especially the sons of the street preacher guy, and you don't want to give them to them, just say no. You own them. If they insist you give them your brass plates, call the cops.If after calling the cops, the perpetrators get away, hire bodyguards to watch over you and your plates. Don't get drunk until they are captured.If you are responsible for guarding your boss's brass plates, and someone shows up claiming to be your boss, wearing your boss's clothes, and asks you to give him the brass plates, check his ID first.If you are responsible for guarding your boss's brass plates, and someone shows up covered in blood, wearing your boss's clothes, claiming to be your boss, but he doesn't look anything like your boss, and he asks you to hand over the brass plates you should say, \\"Sure boss, I'll be right back.\\" Then pretend to go into the back room to get the plates, but instead call the cops.If you are investigating the murder/robbery of a guy who was killed for his brass plates, the first suspects you should interview should be the sons of the street preacher who were last seen ordering the victim to give them his brass plates.If you are investigating the murder/robbery of a guy who was killed for his brass plates, and the prime suspects are the sons of the street preacher, don't waste time looking for them in town. Most likely they packed up everything and headed for the sea.If you are writing on gold plates, keep in mind it is really hard and Gold plates are rare. Therefore, to get the most bang for the buck from the limited gold plates you should use a secret language called \`Reformed Egyptian' which is more compact than plain english, and avoid repetitive phrases like \`And it came to pass' unless those phrases are absolutely necessary to get the point across.If you wake up one morning and realize someone turned you into an Indian, it means you are one of the bad guys. You must now kill the white guys.If you want to fix the problem of looking like an Indian, find someone who didn't get turned into an Indian, who is still white and start going to church with him. Meet with the missionaries of his church, take the discussions, and get baptized. If you follow the teachings of the white guy's church, you will turn white again.It is bad to have multiple wives. (This seems like common sense, however this rule is changed in the Book of Mormon sequel called The Doctrine and Covenants.)If you are an atheist who asks the local prophet guy to back up his claims with evidence, and the prophet curses you to be deaf and dumb, going from door to door begging for food, and you see a group of people marching down the street, do not walk out into the middle of them, unless you want to get trampled to death.If Jesus comes to visit you, keep in mind that one of the things you can wish for is immortality. So don't waste your wish on anything less than immortality. You might be able to wish for more wishes, but I wouldn't test Jesus' patience. Stick with the immortality wish. We know that one works.If someone is lying unconscious for 2 days and 2 nights and you aren't sure if he is dead or not, try smelling him. If he \\"stinketh not\\", he might still be alive.One way to impress a guy is to chop off the arms of his enemies and bring the arms to him.If you need to escape from a town because everyone's language got mixed up, the best way to escape is by the sea, with a barge.If you need to build a barge to travel across the sea after escaping from a town where the languages got mixed up, the best way to build it is to put a hole on the top and a hole on the bottom. That way you can get air by opening the top hole and if it tips over, you can still get air by opening the bottom hole which is now on top. If you accidentally open the wrong hole and notice water rushing in, just stop up the hole real quick and open the other hole.If you are building a barge to travel across the sea do not put windows in your barge. It is unrealistic to expect the windows to survive the crashing waves of the sea. If you want light, use magic, glow rocks instead.If you are building a barge to travel across the ocean, be sure to bring lots and lots of food and fresh water because the trip will take 344 days. If you need to go to the bathroom, do it over the side of the barge because the holding tank isn't very big.If you find yourself on the battlefield fighting your arch nemesis and he chops your head off, don't waste your time and energy lifting yourself up and gasping for air. Give it up. You're dead.If you want to write scriptures, use \\"verily, verily\\" a lot and instead of saying someone worked hard, say they \\"waxed strong.\\" Also, adding \\"eth\\" to the end of words helps, such as \\"he runneth very fast.\\""},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"Most of the reviews written for this book either claim that it is a work of God or that it is a complete fabrication. Setting the emotional religious aspects aside, The Book of Mormon can be appreciated as a piece of truly American Religious text. It did not originate in Europe, the Middle East, India, or China. Millions have believed it to be the word of God and it has become the foundation for one of the fastest growing religions in the world. This book started a uniquely American religion that has grown world wide. Thousands of people left the settled parts of 19th century America and traveled to the area now known as Utah and turned the desert around a briny lake into a thriving metropolis and state with a unique culture and view of the world.Very few other books through history have had such an impact other than the Holy Bible and the Koran. Whether the book is a sacred text or a fabrication really does not change the great impact the book has had on people, history, religion, and even other countries throughout the world. The book has been translated into nearly all the major world languages. It has been read by millions. To so easily discount the book as a great lie or fabrication is to minimize the impact that the book and the church on which it is based has had and continues to have on the United States and the rest of the world.If you truly want to understand the religion known as the LDS faith, you must have an understanding of the book that is the cornerstone of that faith. As one who has read it, I find the book to be a good read. The book is a positive experience with lessons and warnings about how choices and actions made today can effect future generations. The parallels to modern politics in the book are very surprising and even the student of Sun Tzu will find parallels in the battle tactics of the Book of Mormon.I highly recommend this book. As student of early American history and religion I have found it invaluable. It is also one of the few books with a good positive message that can be applied to those of all religions."},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"I have always considered this Book of scripture a truly wise recipe for living a great life; one full of words pointing toward peace and happiness.

We do not believe that thou knowest of things to come, neither do we believe that thy fathers and also that our fathers did know concerning the things which they spake, of that which is to come.\\"Alma 30: 14 \\"Behold, these things which ye call prophecies, which ye say are handed down by holy prophets, behold, they are foolish traditions of your fathers.\\"Alma 30: 23 \\"...And Korihor said unto him: Because I do not teach the foolish traditions of your fathers, and because I do not teach this people to bind themselves down under the foolish ordinances and performances which are laid down by ancient priests, to usurp power and authority over them, to keep them in ignorance, that they may not lift up their heads, but be brought down according to thy words.\\"As you can see...these foolish traditions were denounced in the BoM and yet preached in the church.\\"Don't think! Don't challenge! Don't find objective truth! Everyone who discredits the claims is just an anti-mormon.\\"We've read it. If you're susceptible to gullibility, you might want to do some objective research first.

And it came to pass that I, TANSTAAFL, having been born of Mormon parents, therefore I was taught somewhat in all the learning of my father; which included the Book of Mormon, and having seen many afflictions and cognitive dissonance in the course of my days because of the fact that I was raised in the Mormon religion and having read the Book of Mormon nigh unto twenty times, nevertheless, yea, having had a great knowledge of the goodness and the mischievousness of Loki, therefore I make a book review of the Book of Moron.2. Yea, I make a record of my review in the language of English, and not Reformed Egyptian - the language of the Book of Mormon, because everyone knoweth that no one speaks Reformed Egyptian anyway. Behold, I make an abridgment of the review upon computer which I have made with mine own hands; (the review, not the computer) wherefore, after I have abridged the review then will I make an account of mine own review and if thou findest this sentence difficult for your understandings to comprehend then thou wilt not enjoy reading the Book of Mormon, for I make the record of my review in the idiom of the book of Mormon author. Yea, verily, it came to pass that more confusing than Yoda-speak it is.3. And it came to pass that thus were written the first two paragraphs of my review. And I know that the review which I write true; and I make it with mine own computer; and I make it according to my knowledge. And thus passeth away even the third paragraph also.4. And it came to pass that my review having been limited to 1000 words by the amazon.com web-site, I realized that my choice of writing style, that being the style inflicted upon the reader by Joseph Smith Jr., Author and Proprietor of the Book of Mormon, was not a good choice for one limited to a small number of words, or for that matter an odd choice for the inhabitants of the ancient Americas who supposedly had to inscribe the lengthy and frequently rambling and meaningless prose on gold plates where space was at a premium.5. And it came to pass that this part of the review, yea even the middlest part, I shall shew unto you the parts of the review that review the book of which I revieweth. And it came to pass that I chose not to detail in this review the thousands of revisions which the Mormons made to the book after Joseph Smith wrote it, which was supposedly perfectly \\"translated\\" by a gift from god, or the many anachronisms which the author included, yea not even the horses that the ancient Americans supposedly had despite the fact that the horse arrived with Columbus nor the steel weapons. Nor even shall I comment upon 54 chapters dealing with wars that bear no resemblance to the actual wars that took place in the ancient Americas, yea and I especially shall not comment upon the accounts of wars with nonsensical accounts of million man armies fighting to the last man and their bones and steel weapons disappearing from the face of the earth. Yea, and it followeth that I also chose not to comment on the many plagiarisms and yea, even plagiarisms of mistranslations, which were included in the book. Yea, verily I chose not to comment on the writing or the story of the book, which Mark Twain called \\"chloroform in print,\\" especially since I find that remark highly disparaging to chloroform. For it came to pass in the commencement of my preparation for the writing of the review, I realized that a review of the book which pointed out its flaws would be so long, yea, so long as to be longer than the book itself. Yea, and thus passeth away even the middlest part of the review, the longest paragraph, even though it merely toucheth upon the thousands of give-aways as to the fraudulent nature of the book. For yea, this review cannot contain even a millionth part of what was so poorly written in the Book of Mormon.6. And it came to pass that I decided that my review of the book should mention, before concluding, a list of some of the main themes of the Book of Mormon, and yea I verily mention them thusly: (1) Killing is good, if thou art a teenager and thou hearest voices in thine head telling thee to kill someone, preferably someone drunk so they cannot fight back. 1 Nephi 4 (2) If thou disobeyest God, he will curse thee with a dark skin, 3 Nephi 5:21, Jacob 3:5, Alma 3:6, but (3) If thou art a personage of dark skin, God will make thee white and delightsome, if thou wilt consent to join his church. 3 Nephi 3:15 (4) After Jesus, yea even Christ Our Lord, was killed, he camest to the Americas and killed millions of Native Americans, 3 Nephi 8-9, and (5) Women art completely insignificant except occasionally as breeding stock, passim.7. And there are many things more which transpired in the Book of Mormon which, in the eyes of some, would be considered great and marvelous, but despite having read the book upwards of twenty times, I cannot remember even one.8. Thus, I make an end to my abridgement of my review, yea, and now I bid unto all, adieu. I soon go to rest in the paradise of mine abode, until my spirit and body shall again recover from the taxing effort of writing in such a nauseating style.

Those people benefitted from the time the Saviour spent with them. Their record of these events were recorded on golden plates and handed down through generations until through Heavenly Fathers direction they were handed to Jospeh Smith for translation to be delivered to the people of this dispensation. The Book of Mormon is the word of God. He loves his children and wants all of them to learn of his Gospel and return home to live with him.

It tells of their history, challenges, and miracles throughout a timespan of 1000 years until about 400AD. (Another section also tells of a group of people that came to the Americas at the time of the Tower of Babel talked about in the Bible.) It tells of prophets who received direction from God, wars of many people, and interesting, thought provoking stories.My favorite part of the book is in 3 Nephi when Christ comes to the Americas after his resurrection. He comforts the people after they had gone through so much war, natural disasters, contention, people going astray from the gospel teachings, etc. Jesus also takes time to spend with the little innocent children and blesses them.Jesus Christ is the most influencial person that has ever lived on the earth and this verse in 2 Nephi 25:26 of the Book of Mormon is my favorite. \\"And we talk of Christ, we rejoice in Christ, we preach of Christ, we prophesy of Christ, and we write according to our prophecies, that our children may know to what source they may look for a remission of their sins.\\"This is a wonderful book that has helped my family grow closer together.

My studies of the Book of Mormon and of the Bible compliment each other. My readings in each have prompted greater appreciation and understanding of the other. Each witnesses to me of a Living Christ, of a Redeeming Christ and of our need to love Him and our neighbors, in word and deed, as He has loved and loves all of His and Our Father's children.Neither the Book of Mormon nor the Bible purports to include every word that God has revealed to all the prophets and apostles He has chosen. Neither was meant to be treated as a scientific, philosophical or historical work. The personal meaning of each is enhanced by a growing faith in Christ. Neither work justifies any hateful attacks by anyone on anyone or on any belief system."},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"This is a wonderful book that provides a testament of the divinity of Christ. The messages contained therein are simple; they are ones of faith, hope and the promise of blessings that come through obedience to the teachings of Christ. During this Christmas season, I strongly encourage those who have not read the Book of Mormon, to do so. You will find additional witnesses to the birth of Christ and his ministry while here upon the earth.The gospel of Christ was not taught only among the ancient Jews. To that end, by reading this book, you will find that the gospel message is still available to all who are seeking answers.The reading of this book may or may not convert people to the LDS church, but it will provide its readers with an uplifting and rewarding experience. This book has taught me to be a better person. It has taught me the importance of love, charity and enduring faith through times of tribulation.Please don't allow negative reviews that attack the LDS Church turn you away from this book. It's been said that by their fruits you shall know them. I can't explain the reasons behind so many hateful attacks, but I can promise you that it isn't a principle that is taught in this book."},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"It's as good a time as any that The Book of Mormon is being published and offered on this grand of a scale.

Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"The more I read this book, the more \\"contrived\\" I came to believe it is. My mother read this book to me several times as a young boy and I continued reading it into adulthood. My feelings regarding it changed over time. I went from accepting its claim to doubt to ultimate rejection. The more I read it the more contrived I found it. It so conveniently answers the religious difficulties of the 19th century Joseph lived in.One example (there are many) is infant baptism:\\"Behold I say unto you, that he that supposeth that little children need baptism is in the gall of bitterness and in the bonds of iniquity; for he hath neither faith, hope, nor charity; wherefore, should he be cut off while in the thought, he must go down to hell.\\" Moroni 8:14.Die while *thinking* about infant baptism and you are going straight to hell? Wow. Melodramatic? Convenient? Does this sound like an ancient prophet speaking or a religious revivalist trying to put the catholics in their place in 1830? Doubt entered my life.DNA testing by geneticist at BYU reveal than native americans can trace their ancestry to 6 Chinese mothers. I've read the apologetic answers to the dna questions but rather than clear the issue up, they just seem more convoluted and dishonest than ever to me.I still have warm feelings towards the book because of the experience of reading it with my mother. Several of the stories in it will never be forgotten and some of the characters were my personal heroes growing up. However, I no longer regard it as a historical account and don't care to spend any more time on it. I find it very ironic that rather than the \\"most correct book on earth\\" and deserving of an honored place on my bookshelf, it is much more suited to the fiction section."},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"The Book of Mormon truly is the Word of God. I have read the Book of Mormon many times. The Book of Mormon teaches about God's dealing with mankind and of His teachings through his holy prophets. This is priceless information. The answers to the questions of who we are, why we are here, and where we are going are answered by the Book of Mormon. The Book of Mormon testifies of God's love for us, Jesus Christ's incredible sacrifice, and that God wishes to guide us back to His presence. For those who have not had the opportunity to read and ponder this incredible book, there is an invitation to all: to read, ponder, and ask God if this is truly His word. If you ask in faith, He will confirm in your heart and in your mind that this book is His, and that it's teachings can bring you closer to him.

Some reviewers accuse plagarism--which seems funny since, when quoting God in Israel, the things said in the bible must be repeated in the Book of Mormon, which takes place in the Americas. Why? Because God is the same always...Why would he tell people in one place one thing, and then tell the people in another place, something else again? And when exactly did he stop using prophets? Why? They seemed to have done a pretty good job in the Old and New Testaments. Since God doesnt usually make mistakes, why would he be different simply because he was commanding people in a different part of the world? All these things are answered by common sense, which I guess is lacking in those trying to discount another faith's gospel. I wonder how marvelous the world would be if they spent as much time perfecting their own faith in their lives as they do tearing down someone else's...to claim thousands of changes to a manuscript simply because it was edited into chapters and verses with grammatical paragraphing is misleading at least and dishonest at most. And yet, I dont feel anger over their actions as much as pity and sadness. They need our prayers, to get past their anger and hatred which makes them ridicule another's passion, being mean-spirited and vindictive, all in the guise of being 'real Christians'. May God bless all those who have the intelligence to seek out the truth themselves...notice we dont tell you to believe us---we ask you read and pray and decipher for yourself. How can your own prayers deceive you?"},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"As with Bob McCue (who gave a fine review), I am a life-long member of the branch of the church founded by Joseph Smith that followed Brigham Young to Salt Lake City. My forebearers remained in Utah and I was born and raised there. Like Bob, I also discovered (to my horror) in my early 40s that the leadership of the church (from the very beginning down to the present day) had been less than forthcoming about truths of all sorts. I was serving as a councilor in a bishopric (leadership of a congregation) at the time and had just concluded reading the entire Book of Mormon per the challenge of our Stake President (a leader of 5-10 congregations).I've read the Book of Mormon cover-to-cover many times and selections therein many more times than that. In my opinion, the Book of Mormon essentially adds *nothing* to the doctrinal content of the Bible - it merely gives an early 1800's Campbellite interpretation thereof. Some consider this evidence that Sidney Rigdon (a prominent Campbellite minister and an early Mormon convert and leader) was the source of the doctrinal content. The theories on the book's authorship can be quite fascinating to one who has an interest in that area.I further believe that it could disappear tomorrow without impacting the doctrine of the LDS church at all. In fact, its disappearance would eliminate a number of glaring inconsistencies with past and present doctrines and practices of the LDS church. Just one of these is the nature of the so-called \\"Plan of Salvation/Happiness.\\" The Book of Mormon is crystal-clear that there is no chance for repentance after death - quite at odds with the key LDS doctrines of post-death proselytizing, repentance and vicarious baptisms and sealings.All of that aside, the Book of Mormon could be exactly what its proponents claim and still be irrelevant to the cause of the LDS church. Why? Simply because there are other branches of the church founded by Joseph Smith who lay claim to being the lawful successor (both in God's eyes and according to the laws of man), branches which hold the LDS church in Salt Lake City as being apostate to one degree or another. The widowed first wife (out of at least 34) of Joseph Smith did not follow Brigham Young. Rather, she threw her lot in with others. If one is apt to pay any heed to the claims made for Joseph Smith, they should be prepared to explain why the equivalent claims of inspired translation and revelation claimed by and for James Strang are invalid.I gave it 2 stars for the same reasons that Bob did."},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"The Book of Mormon is a magnificent work on many levels. It offers deep insight into the human condition on both the personal and societal levels. The \\"King James\\" English took a little getting used to, but after a couple of chapters it was hardly noticeable. From an intellectual standpoint, I find it fascinating that such a work could be produced by a young uneducated farm boy; that he could have such insight into so many aspects of the rise & fall of a society and the geography, climate, and history of a time and place about which he had little or no information.From a spiritual standpoint, this book has helped me more fully understand the Bible and has brought me closer to my Lord & Savior. Through a careful study of it's contents and application of it's teachings in my life I came to know that the Book was of God and was a true companion to the Bible.

It seems some can leave the church, but they can't leave the church alone. Please read my thoughts on this book...The Book of Mormon is a second witness of our Savior Jesus Christ. It was translated by a prophet of God, Joseph Smith. Among many other things, it documents the visit of Christ to the Americas after his death and resurrection. In the Bible, which we Mormons also believe to be the word of God, Christ says, \\"And other sheep I have which are not of this fold:them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd.\\" (John 10:16) After Jesus Christ was resurrected, he came to visit those that believed in him in the Americas. It is a beautiful account, and I encourage you to read it.I am 26 years old and have read the Book of Mormon several times cover to cover. A prophet named Moroni gives a challenge towards the end of the book,\\"And when ye shall receive these things, I exhort you the ye would ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these things are not true; and if ye shall ask with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ, he will manifest the truth of it unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost. And by the power of the Holy Ghost ye may know the truth of all things.\\"(Moroni 10:4-5)I have taken this challenge and I know beyond a shadow of a doubt that this book is the word of God. I know this because of the overwhelming feeling of peace and joy I feel when I read it. If you believe in Jesus Christ you owe it to yourself to read the Book of Mormon and pray about its truthfullness. It does nothing but testify of the divinity and mission of our Lord Jesus Christ. I know these things to be true."},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"At first, I was surprised this book was getting such negative reviews, but it's obvious that many of the reviewers have not even read it, but come here to spread an agenda.

Even though I was young, I could understand that when the people were righteous and followed the teachings of the prophets of God, they were happy and prosperous. When they became wicked, the reverse was true.It is a wonderful witness of Jesus Christ. There are prophesies about Jesus Christ throughout the book.

Many of the biblical prophets were shown in vision the last days and the coming forth of the Book of Mormon. Many of the Book of Mormon prophets testified of prophets dealings with Christ among the Jews, of which dealings are contained in the Bible. God is the author of both. Joseph Smith was a special and chosen vessel of the Lord, called and commissioned to do a very important work in restoring Christ's church back to the earth and bringing forth an additional witness of His gospel and divinity. Nearly all other churches have and teach out of only the Bible, and yet the teachings differ dramatically from one church to the other. God has given us the Book of Mormon today as a second witness, (thus Paul's law of witnesses)and therefore, the doctrines and teachings of the gospel cannot as easily be misinterpreted and misunderstood because there are two witnesses. They both testify of the same gospel and are authored by the same God, even Jesus Christ, our Savior. Don't rely on the wisdom of men to determine how you live your life.

I think in my first reading the theme was love. God loves his children. He has a covenant people who he takes care of, if they keep there part of the promise. His arm of mercy is 'always stretched out.'He keeps his promises to Abraham, and preserves his seed by guiding them out of Jerusalem before it is destroyed. Maybe the greatest display of love is when Jesus Christ himself appears to God's children in America. He repeatedly delivers his children and makes their burden light. In companion with the Bible, you can come to know God better and feel his love as you read this book. I testify it is God's word. Read it yourself with faith and prayer, and you will know."},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"I'm reviewing the ebook, not the content.The format of this book on the kindle is cumbersome. It starts with the table of contents and then as it presents the verses each verse is headed by the chapter and verse. This format is followed in each chapter. It's not at all pleasing to look at much less read.I was looking for the Book of Mormon in more of a book format. I have this version in print and it's closer to book format than the basic Book of Mormon. Unfortunately, you would never know that based on the Kindle format.For the price of $3, it was very disappointing.I also purchasedThe Book of Mormon: 1830 Original Edition (LDS) (Kindle Preferred Active Table of Content Edition)for $0.99 and this was exactly what I was looking for. It is presented in book format with no verse numbers and no chapter headings.Off the topic, if you are looking for the full Standard Works you can use this direct link [...] to get the download that will work for the kindle."},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"I've read this book many many times and I can tell you that it is another testament of Jesus Christ - with the bible. It is a good uplifting book that God set aside for our day to help us in our lives. It isn't complicated to understand God's love for his children in all ages and throughout the history of the world. Christ did visit the America's after his life on the earth and his resurrection and the people of this continent at the time did look forward to him coming fo the first 600 years that this record covers.

Comparable to the Bible, it contains the writings of prophets who were striving to lead the people to follow God's commandments. The most exciting part contains the account of Christ's visit to America after His resurrection.I have read the Book of Mormon many times and learn each time I reread it. I have learned about how to find peace and joy in my life and how to be a better person. It has also helped me have greater faith in Jesus Christ and His teachings to all people.The most important part of the Book of Mormon is the challenge contained therein to read it, ponder, and sincerely ask God if it is a true book. The promise is given that one really can know that it is true by the Spirit of God, which brings peace and enlightens one's understanding."},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"In a nutshell, the Book of Mormon is an account of a prophet (Lehi) and his family who left Jerusalem during the reign of Zedekiah, just before it fell to Babylon. The account tells how Lehi and his family were guided by the Lord across the \\"great waters\\" to what is now known as the American continent, where two major groups were formed: the Nephites (who, for the most part of the account, were righteous and believed in Christ) and the Lamanites (who were primarily hateful and violent, believing that there would be no Christ). The book covers the wars of the two peoples, but more importantly, it focuses on spiritual matters, such as the words of the prophets. What is by many considered the climax of the account is the visit of the ressurected Savior, Jesus Christ, to the American Continent to administer to the Nephites (as they were of the house of Isreal, specifically, the line of Manasseh). The account concludes with the fall of the Nephites into wickedness and their consequent destruction by the hands of the Lamanites, who had become more righteous and are the principal ansenstors of the Native Americans. A breif account is also given of another people who came to the Americas before the Nephites and Lamanites: the Jaredites (who came out from Babylon when the Tower of Babel was destroyed). This people, too, fell into wickedness over the centuries and was destroyed.In my opinion, the true value of the Book of Mormon is in it's \\"fruit\\", or it's teachings. While it gives a historical account, the primary goal of the book's cheif compiler (a Nephite prophet named Mormon, for whom the book is named) was to preserve the spiritual treasures of his people, such as:\\"When ye are in the service of your fellow beings, ye are only in the service of your God.\\" (Mosiah 2:17)\\"Wickedness never was happiness.\\" (Alma 41:10)\\"I will go and do the things which the Lord has commanded, for I know that the Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of men, save he shall provide a way for them that they may accomplish the thing which he commandth them.\\" (1 Nephi 3:7)\\"For it must needs be, that there is an opposition in all things.\\" (2 Nephi 2:11)\\"Adam fell that men might be; and men are that they might have joy.\\" (2 Nephi 2:25)\\"Charity is the pure love of Christ.\\" (Moroni 7:47)\\"By the power of the Holy Ghost, ye may know the truth of all things.\\" (Moroni 10:5)Also given in the account are many stories, as well as a few particularly precious allegories (namely the allegory of the Olive Tree found in the 5th Chapter of the book of Jacob and the vision of the Tree of Life found in Chapters 8 and 11 of the First book of Nephi).Much of the language of the Book of Mormon is poetic, similar in many ways to the Old Testament. Also, as the name of the Christ and His coming were made known unto the prophets of the Nephite civilization, who in turn made them known unto their people, there is a constant struggle in their record with those who are \\"Anti-Christ\\" and fight against the spread of the doctrine of Christ, a circumstance that many in this day and time can no doubt relate to.In addition, some of the prophets in the Book of Mormon were granted a vision of our day and time. They wrote many of the things they saw, including telling of Colombus and the colonization by \\"Gentiles\\" of the \\"Land of Promise\\" (the Americas), of a society filled with many things \\"of curious workmanship\\" (advanced technology), of the coming forth of the Book of Mormon like a voice crying from the dust and the subsequent rejection by many who will say \\"A Bible! A Bible! We have got a Bible, and there cannot be any more Bible.\\" (to which the Lord responds in part, \\"Know ye not that there are more nations than one?\\"), and of \\"secret combinations\\" both anciently and in our day which result in the destruction of nations.In his closing statements at the end of the Book of Mormon, Mormon's son, Moroni, tells that he has seen our day (\\"I speak unto you as if ye are present, and yet ye are not. But Jesus Christ hath shown you unto me, and I know your doing.\\") and he knows that many will reject his words and the words of his father. He recognizes the opposition that will rise against the Book of Mormon and invites those who recieve it to \\"ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these things are not true; and if ye shall ask with a sincere heart, having faith in Christ, he will manifest the truth of it unto you by the power of the Holy Ghost.\\""},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"The Book of Mormon helps the reader gain a better understanding of the mission of our Savior, Jesus Christ. It is a companion to the Bible and helps the reader to better understand the writings of the Bible. Since the Book of Mormon has not passed through the hands of many translators it is easy to understand and does not leave the reader wondering what is missing. I know that if you read the Book of Mormon with a pure heart, wanting to learn more about God, you will be touched by the Spirit and you will know of it's truthfulness."},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"The Book of Mormon is very enlightening and I thoroughly enjoyed reading it.

The Book of Mormon is not a particular genre. It contains elements of Action, Adventure, Violence, Mystery, Spirituality and Debauchery. The reading level varies, but averages at about 8th grade level. I read the Book of Mormon more often than any other book and Highly Recommend it.

Discovering the Book of Mormon clearified many aspects of Christ teachings and also helped my understanding of the inhabitants found on this side of the world. Much of the book of Mormon supports the teachings of the Holy Bible and gives clarity to scriptures understanding.I am an educated man with University degrees and have studied religions over the years. Yet the logic of the Book of Mormon is easy to except and understand. Their is nothing in this great Book that denies the teaching of the prophets of old found in the Bible. Yet in every page you get an account of the correct teachings of Christ.The Book of Mormon is an account of the inhabitants of this continent. The rise and fall of many civilizations. How power and envy can destroy a society. Having lived in Mexico, Central America and South America, I have walked where many before me have walked. The great buildings and the many master pcs. the left behind shows the physical proof found in the Book of Mormon. Many have tried and continue to try to prove the Book of Mormon and the Bible to be incorrect and filled with error and yet they continue to be testimonies of Jesus Christ.To read this book is to gain a testimony of Christ and to gain a testimony one need not me a learned man, but be a man in search of faith and a belief greater than himself."},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"I recommend this book to anyone. It has the true gospel of Jesus Christ and includes Christ's teachings from Himself. This is an excellent companion to the Bible. It's passages teach the pure love of the Savior.This book comes from ancient prophets as they relate their history and journeyings from Israel to the Americas and their history about 500 years before the birth of Christ. Read along as the ancient inhabitants of the American Continents receive a visit from the Son of God.Make your own assessments of this book. Don't rely on anyone's review. Rely on God."},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"I was one of the many that also spent two years peddling the book. I peddled in Chinese if that makes a difference. Ho hum. While peddling the book, I had real problems with the historicity of the book. It seemed to me that it was written in the 19th century, not compiled in the fifth century and translated. My favorite part is where this dude goes on and on about \\"fruit of the loins\\". That is just the funniest phrase ever. Say it real fast, \\"Fruit of the loins\\". Then the guy, I think Joseph from the old test, prophesies about Joseph who is the son of his father with the same name joseph. Wow. Joe Smith must have been real excited when he \\"translated\\" that. It's like when your on TV or something. It must have been a cool feeling. Look at me, I'm in the book! How convenient for him. If anyone questions his authority, he can say \\"Look, the Book of Mormon says I am the prophet, Nah!!!!!!\\".It is said it is a book for our time, and well, that's right because it was written in our time. Well actually, it is a book for our great great grandparents time, which is when it was writt... er i mean \\"translated\\".As for the stories and plot, others have commented on it. It is fairly shallow and addresses alot of 18th century issues. It is not a book to be read when you are sleepy, or when you have anything better to do. I gave it two stars because ....... it is free if you go to a mormon church. There. Oh yeah, and \\"fruit of the loins\\".I do feel strongly that is is a work of fiction about the fictional land of \\"promised land\\". The value of the book is up to you. I won't encourage anyone to read it, but if you feel a burning desire, take an antacid.Just remember that if you really think God cares whether you're a Mormon or not, I don't.Testimonies are such programmed garbage. I don't trust the tesimonies for Amway and I'm not going to trust them from the Mormons. Most religious fans (short for fanatic of course) will \\"bare\\" their testimony that their religion is somehow \\"truer\\" than all the rest. Hooey. I'm tired and need to go to bed, good night."},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"Life changing and thought provoking. Because of what it claims to be, an ancient record translated by Joseph Smith intended as a companion to the Bible we have today, this book should be read by every person before a decision is made about its truthfulness. With all the controversy surrounding it, it is impossible to form a true opinion without first hand knowledge of its contents. Truly another testimony of Jesus the Christ."},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"For those critics who have been friendly to Mormons and have not made personal attacks on us or the founder of our faith, thank you for not being antagonistic towards us. It's refreshing to see that some critics can still be magnanimous.I do have to say, however, that it sounds like many people have done a lot of reading _about_ the Book of Mormon, but have they actually read _the Book of Mormon_? For over 15 years I have read hundreds of reviews on the Web and in books that cite all kinds of outside sources in an attempt to dissect the book without ever really opening it and reading its pages. It's one thing to base one's research upon the doubts _other_ critics have about the credibility of the claim that it was translated rather than authored by Joseph Smith. It's quite another to read it straight through and make your own, informed conclusions.To truly be able to claim credibility in your review of the book, you will have to research like a credible scholar. To do this, you need to actually read it from cover to cover to get familiarity with its structure. Then, you need to read it again for understanding. Then, read it again as if you were a member of the faith it promotes, trying to see it the way someone who believes in it would see it. Then, read it again just in case you missed something. There's a lot in the book, so missing something is common, as faithful members of the LDS church will attest.As you're reading and/or after you've read, please come to http://americantestament.blogspot.com and we'll discuss.Once you've read the Book of Mormon several times, other sources you may find of use in adding balance to your critique include:Journey of FaithJourney of Faith: The New WorldExploring the Lands of the Book of MormonPopol Vuh: The Definitive Edition Of The Mayan Book Of The Dawn Of Life And The Glories OfThe Annals of Cakchiquels & Title of the Lords of TotonicapanThose are only a few. The rest can be found by looking at web sites that LDS Book of Mormon scholars are publishing.My own view of the Book of Mormon, apart from a spiritual testimony of its veracity, is that it is hard to refute on a purely academic and scientific level. The degree of internal consistency with its own timelines, characters, voices, and themes is astounding. Comparing it with more widely accepted ancient literature through historical, archaeological, anthropological, and theological lenses has brought me even closer to the conclusion that it is indeed what it claims to be. There are themes, practices, and traditions in common with Middle Eastern peoples that were simply not known to Joseph Smith nor would they be until after his martyrdom. I am no longer so much in awe of that as I am at secular researchers who seem to be actively choosing to ignore such facts as they try to piece together the puzzle. They simply ignore the \\"picture on the box\\" that the Book of Mormon offers and try to do everything on their own."},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"Karl Marx once said, \\"Religion is the opium of the masses.\\" Now I'm no believer in Marxism, but his statement about religion is VERY true.I was given this book by Mormon missionaries trying to convert me. I love to read so I read this book, but admit that the last couple chapters I just skimmed because in all honesty the book was very boring.I also found it quite offensive for a few reasons:1. The Book of Mormon has Jesus killing multitudes of people! As a Christian I do not believe Jesus EVER killed2. The Book of Mormon is VERY racist, praising white skin, and insulting black skin.3. The Book of Mormon claims that American Indians are descendents of \\"Lamanites\\" (Jewish people),when anyone who knows anything about history knows that American Indians are descendents of people who came from Asia across the Bering Strait.But, regardless of how fictional it is, was it a good read? No. The only thing that kept me reading was the true fascination over how any human being can believe this book is the word of God? And I was very distracted by all the \\"And it came to pass.\\"I have one question which the missionaries couldn't answer for me. Why if Joseph Smith translated the Book of Mormon from \\"reformed Egyptian,\\" did he use Elizabethian style of English? No one in his day talked like that, so why did he use this type of English? The reason the Bible is in this type of English, is because at the time people were translating the Bible into English, they did speak English in this way. So it's clear to me that Joseph Smith was simply copying the Bible. Also it's also very clear that Joseph Smith really plagarized the Bible when writing his Book of Mormon.But like I said, it's not just Mormons. Have you ever tried to convince a devout Moslem that the Koran is false and that Mohammad was a womanizing fraud (which by the way Joseph Smith was too)? Or a Catholic that the rosary is wrong? Or a Jehovah Witness that they're wrong, or a Jew, or a Baptist or any born-again Christian, or a Buddhist, ..... if anything when you see that there are over 5000 religions in this world and you study the history of how people did the craziest things in the name of their religion, you really have to marvel at the nature of human beings!"},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"I loved finding Jesus Christ talked about so beautifully as being the only way to salvation.

The result? I was married and my wife and I raised three daughters with both the Bible and the Book of Mormon as guides, with wonderful results.The Book of Mormon strengthened our faith in the truthfulness of Bible sriptures. It helped my wife and I to teach principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ with power and effectiveness. This book has helped my family to be more at peace by giving us a spirit that allowed us to get along better with each other.The Book of Mormon is full of references to the Savior Jesus Christ. It proves the Bible to be inspired, for prophets of the Western Hemisphere had long ago foretold the coming of the Messiah, of His birth in the Old World.The Book of Mormon not only supports the truth in the Bible: It mentions things not as well covered in the Bible, such as infant baptism and the nature of universal resurrection.

Joseph smith was 18 years old when he translated this book, with no education whatsoever. He translated it in 81 days. 12 people saw the plates that they were origionally written on, and none of them ever denied their testimony. Joseph Smith lived a life of grief, standing up for the things that he knew were true and that he could not deny. The book of mormon is testified many times in the bible. Evidence from ancient american sites depict many of the accounts testified in this book.As a member of the church of Jesus Christ of latter day saint, I testify that this book is the keystone of our religion, as you dig deeper into our religion, you will find that there is a great opposition toward it, but as the only true church, it will prevail against evil. The testimony of Joseph Smith will live on forever, the church will never get smaller, and there will continue to be many miracles involved with the members of this church.

The most pronounced is the claim that the Book of Mormon contains a record of a people of Hebraic origin that populated the Americas, thus making it a history of the Americas. Unlike the Bible (Old and New Testament) where we know the location of the major cities and countries, to date, Modern Archaeologists have not been able to locate any of the cities mentioned in the Book of Mormon. Also, animals such as the horse, cow, sheep, a number of plants from the old world and other items (such as steel) are mentioned as existing in the Americas by the Book of Mormon, yet, these old world animals etc were not in the Americas until after the European encroachment. Also, recent studies into DNA and indigenous inhabitants to the Americas show that the population came from a Mongoloid stock and not from a Middle Eastern stock.As a book of inspired fiction I would say that it is worth reading.

I must say that I'm very, very impressed.My guess is that most of the people here who have shared negative reviews have never even read The Book of Mormon all the way through, and if they have, then they likely didn't understand what they were reading.The Book of Mormon is everything that it purports to be - ANOTHER TESTAMENT of JESUS CHRIST.This is not a book about genetics.This is not a book about zoology.This is not a book about metallurgy.This is not a book about anthropology.This is not a book about linguistics.This is not a book about geology.This is not a book about archaeology.This is not a book about botany.And this is not a book about horses.This is a book about Jesus Christ. If that troubles you, then don't read it. If that interests you, however, then please read it, again and again.Who cares what Mark Twain said about the Book of Mormon? Who is Mark Twain that I should value his opinion over what the Book of Mormon itself has to say?Have the courage to find out for yourself what is in this book and the testimony of JESUS CHRIST that it shares.And to the negative reviewers, to be very honest, I wish you peace. Many (perhaps even most) of you are like the hungry man who dreams that he gets something to eat but soon wakes up to find that his soul is empty. For some strange reason, you can leave the church, but you just can't leave it alone.

In chapter 8 of 3rd Nephi we can learn of the signs of the Savior's crucifixion. Jesus Christ is the Lord and Savior of the whole earth - the signs of his birth and death were recognized the world over by those who believed in him - just like today the signs of his second coming are recognized by believers the world over. But my favorite part begins in chapter 11. The resurrected Jesus Christ appears to the inhabitants of the ancient Americas. These people had just suffered major destruction. Their cities had been destroyed. Their homes and belongings were destroyed. Many of them had lost friends and loved ones. They were tired and dirty and hungry. And they saw Jesus Christ - in the flesh. He invited them to come unto him ... to feel the prints of the nails in his hands. He taught them his gospel and prayed unto the Father on their behalf. He invited them to bring their sick and injured unto him. He layed his hands on their bodies one by one and he healed them. He invited them to bring their little children unto him. He blessed their little ones and angels descended from Heaven and ministered unto them. He ministered unto these people in much the same way as he had ministered in the New Testament. One by One. Individually and Personally. This is the way He wants to minister unto each of us today. He wants us to have a personal relationship with him. From the Holy Scriptures he beckons us &quot;Come unto Me&quot;. Jesus Christ is the answer to all of our problems and struggles in this life. He doesn't take all of our problems and struggles away - he helps us bear them with a glad heart, a joyful countenance, and a quiet peace that cannot be found anywhere else. Jesus Christ is the real thing - the everlasting. I am writing this review on Christmas Eve 2000. I love the Christmas Spirit - The spirit of giving, the spirit of sharing, the sprit of peace, joy,and love - The Spirit of Christ. May we all have this Spirit in our own individual, personal hearts and in our families, communities and in our world is my prayer always. In the name of Jesus Christ.If you share these same desires I invite you with all my heart to read The Book of Mormon, and The King James version of the Holy Bible. Learn of the prophesies, the teachings, and the life of Jesus Christ. Come unto Him and recieve Him into your heart - pray unto the Father in his name - express your gratitude for his blessings and ask his blessing on your life and your family. There was no room for him in the inn - Let's make room for him in our hearts."},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"There have been over 440,000 copies sold through amazon.com. The Book of Mormon was recently ranked among the top ten most influential books in the history of America by Book Magazine. It is a volume of holy scripture that goes hand in hand with the Bible. It testifies of Christ- that He lives and loves us. It is an account written by ancient prophets (just as the Bible is) yet this record is about God's dealings with people who once lived in the Americas.

It tells of an ancient civilization on the American continent (mostly Nephites, Lamanites, Jaredites) that waver from good to bad, back to good, and worse etc., until finally most of the righteous followers of Christ are gone. And then Moroni, the prophet, gives us a promise. He says that if we read the words contained on the plates, if we ask God in faith, He will tells us of its truthfullness. And you know what the great part of it is? It works! Unlike the greatest literature of the most respected authors, the BoM is interactive. Shakespeare, Hardy, Poe, or any of the best can't make such a claim! If you have a question, ask the author. He'll answer it for you. I know this because I tried it.I want to share with you, the reader, and the world that I know beyond any doubt that the Book of Mormon is true. It testifies of Christ in a most powerful and undeniable way. Although men may unite against it and form entire groups and armies to &quot;prove&quot; it untrue, one simple fact remains. It IS true. Critics can't change it, and neither can I. All you have to do is read it humble yourself before God. Ask in faith.

I myself was not raised in the church, even though I had been baptized at age eight, to please my grandmother. I seldom ever attended meetings, because my mother was totally Anti-Mormon (or any organized religion, for that matter).I was first invited to read the BoM when I was only 17, back in the 70's (I am now 47 years old). I can't say it was easy to read; especially if you aren't use to reading scripture-type books. Even so, I enjoyed the feeling I got, as I continued to read it myself.When my mother found out I was reading this book, she was very angry. She insisted Joseph Smith was at worse, delusional or best, an epileptic with seizures. She had never read it herself, so I chose to ignore her attacks of the book; scoffing it off as blind bigotry (or perhaps it was a touch of my own teenage rebellion). For that matter, my father had never read the book either, but he didn't mind my reading it. In fact he secretly encouraged me to (but don't tell your mother) LOL.As I got into the book, the conflicts of the core family (and eventually civilizations of people) all began to intrigue me. There are epic battles between good and evil. I enjoyed the heroic characters and events in the book.There are also basic guidelines by which to \\"live by\\" much like the Bible directs. My favorite part of the book is towards the end, where the Savior, Jesus Christ appears to the decedents of that original core family.Even though it greatly disturbed my mother, I myself did not believe a mere man could write such a record; let alone anyone mentally ill or otherwise. There had to be more to Joseph Smith than what my mother professed.I began to believe it could actually be a record of an earlier people. Not only did the book seem totally plausible to me, there is even a passage or verse that invites the reader to decide if it is TRUTH or NOT: See Moroni 10:4.I took that challenge to heart and asked God myself if the book was true or just the vain imaginations of a man (written close to 175 years ago). I asked God, with faith; I felt blessed and incredibly enlightened by my prayer/s. When I would pray about the book or the Church I would receive a wonderful feeling, which I wish I could have bottled and savor at all times.I began attending The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (LDS) regularly. I gained a strong testimony and took the Church's teaching to heart. I so much wanted to retain the feelings I received about the Church. \\"With all that is wrong, with the youth of the world,\\" I caught my mother telling her aunt, \\"at least she is active in her church and I don't have to worry as much, as I did my sons!\\"Wow, what a confession, even though she insisted that it was all \\"just a teenage phase\\"! Nope I am now 47 years old (as stated earlier) and I have raised my own family in the Church. I am still very active today (and a Temple recommend holder) and continue to read the BoM. I continue to reap benefits from studying it, sometimes just a single verse, other times several chapters.After my father's death, 10 years ago, my mother was very comforted by (as she calls it) \\"My Daughter's Version of Heaven\\". Now in her old age, she insists she is too old, to attend church, but she has become a fierce defender of the TRUTH of its wonderful \\"FRUITS\\" to her friends.Don't allow a negative review or anyone to dissuade you from the TRUTH! God will give you the ability and blessings to know for yourself!

If one could rate spiritual lvls between 1-10, 10 being the most spiritual and Christ centered than the BOM would be a 10 w/o doubt and the only solid 10 out there. For reference point the Holy Bible probably scores a 8.75 on the same scale. In other words, the BOM has no comparison for truth and spiritual knowledge amongst books today."},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"Like the Bible, if you read the Book of Mormon with the intention of gaining truth, wisdom & comfort; that is what you will receive. You cannot receive these things if you read without truly wanting to know if what you are reading is true.I began searching for things of God when I was about 14-15 years old. Living in a rural area north of Springfield, MO; the closest church to me was a Baptist church. I went there for several years & was a member of the Baptist religion for approximately 30 years. I always thought how cool it would be to have lived when there were prophets & apostles on the earth.In 1976, I came in contact with a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I had never heard of this church or it's beliefs. I was told of living prophets & apostles & that Jesus Christ had appeared before ancient people in the Americas. This jogged my memories of history classes; when the Aztecs thought Cortes was the \\"White God\\" returning. I realized that in order for this god to return; he would have had to been there before.The Book of Mormon gives an account of Jesus Christ appearing to the people in what is believed to be South America. This account begins in 3rd Nephi: Chapter 11. It to me was one of the most beautiful passages I've ever read. I know this story is true & not fiction as some have claimed. The Spirit of the Lord filled my heart with that truth.Being a Baptist; I still listened to others & all their anti-Mormon talk. I spent 21 years finding out for myself that the things they were saying were not true. Most of the things could be traced back to 1 or 2 sources of individuals who were bitter because of being reprimanded for serious problems.In 1997, I was baptized a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. My life made a profound change. My spiritual experiences have been like none I've ever known. Some, much to sacred to even mention. Most of these have been because of what I have learned from the Book of Mormon, the life of Joseph Smith Jr & the words of the living prophet today: Gordon B. Hinckley.I suggest for anyone who wants to know about the true teachings of Jesus Christ to read the Book of Mormon; but with your heart ready to receive the Spirit of the Lord. He will not dwell where there is contention.Oh yeah; the member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints I came in contact with in 1976...

The scriptures can be so confusing sometimes so it's nice to have to different books who are in complete harmony with each other to compare and better understand. I have read this book a couple of times now, and everytime I read it, it seems I find something new that helps me in my life. I have found that it applies to whatever trial I might be having at that particular time in my life no matter how small or how severe.

The book is a repetitive, juvenile, uncoordinated, rambling chore to read, written in the lowest style imaginable.

The LDS church presents it as another testament of Jesus Christ, but it is nothing more than a transparent imitation of the King James Bible. However, while the KJV is lyrical, stirring and replete with tales of sin and redemption, the Book of Mormon is a boring, anemic, overwhelmingly bland reproduction.Supposedly, the BofM is a history of the peoples living in the North American continent before, during and after the time of Christ. However, no archealogical evidence of the existence of these peoples has been unearthed. Why? Surely they didn't vanish into thin air. The LDS church says the BofM was translated from golden plates hidden, by an ancient warrior, in a hillside in upstate New York. The translator of the plates was Joseph Smith, the first prophet and president of the LDS church. However, no other person besides Smith ever saw these plates and their existence has been questioned by LDS and nonLDS scholars alike. Did they also vanish into thin air along with evidence of the lives of the people (Nephites, Lamanites and others) these plates chronicled?As historical fiction, this book fails to capture the reader's attention. As scipture, the BofM is a usurpation of the KJV of the Bible, although it pales in comparison. It professes to be a history of people who vanished without a trace, written by a man with a dubious past and an incredible imagination."},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"All I have to say is that for a book to be for sale on Amazon for barely a month and already it has 108 reviews has got mean something, and those are only the 108 that were appropriate enough to leave posted.

So, love it or hate it, I think everyone should check it out.

So, be warned."},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"I have not really known much about the Book of Mormon until a few years ago. I have heard of it, however, I have never really looked into it until recently. I have to make a comment that an amazon book review is not really the appropriate place for &quot;proving&quot; that the book as well as the religion is false. That would take many books to &quot;prove&quot;, and people who do it end up looking rather ignorant (case in point, see the review entitled, &quot;good firewood&quot;, and the use of the old, tired Revelation 22: 18-19 argument).In any case, I will now attempt to &quot;review&quot; this book. I personally feel that the book was well writen. For an 18 year old boy to write it in 6-8 months (especially if you believe he did it without divine intervention) is simply phenomenal. It is interesting that, being writen by a farmboy, it's divine origin is still being debated to this very day, and by learned professors none the less. With religious feelings aside, the historical aspect of this book is reason enough to read it, not only for religious reasons, but for philosophical and historical reasons as well.I do tend to agree with many other reviewers (in point- &quot;why is this book even on here?&quot;) that the vast majority of people who gave the book a bad rating most likely have not even read the book, and if they did, read it in the completely wrong mindset. Thus, I will most likely have a poor rating for this review no matter what I say, merely because I rate the book with 5 stars.To conclude, I will say that the book is definitely worth while to read, but don't buy it. You don't have to buy it, because this exact copy can be obtained for free from any LDS church-- no strings attached. You will save $5 and will receive it faster. Also, if you are so opposed to the church but would like a copy anyway, you won't be paying for the book, and thus will not be supporting the church. It's better for everyone! :)---Christoph"},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"This is a book that requires you read it with some nebulous spiritual guidance, suspend common sense, reason and logic and ignore any reliance on any facts or evidences. It is based on the alleged-claimed visions of Joseph Smith, a 19th century man steeped in Protestantism who was born in 1805 and is the foundation for the American religion of Mormonism which was organized in 1830 after he produced the Book of Mormon. This book is nothing more than a book of fiction about imaginary people which draws heavily on the King James version of the Bible, The View of the Hebrews, by Ethan Smith (no relation), the Solomon Spaulding Manuscripts and other sources which sound suspiciously like his own family. If you are willing to believe that Joseph Smith had visions and saw angels and many of the Biblical characters, then it will appeal to you as some sort of complimentary book to the Bible. It is interesting to note that no where do any of the witnesses to these claimed &quot;golden plates&quot; which are supposed to be the basis for this book state that they ever saw anything with their physical eyes. Instead they use such phrases as &quot;spiritual eye&quot; (Martin Harris-one of the witnesses) and &quot;shown by a supernatural power,&quot; another &quot;witness.&quot; One must ask the question, if these records were real, why did it require faith and prayer to see them by some metaphysical, spiritual means? These kinds of documented reports show clearly this is a book based on beliefs in angels, the supernatural and other metaphysical notions. Obviously, there are no evidences of any tangible source to validate this book which is claimed to be written in an unknown language called: Reformed Egyptian. It has remained as some source of &quot;truth&quot; only in a spiritual sense as it relies heavily on the Christian principles in the Bible. It is a mildly interesting read, but very laborious to wade through because of the repetitious phrases such as: &quot;and it came to pass.&quot; One can see clearly that this book is only for Mormons who have a &quot;belief&quot; in their brand of subjective truth.

After 150 years of revisions, mostly grammatical and spelling, the book is still extremely difficult to read due to the horrific King James English used in it.The book amazingly enough also managed to answer a lot of questions people were asking about religion, Masonry, etc. in western New York state during the 1820's.

It covers the history of the people who left Jerusalem in 600 AD and travelled across the ocean and settled in the Americas where other peoples currently existed. There is also reference to a much older civilization which had settled there from a much earlier period following the Tower of Babel recorded in the Old Testament of the Holy Bible.Overall, it is a reinforcement of the teachings of Jesus Christ with the most significant difference being that there was only one translation in the early 19th Century versus multiple translations and copies of the Holy Bible from numerous sources which make up the current Holy Bible. Members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints maintain that the Holy Bible, Book of Mormon and the Doctrine & Covenants (modern revelation since the early 19th Century) are considered canonized scripture and all testify of Jesus Christ of the New Testament (the same one prophesied about in both the Old Testament and Book of Mormon prior to his birth, baptism, ministry, atonement, death, resurrection and ascension into heaven before the original apostles.)This book has been an important strengthening of my testimony of the gospel of Jesus Christ and his birth in Bethlehem, baptism by John the Baptist, ministry including the many miracles, atonement, death and literal resurrection which are taught to be literal not just figurative stories from a moral fictional Bible but an actual account by prophets of God the Father.

As such, it has been something of an embarrassment to Mormons not absolutely convinced of its authenticity. They would prefer emphasis on the Holy Bible--especially the New Testament--as opposed to a document that many people, both Mormons and non-Mormons, have problems with.I will not comment on the basic scholarship of the 'Book' except to say that much of it was lifted whole cloth from Isaiah and other books of the Bible. Also, as a supposed inspired translation, it has serious problems. Joseph Smith and his Mormon followers spoke and read Nineteenth Century upstate New York English. They didn't speak like the Elizabethan translators of the King James version of the Bible. Nevertheless, Elizabethan style prevails throughout. Why would God, Jesus or one of their angels seen fit to translate this document into archaic English?Suspiciously, the Book of Mormon story has much in common with the revelation of the Holy Qur'an to Muhammad. The unlettered Muhammad, who is troubled by religious uncertainty, is visited by the Angel Gabriel who recites God's word to him in the form of the Holy Qur'an. The near child, Joseph Smith, also troubled by religious uncertainty, is visited by the angel Moroni who again reveals God's word. The two stories are too similar to be accidental which leads to one of two conclusions. Either God contacts his Prophets via angels...or...Joseph Smith deliberately imitated Muhammad's method of revelation.Also, demographically, the book is suspect. Genetic studies suggest that most of Amerind precursors originated in Northern Asia, not the Middle East. Yes, there is some evidence of admixture of European genetics but, again, this is European. The Book of Mormon peoples were iron-age people which accords with their supposed temporal origin in the Middle East. Despite extensive archaeological digs throughout the Americas there is no evidence of iron tools and weapons described in the Book of Mormon. Why? Did they all rust away? Why do we have iron implements from Africa, Asia, and Europe even older than the purported dates of the Book of Mormon peoples?And really...the Amerinds were CURSED with dark skins. By what evidence is dark skin a curse or is this simply evidence of common nineteenh century racism? Also, the gold plates--the extremely important document of vanished people--was buried in an Indian mound in New York? What evidence is there that New York ever had a high level of native American civilization? Weren't all the higher Amerind civilizations--with gold metallurgy--only in Meso and South America?Some have questioned how the boy, Joseph Smith, could have known that the ancient Native Americans had achieved a high level of civilization. The fact is that even in Smith's day, much was known of ancient mesoamerica and the Inca Empire. The great scholar William Prescott published his excellent 'The Conquest of Mexico and the Conquest of Peru' with extensive descriptions of Native American civilization in the 1840's.In any event, the Mormon Church has spent millions digging for Book of Mormon 'proof'.

They were written by people, just like us). Most people either believe it or they don't. Easy enough.The dispute seems to be in why to believe it or not. Most of those that believe it think that God has spoken to them in some way telling them it was \\"true\\" (it came to us through the power of God). The ones that don't think it is \\"true\\" seem to indicate those that believe it have not taken the time to understand where the Book of Mormon came from. How implausible it really is to believe the book of Mormon was translated through looking glasses in a hat while nobody really even saw the translation happening because JS was always behind a curtain while translating it?Of course a book that claims to be a manifestation of God's power and is followed by millions of people worldwide (though a small investigation will reveal that the Mormon churches claim of 12 million is seriously inflated) will create a polarized effect. Those who leave the church often feel seriously jaded and want to help other people out of what they believe is a fraudulent arrangement. Most of the people who leave the church, however, leave it alone. The defenders of the Mormon church like to say people leave the church but can't leave it alone, but they only hear from the people that meet that description. The ones who have left the church and left it alone are many.The polarized reviews are not an indication of the books truth. They are also not an indication of an interesting book. They are merely the indication of a subject that seems to require an all or nothing opinion by those who care about the subject.

And I prayed to receive the promised \\"testimony\\" regarding the truth of it. When the truthfulness of the Book of Mormon was not made manifest to me, I faced a monumental problem.Beginning at age twelve I was summoned into the first of many closed-door \\"worthiness interviews.\\" A couple times each year I was required to meet alone with a local religious authority and be asked fifteen standardized questions. My answers would determine my standing in the religious community and ultimately my destiny. If I could meet the requirements outlined by my bishop during this interview by giving all \\"yes\\" answers I would be rewarded. I felt that my security and well-being depended upon providing correct answers, something not unlike my classroom experience as a junior high school student.My bishop asked me question #1, \\"Do you have a firm testimony of the gospel as restored to the earth through Joseph Smith?\\" In the second question he asked if I accepted and sustained the current prophet of the LDS Church as ultimately the only person on earth with legitimate and God-ordained priesthood authority. As that authority was bestowed upon Joseph Smith by heavenly visitors then properly passed unto the current leader, my being able to answer question #2 correctly hinged upon my getting question #1 right.And my being able to get question #1 right hinged upon my obtaining that testimony promised in the Book of Mormon. Once I had a sure witness of the truthfulness of the book, I could know for certain its translator Joseph Smith was a prophet of God and I could trust his account of the \\"restoration\\" to the earth of \\"the one and only true Church.\\" I could know for certain that the line of priesthood authority given Joseph Smith during visits from John the Baptist and three of Christ's apostles was real. I could know for certain that the leaders of the LDS Church today still carried that same authority (question #2's correct answer).So I redoubled my efforts and prayerfully searched the pages of the Book of Mormon. Beginning at age fourteen, I attended one class period each school-day taught by the LDS Church. That class was part of a four-year-long educational program designed help me learn the truth of this book. I studied hard and earned all A's. I memorized dozens of verses contained in the Book of Mormon. After another slow and careful journey reading it cover to cover, I prayed for a testimony. Despite my eager readiness to believe, the truthfulness of this book was not made manifest to me.I was in a true conundrum and became quite anxious about my situation. Other young people, many of them children much younger than me, had often stood in the pulpit and publicly shared their testimonies. \\"I know this Church is true, I know Joseph Smith was a prophet of God, I know the President of the Church is a prophet of God,\\" they would say. Many adults stood and proclaimed that they knew \\"beyond a shadow of a doubt\\" that these things are true. It became imperative that I gain my own testimony of the truthfulness of the Book of Mormon.I delved into a sincere and careful third reading of the Book of Mormon. I was ready and willing to believe. Sensing my need for the adult approval and personal self-esteem that would come with my testimony, I prayed with all the faith I could muster. Still I did not receive the prized testimony that would secure my future. The truthfulness of the Book of Mormon was not made manifest to me. After years of sincere testimony-seeking, I felt hopeless and sunk into teenage depression.A recurring nightmare began before my high school career ended. In it, it is semester's end and just days from graduation. As much as I wanted to, I have not completed even a small fraction of the requisite coursework. My classmates all appear to be happy and are moving on. I feel like an utter failure and experience near-panic when I assess my situation. It is painfully obvious that I will not complete the required coursework in time.Twenty-five years later I can honestly say the Book of Mormon has in many ways shaped my destiny. Not possessing a testimony of its truthfulness left me unable to conform to the requirements of the LDS faith. I became a perceived threat. I remain estranged from my Mormon family and small Utah community. I have often been the object of misunderstanding and sometimes the object of fear or pity. My lonely and painful existence has been a tribute to this most influential book."},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"I think its unfair for people to forget about the great writers of our time.

It has brought me the greatest joy. I read it's pages and I am filled with light. It is a companion book to the bible. With two testaments of Christ we can more easily understand principles and come to know God. Christ is the very center of the Mormon religion. Anyone who believes otherwise is mistaken. We are Christian. In every way as a people we seek to follow Christ. Although others may mock, we need pay no heed. Many have different ideas and principles. We respect that. However, although man may philosophize all he/she desires.... One thing stands true- that is God. We cannot change God by our theories. The only way to know God and know Truth is through prayer. Mormons are not out to &quot;Convince&quot; others. Each person has the opportunity to find out for himself. To pray and ask God and in faith receive answers. This book is scripture like the bible.As Mormons we merely want to share. We have no reason to convince. We only want to share the joy that comes from this book and the principles that bring true and lasting happiness.It is utter Irony that this book is being rated in such a manner. The nations of the world will be judged by this book and it's teachings. I would not criticize the Holy Bible for the same reason.

It has been translated into dozens of foreign languages. Millions of people have read it, many receiving free copies from Mormon missionaries (the LDS church - the largest of the Mormon churches - has a full-time missionary corps of over 50,000). Many of those have accepted its claims and joined one of the many Mormon sects which accept it as divinely revealed scripture. Many others - probably the great majority - have read it and recognized it as a fantasy tale written in the early nineteenth century.The book purports to be a translation - made with divine assistance - of gold plates on which the ancient inhabitants of America wrote their own religious and secular history. It describes these inhabitants as Israelites, having been divinely led to America at the time of the Babylonian destruction of Jerusalem six centuries before Christ. It describes their culture, their prophets, their many wars, a supposed post-resurrection visit by Jesus to America, and the final destruction of the more civilized inhabitants about 400 C.E. by the more savage ones, who are the ancestors of the American Indians.No non-Mormon historian, anthropologist, archaeologist or other expert in pre-Columbian America accepts the Book of Mormon's (non-religious) claims. Rather than being an accurate description of ancient American culture, it describes what a relatively uneducated person in the time of Joseph Smith might suppose it to be - similar to his own American, European-based culture, with steel, horses, chariots, glass, compasses, coins, wheat, cattle, flocks, and so on. None of these things were known to the ancient Americans. Nor does it accurately reflect how Jewish immigrants to America might have lived, since it shows a great ignorance of Jewish religion and culture. More than that, the book shows no indication of familiarity with genuine ancient American life or history.The book is filled with many other anachronisms. Much of its religious material is merely copied almost word-for-word from the King James English Bible translation, putting many words of the New Testament writers into the mouths of American prophets who lived supposedly hundreds of years before Christ. The supposed historical material is largely a reflection of commonly held ideas in Smith's time about the origins of the American Indians, and mostly based on a book published by a New England pastor just a few years before Smith wrote the Book of Mormon, called \\"A View of the Hebrews\\", by Rev. Ethan Smith (no relation), first published in 1823, with a second edition in 1825. (See David Persuitte's book \\"Joseph Smith and the Origins of the Book of Mormon\\"). That notion - that the Indians are descendants of ancient Israelites - has been so thoroughly disproven by science that even many Mormon scholars now admit that Smith's claims on that issue were wrong. (See Simon Southerton's book \\"Losing A Lost Tribe.\\")Hundreds of books have been written by Mormons to support the claims made in the Book of Mormon. Hundreds of others have been written to expose the book as a work of fiction. Interestingly, the defenders of the book's claims generally urge readers of the book not to read anything ABOUT the book - especially anything negative - but rather they urge the reader simply to pray to God and ask whether its claims are true. Unfortunately, it seems that God sometimes tells readers that it is true, but apparently he tells many other readers that it is a hoax. Why else would one find dozens of copies in the ten-cent bin at every thrift store in the country? Or perhaps most people feel that they do not need God's help in confirming that they are reading a fantasy tale - however religious it may sound - and not a description of real life or real events in a real place."},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"The Book of Mormon (BoM) is an interesting book. It is like the most religious books, filled with intricate stories and exotic names. One is amazed by its view of the world, struck by its strong personalities, sad by its interpretation of the human nature and wishful about its hope for us humans.BoM contains 14 different \\"books\\", bearing the author's name. According to BoM itself and its preface, these \\"books\\" are really 14 parts of three different ancient goldish plats, which in turn are summaries of several other plates. These summaries have been made by a redactor, the 4th century CE soldier/prophet Mormon and his son, Moroni.In all, BoM tells the story of three different families with friends (between 20-40 people) who leave Middle East in different periods of time and at god's command head for America. The majority of the book is about the second colony which leaves for America in 600 BCE. This colony suffers by frictions between older and younger brothers, frictions that are cemented into the offspring, leading to the separation and the establishment of two people: the ligh-skinned Nephites and the dark-skinned Lamanites. During their lifetime, they meet the third colony, Mulekites and find the remnants of the first colony - a great civilisation called the Jaredites. The wars descripted are not that child friendly. The different migrated groups become very blood thirsty in their fights, but somehow god seems to take sides in these bloody wars - and help the good ones.We never know where all the action takes place, but are given lots of names of cities, lands and rivers, so it could be every where or some where in America. I think that it must be a restricted area in America, because everybody gets to meet everybody in some odd way.The colonies described develop the same evil tendencies:- they become rich and start to boast,- they cling to beliefs such as god is forgivable and will save every body regardless if they regret or not, or that there is only one god and that he has no children,- they establish secret societies, \\"robber bands\\" which creates anarchy, because these robbers communicate thru secret oaths and signs etc and therefore undermine stability and rule of law,- they deny miracles, ministering by angels and the holy spirit- they become strong selfish individuals- they mock god and the prophets.The pictures I get from BoM is diverse. According to its story, the Lamanites could be plausible ancestors of some Indian tribes in America. One reason for believing this is that the Lamanites are described in the same way the Indians were described by European: that they are in a devilish statem savages and cannibalists. I totally reject this view of Indians, and do not find the description of Lamanites objective.The language of Book of Mormon (BoM) is oldish. There are lots of \\"knoweth\\" and \\"ye\\". There are too much repetitions of verbs, phrases and expressions, that makes you bored, like \\"or in other words\\", \\"and it came to pass\\", \\"for behold\\".Everything in BoM is just like the bible an either-or: either you follow a straight path and come to paradise or several wrong paths and go to hell. There is a clear picture of dual ending, which one can notice in every religion.There are not many women mentioned in the book: only three women are named (five if you count Jesus' mother Mary and Eve, the foremother). God talks always to men, they are always kings, rulers, judges, priests etc. They are always given what they asked. This view of women is different from mine - every era had had its own. However, the story the prophetess, Akish and the faithful queen (anonymous) are wonderful.I recognised many wordings from the bible scriptures, but they have been evolved in some way, there are modified and sound different, you know, they have an American touch for a European like me, for example: New Jerusalem will be built in America, \\"the house of Jacob or Israel\\" is referred to the Indians, \\"the Gentiles\\", to the Americans and of course, the climax in the middle for the book: Jesus' visit to America! Besides this, Moses is mentioned a lot and Isaiah is overquoted!The Christian Messiah is the focus of the book - BoM people believe in him both before his coming and after. Whatever the people do, they bear his name. Even though I do not believe in a historic Jesus, I found a strong, powerful, meek and glorified Jesus in BoM, one that is proud of having been crucified and proud of having saved the world. He is not the agonised Jesus of Getsemane. He is as maybe many Christians expect him to be, when he comes back again - powerful and almighty, read III Nephi!The fact that BoM supports a Jesus that is supposed to be historical and gives him qualities that he could only have acquired when New Testament was written, makes the book a religious thesis, rather than a historical overview of ancient American Christians.The preface contains the coming forth of Book of Mormon and its editing by the young Joseph Smith, prophet for more than 150 BoM-believing groups in US. Thru revelation, he found the plates, dug them up from a hill, Cumorah, and translated them using holy glasses \\"interpreters\\" by the power of god.In BoM there are prophecies about the coming forth of BoM, where a man called Joseph will translate them. In BoM there are a lot of stories who are like Joseph's, especially Mormon's own story, where he digs up some plates in a hill called Shim - later Cumorah! Another prophet, king Mosiah used also holy glasses or interpreters to translate some other holy plates.However, in it one finds an idealised Christianity - Jesus answers almost everything that he never did in New Testament, such the meaning of the communion, baptism of children etc. For me, as a liberal Christian, the BoM cements the literalist fundamentalistic view of Jesus and the bible. I am impressed by Joseph who wanted to revitalise Jesus for his own time and for us today. Even though he had to make up this wonderful story of plates, dug up in Cumorah in order to establish an ancient basis/proof for a real Christianity - he managed for people then and now to create a new framework of understanding. He made Jesus real thru BoM, thru his actions (besides polygamy!) and thru his utter confidence in god's role in America and the world. Thus, if the book makes a person come to the Christian Messiah, then Joseph has succeeded well."},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"What missionaries will do is get you to pray to see if thisbook is true.

Some of these canbe passed off as editorial mistakes but others are serious changes inmeaning which reflect current LDS doctrine.

One thingyou will never hear from a Mormon (because few know this) is that ALLthe witnesses of the Book of Mormon left the church. Joseph Smith'sson left the Utah church and entered the Reorganised LDS, and so didJoseph's first wife Emma."},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"Joseph Smith once said \\"I told the brethren that the Book of Mormon was the most correct of any book on earth, and the keystone of our religion, and a man would get nearer to God by abiding by its precepts than any other book\\" (The Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith, page 194).The vast majority of Mormons will confirm that they believe in this statement, yet the Book of Mormon does not contain many of the doctrines taught in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.As a matter of fact, the BoM contradicts Mormon theology in many important doctrines.Here are just few examples:The BoM teaches that the authority to baptize comes from Jesus Christ (3Nephi 11:25), but the LDS church teaches that this authority was given to Smith by John the Baptist.The LDS church teaches that, before the \\"restoration\\", there was a complete apostasy (History of the Church vol.1 page XL), but 3Nephi 28:1-8 denies that.The LDS church says that God was once a man and, through obedience to Mormon doctrine, death and resurrection, was elevated to godhood (Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith, page 342-345; Lorenzo Snow, Millennial Star, vol.54). The BoM, on the contrary, teaches that God is eternal (Moroni 7:22), He is not a glorified man (Alma 22:10; 31:15; Mormon 9:9-11; Moroni 7:22; 8:18), and He is unchangeable (2 Nephi 27:23; 29:9; 3 Nephi 24:6).Mormon doctrine states that God is a personage of flesh and bones (Doctrine and Covenants 130:22); however, the BoM teaches that God is a spirit (Alma 18:24-28; 22:10-11).Mormons are polytheists (B. McConkie - Mormon Doctrine page 576-577; Journal of Discourses vol. 2 page 345), yet the BoM clearly states that there is only one God (the testimony of three witnesses, 2 Nephi 31:21; Mosiah 15:1-4; Alma 11:28-29,44; Mormon 7:7).Mosiah 2:39 shows that hell is a place of torment, but LDS theology denies that.Polygamy is strongly condemned in the BoM (Jacob 1:16; 2:23,24,27,31; 3:5; Mosiah 11:2,4; Ether 10:5,7); strangely enough, first president and \\"prophet\\" Joseph Smith married over 30 wives and plural marriage was widely spread in the early church; the LDS church was forced to renounce polygamy in 1890 as a necessary condition for Utah to achieve statehood, therefore, today Mormons do not practice it; but polygamy as a principle was never renounced (see Doctrine and Covenants section 132 and Mormon Doctrine by B. McConkie page 579).Mormons teach the LDS \\"gospel\\" will be preached to the dead in the spirit world, thus giving them a chance of salvation; the BoM, on the other hand, teaches that salvation must be obtained in this life (Alma 34:31,33,35; 2 Nephi 9:38; Mosiah 15:26; 26:25-27).One of the LDS missionaries favorite techniques to convince people of the veracity of their message is to tell them to pray to know whether the BoM is true, and, they say, you will receive a \\"burning in the bosom\\" as a confirmation from God. The BoM denies that, and teaches that we are to search Scriptures to determine the truth (Jacob 7:23).The BoM teaches that there are only two destinies after death (1 Nephi 15:35; Mormon 9:23; Alma 3:26; 40:26; 41:4; Mosiah 16:11; Helaman 14:18-19; Ether 4:18; 2 Nephi 2:28-29; 9:16; 28:21-22; 3 Nephi 27: 11, 17), but Mormons believe that there are three kingdoms in the spirit world: Celestial, Terrestrial and Telestial (Doctrine and Covenants section 76).So, if this book is \\"the cornerstone of the Mormon religion\\", why don't Mormons teach the doctrines contained in it?"},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"I have met some missionaries and they all told me to pray about whether the Book of Mormon is true or not? Okay, so I thought, \\"you can't just tell me if it is true or not?\\" So am I suppose to pray about everything to know if it is true or just the Book of Mormon? I mean, does praying even work to determine if God exists or not? If praying does work, then everyone would know that God exists but yet there are some who are not sure. Can someone simply pray to know if they will have a baby girl or baby boy, or if there are other life forms in another part of the galaxy, or if they will get a raise in a month or two, when and where the next earthquake will occur, or what the answer is to a test question, or even which religion or church out of all the religions and churches out there is/are correct (Judaism, Christianity, Islam, etc)? If praying worked, then we would have all the answers to these questions by now.I have prayed and still have not got any answer. I don't think that by simply praying will you get an answer to your questions, and I also think they know this but they just don't tell you. From my experience, it is usually only real actual physical evidence that will answer a question for you or for someone to actually experience those events, which of course we are unable to know about since we are not from that time period of Joseph Smith 1800s and were not around to actually see him physically discover the gold plates and to translate them, or whether he just wrote it himself just as H.G. Wells wrote War of the Worlds or Hemmingway wrote The Sun Also Rises. And also we are unable to know of the intentions at the time the religion was founded.I don't need to pray to see if a Chemistry textbook is true or not, so why would I have to for the Book of Mormon? And I have yet to hear a Chemistry professor say \\"pray to find out if the Chemistry book is true or not.\\" If the book works, then the things it talks about in there will also work and be reproducible, and if a formula in it doesn't work, then it will also show to not work in an experiment and be wrong. I don't need to pray about it to know if it works or not or if it has any effects. The same thing with a math book, or a physics experiment book. I don't need to necessarily pray about it, to see if it is true or not. I just have to try it out.When they asked me to pray to see if the book was true or not, this made me think \\"I don't even believe these missionaries know if it is true or not themselves and they are just waiting to see what my opinion is.\\" I mean, what is there to pray about in the book?I know, if I was truly trying to convince someone that something was true, I would point out how it was true and give instances or examples. It is called the burden of proof, which makes an argument a lot more convincing. Something is much harder to believe if it can't be proven. If the Book of Mormon is not about whether it is right or wrong but about faith, then why do they say that \\"I know that this church/book is true.\\" which would then not require faith?The Book of Mormon is a book about two civilizations that existed on the Americas thousands of years ago, which I have never heard of in school history books. Either the book was completely made up by Joseph Smith or someone else (because it is said that Joseph Smith was 14 and uneducated when the book was written) using his wild imagination like H.G. Wells writing the Time Machine or War of the Worlds which are both works of fiction and imagination, or he really was somehow visited upon angels and led to some gold plates in some fields where he later translated into the Book of Mormon. I think most people would believe the former was true, since I have never heard on the news of anyone ever being visited upon angels ever since Joseph Smith's claims that he had been.To me the Mormons are a very well organized religious system that emphasize strong family values and a healthy lifestyle, and which makes most of their money through regular 10% tithing of their members, which then allows them to build their temples, stake centers, church buildings, and publish their literature throughout the world.They are also slightly different from other Christian churches like Catholics, Protestants, Non-denominational, in that in order to enter certain buildings such as the Temple you have to have be Temple worthy. And not to mention that Joseph Smith, to them, was a prophet that restored the true church of Christ on the planet, which some people would disagree with.I find this amusing with most religions and that is of the many differences among these so called divine churches. I mean, if churches were divine, wouldn't God somehow get it right the first time instead of having so many different churches like the Catholic Church and then the Protestants who later were protesting against the Catholic practices, and then of course the Latter Day Saints or Mormons who claim to be the true church of Christ? Why didn't the Mormon church happen earlier if it was the \\"one true church of Christ\\" instead of in 1830 after Judaism, Muslims, Catholics, and then the Protestants? It makes me wonder and question a lot about religion and if there really is any type of divine intervention among them or is it just simply man-made."},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"The message of The Book of Mormon saved my life, and then it healed my soul.\\"I glory in plainness; I glory in truth; I glory in my Jesus for he hath redeemed my soul from hell.\\" - 2 Nephi 33:6"},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"I have read the Holy Bible and the Book of Mormon.

Thanks, and please check my reviews of books by Hugh Nibley and John Sorenson, as well as my review of \\"Echoes and Evidence for the Book of Mormon.\\"SeeEchoes and Evidences of the Book of MormonAn Insider's View of Mormon OriginsFrom the cold hard facts then:Joseph Smith demonstrated his ability to write Book of Mormon scripture by composing the scripture-sounding \\"Preface\\" (now dropped) as well as the two testimonies (originally at the end of the book). Note the following:PART OF THE PREFACE TO THE BOOK OF MORMON COMPOSED BY JOSEPH SMITHAs many false reports have been circulated respecting the following work, and also many unlawful measures taken by evil designing persons to destroy me, and also the work....notwithstanding my utmost exertions to recover it again....Satan had put I into their hearts to tempt the Lord their God, by altering the words, that they did read contrary from that which I translated and caused to be written; and if I should bring forth the same words again, or, in other words, if I should translate the same over again, they would publish that which they had stolen, and Satan would stir up the hearts of this generation, that they might not receive this work....Wherefore, to be obedient unto the commandments of God, I have, through his grace and mercy, accomplished that which he hath commandedSLIGHT CHANGES TO SHOW THAT JOSEPH SMITH COULD COMPOSE BOOK OF MORMON SCRIPTURE:As many false reports had been circulated in the land, many unlawful measures were taken against Nephi by the evil designing Lamanite king. But notwithstanding Nephi's utmost exertions, Satan had put it into their hearts to tempt the Lord their God, by altering Nephi's words, that they did read contrary from that which he caused to be written as testimony on gold plates. And it came to pass, that Nephi said, If I should bring forth the same words again, or, in other words, if I should write the same over again, they would publish that which they had stolen, and Satan would stir up the hearts of Lamanites, that they might not receive this work. Wherefore, to be obedient unto the commandments of God, I, Nephi have, through his grace and mercy, accomplished that which he hath commanded.The preface also shows the back-tracking style found throughout the Book of Mormon.Note the following examples:l. \\"I have charity for the Jew--I say Jew, because I mean....\\"2. \\"And now if Christ had not come into the world, speaking of things to come as though....\\" (Supposedly written in 148 BC-before Christ)3. \\"...so long as there should be a band of Christians remain to possess the land--For thus all the true believers of Christ....\\" (Supposedly written in 73 BC)4. \\"And behold in the end of this book...Behold I do not mean the end of the book of Helaman, but I mean....\\"5. \\"...it must needs be expedient that Christ-for in the last night an angel spake unto me that this should be his name....\\" (Written in the sixth century BC)6. \\"...and if I should bring forth the same words again, or, in other words, if I should translate the same over....\\"7. \\"...that my name should be had for good and evil among all nations, kindreds, and tongues, or that it should be both good and evil spoken of among all people.\\"NOTE: Number \\"6\\" (above) was written by Joseph Smith in his 1830 preface of the Book of Mormon, a preface now deleted, and number \\"7\\" was also written by Joseph Smith as he later described his visit with an angel.Also, remember that Joseph Smith didn't know when to quit talking. His prayer for the dedication of the Kirkland Temple, according to the guides, was a couple hours long. Thus, again he demonstrated his ability to spin scripture as fast as his scribe could write it down.Published in 1830, the original Book of Mormon bears all the marks of a novel written by a relatively uneducated man. Some 4000 changes have been made in grammar (also deleting the overuse of \\"and it came to pass\\").Also, some significant errors corrected (King Benjamin was dead at one point and it was changed to Mosiah). In addition, it contains errors that are found in the King James Bible at the time.Taking the popular folklore of the lost white race of \\"Mound Builders\\" and that the Indians were descended from the Jews, Joseph Smith had all the makings of a novel set in his lap. He was not a scholar, but he used a few books as references--notably \\"View of the Hebrews,\\" published in Poultney, Vermont, where his chief scribe and third cousin, Oliver Cowdery, came of age.The project took about a year. At the age of twenty-two-and-half, Joseph Smith dictated 116 pages over a two month period. When these pages were lost or stolen, he waited some nine months (with some composition in between) before starting again. Then after three months, he completed his novel at age twenty-three-and-a-half.At the time, Joseph Smith was not a teenager or \\"farm boy\\" as many Mormon writers say, deliberately confusing Joseph's teenage visions with his dictating of the Book of Mormon. He was a married man of 22-23 when he began his novel.Note, also, that Joseph Smith didn't have to \\"write\\" a single word. He had various scribes do that as he \\"translated\\" from behind a curtain by looking at a magic stone placed in a hat.For a fascinating look at the problems of the Book of Mormon, read \\"American Apocrypha,\\" a collection of essays by former Mormons. American Apocrypha: Essays on the Book of Mormons (Essays on Mormonism Series)The following is from an essay by Professor Edwin Firmage, who tells a compelling story of how he came to abandon his belief that the Book of Mormon is an ancient document. The other essays in this book are also fascinating. Highly recommended for anyone interested in the Book of Mormon.Professor Edwin Firmage, Jr. writes:\\"Nearly twenty years ago, as a first year-graduate student at the University of California, Berkeley, my ambition was to become another Hugh Nibley, whose writings I loved since I was twelve....\\"\\"Still a neophyte, but armed with German and a little Arabic, Greek, and Hebrew, and intent on acquiring the requisite apologetic tools, I cameo Berkeley to study ancient Near Eastern languages, particularly Egyptian, the language of mysteries par excellence.\\"Not long after my arrival, I was asked to teach the Book of Mormon in the Gospel Doctrine class in my Berkeley ward. I welcomed the opportunity, as it would give me a chance to delve deeper into the book. By any standard, my wife and I were faithful Mormons who attended church, visited the temple, and prayed together. I expected my study of the Book of Mormon to result in an increase of faith as it had done on my mission. But within six months, I no longer believed the Book of Mormon to be an ancient text.\\"To this day, I am not sure how it happened, although I can isolate several issues that played a role in my change of mind....I have often thought that what happened to me in Berkeley was fundamentally a conversion, or, if you like, an anti-conversion. The process had all the inscrutable suddenness that characterized some of the conversions I had witnessed as missionary. Like a conversion to faith, the effect of my change of mind propagated with amazing speed. Almost overnight my whole outlook on life was different.\\"\\"The remaining pages of this essay will present a few of what, for me in 1984, were discoveries of some importance. These do not by any means constitute a comprehensive explanation of the Book of Mormon. Nor are they offered as proof of my thesis that the book is modern, but as examples of how the assumption that is modern resolves otherwise significant difficulties.\\"Further, there is no archaeological evidence for the claims of the Book of Mormon. Read the following:Robert J. Sharer is Professor of Anthropology and Curator of the American Section of the University Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology at the University of Pennsylvania. His fascinating and heavy book analyzes the Maya from every angle. Although Sharer does not mention the Book of Mormon, he does give a devastating answer to those who would link Meso-American civilization with the ancient Hebrews, placing such theories squarely in the 19th century.Sharer writes: \\"After more than a century of gathering and analyzing archaeological evidence, we have discovered nothing to support the idea of intervention by people from the Old World.\\" \\"This is not to say that accidental contacts between the Old and New World peoples could not have occurred before the age of European exploration\\" (p. 6).\\"On the basis of the available evidence, then, the courses of cultural development in the New and Old Worlds seem clearly independent of each other and devoid of significant contact until 1492\\" (intro., p. 7).The ancient Maya civilization, Sharer continues, \\"are to be \`explained' not as a product of transplanted Old World civilization, but as the result of the processes that underlie the growth of any culture, including those that develop the kind of complexity we call civilization.\\"\\"The idea, which either explicitly or implicitly asserts that the peoples of the New World were incapable of shaping their own destiny or developing sophisticated cultures independently of Old World influence, is still popular in quarters.\\" \\"But this is but one more popular myth devoid of fact, for the evidence points unmistakably toward the evolution of civilization in the New World independently of developments in the Old World.\\"Lastly, every Mormon should read Robert Silverberg's book, \\"The Mound Builders: The Archaeology of a Myth.\\" This book provides the context for the novel called the \\"Book of Mormon.Mound BuildersAnother great book is Robert Wauchope's 150-page \\"Lost Tribes and Sunken Continents: Myth and Method in the Study of the American Indians.\\"Lost Tribes & Sunken Continents: Myth and Method in the Study of Ameri"},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"As a piece of literature or an expression of literary art, the Book of Mormon holds merit. If one were to encounter the Book of Mormon in its children's book form, it would be apparent that the stories are powerful and stimulating to the imagination. The problem lies in the overly exerted, drawn out, and repetitive tone of the actual Book of Mormon; with its artificially stilted, quasi-16th century styled English that is in no way consistent with the ordinary thought and speech patterns of the 19th century. Of course, the purpose of this review is not to add another critique of the perceived tastefulness of this book, because all such attempts are purely subjective. Due to the preceptive nature of this book, and the obligatory demands imposed on supplicant minds by the doctrines of and associated with this book, it is of greater necessity to place a deeper perspective of the Book of Mormon in real space and real time.Mormonism represents the final westward culmination of a religious system having its roots in the Near East. Catholicism was the Romanization (Europeanization) of Judaism, followed by the Church of England as the Anglonization of Catholicism. Puritanism was the colonialization of Anglicanism, and then Mormonism as the frontier westernization of Puritanism. All part of a collusive process to bring the memetic structure of Judeo-Zionism to the status of paradigmatic dominance.To write the \\"translator,\\" Joseph Smith off as an under-educated simpleton is a serious lack of thought given the deeper motives involved. The Mormon followers are right in saying that there is no way an uneducated farm boy from Vermont could have invented such a complex and elongated text buried in tons of intricacies that are the cornerstone of a modern institution - perhaps the wealthiest church on the planet. It is more accurate to assume that Smith was one of many Masonic agents (Agent Smith) narrating a manuscript which was to become the foundation of a church (political arm) that would help shape the West in the image designed by the forebearers of the industrial complex.The Book of Mormon cloaks an elite corporate-capitalist agenda which would have been taking form around the time of first publication. There was a book written by an H.V. Andersen called \\"The Book of Mormon and the Constitution\\" which elucidates all the political trappings of the Book of Mormon. Andersen, a general authority of the Church, believed that the United States of America, founded by righteous men raised up by God, came into existence for the very purpose of bringing forth the Book of Mormon \\"from out of the earth\\" to all nations, kindreds, and tongues. Andersen in his book, declares the Nephite nation a proto-capitalist system in the spirit of the John Birch Society. He then goes on to cite the movement of a secret combination (secret society) called the Gadianton Robbers, who parallel in doctrine today's communists, democratic socialists, and even plain critics of industrial exploitation. One thing leads to another and the righteous Nephite-Capitalists are lured by the seductive doctrines and priestcrafts of the Gadianton Robbers. Then, the Lord, having sent his prophets to warn the Nephites of their fornication with the teachings of the Gadianton Band, exacts punishment over the Nephite nation by \\"delivering them up into the hands of their enemies,\\" the Lamanites. This seems to be a ploy to scare adherents into total compliance with the economic desires of the plutocracy.What here becomes apparent from the relevant complexity of the book is that, Smith had sophisticated help. Although he lacked formal education, he may have had a talent for self erudition. It is within reason to believe that Smith was performing a vital function in a much grander scheme.A closer look reveals the Protestant Reformation along with other movements, were the beginnings of a more westward direction toward greater literalism in scriptural myth interpretation, detachment from nature, and unrelenting fragmentation of the human mind. This inevitably leads to a stripping bare of the original mysticisms and aesthetics of the world's older religions; a process which will aid in preparation for a society as described in Aldous Huxley's Brave New World. A left-brained world that would be devoid of poetic meaning, artistic depth, and inward spiritual contemplation.The Mormon Church, finishing what began more recently with the Calvanists, enacts the final move from esotericism to exotericism in religious and philosophical thought. Even more evidence of this comes when one observes how they have made the Trinity into three separate (fragmented) personages, two of whom are flesh and bone. Mormonism boasts a doctrine of eternal exaltation in which men can become gods of flesh and bone, thus compounding the obsession with flesh and matter. This is by far the most obvious in a series of anthropomorphic religions. Likewise, Mormonism began the trend of trivializing religious architecture by building fluorescent lit churches that look more like office buildings than places of spiritual gnosis; a trend that has been taken up by other Christian churches as well.At first, spiritual thought is monopolized, then literalized, and then drained depleted, left with nothing more than a dry, meaningless hull of songs, pageants, and shallow discourse that is then made to compete with pure spiritless atheism and economic materialism which will win out in the end, leaving nothing more than a feelingless population where each individual is a lonely cog in an intensified cycle of production and consumption.We have come a long way since the age of the shamans who had a more organic and cyclical view of creation. We have been made linear and inorganic, and have been taken from a synergistic relationship with the natural world to one that is fragmented. The advent of every new religion serves the purpose of matching the raw untamed spirituality of the innerbeing to the outer demands of political and economic conformity. The Book of Mormon, along with the Doctrine and Covenants, the Pearl of Great Price, and the King James Version of the Bible, acts as a substitute for real spirituality while subconsciously planting political memes in the minds of unsuspecting readers. Smith, a high initiate of the Masonic craft among others, carefully crafted the Book of Mormon to brace the new faith and ideology. The collective consciousness has been tampered with, organized religion has again taken its toll, and Mormonism is the fulfillment of this gospel."},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"Doubleday's Edition of The Book Of Mormon (ISBN: 038551316X)This new edition of the Book Of Mormon (BOM) has the revised and corrected text of the 1981 Standard Edition of the BOM, without the footnotes. It includes the front matter of the Title Page, the Introduction, Testimonies of Three and Eight Witnesses, plus the Prophet's Testimony from the Pearl of Great Price, and the Brief Explanation About The Book Of Mormon. So if you have a recent edition of the BOM, a triple, or a quad, you already have the information. The only difference is that there are no footnotes.This edition has several advantages over the Standard Edition (ISBN: 0967686555), which, by the way, can be gotten for free at http://www.mormon.org/freeoffers/0,17785,2071-1-1,00.html. With the footnotes gone, the book is far more readable. You do not have the little superscripts and the blocks of numbers at the bottom. Although it is still in double-columns, it is far easier on the eye, and therefore the mind. The chapter and verse numbers are there, but the absent footnotes make a difference.Since we have one standard edition, I find at times that my eye gets into grooves and habits. For example, as I hit the end of a column, my eye glosses over text. I miss words, ideas and concepts this way. By having another text, it compensates for being so visially oriented. I get the approved text, but with a variation of page placement.For readability, I always suggest the reprint of the 1830 First Edition (ISBN: 083090025X). Here, the text has only chapter division (which are longer than in the Standard Edition), and had no verse divisions. Within the chapters, the text divided into single-column paragraphs, as in a conventional book. It is easier to read, but there is no way to stud from this text. Furthermore, the text was not revises and correct. Although this is not a problem-most of the alleged 4,000 changes are mere punctuation and prose-style-it is always best to stick with the most current revelation.The book also has two more subtle features. First, the dates of events are included in the chapter headings, which has been done for several; years now with foreign language editions. Secondly, there is a selective Reference Guide at the back, after the pronunciation guide. It begins with reference to Christ and His mission, People, Doctrines, and Places and Events. It is by no means an adequate index or Topical Guide. However, it does the job for someone new to The Book Of Mormon.Another difference is the binding, page size and page with. The Church of Jesus Christ has been trying to get the BOM in a cheap format, so that price would not preclude anyone from owning a copy. This edition seem more like a conventional book, with thicker paper, easy-read font, and a cover that appropriately meshes with the contents of the book.This book is beautiful, and is not as flashy as Deseret's Heirloom Edition, or Covenant's Heritage Edition of the BOM. It would work well for a non-member, without overwhelming them. I also thinking it would be god for personal study. Not having footnotes forces you to focus on the immediate text and flow of the message, logic, and doctrine.Kendal Brian HunterAuthor \\"Consider My Servant Job\\" (SIBN: 1555177522)"},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"I was 'given' this book by two missionaries of the Mormon Church a few weeks ago. They asked me to read and study various chapters but I read the entire book instead. Having read many religious books over the past 10+ years I can honestly say that the Book of Mormon is nothing to get excited about. Essentially, it is a watered down version of the King James version of the Holy Bible with different, but similar, personal experiences occuring throughout the entire volume.It seems to me as though the author, Joseph Smith, attempted to write in the style and manner of the Holy Bible. There is noting contained in the Book of Mormon that will lead any person closer to God than is available on the market today.Sadly, I did not have a life changing experience that I was promised by the young missionaries and will continue to search for the true meaning of life the best I can.For a poorly written book that has plagarized the Bible, this Book of Mormon deserves 2 stars.

This would include comprehensive research of all available data, such as consumer report magazines before making our selection. We make our final selection based on the facts we have obtained through our study and analysis of all available evidence. How many of us make prayer to God as part of the selection or purchasing process? Why don't we? Because we put more faith in objective findings of fact, right?I believe the same logical process of critical thinking and analysis of the findings of fact should apply in our selection of books to read and more importantly how to judge the claims made in this or any other book.If we exclude critical thinking, including analysis of the findings of fact and simply apply prayer, and faith based reasoning, then any conclusions we reach will most likely be faulty.I would encourage anyone wishing to obtain and read the Book of Mormon to use the same critical analysis of all the findings fact, before making their final decision.Two other books I highly recommend for important background information on sources of the Book of Mormon are: 'An Insider's View of Mormon Origins' by Grant H. Palmer. Mr. Palmer LDS Church member and retired Mormon church educator, was recently disfellowshipped by the Mormon Church for research and findings of fact which conflicted with accepted LDS Church teachings on Joseph Smith and the origin of the Book of Mormon. The second book I would recommend would be 'Losing a Lost Tribe, Native Americans, DNA and the Mormon Church' by Simon Southerton. Southerton is a former Mormon Church Bishop. Southerton's book provides DNA analysis that contrary to Joseph Smith's teachings Native American's,(Indians), are not of Jewish descent, but Asian,(Siberian).Most of the reviews endorsing the Book of Mormon here are insisting we ignore the critical thinking process and analysis of the findings of fact, and simply rely on prayer, and faith based reasoning."},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"Nothing sarastic about this title.

No historical, anthropological, linguistic, or genomic data corroborates the Book of Mormon's fantastic claims of a pre-Colombian civilization of Jewish ancestry in North America that fought with steel swords, died in the millions, herded cattle and elephants, practiced monotheism, and toted around gold plates on which to write their history.Debunking the lies I was taught in my youth has been the most liberating experience of my life.The mormon missionaries distribute the Book of Mormon for free.

Each time it reaffirms my belief that Jesus Christ is real, and that He loves all of us, not just those He ministered to in the Middle East.The Book of Mormon has had detractors for about 175 years. It will continue to have detractors. It won't stop the book from touching the hearts of those who are seek the truth."},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"If you have any interest in this book just go to any Marriott hotel and get a free copy from the drawer (this is a very wealthy and secretive cult--they don't need your money.)

It is a record of God's dealings with the ancient inhabitants of the Americas and contains, as does the Bible, the fulness of the everlasting gospel.The book was written by many ancient prophets by the spirit of prophecy and revelation. Their words, written on gold plates, were quoted and abridged by a prophet-historian named Mormon. The record gives an account of two great civilizations. One came from Jerusalem in 600 B.C., and afterward separated into two nations, known as the Nephites and the Lamanites. The other came much earlier when the Lord confounded the tongues at the Tower of Babel. This group is known as the Jaredites. After thousands of years, all were destroyed except the Lamanites, and they are the principal ancestors of the American Indians.The crowning event recorded in the Book of Mormon is the personal ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ among the Nephites soon after his resurrection. It puts forth the doctrines of the gospel, outlines the plan of salvation, and tells men what they must do to gain peace in this life and eternal salvation in the life to come.After Mormon completed his writings, he delivered the account to his son Moroni, who added a few words of his own and hid up the plates in the hill Cumorah. On September 21, 1823, the same Moroni, then a glorified, resurrected being, appeared to the Prophet Joseph Smith and instructed him relative to the ancient record and its destined translation into the English language.In due course the plates were delivered to Joseph Smith, who translated them by the gift and power of God. The record is now published in many languages as a new and additional witness that Jesus Christ is the Son of the living God and that all who will come unto him and obey the laws and ordinances of his gospel may be saved.Concerning this record the Prophet Joseph Smith said: \\"I told the brethren that the Book of Mormon was the most correct of any book on earth, and the keystone of our religion, and a man would get nearer to God by abiding by its precepts, than by any other book.\\"In addition to Joseph Smith, the Lord provided for eleven others to see the gold plates for themselves and to be special witnesses of the truth and divinity of the Book of Mormon. Their written testimonies are included herewith [in the book] as \\"The Testimony of Three Witnesses\\" and \\"The Testimony of Eight Witnesses\\".We [the leaders and members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints] invite all men everywhere to read the Book of Mormon, to ponder in their hearts the message it contains, and then to ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ if the book is true. Those who pursue this course and ask in faith will gain a testimony of its truth and divinity by the power of the Holy Ghost. (See Moroni 10:3-5)Those who gain this divine witness from the Holy Spirit will also come to know by the same power that Jesus Christ is the Savior of the world, that Joseph Smith is his revelator and prophet in these last days, and that The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is the Lord's kingdom once again established on the earth, preparatory to the second coming of the Messiah.I personally testify that I have come to know that the Book of Mormon is divinely inspired scripture, just as much as I know that Jesus is the Christ, and I wholeheartedly recommend that everyone read this book for themselves. Don't rely upon the testimony of other people. Read it for yourself."},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"(From Paragraph 67) Christian faith cannot accept 'revelations' that claim to surpass or correct the Revelation of which Christ is the fulfilment, as is the case in certain non-Christian religions and also in certain recent sects which base themselves on such 'revelations'.(Paragraph 73) God has revealed himself fully by sending his own Son, in whom he has established his covenant for ever.

It was written by a man in New York City who asked that it be published by a local publishing company. When the editor/publisher took a look at it he said, \\"This is garbage and I will not publish it!\\" It was left in the corner of the publishing building. One year later the company closed down. Joseph Smith purchased the company and found the book sitting in the corner under a pile of dust. He then read it and thought it was a great read. Thus, the book of Mormon was born. Joseph Smith was a corrupt man and therefore right away anything he ever said or supposively wrote should be taken into serious consideration as a lie. Anything written by a man today who claims to have visions or visitations from angels has obviously consulted with demons and portrays to us that he is holier than we are. Friends, this is how cults get started. The only recommendation I can give for The Book Of Mormon is to read it and study it so you can teach Mormons how wrong they are and to rid the world of such heresy! Sure, lots of what is in the book or has been added by Joseph Smith has been taken from the Holy Bible. But so what? It's only a gimmick to attract those wandering people who are in search for something \\"godly.\\" Don't be fooled! Amen! P.S.

If you have a sincere heart and a contrite spirit, and get down on your knees and pray to ask God if what you have read is true, HE will make it known to you! Ask anyone of these reviewers that gave this book 1 star, why they did, and they will give you some excuse...but it really comes down to the fact that they are angry at God. One example is the guy who said we condone divorce. I assure you we don't. We encourage people to work out their problems and then to get out of the relationship if nothing else will work. Don't you do the same for your friends? It is no doubt in my mind the guy in this example went one way and his wife went another. She had a support system of the Church, and he didn't, and thus he blames the Church instead of looking at himself. I feel sorry for all of you angry people out there.

I know with all the fiber in my bean, that the Book of Marmon is bad fiction written by as B.H. Roberts asserted, \\"an immature mind.\\" Yes, I post boldly and with the spirit of reason to you today, that this book has changed the lives of many people. For this book has inspired people to believe that because they are \\"white and delightsome\\", that they are a chosen and peculiar people. This book solemnly affirms that God regularly punishes the wicked and the unbeliever with dark skin.This book also inspired acts of violence in the name of the lord. Just as Nephi understood, that \\"better one man should perish, than an entire nation dwindle in unbelief\\", many other Mormons have taken the matter into their own hands. From the second biggest religious terrorist attack in our nation's history at Mountain Meadows, to the killing of perceived apostates by Porter Rockwell, Bill Hickman, Hosea Stout, and Dan Lafferty, this book has stood as the inspirational anthem of blood atonement.Yes, I testify that this book has inspired many people to better themselves. A common theme in this book is that God blesses the righteous with economic prosperity, but then punishes them with economic hardship when they turn away from the Lord. It makes me feel so superior to know that the less fortunate should have been more valiant in the pre-existence. .I will bear witness to you that the Book of Marmon has been found to help many people who suffer with the heartbreak and fatigue of insomnia. Even the great author Mark Twain realized the medical value of this book when he called it \\"chloroform in print.\\" 2 Nephi by itself has given hope to those suffering from this crippling sleeping disorder. This is the reason for the two star rating.I also testify, that this book testifies of Jesus Christ. In this book, those who rejected his glad message were destroyed in earthquakes, floods and other disasters. You think Jesus was pissed at the moneychangers in the temple? Check out his wrath in 3 Nephi. Reminds me of an old primary song \\"Jesus wants me for a Sunbeam\\" but my version would go \\"Jesus killed me in an earthQUAKE, because I wasn't good....\\" Yes this Jesus fellow sure made an entrance. The message is, \\"believe in me, or I'll show you who's boss.Let me say in closing, that I know without a shadow of a doubt, that Joseph Smith wrote this book.

You can take some reassurance in this because powerful and sacred truths by their very nature draw both strong support and opposition.Christ's life is a wonderful example of this. He either is the Son of God or He is a raving lunatic. He really performed miracles or He was involved in some of the most remarkable deceit ever performed. This explains why so many revered (and still revere) Him as the Son of God (which He is) while numerous others wanted to murder Him. Those that knew he was indeed the Son of God (and even those who know now) have not had it revealed to them by \\"flesh and blood\\" (or in a debate forum) but by the \\"Father which is in heaven.\\" (Matt 16:17)In a similar fashion, The Book of Mormon, a strong witness of His Divinity, has people that love and others that think they despise it. Ultimately the truth regarding this matter, as with a testimony of Christ, is not going to be revealed to you via \\"flesh and blood.\\" Rather, the answer is going to come through the power of the Holy Ghost from our \\"Father which is in heaven\\" as you pray to Him about the matter in Christ's name after having studied and pondered the Book with a willingness to follow Christ (as outlined in \\"Moroni's promise,\\" Moroni 10:3-5).

Critics never will learn and build but find fault and tear down...."},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"If I never see the words &quot;great and abominable&quot; again, it will be none too soon."},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"Unsupported, contradtroy, please don't waste your money.

I had just finished reading the Bible (which I couldn't put down...a must read for all theologians out there) and I expected this to pick up right where the Bible ended and go into Armageddon and all the end of the world stuff. But all I got was this story of some people who sailed across the ocean and settled in a New World. In this New World (which we are suppose to believe is America) they have many wars with steel swords (which couldn't have happened since steel didn't exist back then) and rode horses (again horses were brought to America buy the Europeans in the 1500's). Besides all these plot holes it reads real weird with all the \\"It came to past's\\" and \\"Exceedingly so's\\" It also gets real boring, It put me to sleep many times. Even toward the end with the promise it gives about 'praying and discovering the truth for your self.' Well I prayed for I don't know how long, and never really got anything back. I don't know maybe this means I'm not righteous enough.

Yes, I am a Mormon and just had to laugh, my Father is not a member of my church but my mother is I have had the choice all my life of membership in this church, and at no time growing up was I ever involved in anything without first asking my father. It is tragic when divorces happen but I believe they happen in all religions. I have the right to believe this book to be true or false, but before any review can mean anything, we should judge for ourselves.Unless I am mistaken, Mark Twain wrote Fiction. Now I am a student in college I study Anthropology, and I know that there are many languages, many have been forgotten. However, I wonder could we call Spanish, French, Italian, or Portuguese reformed Latin. No matter what you do language changes over time. I am also sorry to inform you that we do not believe we were born on the planet Kolob, remember scriptures speak symbolically. Mormons do teach about it. I would answer any questions anyone has my email address is Scottishknight19@hotmail.comTo conclude we believe that if we desire to do what is right and work towards that to the best of our abilities we may obtain that alone if it must be. There are many misconceptions out there and as far as those White shirted bicycle riders, it is not their place to come into your house and argue. If you want to argue find a neighbor or co-worker and if they are a good \\"Mormon\\" they will tell you without arguing.

Right. Many are a lot of former members of the Mormon church who still can't leave it alone after leaving it. In fact there is a large group of ex-mormons who are purposely writing in one-star ratings to try and get the \\"Average Customer Review\\" down as low as possible.I am still an active Mormon, so guess what kind of rating I'm going to give it.......... Right.The Book of Mormon is not meant to be a literary work of art, nor was it meant to primarily be a history of the Ancient inhabitants of America. It is a book of scripture, describing the doctrines and practices of a Christian religion much like the Bible. It stands with the Bible as a second witness for the life of Jesus Christ and His teachings.Despite all the negative comments the Book and its teachings have changed the lives of millions of people for the better; helping them understand who they are, why they are on this earth, and what will happen to them in the next life.

I would sugest to every one that decides to read the book, to investigate after they read it. check online and also called the missionaries and ask them about your doubts and questions. Ask them about the CURSE of CAIN, ask them about the secret handshakes and tokens in the temple, ask them if they feel they better than you, invite them to your house and feed them with the truth and the real history of the church.

Trust me the book is a lie and I can give many things that would prove that it is a lie, but not in this review. To the coverts, I belong to a yahoo group for ex mormon women. Many ex converts on that website. Why? Because very soon you will see the truth for yourself. AND women in the church are nothing more than a baby factory and a servant to their husbands. Mormon men do not let their women have an opinion. Anger is a suppressed emotion in the mormon church as well. It's ok to get angry every now and then. In fact it's not healthy to bottle up the anger. Watch the anger and hurt when a family member cant attend thier own other family member get married in the Temple because the church said that they were not \\"Temple Worthy\\" In other words dont pay their tithing. Non members cant go into the temple either to watch a friend or family member get married. Ask the older generation of Mormons about the Mountain Meadows Massacre on September 11, 1857 There there was a movie called \\"September Dawn\\" that came out last month about it, but I knew about this many years ago. The founder, Joseph Smith, was a con man and was well known in his youth to tell some tall tales. He was even accused of stealing documents from a professor in which he changed the names, etc and that is what the Book of Mormon are about. FACT: Joseph Smith changed his story about seeing God the Father, Jesus, and the Holy Ghost several times. The first story was he saw an angel, then it was just God, then he changed the age he saw them, and many other variable stories. If I saw God I would remember in detail without changing my story so many times. The church finally had to decide on which version of the story to keep. Historical Fact: The mormons didn't let black men hold the priesthood until 1978. They stated before that year that the blacks were cursed and marked black because of Cain and would not reach the \\"Celestial Kingdom\\" anyways. The all of the sudden the \\"Prophet\\" Kimball suddenly had a vision to let the blacks hold a priesthood. How convienent when you look at the year and what was going on. Mormons think they are Christians but they do not celebrate all the traditional christian holidays and believe that the Mormon church is the only true church and all others are an abomomination and doomed to hell."},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"Let it be known unto all those who read this review, that I am Moroni.

Some of the most serious readers have stopped in their attempt because of it's complexity, and some have simply touched the pages one-by-one to know it is a book inspired by G-d.My humble suggestion is to purchase the more expensive Grant Hardy edition that is on sale here at Amazon because it can help you to understand the Book of Mormon better.

You can learn a lot about human nature from studying their history and perhaps learn to be wiser than they.

Unless of course you'd like a novel.I can say however, I am disappointed in some of the reviews I have read. As with anything, particularly books of faith, one truly needs to DESIRE the knowledge to understand it.You need to WANT to read the book. Not simply read it hoping to be given this wealth of knowledge that will not make you all powerful and all knowing, when it comes to the LDS faith.If you go into your journey of reading this book, with a blackened heart, with serious doubt and not an inkling of faith or hope that the words you are about to read will in some way help you, it's very likely you'll remain that way even after completing the book. Or worse yet, you'll feel even more horrible.Those who are adamently against The LDS Church, will likely find anything possible to complain about this book, no matter it's significance. If you truly wish to be given knowledge of the LDS faith, are truly interested in the teachings and have faith that this book will shed some light on questions you may or may not know you ever had, READ THIS BOOK!!If need be, find yourself a free copy somewhere, if money issues keep you from purchasing this.

He loves us and wants us to return to Him.We believe Jesus Christ is the Son of God. He is our Savior. He redeems us from death by providing the Resurrection. He saves us from sin as we repent.Through the Atonement of Jesus Christ, we can return to live with God if we keep His commandments.We believe the Holy Ghost helps us to recognize truth. Through reading the Book of Mormon you can call upon the Spirit of God to ask Him if what you are reading is true scripture and came from Him.We believe the first principles and ordinances of the gospel are faith in Jesus Christ, repentance, baptism, and receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost.You too can know that the Church of Jesus Christ has been restored to the earth in it's fullness just as it was in the times of Jesus Christ. By prayerfully reading this scripture you can get the answers you are looking for in life.The priesthood authority of God exists in His Church today, just as it did in the original Church of Jesus Christ during the New Testament times..Through reading the Book of Mormon you will find the Bible and the Book of Mormon are the word of God.God has not stopped talking to us as a people.Have you ever wondered why God talked to his Prophets in the Bible but why is did he stop revealing his word to us? Because He never did stop talking to us. God still reveals His will to prophets today, just as He did anciently.Your life has a sacred purpose here on earth and has meaning.Your family can be together forever.There seems to be so many people who have jumped to review this book- The Book of Mormon which was translated by Joseph Smith........ not written by him as a fictional book. How many other books have you read reviews on this website that have gotten so many hostile reviews? Why do so many DO NOT want you to really read this book? I'll tell you why because they are afraid. Just like the jews were afraid of Jesus in His time. Jesus in His day was a controversial leader when you think about it, and many people did not want to accept Him. His church and teachings was a different way of life, then living the Law of Moses, as the Jews had been living up till that point. Jesus Christ fulfilled the Law of Moses and established His church on the earth.This book is another Testament of Jesus Christ.This sacred book was written for our day. God has not stopped talking to his people and saved this scripture to be read in the Last Days.....our times in the world right now are so turbulent. Look in the news and it is everywhere the morally corrupt, the wars, the greed and the blood thirst show in almost every aspect. This book of scripture was written for our time to be able to Stand with God as a witness at this last day of His Son Jesus Christ. I would exhort you to read this book and let it touch your heart and fill your soul with His love. I am member of the LDS Church and have read this book of scripture many times. It is truly inspiring and you will feel the Spirit of God when you read it.If you will read it and ask God for an answer whether this book is true and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints is true you will get an answer .The words in this book came from God and his Prophets. If you have any questions about this book I would go to someone whether it is a friend or an acquaintance of the LDS church. It always puzzles me how people will turn to people for answers who aren't a member of the church and they don't have the correct information about the Book of Mormon or our beliefs .If you were going to find out the beliefs of the Catholic church would you go to a Baptist to find out about it? No, I think you wouldn't, but to someone who believes in that Church. Do the same here and find the answers from those who really know and believe in this Church and the Book of Mormon.You can also find answers to questions you may have on the church's website at www.lds.orgGood luck to you in your quest in finding the truth as it will be the most important thing you will do in your life."},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"The concept behind this book is interesting, whatever else may be said of the religion for which it is sacred literature. Is it colorful fiction? Divine revelation? Was it penned (as my one-time neighbor solemnly cautioned me) by a deceptive fiend straight out of Hell? I have no idea. I found the Book of Mormon remarkably readable and light compared to most liturgical tomes and was impressed a time or two by its quality, if not by its claims.

However, the more I look into it, the more I find of value. It has withstood the test of time. Since my first reading, I have continued my education, and received degrees in a variety of fields including literature/humanities, sciences (astronomy, physiology), social sciences (clinical psychology), and have taught in universities. I have read a countless number of books, and written about 20.I have grown to love this book because of the truths contained therein. The words of King Benjamin are especially inspiring along with the words, and experiences of Alma, Enoch, and Moroni, among others.This book consists of the records of the pre-Columbian people of the Americas and their parallel experiences (parallel to the people whose records are contained in the Old and New Testaments of the Bible) with prophets, wars, contentions, pride, and the coming of the Saviour to teach His gospel of peace.There are ugly events, as some have written, certainly, and that is true of life, for as far back as our histories record. But there are also inspirational truths that touch the soul.I have found that my life has been so much better, for having learned from the teachings of Christ, in this book, that I shudder to imagine my life without having read it. Some, who give a negative review, actually, many, while they are entitled to do such, apparently haven't read the book. I find their posts full of errors. For instance, one writes that the best part is when Christ appears in the end. While it was good of the reviewer to share his favorite part, those who have read the book will wonder how it is possible that he thinks that the book ends with the appearance of the Saviour!There are many others that indicate a lack of knowledge of the book, even when the reviewer starts out by stating that he or she has read it many times. I must discount all reviews that include lies and it is obvious when someone writes a detail about the book that is obviously not factual to those who actually HAVE read the book.This is a book about the Saviour and Redeemer of mankind. It is about His teachings, and His example to us. It is full of what we need to know to be happy in this life and the next, to be good, honest people, to love one another. It is about repentence and the atonement. It is about repenting and aligning our lives to be more Christ-like.It is about having no more disposition to do evil. It's about sacrifice, and obedience to God.Whenever I feel like something is missing in my life or that I may be focusing a bit too much on the wrong things, such as career advancement (as opposed to further development of my talents), or material things (status), or even gossip, or spending too much time on trivial of silly things, I turn to the Book of Mormon, and it is like drinking from pure, clean waters that nourish and restore me.My life is good. I have a wonderful career as a writer. I have a wonderful, smart and loving spouse. My children and I have exceptional relationships. I am so blessed. This book, and the Old and New Testaments, together, keep me on track.I love the Bible, I read it regularly. The Book of Mormon is aligned with the words of the Bible, and is yet another testimony of Christ and His gospel.It is herein that I find meaning and significance. And for that I am most grateful."},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"I hope that people considering reading this book will disregard what seems to be out right mormon haters posting here.How will anyone know unless they read for themselves.If you are curious, why not?

It is a very beautifully written book and is written like an intricately woven tapestry. There are many levels of understanding that can be found within the Book of Mormon. The stories that are related therein are written very much as the parables of Christ that are related in the New Testament--they can be taken on a literal or spiritual level, depending on how you look at them.I have read the Book of Mormon focusing on the spiritual aspects found in the stories. I have read it purely for a geneological view of the history of the people who wrote it. I have read it as a literal story of the history of a people. On all levels it is interesting.If you want it to, the book can change your life. If you don't, then it will be just an interesting read and you can put it on your bookshelf to collect dust.The only reason to buy the book, as opposed to getting a free copy, is because it looks prettier than the free version.

Just because they believe something different from some of us doesn't make them bad. I have read pretty much all the LDS books and they are pretty harmless. Christians have no reason to 'hate' Mormons. They believe many of the same things we do and their dedication to family and community is admirable.Now sure they believe Jesus came to the Americas and that the lost tribe of Israel settled here and built a giant empire with vast cities. People point out that none of this has been found. So what? If you have faith you don't need proof. And what harm is there if it isn't true? As long as they are doing good works, I don't think God cares about the little details. In fact for centuries many in England believed that Jesus appeared there. And the myths about the lost tribe of Israel coming to the Americas existed long before the LDS (heck, there are so many places that claim the Lost Tribe came there I am beginning to wonder how those fellas made all them trips!).And don't believe all that hogwash about polygamy. The Mormon's abandoned that years ago in order to join the Union. Only a few holdouts that aren't part of the main Mormon Church still do that.So rather than reject the Mormons, Christians should show them the same love they show to Muslims, Jews, Hindus and Pagans. We do not hate those who think differently, we merely gently espouse our gospel and let the Holy Spirit lead them where it may.I encourage you to read this book if you are curious what the Mormon's believe. Just like reading the Koran is a good way to learn about Muslims. By understanding different faiths, we can be better Christians."},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"If you have ever seen or heard anything about the The \\"Mormon\\" Church or The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and wanted to know more about what we believe, here is a no pressure way to learn. The Book of Mormon contains the word of God to His children. Specifically, the words of ancient American prophets recorded for us in our day. The Book of Mormon witnesses of Jesus Christ, the Savior and Redeemer of the world. As all good books should, this book will teach you and uplift you each time you read from its pages.

I read the book expecting a good piece of well written fiction but instead I found plagarized portions of the bible. The storyline was incredibly violent and poorly written. If you are reading it for literary enjoyment I'd suggest you don't waste your time. If you're reading it as a book with which to gain great insights and wisdom I would also suggest you don't waste your time. I found nothing of great value in it. I've found more profound wisdom reading graffiti on the bathroom wall. There was nothing remarkable that held my attention. It's a sleeper. One's time and money is valuable and there are far better books with which to spend both on.Perhaps more fascinating than the book is the fact that the Mormon people honestly believe this book is actual scripture, that it is not fiction, but an actual documentary account of people who lived on the American continent. The problem is that no 3rd party historians or archeologists can find any trace of authenticity to support such claims. The only truly fascinating thing is when one realizes that large numbers of people do not view it as fiction but instead view it as the most perfect book ever written.The worst part is the end wherein a character named Moroni promises the reader that if they will pray about it God will tell them it is a true book. Mormon Church members believe this verse and use it as a missionary tool with which to convert people to believe the book is not fiction but actual fact. I took the \\"moroni's challenge\\" as they call it and prayed with all the sincerety I could possibly muster. I did not get any kind of inspiration or insight that this book was true. In fact I got a strong impression that it wasn't true. If you don't agree that the book is true, the Mormon members claim you aren't righteous and that there is something wrong with you as is evident by one of the reviews written here by the name of \\"notlostanymore t-rev from Marysville California\\". His review completely verifies my above statement. It has very psychologically unhealthy/cultish underpinnings. They believe there is something wrong with people who do not accept the book is a true, factual documentary.If you are curious about the book I suggest you read it but do not allow the mormons to answer questions person to person. If you become curious I would suggest you use the anonymity of internet forums with which to ask questions so no personal contact will be made. They will try to convince you that it is not just a book but is holy scripture that must be adhered to and if you end up believing that pitch you will be living your own very real, non-fictional horror story. You will be bombarded by the strong manipulation tactics displayed by the reviewer \\"notlostanymore t-rev\\" and every other mormon member who is just like him and this can be very damaging to one's psyche and lifestyle.You see, it's not just a book - it's advertised as a religion and I recommend you treat it as such.-------------------------------------------Reviewer: notlostanymore \\"t-rev\\" (marysville, ca)For anyone who has ever read the Book of Mormon, they know it is true. I know it is true because I asked God myself. All you have to do is the same. If you have a sincere heart and a contrite spirit, and get down on your knees and pray to ask God if what you have read is true, HE will make it known to you! Ask anyone of these reviewers that gave this book 1 star, why they did, and they will give you some excuse...but it really comes down to the fact that they are angry at God. One example is the guy who said we condone divorce. I assure you we don't. We encourage people to work out their problems and then to get out of the relationship if nothing else will work. Don't you do the same for your friends? It is no doubt in my mind the guy in this example went one way and his wife went another. She had a support system of the Church, and he didn't, and thus he blames the Church instead of looking at himself. I feel sorry for all of you angry people out there. Open your hearts up to God and HE will make everything ok again. All you have to do is ASK! Buy it!"},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"I was recently at my grandmother's house and saw a copy of the Book of Mormon respectfully sitting on a bookshelf. On the inside front cover was a personal, handwritten message stating with absolute knowledge and certainty that the Book of Mormon was in fact an accurate history of ancient American civilizations, and that reading this divine book would surly change the life of the reader. The person who wrote the message was me. I wrote it 20 years ago as a pious 15-year old boy who was attempting to convert my non-Mormon grandmother to the Mormon religion. The curious thing about it is that when I wrote that message, I hadn't even read the book.6 months after I wrote those certain words, I finally read the book for the first time. I was being taught that the Book of Mormon was food for my soul, and I obediently got into the habit of reading a chapter of it every single day before going to sleep. Many chapters were boring and reading them was an exercise in self-discipline. Other chapters were mediocre, but I would search for meaning and inspiration and using my creativity, would often find it. A few chapters are in fact quite interesting and even inspiring.Ironically enough, my habit of reading at least a chapter of the Book of Mormon every day ended when I was a Mormon missionary. By the middle of my mission I had read the book about 10 times and despite my best efforts, reading it became an unendurable chore. I tried several times to resume the ritual of \\"feeding my soul,\\" but I just couldn't do it. The book became boring to be sure. But it wasn't plain boredom that paralyzed me: it was the cognitive dissonance that I suffered: when I actually engaged myself in the book, I was looking squarely at the fact that what I \\"knew\\" was accurate history and God's uncorrupted teachings was plainly and patently implausible and uninspiring.It is hard to talk about the merits of the Book of Mormon without digressing to the merits of the Mormon religion. But that is what I'll try to do. What makes a book a good book? I would say a book is a good book if it is entertaining, interesting, thought provoking, educational, or stimulating. It is an outstanding book if it somehow expands your mind or soul.If I had approached the Book of Mormon with an open mind rather than with an a priori certainty that it was accurate history my review would be different. Perhaps I could say that it was interesting and thought provoking. At least some parts of it. But reading it over and over again with fanatical dedication stunted the growth of my mind and soul and was anything but a pleasant activity. Because of that, I can't give it more than a single star.But of course that is just one man's opinion. Go ahead and read it if you feel inclined to do so. But be forewarned: if you read it, don't like it, and have the audacity to write a review about it, you will most likely be accused of being a bitter, angry, mean-spirited person who has a bone to pick with the Mormon Church."},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"This book is all made up by Joseph Smith, if you read it you will see that it can't be a true story about Jesus coming to America. It is full of things that were not here during the time the book was supposed to have taken place, Like wheeled carts, horses, cattle, elephants. There is no evidence in North or South America of the people who are in the Book of Mormon.it is a very boring book and will put you to sleep.

I have read the Book of Mormon many times and prayed about it. I know it is the Word of God without a doubt. How can I know you ask? It's really quite simple.The Book of Mormon is a companion volume to the Bible. The Bible gives us the religious history in the \\"old world\\". The Book of Mormon gives us the religious history of the America's. The Bible refers to \\"the Spirit of truth\\" which shall \\"testify of me\\", me being of course Jesus Christ (see John 15:26).The Book of Mormon expands on this and tells us how to have \\"the Spirit of truth\\" testify to us conerning truth. It says if you Read it (whether it be the Book of Mormon or the Bible, or anything for that matter), Ponder it (give thought to it, think about it), then Pray about it asking the Father in the name of Christ if it is true, with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Jesus Christ; he WILL manifest the truth of it unto you by \\"the Spirit of truth\\". You can see this promise in Moroni 10:3-5 which is the last book in the Book of Mormon.This is how I know the Book of Mormon is the word of God.Is it easy reading? Not necessarily, but then again, the Bible isn't either. I think the Lord intends it this way so we'll have to study and work hard for understanding. For doing so will only help us.I strive each day to live it's teachings as well as the Bible's. I am a better person because of it. It helps me to strive to become an even better person each day.

Blessed be the name of God for bringing us this inspired account of an ancient people.Speaking of the time when this book should come forth out of obscurity one of the ancient prophets of the Book of Mormon writes:And behold, their prayers were also in behalf of him that the Lord should suffer to bring these things forth. And no one need say they shall not come, for they surely shall, for the Lord hath spoken it; for out of the earth shall they come, by the hand of the Lord, and none can stay it; and it shall come in a day when it shall be said that bmiracles are done away; and it shall come even as if one should speak from the dead... Yea, it shall come in a day when the power of God shall be denied, and churches become defiled and be lifted up in the pride of their hearts; yea, even in a day when leaders of churches and teachers shall rise in the pride of their hearts, even to the envying of them who belong to their churches... Yea, it shall come in a day when there shall be great pollutions upon the face of the earth; there shall be murders, and robbing, and lying, and deceivings, and whoredoms, and all manner of abominations; when there shall be many who will say, Do this, or do that, and it mattereth not, for the Lord will uphold such at the last day. But wo unto such, for they are in the gall of bitterness and in the bonds of iniquity. Yea, it shall come in a day when there shall be churches built up that shall say: Come unto me, and for your money you shall be forgiven of your sins. O ye wicked and perverse and stiffnecked people, why have ye built up churches unto yourselves to get gain? Why have ye transfigured the holy word of God, that ye might bring damnation upon your souls? Behold, look ye unto the revelations of God; for behold, the time cometh at that day when all these things must be fulfilled. Behold, the Lord hath shown unto me great and marvelous things concerning that which must shortly come, at that day when these things shall come forth among you. Behold, I speak unto you as if ye were present, and yet ye are not. But behold, Jesus Christ hath shown you unto me, and I know your doing. And I know that ye do awalk in the pride of your hearts; and there are none save a few only who do not lift themselves up in the pride of their hearts, unto the wearing of very fine apparel, unto envying, and strifes, and malice, and persecutions, and all manner of iniquities; and your churches, yea, even every one, have become polluted because of the pride of your hearts. For behold, ye do love money, and your substance, and your fine apparel, and the adorning of your churches, more than ye love the poor and the needy, the sick and the afflicted. O ye pollutions, ye hypocrites, ye teachers, who sell yourselves for that which will canker, why have ye polluted the holy church of God? Why are ye ashamed to take upon you the name of Christ? Why do ye not think that greater is the value of an endless happiness than that misery which never dies-because of the praise of the world?

A biased person will take it like the Grinch in Dr. Seuss's \\"Grinch Who Stole Christmas\\" did Christmas.As a young man, I was told by my parents that I should choose my friends wisely, as they would have a great impact on my morals and the choices I would make in life. While most of my friends are not books, I count this book and the men who wrote it my friends, heroes, and spiritual Hercules. Spiritual, yet down to Earth.If you never read another book in your life [...], I propose that you read this book. Make up your own mind, or don't, it's up to you.MY ONLY COMPLAINT is that the book can so easily be obtained for free. While butter and honey should be free by Isaiah and John the Baptists' utopian expectation, I think the low price may lead people to take this book for granted. \\"HO, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters, and he that hath no money; come ye, buy, and eat; yea, come, buy wine and milk without money and without price.\\" (Isaiah 55:1)Finally, for all who in this fast food and instant entertainment world are too lazy or reserved to ask for, read, analyze, and pray about a 531 page book, the main message of the book as spoken by Jesus Christ is as follows:Third Nephi 9: 14 - \\"Yea, verily I say unto you, if ye will come unto me ye shall have eternal life. Behold, mine arm of mercy is extended towards you, and whosoever will come, him will I receive; and blessed are those who come unto me.\\"Take a chance on this book. You cannot lose (I haven't after 49 1/2 attempts!), and you may actually find yourself smarter and happier and closer to God for having read it."},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"This book can change your life for the better. It has mine.I have read the Book of Mormon many times. When I first read it, without pondering it carefully, and without praying, it didn't do much for me.But once I started reading the book for understanding, and really wanting to find out if it was true, and praying to our Heavenly Father in the name of his Son, Jesus Christ, to know if this book was indeed divinely inspired, I got my answer from God.I know that this is a true book. It is filled with many wonderful truths that shed light on the most important questions that people need to know in this life. It uplifts me in spirit. It helps me in my day-to-day life.I know that Joseph Smith, the man who translated this book by the gift and power of God, was a prophet called by God. Many people say differently. Go to the Source. Go to Him who is your Father in Heaven, and ask him sincerely if this book (once you've read it) is true and if Joseph was a prophet.

Doubleday has laid out this edition in an easy-to-read format with fairly large text.I first read the Book of Mormon as a teenager. Thirty years later, I find the book just as compelling and inspirational as when I first read it. There will be naysayers and those who denigrate the book without really even reading it just to get in a dig at a religion they might not understand or might not like, and I admit to having once been in those ranks -- until I actually picked up the book and read it myself.They always say not to judge a book by its cover and in turn, I say not to judge this book by anyone else's biased opinion -- including mine. :) I would say to ignore all these reviews, both pro & con, and pick up the book and read it yourself -- that's the only way to know for sure if the contents are to your liking.

It's very well written, and it is also and interesting read.What I did enjoy about the book is that there is a real enthusiasm in it, the book just seems excited. It is also very well structured and consistent.Now, one review for this book on this site was by a \\"black\\" woman(no offense intended as to referring to her as black, as she did to herself) who encouraged every non-mormon to do their research on the net. If that isn't a sign to pick up the book then what is? I doubt she ever finished the book, in all fairness, what harm could come to you for actually RESEARCHING the RELIGEON based on IT'S text, not the texts of someone who feels the need to BASH the religeon for whatever reason they have. Have you ever noticed how you can acquire this book for free...go buy an anti-mormon book, they all cost MONEY. People call Joseph Smith a gold digger(he, at one time, worked for someone who wanted to mine for gold until Joseph Smith convinced him it wasn't worthwhile. You can read this in Joseph Smith, History). The problem with people calling him a gold digger is that they then close their eyes to the location of the real gold diggers, the people who write and sell anti-mormon literature. The mormon website has the Book of Mormon up there for you to read for FREE, most in depth anti mormon literature will only provide you w/a few pages of lies to get you to buy the book..where you are bombared w/mainly more lies.DO YOUR RESEARCH IN THE ONLY PLACE WHERE YOU CAN CONDUCT VALID RESEARCH. Don't go out and read a bunch of stuff on the net which could've very well been written by an 11 year old. If you want to study the Mormon reliegeon, acquire this book and other Mormon texts. Just as if you wanted to study the Muslim religeon, you wouldn't go find anti-muslim sites, you'd go check out some Muslim literature.If you want to enjoy this book you need to know something before you even start, and that is to BE FAIR when reading this book and desregard, if only for a moment, all the anti-mormonism you've read and just read the book, an actual publication of the church itself.It's has earned every one of the 5 stars I give it."},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"This is a wonderful book and truly inspirational.

Joseph Smith Jr. translated this book through divine means for US to have TODAY. He did NOT write it himself. He translated it. To some it may seem like a history book, but it is more than that. It will bring spiritual enlightenment to those who read it searching for truth.

It so beautifully corroborates the Holy Bible, in many cases filling in missing links. To a first time reader, it is like reading a compelling family saga. The gospel of Jesus Christ is taught throughout the Book of Mormon. After reading this book, one can have a sure knowledge, not only about the divinity of Christ, but of the history of those who lived in this hemisphere from 600 BC to 400 AD.

I usually get to bored, put it down and never return. My experience with The Book of Mormon has been completely different. I have read the entire book several times and am constantly amazed at the new insights I gain into the life of Jesus Christ. The Book of Mormon is a great testament of the life and mission of Christ as recorded by the inhabitants of the North and South American continents from 600 BC to 400 AD. It stands as a second witness to support the writings of the Bible, not to replace the Bible. The Book of Mormon is an easy read and for the most part flows chronologically.Our family just finished reading The Book of Mormon this past year and we feel a greater closeness to Heavenly Father and to His son, Jesus Christ. So many of life's questions can be answered within the pages of The Book of Mormon. I encourage everyone to read and ponder the words contained therein. By doing so you will be able to develop a stronger relationship with your Eldest Brother, Jesus Christ."},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"Like all religious matters, the Book of Mormon should be read with an open mind and heart, not to mention tolerance for the beliefs of others.

I know that it is a record of our ancestors that lived here on this the American Continent. It is a companion to the Holy Bible (they go hand in hand) to help us understand the fullness of the Gospel.

The book of Mormon, teaches the doctrine of Jesus Christ, and the consequences of sin / righteous living in a crystal clear and to the point manner. In this way the book helps one to get unto Christ and to get in touch with one self. Because the book is written by ancient prophets who had struggles similar to ours, the teachings can be likened very easily to your own life, I guess that this makes it the best \\"How to\\" life ones life book there is.There have a lot of other books been written about the Book of Mormon, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, Joseph smith etc, But if one truly wants to understand the Church and/ or the Book of Mormon, nothing beats, getting down to the core and reading the Book of Mormon itself. Books describing the Book of Mormon, are just writers opinions and are in general a waste of your time. The Book of Mormon, is written in old English, but my experience is (being an ex LDS Missionary), that one just has to bite trough this."},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"When I finished reading the Book of Mormon, it had answered many questions that I have had. Who the 'other sheep' were that Christ spoke about as recorded in the Bible. It also answered many questions about the ruins and temples that have been unearthed in South America and Mexico. When Joseph Smith translated the Book of Mormon, most of those had not yet been found by archiologists.

Which is what one would expect to hear from someone who was raised in the Mormon Church. But, I didn't always love it. Don't get me wrong, it's not as if I disliked it, I grew up reading from it as a family, confident that it was an uplifting a book as any other, but I hadn't put it to the test . . . hadn't built my own testimony of it. It wasn't until I was 20 and I moved out on my own that I really decided to start a real prayerful study of the book. I now love the Book of Mormon. I've grown in my appreciation of the Savior through my prayerful study of this book. And that is why I read this book, and the Bible, to grow closer to God.I would encourage anyone who is seeking to find out more about the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints to read this book, and if possible, the &quot;Doctrine and Covenants&quot; and the &quot;Pearl of Great Price,&quot; as well as the Holy Bible. These three books, along with the &quot;Book of Mormon&quot; create the four books of canonized scripture of the LDS faith. I understand that you'd want to read outside sources on the Church as well, as any well-rounded scholar would, just let common sense be your guide. There are many non-LDS writers who are not in agreement with the teachings of the LDS church, who write fair, well researced books. On the otherhand there are those who write hateful, misleading books that pervert that which is most sacred to me. Anyone who would claim to be a caring Christian and then belittle and mock those who believe differently then they do, needs to reexamine their intent, and should be viewed with suspicion by those looking to research.I know one of the main questions of those who are unfamiliar with the LDS church is whether or not we're Chrisitans. From my point of view, I worship the Son of God as my Savior, my Redeemer and King, and I believe that through him all mankind can be redeemed. I believe He has taught me on how to live, to be charitable to my fellow man, forgiving, to be filled with hope and faith. To pray when I am weak, and to pray when I am strong. To lift those up who are around me, to love all those I come in contact with, and mostly, striving daily to become a better person today then I was yesterday.If that's not Christian, I don't know what else I'd want to be.God bless America, and all those who have died in the senseless tragedy in New York and Washington."},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"I have read The Book of Mormon and I know that it is true.

The promise found in Moroni 10:3-5 (The Book of Mormon is set up like the Bible in books, chapters and verses, thus this would be found in the book of Moroni, tenth chapter, verses three through five) says that if we read the book, ponder it in our heart and then ask God if they are true.

Perhaps the most misunderstood book on earth, The Book of Mormon is simply another testament of Jesus Christ and tells of a people from 600 years before His birth until 400 years A.D. It simply and beautifully testifies that Jesus really is the son of God and supports all that the Bible has taught us concerning His life. It was not \\"authored\\" by Joseph Smith, only translated by the power of God through Joseph Smith, as the book will explain. It is an ancient,spiritual record of the native american people and their understanding of Jesus Christ and His eventual visitation after He was crucified. They witness the new star at his birth and the earthly calamity of his death. There are few words more beautiful than those in the chapters where He visits them and shows them the prints from the nails in His hands and feet, and proclaims who He is and then teaches them all he taught the people in Jerusalem when he was walking among them.

While I have always been a Christian, my wife and a foster son came from different non-christian religions traditions. Both were converted to belief in the Lord Jesus Christ by the Book of Mormon. This book lives up to its title page when it says that it is to the \\"convincing of Jew and Gentile that Jesus is the Christ\\".

Joseph Smith founded Americas greatest religous movement, and it is predicted by 2050 the Mormon Church will be the worlds biggest religous movement since the advent of Islam. And of course the Book of Mormon is Joseph Smiths greatest work. Anyone who is a believer in the divinity of Jesus Christ should find this a very inspiring book. The book is very Christ centered which certainly shows Joseph Smiths very deep belief in Christian ideas (although Joseph Smith did believe that modern Christian churches had become corrupted with false doctrines). The book is highly complex and shows forth astounding consistency. I have seen that many people bring up the fact that Mark Twain was not impressed with the book. I believe that Mark Twain was likely jealous that he could not produce something this complex. Tom Sawyer and Hucklberry Finn are great but nothing in comparison with the Book of Mormon. Nor can those who bring this up write anything close to it. For those who are not interested in the intellectual history of religon will probably find this a boring read. And I know some superstitious people think the book is anti-Christ, Occultic, and that Joseph Smith started a satanic cult. This shows there lack of education into even what these words mean, shows there lack of intelligence, and shows there lack of appreciation into American history. I would recommend also the mountain of recent studies done on the Book of Mormon. From a very pro-Mormon point of view I would recommend the works done by the Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies found at [local website] They are many times apolegetic but they have produced a mountain of literary studies into the Book of Mormon.

I was 19 when I joined, the son of a family that was Christian, but not rooted in any one faith. As my father was in the military, we moved around a lot, and as a result I had the opportunity to look into quite a few Protestant denominations. I have also been fascinated by ancient American archaeology and the legends of the indigenous peoples of the New World since I was about ten years old, particularly those stories of a bearded white god that visited anciently.My first reading of the Book of Mormon confirmed what I had come to believe, that Jesus Christ visited the New World in ancient times. Since that first reading in my nineteenth year I have taken the opportunity to investigate the veracity of the Book of Mormon not only from a spiritual but an academic standpoint. I have taken the opportunity to study a few languages, to learn a bit more ancient American folklore and I have made sure to study non-Mormon writings as frequently as possible. In my studies I have found that at least a few of the original inhabitants of the New World practiced a monotheistic religion, and that not all were the stereotypical pagans our \\"history\\" (with the help of Hollywood) has taught us.I believe the Book of Mormon to be what the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints purports it to be: It is inspired Scripture, written anciently by New World Prophets and translated by Joseph Smith, Jr. My faith in this book is not built on, but bolstered by, my academic studies, for only a spiritual witness can verify the truthfulness of the Book of Mormon.Read this book, and read it with your Bible close by, for the Book of Mormon is a companion to the Bible, not a replacement of it. I cannot recommend it too highly."},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"The information about Christ's ATONEMENT, our PURPOSE on earth, and how Obedience to the commandments brings BLESSINGS are explained CLEARER, IN MORE DETAIL, and feel INSPIRED when read in this book.But don't take MY word for it....read it and pray to know it it is right yourself. Good luck! It changed My attitude towards religion, prophets, and getting guidance for my life."},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"There are two issues with the Book of Mormon. The first is whether or not it is &quot;true&quot;. For the reader who is credulous enough to believe that the myths in the Bible are accurate history, then they might be able to convince themselves that the Book of Mormon is true. For the reader who has a neuron of prudent skepticism in his brain, the answer to whether or not the Book of Mormon is true is painfully obvious. Judge for yourself.The second issue with the Book of Mormon is its quality as a piece of literature. If the reader has a predisposition towards Christianity, some of the issues it raises are mildly interesting. It's interesting to consider who, specifically Jesus was referring to when he said he had other sheep. It's interesting to learn that children who haven't been baptized aren't going to hell. It's interesting to hear from Christianity that the purpose of life is to have joy. It's interesting to think that people had a crystal clear understanding of Christianity before Jesus was even born. It's interesting to consider that the true religion is more widely available than usually thought.But, the few &quot;interesting&quot; ideas are drowning in prose that tries to sound like King James and painfully fails. When the author suffered from writer's block as he frequently did, he copied from the Bible whole chapters at a time (and he usually chose boring chapters of the Bible rather than relatively interesting ones!). The characters are one-dimensional and homogenous. When the &quot;Lamanites&quot; (the supposed ancestors of the American Indian) speak, the Indian clich&eacute;s tend to make your skin crawl. The plot is repetitious and unbelievable. The dialogue is uncompelling. The logical arguments are unsound. It's a long, tedious read.Perhaps I am being too harsh. If you compare it to the Old Testament, I suppose it holds its own. But if you compare it to great Western literature, be it Homer, St. Augustine, Thomas Aquinas, Emerson, or Charles Dickens, it is totally and utterly out-classed. A unique epic? Yes. Great literature? Not even average literature.Among the relatively good chapters are 2 Nephi 2, Mosiah 2, Alma 29, Alma 36, and the second half of 1 Nephi 4.It's a great book to read when you can't sleep."},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"Although I am one who regards this book as divine, one of the universal things i love about it is it's poetry.

Hung up on their fears of the book (and their fears of \\"Mormons\\"), they fail to see the good the book, like the Bible, has wrought in the world, and in personal lives.

I don't believe it is what it claims to be, and I did read it 10 years ago when a Mormon coworker gave me a copy. It is usually what Mormon missionaries give potential converts to read, and this is somewhat misleading, since the Book of Mormon has nothing to do with the organization and beliefs of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (Mormon church). It is supposedly about Christ visiting the people of the Americas shortly after his resurrection, and it is full of rather innocuous stories with moral values and lessons that would be hard for any Christian to argue with. That is exactly WHY Mormons use it as a missionary tool. If you really want to know how the LDS church is organized, you need to read the Book of Doctrines and Covenants, ISBN 0830902775. That is where the cat gets out of the bag. There you will learn about how and why the church baptizes the dead, marries for eternity, believes in premortal existence, first instituted and then renounced plural marriage, and how Mormons believe that man can ultimately achieve godhood. But as for the Book of Mormon, I give it 3 stars, because even if you don't believe it is divinely inspired, the stories are interesting and above-average in quality, and if you do believe it is divinely inspired it is much more."},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"This book is an amazing hidden treasure of the history of the ancient people in America.

To me, its the greatest book currently in print. Reading the book is an exercise in feeling. More than anything, the book just feels good! More than that, it evokes deep passion, a passion that jumps out through many of the reviews posted here.My journey with the Book of Mormon has been the amazing journey of my life. I first read the book in its entirety when I was eight years old. What I got from it was a child's recognition that it had some pretty far-out, God-centered stories. But in time, as I majored in literature and began to read and ponder it on a more mature level, I became fascinated with its more complex nature. On one level, it can be read and partly understood by a child. But this book, like a good video game, will take you as many levels deep as you want to go with it, and give back in direct proportion to what you put into it. There are complex, intricate Hebraic poetic forms that, when fully understood (if that's possile) reveal its writers as among the world's most gifted, virtually all of them pointing the reader toward Jesus Christ. The depth and breadth of my journey with this book has truly been the amazing journey of a lifetime. I recommend it. But be prepared! Like me, it may take you on a longer, deeper journey than you ever thought possible and still leave much to ponder and explore.Here are some (but by no means all) of the highlights of my own journey with the book.1. The journey of Lehi and his family found in the book of 1 Nephi. The Book of Mormon appropriately begins with this, an allegory of each of our life's journeys. The only other think I know like it is Homer's \\"Odyssey.\\" However, unlike \\"Odyssey\\" this journey is a family journey, not an individual one. \\"Families together\\" is a great Mormon (perhaps universal?) theme that begins here.2. Also in the book of 1 Nephi is the allegory of the Tree of Life. This powerful allegory has been depicted in the artwork of many cultures the world over. Its universal theme is better explained in the Book of Mormon than anywhere else I know.3. In the book of 2 Nephi Chapter 4 is the powerful idea that even \\"wretched\\" people (as Nephi calls himself) are loved by God and may in fact be favored by Him and even share His secrets and speak for Him. Although written before the New Testament Apostle Paul wrote, this message has Pauline echoes to it.4. In the book of Mosiah is an address given by a king amid all the ancient Hebrew tradition, pomp, circumstance, etc. with two powerful messages: 1) That beggars should never be turned away, since we all, even kings, are \\"beggars\\" unable by ourselves to produce even the breath of life; and 2) that when one is in the service of fellow beings he/she is only in the service of God. These two messages are ironically spoken by a king and echo the words of another king, Jesus Christ, in the New Testament.5. The book of Alma contains some of the most profound words and ideas in the English language. I'm particularly taken by Alma Chapter 32, where Alma compares the \\"Word\\" (Jesus Christ) to a seed, then gives the best formula for how an unbeliever/seeker can become a believer of which I'm aware. Alma, together with Nephi, is a master of Hebraic poetic forms and wording. Its no coincidence, I think, that their books are among the largest in the Book of Mormon. Alma writes beautifully of many other universal human themes too numerous to mention here.6. The book of III Nephi contains the most sublime language describing the love of Christ I've read. Even though the words have undoubtedly suffered some from translation, they are hard to read (or even think about) without bringing tears. What love this man/God has!7. Chapter 12 of the book of Ether contains what for me is a TRULY BIG idea and one full of hope: That human weaknesses are gifts from God to keep us humans from becoming too full of ourselves and that, if we turn to Christ, he'll help make those weaknesses into strengths. I know of no other place this idea is found.8. Last (but not least) the book of Moroni has given me the surest advice of how to discern between good and evil. If a thing brings me closer to Christ, it is good. If it takes me further away, it is not good. That's pretty simple. Even I have been able to understand that. This book also (in Chapter 10, verses 4 and 5) gives the assurance that the best way to test the truth of something is to read about it, ponder it, then ask God \\"in the name of Christ.\\" If it is true, you'll feel good about it inside. But only if you give room enough to ponder before sincerely asking. This idea is echoed, though less explicitly, in the New Testament: \\"Seek and ye shall find,\\" and \\"if any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God.\\"(James 1:5)So, these are some of the highlights of my journey with the Book of Mormon. Its been a wonderful, gradual, ever deepening awakening over a lifetime of reading, studying and comparing. Its powerful language and intricate poetic forms are just now being discovered and understood. I'm most appreciative of the wonder, the passion, and the hope the book has given \\"wretched\\" me and a few million others."},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"This is an incredible Book.

Moreover, I have read a heck of a lot of material critical of the text itself (e.g. The Tanners, Evans, Vogel, Metcalfe) Notwithstanding, most, if not all, the attacks are usually based on fraud and/or popular though errant assumptions about the Book of Mormon text that actually do not jive with the text itself.I urge any one interested in the truth to read the Book of Mormon to discover for themselves that it is indeed another testament of Jesus Christ, and to learn of its truthfulness by study and by prayer to God, after \\"testing all things\\" (Acts 17:11)."},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"I've read this book growing up, and had always been fascinated with the story plots as well as the strength of character exemplified by the good guys. Growing up with these stories made me feel a desire to make myself into someone of strong character. It made me realize that I don't need to be like everyone else. I just need to do what is right. Because of this book, I have decided that when there are times where doing the right thing is hard, it's worth it to do the right thing, even if I get nothing for it.I also can feel the love and the reality of my Savior, Jesus Christ, as I read. The purpose of this book is specifically to testify of Christ and if you are looking for such a testimony you will find it here. If you are looking simply to criticize you will find that as well. If people are capable of criticizing something as perfect as the Savior, they certainly will find things to criticize in anything; including a book, although made through divine inspiration, that is compiled by and is about ordinary human beings. If you read the book, you will find the writers were well aware of their weakness in writing and knew people would read and size the book up, and even misunderstand it, based on their (the writers of the BOM) inability to express things in writing. This difficulty in expressing deep, ineffable feelings does not make the book any less true. Maybe just more misunderstood. You will get as much as you want to get out of it. For those who want to get much out of it, there is much to get because there is truth there. If you are in it to learn more about Jesus Christ and become closer to Him, you will find it invaluable. If not,you are reading a book in which the whole purpose is to bring you closer to Christ and if you're not up for that, maybe this will be an interesting read."},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"I have read this book of Mormon and it is the best book I have ever read !

(I have read the Bible and excerpts of other religious writings as well.) I learn something new every time I read it. I have heard many things about the Book of Mormon, both good and bad. Regardless of what is said by others, the book has given me a greater understanding of Jesus Christ. When I have read it and studied it, I have found a greater ability to resist temptation and I feel a greater love not only for God, but also for those around me.Those that criticize or claim fraud usually dismiss those of us who speak for its authenticity by referencing some obscure historical fact (out of context), citing some anti-Mormon article/book without checking their sources, and/or generally dismissing proponents of the Book of Mormon's truth as brainwashed cult members. (Incidentally, most critics seem to use the term \\"cult\\" rather broadly and are usually unable to offer a definition of what a cult is when asked.) By in large these critics, to paraphrase a recently deceased Mormon leader, are often masking behavioral lapses with intellectual reservations.The intense criticism of the book should in and of itself raise a flag to genuine seekers of truth. If it was so off-base, why has it influenced millions to live in greater conformity with the teachings of Christ?I do not mean any ill will towards those who choose not to believe. I accept that many are sincere in their opposing beliefs. I am writing this review simply to do just that--offer my review that I enjoy this book and highly recommend it to everyone. It speaks for itself."},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"Mormons treat this book as scripture and the Mormon Church wants you to believe that it is in fact both scripture and real history. The science of DNA and modern anthropology says otherwise. Watch out though, Mormon apologists change their story as needed. They are a moving target. For decades Mormon's have been teaching that native Americans are descended from the \\"Lamanite\\" people talked about in this book. Now, much to the chagrin of the average Mormon beleiver the fancy Mormon apologists are back tracking on this with a new \\"limited geography theory\\". Why? Well for one thing DNA evidence that shows the opposite- oops!I was born into the Mormon religion and read the book many times when younger because I was told that it was the righteous thing to do and that I would be spiritually rewarded. Well, it used to put me to sleep no matter how hard I tried to treat it with reverence and stay interested.Now that I am grown up and realize that the book is not what it claims to be, I can in retrospect understand why I was being put to sleep: It is really a very simple minded good-guy/bad-guy story and quite boring. The style is dry and droning. It exists not to entertain, enlighten, or anything else except to get you to join the Mormon church. Oh, and by the way, members in good standing are asked to pay 10% of their income to the church for the rest of their lives so there is a big money thing going on here.Now since this book is part of the whole \\"you can be a god forever in heaven\\" promise that is the Mormon religion, lots of people will let wishful thinking cloud common sense and rationality and buy into it. Ironically, some otherwise smart and educated folks, mostly born into Mormonism, are able to perpetually talk themselves into this stuff in ever more sophisticated and convoluted ways.A better read would be M. Shermer's book \\"Why people believe weird things\\". Shermer also wrote an article \\"Why smart people believe weird things\\" which I think is included as a chapter in his book.The book also plays a psychological trick on you by inviting you to pray to see if it is true. You are promised a special feeling that you are instructed to attribute to the Holy Ghost. It you get any interesting feelings you might feel you have been touched. Otherwise you are implicitly invited to see yourself as too insincere to receive the spiritual witness. So what do you do? For some the answer is try again and again until you can convince yourself that you now feel something and since weird feelings or warm spiritual feelings do occasionally and randomly occure in normal people some people will be \\"converted\\".Of course, now that we have the scientific method and philosophical history to learn from we should be able to realize that this is exactly the wrong way to figure out truth."},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"Dear Readers:I was actually surprised that my first review of this book was banned (after being listed for about 2 years). I simply stated (without name-calling or profanity), facts about ol' Joe Smith and his connections to Masonic Lodges and the review was finally censored. Basically this book purports to be a history of ancient people and prophets, and discovered by Joe Smith with the aid of an angel (in New York State), and actual visitation by god the father and son,...jesus christ in a forest near his home (mormons believe god the father, the holy ghost, and jesus are not one but seperate entities). Yes, the &quot;Latter Day Saints&quot; actually believe all this to be true. If you want to read about the connections between Joeseph Smith and the Masons there's plenty of historical information out there to read along with numerous websites. I read a great deal at my University Library and one book written by Mormon scholars called &quot;Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought Vol. 27, No.3. Fall 1994,&quot; went into great detail to prove Smiths involvement with lodges, and other particulars of the church which would make the average Latter Day Saint scratch their head in disbelief. It's all documented and true, and even the Mormons will admit to its validity, (if they're even aware of it, for it's not one of their proud moments in their church history). If you ever attend a Latter-Day Saint church, they never talk about the gray areas in church history, Smith's history, his arrests, his conections to the jewish book of mysticism, sigils, ritual daggers, treasure hunting, Book of Mormon text changes, numerous seer stones, the current president ( not president of church at the time) buying false documents regarding Joseph Smith seeing a white salamander instead of God, (why would he purchase such fantasy if he believed the book of mormon to be true??)...etc, etc ad infinum! All of this is neatly &quot;sweeped under the rug&quot;. Ask a Mormon missionary about anything of this nature and they'll be dumbfounded; I can almost certaintly guarantee it!I thought that the only religious grouping with enough pull and power to ban and edit unwanted facts were the Jews, but now I guess the Mormons have just as much power here on Amazon! Looks like zionism reigns supreme in this nation.&quot;A comfortable lie usually wins over an uncomforatable truth,&quot; and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints is proof of this."},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"I believed everything the Mormon church taught and read this book like a diligent Morgbot and I've gotten nothing.

I'm done."},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"Wow. I haven't seen this many 5-star reviews since \\"Battlefield Earth\\" came out in paperback. To make it fair, the Scientologists and the LDS Church should both publish a book on the same day, and see which Church can have the most believing members give it 5-stars. Bonus points if they can get the same members to buy copies of a book they already own in order to push the books sales ranking. Since both Churches are about the same size, and have devoted detractors as well, it could be interesting. Of course, if we said that the members actually had to have read the book in order to vote, that would severely limit the number of Mormons who could participate.As for the Book itself, some say it is a record of the religion and culture of two tribes of people living in the Americas thousands of years ago (some say around the time and location of the Olmecs and Mayans). Others think the book is a modern record of the religion and culture of the upperstate New York in the late 1820's, including the theories then in vogue concerning the origin of the American Indians.Some say it was written by several ancient prophets on metal plates that were buried and preserved in a hill in New York. Others believe it was \\"written\\" in the 1820's by Joseph Smith (he actually dictated it to a scribe).But you'll never know if you don't read it. And in addition to praying about it, I would recommend learning all you can about the circumstances of the translation, the history of Joseph Smith and his family, and the history of ancient America, where the book is set.It should also be noted that the Book of Mormon can be \\"true\\", but that doesn't necessarily mean that the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is \\"true\\" as well. One doesn't necessarily follow the other. Linking the two is a common mistake promoted by many well-meaning LDS.Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"The Book of Mormon is a work of fiction with its origins in the desire of early nineteenth century Americans to explain the remnants of Native American civilization they were aware of. Finding it incredible that the Indians could have made such a civilization on their own, the author imagined that a group of exiles must have come over from the Holy Land centuries earlier.Just who wrote the Book of Mormon is hard to say. I tend to think Joseph Smith did. Yes, he was uneducated, but he was certainly a smart young man. Considering his later writings, I don't see that the Book of Mormon was beyond his abilities.As far as the merits of the book itself, certainly it has some. The plot takes some interesting turns. As literature, though, the book is frankly dull, especially in the last half. The Book of Mormon deals in black and white: the characters are either wicked or righteous. Real people aren't like that. Whatever Smith's merits as a writer, creating believable and interesting characters wasn't one of them. Unlike real history, the plot of the Book of Mormon also tends to follow a neat path of \\"wickedness leads to destruction\\" every time.Most scientists who are not historians of 19th century America tend to dismiss extreme religious books like the Book of Mormon as beneath their notice. In a way you can hardly blame the scientists, because the Book of Mormon is contrary to pretty much everything that is known today about Native American civilization. However, I think the scientists are wrong to ignore religious works. The Mormons are today a group with serious political power; they are well represented in Washington, especially in the intelligence community. No matter what your own beliefs are, in my opinion it is important to read the works of people you disagree with. If you are a fan of the Book of Mormon, I would urge you to balance it by reading contary views. I would suggest the books \\"Ghost in the Universe\\" by Edis, and \\"The Demon-Haunted World\\" by Carl Sagan."},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"for one, about the smithsonian report, they have recently retracted that document, because of the fact that they have found out those things were acurate that they stated were wrong, and the first people on the americas didn't get there in 600 bc, they were there far before that...look at the book of ether, and lastly if a prophet recieves revelation from God, and another prophet of God gets the same one...word for word...how is that plagarism? this book is true and i love it"},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"Well, you know what they say... &quot;you get what you pay for&quot;."},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"This book changed my life and I see it improve the lives of those around me every day.

It continues to help me understand God and His dealings with His children. I hope this new edition enables people everywhere to enjoy this wonderful book."},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"I am not exaggerating about the title of this review. If that is true, there must be something to it. I enthusiastically read all the holy scripture from all religions which I can get my hands (\\"Mormons\\" should, too; when it comes to ideas, one must receive in order to give). For me, none of them has the impact, usefulness and--above all--implications that the Book of Mormon does. In the interest of brevity, I will let the reader discover those implications.I try to 'give back' a fraction of what I've gained in so many ways from this book by letting \\"those who have ears\\"--curiosity or an intuition--hear.Aside from the quality of the content itself, one of the most amazing things about the BOM to me is that there are no contradictions or flaws within its own story. The vicious \\"anti's\\", who will scrapple for any way to detract, conspicuously ignore going at this, but pro's overlook this too. The BOM is the most complex book I have ever read, even tho it was dictated to at least 4 different scribes during the course of translation. Even 2-hour movies have contradicions in their storylines. While that does not prove its veracity, and I realize that they did clean up the text to make a printer's copy, which still exists, even then there was no punctuation or formatting. The original dictation leaves still exist, but Emma Smith's decision to hide & leave them in a cornerstone led to the visible disappearance of the text during the ensuing decades and floods until it was uncovered. Perhaps advanced spectroscopy will someday reveal the text and bolster my observation.For newbies: the BOM is one of the most difficult books to intellectually \\"get\\". Once it \\"clicks\\", though, and you \\"get it\\", your life may change dramatically, no matter what religion, if any, you choose to associate with, or to what level. It is difficult to recommend a religion which has dealt so contemptuously with myself and others with long hair; the wrong skin color; or works-producing faith in the Book of Mormon's, Doctrine & Covenants', and New Testament's mandate of plain dress. However, one cannot be abused or harrassed simply reading a book. People who find the BOM difficult to read have not had the \\"click\\"; I used to be one of those people. Reading the middle of 3 Nephi and also starting at the beginning of the the true story text were breakthroughs for me. I've met many people who say, \\"Yeah, I read the B.o.M., I read that, the whole thing, and wasn't impressed.\\" I invariably ask them to \\"tell me one thing about the Book of Mormon\\". Not how it came about, but actually one thing from the text of the actual Book of Mormon--one name, one story--anything. They invariably can't even give me one firsthand bit of info. I say, \\"Surely, if you read an entire book, you'll remember one name, one story--even anything about the book itself. You never read it, and I suggest you do, even if only to understand others who are your friends or neighbors.\\"For olbies: I strongly recommend any Book of Mormon enthusiast get ahold of a photographic reprint of the BOM's first (1830) edition, and actually read it. It is indeed a moving experience, especially for someone who might be raised as LDS and took for granted the Book of Mormon, its current sophistication of formatting, printing, and extensive footnoting (not my case). You see a Book of Mormon with no verse separation--paragraph form--with no chapter headings, except the few which were surprisingly literally part of the translation/abridgement (it's difficult to articulate such subtle hidden blessings). Firsthand, you see how obvioiusly the typesetter had no clue regarding the content of the Book of Mormon, as you see the results of his struggle & haste to insert punctuation into a manuscript which had none whatsoever. You see the misspellings, the rudeness of the formatting, but that makes the text of the work shine through. Because the words and text are the same, familiar, and recognizable. Sure, \\"a-coming\\" was changed to \\"coming\\", etc., but the exaggeration of detractors' shrilly-announced list of changes becomes visibly demonstrated in a personal way. You gain a connection to the reality of the story behind this text on a visceral level, even in just a few pages, and the effect is even more powerful if you become fortunate enough to crack open an extant original. And keep in mind through all these faults of men that the 1830 version was a high-end book & print in its day; leather-bound, large, and costing an equivalent of well over a thousand dollars in today's money. Many people gave them away to strangers at their own personal cost--not because of some dogmatic pressure, but quite the opposite; those people were hugely going against the flow at the time.Photographic reprints are available in print as \\"Joseph Smith Begins His Work: Book of Mormon 1830 First Edition: Reproduced from uncut sheets\\" self-published by the he late, great Wilford C. Wood, but still available (print seems slightly larger than original, including fascinating memoranda); from the RLDS's Herald Publishing House (good bit smaller than the original--ISBN 0-8309-0025-X); and on CD-ROM as the \\"Octavo Edition\\" (ISBN 1-891788-08-6) in the form of color photos, page-by-page.It even took awhile for the general body of the original LDS church and even post-Smith-martyrdom sects (including the \\"Brighamites\\" (Utah/largest sect), to \\"get it\\". The members, even at the highest levels--all converts--publicly employed the Book of Mormon relatively little compared to today, being more familiar (and oftentimes more confortable with the concept of) the Bible, but also having no acces to similar Biblical formatting, concordance, and research tools which are all ridiculously accessible today but which were available in that day for the Bible.The potential benefits range from a better understanding of others & history to something on the order of Pascal's Wager: if it is false, there is little wasted and considering the fundamental extreme positivity of the Book of Mormon's exhortation, still a tremendous lot to be gained for a person of conscience. If it is true, the potential benefits, and the end thereof, cannot be measured. Despite the numerous mistakes of both extant and extinct theological branches which claim Joseph Smith, Jr. (the seer-translator) in their ancestry, the Book of Mormon remains as arguably the most pristine jewel of the entire theological world.On Library of Congress's top 20 list of most-influential books in America, any self-educated reader puts themself at a disadvantage if they cognizantly avoid this book."},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"All I can suggest, if you're curious about this book, is to read it with a grain of salt. As you can plainly see by reading over all the \\"five star\\" ratings, there are some satisfied Mormons out there. That's a wonderful thing.Please note that if you were shopping for a Ford, you would look for other opinions other than those of satisfied Ford drivers and from Ford itself. You would also choose to talk to those who have driven Fords and find out why they chose another car. You'd read reviews that were also less than pro-Ford. Religion definately takes more thought than what car you drive.This being said, if you are interested in the Book of Mormon as a fictional book... or as an \\"inspired by\\", yet not quite historically correct book, you may enjoy getting a better understanding of your Mormon friends and neighbors. If you're looking for entertainment, you'd be better off finding a decent author. This is definately not on par with Dickens, Twain, Steinbeck, or Hugo. If you are planning on looking at this book as if it is cold hard fact, I suggest that you pick up some accompanying books on DNA research, \\"New World\\" archeology, world religion, and philosophy.Basically, I just suggest looking at this with a serious grain of salt. I'd also suggest reading over the Koran, the Sutras of Buddhism, the Talmud, and other \\"holy\\" writings. Treat this book the same way you would treat any of the others. Know that some view it as a holy scripture, and will try to tell you to view it the same way."},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"It is hard to write a book review about a book like the Book of Mormon. I find the same to be true for any religious text, as these books are not written with the intention to entertain or demonstrate impressive literary skills in the authors. These books are written with the intention to present truths that help the readers to live more fulfilling lives with greater happiness.I gave this book a 3 rating for the sole purpose of illustrating my opinion that the value of this book is completely personal. You'll notice that the reviews tend to be a 5 or a 1. This book seems to bring out extreme emotions either for or against it.All I can do is echo what many others have said, and that is to read it and follow the promise towards the end, to pray and ask if its true and receive an answer for yourself.Some people claim that the promise is rigged because it says you must pray with \\"real intent\\", thereby covering the bases.. thus if you don't get an answer that it is true, then you must not be righteous enough or sincere enough. I can certainly understand complaints of this nature.Let me share my own personal opinion from what I have learned in my life. It is that our Father in Heaven does not teach you something unless your heart is prepared to hear it. Why? Because he loves us SO much. He is not some dictator that wants things his way or the highway. He is our Father, and he knows the natural rules that lead to a society of true peace and happiness for all its members. In order to achieve such a society, there are ideals and behaviors that must be learned and followed by everyone. If we choose to follow our own selfish desires and impulses which would ultimately prove destructive to the perfect happiness of those around us, then we cannot be a part of the perfect society in Heaven. God is our father, he loves us more than we can comprehend and longs dearly for us to return to him. However, we have our own free agency and must make our own decisions - God understands that he cannot force us to do what's right or it would defeat the entire purpose of our coming to earth.Anyway, my point is that He knows if we are ready to receive certain truths, and until we are, he won't give them to us. This is because, if we receive a truth, we are held responsible to behave accordingly. If we don't, we are condemning ourselves. God is VERY careful not to give us truths we aren't ready for, because he does everything in his power to avoid our condemnation. (Being condemned means that we cannot dwell in Heaven).Thus, the purpose of praying with true intent. If we read the Book of Mormon, or any text, without being humble and teachable and willing to act in accordance with the truth we set out to learn, then we will not receive an answer as to its truthfulness. However, if we do have true intent to follow what we learn, then you will receive an answer as to the truthfulness of the Book of Mormon, this promise applies to anything you want to know the truth of. God is there, helping us as much as we allow him to, and if you are sincere about wanting to do what is right, you will receive answers to your prayers about the truthfulness of all things.Thus, read the Book of Mormon if you really want to know the truth, either way. Not if you are already certain of its falsehood and have no intentions of making a change in your life IF you did end up feeling that it was true.As for me, this book gets a 5. I believe it to be a true book of God, regardless of the human imperfections of its authors. It teaches a person to draw closer to God, be loving towards their neighbors, to be kind, patient, full of charity towards all men. In my opinion, anything that teaches these principles is of God, regardless of which religion it belongs to."},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"There are those out there trying to dispute The Book of Mormon,but you have the opportunity to know for yourself if the book is true.

If these people lived , then where is the proof? Also why not let others see the plates so they could be part of the whole scam! I have not read the whole Bible , but I've read enough to know the Book of Mormon is a big rip off of it!

It's initial goal was to establish his credentials as a gifted finder of buried treasure and later to set him up as a gifted spiritual leader to enrich himself on other people's money as he had already demonstrated a determined dislike for serious physical labor (though I can't say I blame him). I congratulate him on a creditable job, but don't waste your time looking at it as a book of scripture.As a lifelong member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (which would be more accurately called the Church of Joseph Smith of the latter-day duped) I must give this book one star. Its religious/spiritual quality is zero (since the whole thing was made up by Joseph Smith - a man with a serious reputation as a treasure hunter during the time he was waiting for the angel to give him access to the plates), and who used magical devices (such as his peepstone) used in his hat to \\"translate\\" the Book of Mormon. A device he also used to locate buried treasure for gullible clients. He was also a devotee of magic and the occult (about which I learned in church history at Brigham Young University). The book's historical impact is two stars though, as mormonism has had some impact on the direction US history and played a prominent role in settling the western frontier; though as mormonism appears to be in great trouble due to substantial falloff of new converts over the past decade, the growing number of people leaving the church, and the constant pleas for tithing coming over mormon pulpits indicating the church's financial stress, perhaps in 50 to 100 years its historical impact may be much smaller.This book reads much like the Bible (including its attempt at King James Bible style English) but is full of incredible and fantastic stories mimicking both the Bible and the world of Christian revivalism as seen by Mr. Smith in early 19th century America. A small sampling of these fantastic, scripturally unprecedented or fantastically embellished, and even morally dangerous stories follows: Nephi's God-directed cold-blooded murder of Laban, the keeper of the brass plates in Jerusalem (Since God supernaturally gave Smith the gold plates, gave Lehi's party the Liahona, gave some Book of Mormon prophets some fantastic powers and information, it makes me wonder why instead of instructing Nephi to murder Laban for his plates, God didn't just give Nephi a copy of the brass plates - or give Nephi the contents of the brass plates by revelation.); the magical Liahona guiding Lehi's party through the wilderness of the Arabian peninsula, Nephi and other Book of Mormon characters being told by God the exact year of the future birth of Jesus Christ, even the Messiah (since Christ and Messiah are the same word in different languages, seems somewhat redundant, but it seems Smith was ignorant of this when he produced the book); the amazing account of the release of Alma and Amulek from prison by an earthquake (like Paul in the New Testament); the existence and arguements of deceptive and unprecedented ancient world doubters/atheists Nehor and Korihor (Thomas Paine); Nephite missionary Ammon cutting off only the arms of a bunch of Lamanite sheep rustlers; the fainting and trances (like a Christian revival) of almost all members of King Lamoni's court during Ammon's visit; the story of the unkillable 2000 2nd generation converted Lamanite warriors under the Nephite general Helaman; a later Nephi's unprecedented God-given power to cause a famine among the wicked Nephites till they repented, the \\"day and night and a day\\" with no darkness to commemorate the birth of Jesus in Jerusalem; the Jaredite barge/submarines, the battles to the last man (almost) fought in the Jaredite and Nephite/Lamanite wars - again a story that strains credulity as such battles to the last man are unprecedented in the history of the world - except in the Book of Mormon; etc. In fact, the Book of Mormon borrows liberally from some books of the Bible such as large sections lifted almost verbatim from Isaiah and Matthew (though making the same translation mistakes made by King James scholars in the Book of Isiah). Smith did this since Ethan Smith, author of \\"Views of the Hebrews\\" (a book published in two editions in the 1820s) predicted that someday Indian scriptures would be discovered and would contain writings of Isaiah.All of these bizarre things in the Book of Mormon are defended by mormons as a last resort as tests of faith. You must believe in a capricious, mean-spirited God who is a respecter of persons (especially of the righteous and powerful Nephite super-hero prophets) to believe the wild stories in this book.Even more fantastic, the Book of Mormon has almost no influence on mormon theology, as it strongly condemns polygamy in several places (a practice near to the heart of mormonism for over 70 years), condemns secret combinations and oaths (which is integral to the temple endowment of mormonism), and clearly teaches the doctrine of the trinity (which mormons have not believed since the early 1840s due to Smiths publication of the 13 articles of faith with proclaims the \\"godhead) to name the most striking,\\" And of course, there is not one shred of archaeological, historical, cultural, linguistic, genetic, or geographic evidence to support the claim that the people of the Book of Mormon ever existed, and overwhelming evidence to the contrary. Check it all out on the internet.Finally, as a mormon I read this book cover-to-cover three times. Once in seminary, once before I went on a mission for the mormon church, and once while I was out on my mission. I took up the challenge in the last chapter of Moroni to pray about the book on all occasions, and I felt nothing, absolutely nothing about this book. Mormons will say that I did something wrong to not get an answer, but this is not the case. So save yourself the trouble of going down this dead-end. It was written by Smith and is not worth any serious consideration."},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"The Book of Mormon tells all of our beliefs.

Such arguments have been going on regarding the Bible for thousands of years. To this day half of the Bible (the New Testament) is disregarded as an unauthorized addition by Jews who reverence the Torah. See, Deut 4:2.The Book of Mormon from its title page purports to be one thing--Another Testament of Jesus Christ. New scripture from a God who is following the same pattern He has followed for generations; new scripture to complement the old. The Book of Mormon is for persons who wonder why the Bible stopped--who wonder where the prophets have gone. For a good long time the world wasn't ready to have a prophet. In the 1830's, in a country with unlimited possibility and unprecedented religious freedom, God again revealed Himself to a prophet. I find it curious that people who revere prophets such as Moses, Abraham, Daniel, the Apostle Paul and others will not test claims of a modern prophet. I wonder if Isaiah had trouble distributing his book--it demands a close reading, was doctrinally controversial and probably disturbed the governing orthodoxy. But that is the way God works, He allows us to decide whether to read the book.The Book of Mormon is the means given by God to test the veracity of the man who brought it forth--Joseph Smith. It is a test--no more no less. The Book of Mormon itself at Moroni Chapter 10 (the last chapter of the entire work) at verses 3-5 is instructive: \\"Behold, I would exhort you that when ye shall read these things, if it be wisdom in God that ye should read them, that ye would remember how merciful the Lord hath been unto the children of men, from the creation of Adam even down until the time that ye shall receive these things, and ponder it in your hearts. And when ye shall receive these things, I would exhort you that ye would ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these things are not true; and if ye shall ask with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ, he will manifest the truth of it unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost. And by the power of the Holy Ghost ye may know the truth of all things.\\"So, instead of engaging in argument, test the Book. Read it and ask God whether it is true. I have. It is."},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"Anyone interested in American Religous history must read this book. The Book of Mormon recently voted one of the nations top 20 most influential books, Joseph Smith is Americas greatest religious reformers. Anyone who is a believer in the divinity of Jesus Christ should find this a very inspiring book. The book is very Christ centered which certainly shows Joseph Smiths very deep belief in Christian ideas. The book is highly complex and shows forth astounding consistency (with some acceptions). Although some of the stories are shallow and not really entertaining and the characters fit into simple categories of being good guys or bad guys, the story as a whole is complex and captivating. I have seen that many people bring up the fact that Mark Twain was not impressed with the book. I believe that Mark Twain was likely jealous that he could not produce something this complex. Tom Sawyer and Hucklberry Finn are great but nothing in comparison with the Book of Mormon. Nor can those who bring this up write anything close to it. And I know some superstitious people think the Book of Mormon is inspired of Satan, that is as superstitious as an astrologer. I would recommend the mountain of recent studies done on the Book of Mormon. From a very pro-Mormon point of view I would recommend the works done by the Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies (FARMS). They are many times apolegetic and fall into the same ridiculous category as Christian apologists that actually think religious claims can be verified with physical evidence, but they have produced a mountain of interesting literary studies into the Book of Mormon. From a more secular view of the Book of Mormon I would recommend works that have been published by Signature Books. I also want to bring up one more point about this book. I have seen a lot of people bring up the recent DNA studies showing that the American Indians come from Asia and not the Middle East as the book claims. Although this is true I find it odd most of these people are strict Bible believers and don't realize that the same type of DNA studies show that humans are much older than Adam and Eve and DNA also helps in verifying organic evolution. Just read the article by Thomas Murphy in the book \\"American Apocrypha\\" published by Signature Books and you will realize DNA presents problems for both the Book of Mormon and the Bible."},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"I compare this book to the Koran.

Here are some of the important lessons found in this book:If you own brass plates, don't show them off. Keep it low key, especially around the local prophet guy. If the local prophet guy asks you about your brass plates say, lie for your own protection. Say, \\"Brass Plates? What brass plates? I don't own brass plates.\\"If someone orders you to hand over your brass plates, especially the sons of the local prophet guy, and you don't want to give them to them, just say no. You own them. If they insist you give them your brass plates, call the cops.If after calling the cops, the perpetrators get away, hire bodyguards to watch over you and your plates. Don't get drunk until they are captured.If you are responsible for guarding your boss's brass plates, and someone shows up claiming to be your boss and asks you to give him the brass plates, check his ID first.If you are responsible for guarding your boss's brass plates, and someone shows up covered in blood, wearing your boss's clothes, claiming to be your boss, but he doesn't look anything like your boss, and he asks you to hand over the brass plates you should say, \\"Sure boss, I'll be right back.\\" Then pretend to go into the back room to get the plates, but instead call the cops.If you are investigating the murder/robbery of a guy who was killed for his brass plates, the first suspects you should interview should be the sons of the local prophet guy who were last seen ordering the dead guy to give them his brass plates.If you are investigating the murder/robbery of a guy who was killed for his brass plates, and the prime suspects are the sons of the local prophet guy, don't waste time looking for them in town. Most likely they packed up everything and headed for the sea. Check the nearby beaches.If you are writing on gold plates, keep in mind it is really hard and Gold plates are rare. Therefore, to get the most bang for the buck from the limited gold plates you should use a secret language called \`Reformed Egyptian' which is more compact than regular Egyptian, and avoid repetitive phrases like \`And it came to pass' unless those phrases are absolutely necessary to get the point across.If you wake up one morning and realize someone turned you into an Indian, it just means you are one of the bad guys. Don't get upset, it doesn't necessarily mean you are a bad person, just that you happen to be part of the bad \`nation'.If you want to fix the problem of looking like an Indian, find someone who didn't get turned into an Indian, who is still white and start going to church with him. Meet with the missionaries of his church, take the discussions, and get baptized. If you follow the teachings of the white guy's church, you will turn white again.If you are an atheist who asks the local prophet guy for a sign, and the prophet curses you, and you are deaf and dumb, going from door to door begging for food, and you see a group of people marching down the street, do not walk out into the middle of them, unless you want to get trampled to death.If Jesus comes to visit you, keep in mind that one of the things you can wish for is immortality. So don't waste your wish on anything less than immortality. You might be able to wish for more wishes, but I wouldn't test Jesus' patience. Stick with the immortality wish. We know that one works.If someone is lying unconscious for 2 days and 2 nights and you aren't sure if he is dead or not, try smelling him. If he doesn't stink, he might still be alive.One way to impress a guy is to cut off the arms of his enemies and bring him the severed arms.If you need to escape from a town because everyone's language got mixed up, the best way to escape is by the sea, with a barge.If you need to build a barge to travel across the sea after escaping from a town where the languages got mixed up, the best way to build it is to put a hole on the top and a hole on the bottom. That way you can get air by opening the top hole and if it tips over, you can still get air by opening the bottom hole which is now on top. If you accidentally open the wrong hole and notice water rushing in, just stop up the hole real quick and open the other hole.If you are building a barge to travel across the sea do not put windows in your barge. It is unrealistic to expect the windows to survive the crashing waves of the sea. If you want light, use glowing rocks instead.If you are building a barge to travel across the ocean, be sure to bring lots and lots of food and fresh water because the trip will take 344 days. If you need to go to the bathroom, do it over the side of the barge because the holding tank can only hold a few days worth of human waste.If you find yourself on the battlefield fighting your arch nemesis, and you chop off his head and he falls to the ground, do not be alarmed when he lifts himself up and gasps for air. This is a common reaction to getting your head chopped off.If you find yourself on the battlefield fighting your arch nemesis and he chops your head off, don't waste your time and energy lifting yourself up and gasping for air.

After much reflection and analysis, I now believe the church is primarilty a socioeconomic organization that masquerades as a religious cult. The foundation of the church's atypical Christian belief is the Book of Mormon, a product of the vivid imagination of Joe Smith and ample plagiarism from the Bible.The book purports to be a history of a large society that was visited by Christ around the time of the Biblical resurrection. Where these people lived is unknown, although Mormons generally feel the events happened in South or Central America. For some unexplained reason, the book is written in King James English just like the Bible, and contains numerous references to religious issues that were common to the period. What did Joseph Smith claim? That an Angel revealed to him a record written on gold plates, after which Smith translated the plates into the Book of Mormon. After the translation, the angel took the plates back - never to be seen again. (Yes, Mormons actually believe this.) With the aid of a few others Smith started a new religion and soon developed into an egotistical leader, engaging in polygamy, starting his own bank, writing numerous other &quot;scipiture,&quot; and even running for President. The LDS church has gone to great lengths to &quot;revise history,&quot; surpress many of Smith's foibles, and portray him as an uneducated boy who ultimately became a martyr. (Smith died in a gun battle.)The Book of Mormon is poorly written, lacks grammatical cohesiveness, and is very boring.

Then in 1 Nephi Chapter 4, I read about how Nephi murdered an unconscious Laban at God's command to obtain written records Lehi, as a wealthy Jew living in Jerusalem should already have owned. Anytime you have anyone claiming God commanded him to murder someone else, you've got the potentials for another Waco or Jonestown tragedy. Or, for that matter, the 1857 Mountain Meadows Massacre perpetrated by Mormons near Cedar City, Utah.And don't think reading the BoM will teach you much about the contemporary LDS Church. The BoM clearly lacks important core LDS beliefs developed by Smith after he wrote the BoM, such as the Temple ceremony, polygamy, the Word of Wisdom, the Aaronic and Melchezedik priesthoods, and the three degrees of heaven, all doctrines necessary for exaltation into the highest degree of the Celestial Kingdom in LDS theology. They're just not in the BoM.In addition, don't think reading the BoM will teach you much about the Mayan or Olmec civilizations (i.e., the real-life people who lived in Mesoamerica during the time period supposedly covered). The BoM claims the Nephites had horses and steel swords, something all non-LDS archaeologists and anthropologists will tell you simply weren't there at that time period.Frankly, I can't think of a single reason why anyone would want to read the BoM except to see a classic example of what is called \\"pious fiction.\\"James Clifford Millermillerjamesc@cox.net"},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"Joseph Smith, Jnr., has never been given his proper due either by his friends or his enemies. He wrote the greatest fantasy novel of all time, but he called it scripture and forced his friends to deny that he was a novelist. He made so many mistakes and displayed such ignorance that he was mistaken either for a prophet or a fool, when in fact he was a genius who memorised the entire King James Version and could recite it from memory for hours at a time. He had a vivid imagination, the gift of being a great storyteller, and no sense of humor at all (see below). I have a theory that from time to time the Earth is visited by what I call Novas, extremely great men who pass like meteors in the heavens, throwing the human race for a loop. They tend to be sociopathic. Such an one was Joseph Smith. He was great regardless of whether the BoM was true or not. Yes, I have read the entire book. I know too much about it to believe any of it. Take, for example, the ninth chapter of Ether. This is the one flash of dry humor in the book, so of course the faithful don't notice the humor.

If you just remove the four brackets then you have first Corinthians, Chapter 13, verses 4-7 from the King James (1611) translation of the Bible.Which is rather strange, really, because according to information from the &quot;Ask Gramps&quot; column written by Mormon member H. Clay Gorton:&quot;All the witnesses [to the translation of the BOM], directly or indirectly, provide strong evidence that Joseph Smith did not use a King James Bible.&quot;The whole subject of the alleged translation of the Book of Mormon is riddled with this kind of inconsistency, starting with the gold plates that were supposedly buried in the hill called Cumorah, near Manchester, New York, in 420 A.D., just over fourteen hundred years before Smith allegedly found them in 1823.According to David Whitmer, one of the three witnesses to the authenticity of the BOM, Smith:&quot;... did not use the plates in the translation, but would hold the interpreters to his eyes and cover his face with a hat, excluding all light, and before his eyes would appear what seemed to be parchment, on which would appear the characters of the plates in the line at the top, and immediately below would appear the translation, in English, which Smith would read to his scribe, who wrote it down exactly as it fell from his lips. The scribe would then read the sentence written, and if any mistake had been made, the characters would remain visible to Smith until corrected, when they faded from sight to be replaced by another line.&quot;So if Smith didn't need the plates in order to translate them, what was the point of showing them to him in the first place?Why, having been shown the plates, did Smith see &quot;what seemed to be parchment&quot; during the translation?Why was the text on the plates in &quot;reformed *Egyptian* hieroglyphics&quot; if it was written by one-time *Israelites* living in America?Why, if it is genuine, has no-one else ever found a single example of this form of writing, not even in America, Egypt or Israel?Why, if Smith was able to read Egyptian hieroglyphics at all, did he make such a hash of &quot;translating&quot; the manuscript he named the &quot;Book of Moses&quot;? (See &quot;By His Own Hand Upon Papyrus: A New Look at the Joseph Smith Papyri&quot; by Charles M. Larson)And why was Smith given a translation in 17th century English, which surely bore no relation to either the language of America in the 1820's or to the language of the original authors?It is also hard to understand why, even with that seemingly &quot;absolute&quot; quality control, well over 3,000 changes have been made to the text since it was first published.And it *still* contains errors such as this &quot;prophecy&quot; concerning the birth of Christ:&quot;... he shall be born of Mary, at Jerusalem which is the land of our forefathers ...&quot;(Alma 7:10)(It need hardly be said that Jesus was born in Bethlehem rather than Jerusalem, and that Jerusalem itself is a city, not a &quot;land&quot;.)The truth of the matter is that this is not a &quot;divinely inspired&quot; work at all, but a (...) version of an earlier novel called &quot;The Manuscript Found&quot;, by one Solomon Spaulding, (not to be confused with another of Spaulding's works - &quot;The Manuscript Story&quot; - which has nothing to do with the BOM).So, if you enjoy badly written adventures in a poor imitation of the language of the King James Bible, you may well enjoy the Book of Mormon.If you don't, you won't.Just one last point - it has been asked &quot;If the book has been the backbone of a religion for over 100 years and yet it was a scam, would it have gone uncovered for so long and would so many people have believed it to be true?&quot;On the face of it, these are perfectly good questions, which have been asked numerous times by people on both sides of the discussion. The answers are:Firstly, the question of the authenticity of the BOM is nothing new, on the contrary, it has been in doubt ever since the book was first published.Secondly, there are far more people around the world who believe in flying saucers than have even heard of the BOM - but that doesn't., of itself, mean that flying saucers actually exist, does it."},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"\\"All false doctrines are fables.

As many of the &quot;believers&quot; have pointed out already, you can get it for free. So why, oh why is it for sale here for a mere $0.95? That is a puzzle for even the most faithful mormon (as you can see by some of their comments here). Well, it's really not to do with the value of the book (as I said, $0.95 is a little much for the book but hey, you do wind up with some paper (I dunno, table coasters, handiwipes,,,use your imagination).Back to the &quot;why just $.095?&quot; question. Two answers...Reason one: Promotion. First rule of business (yes, the mormon church is a business....a HUGE business empire), advertise your wares anywhere and everywhere. Displaying the book on one of the most popular websites selling products is no accident. The web is where people come to look at things. The mormon CEO's don't really want or need to sell a book to anyone. Just look for the TV commercials...they're clamoring to give the book away for free. They just want you to read the book. They'd give it away free on the dot com sales sites but ya can't just give away things for free on sites that are designed to produce income. Ya gotta sell it. They really don't care about the $.095. It probably costs more to make a book than that anyway and trust me, they're not trying to recoup their losses with a mere 95 cent charge for the book. And they're not doing a fire sale because of overstocks. All they want to do is get as many people as possible to read the book. Eventually they strike gold and some poor person reads and believes and ends up giving them 10% of his income for the rest of his/her life. That produces the revenue that buys the &quot;church&quot; a lot more books and then some. Be it one person out of a thousand readers or one out of every ten thousand. I don't know what the profit margain is but I guarantee the mormon leaders and accountants do.Reason number two for the price tag: I actually learned this devious tactic as a 19 year old while I was a mormon missionary. We were required to peddle as many books as possible during our 16 waking hours of non-paid missionary work each day. Even way back then, they were doing the $.095 fire sale thing. But it had nothing to do with book revenue. We were actually told that the point of distributing the book to others for $0.95 had nothing to do with recouping printing costs. They were happy to just give the book away for free except for one thing. We were instructed that if you give something to someone for free, they won't value it. It will wind up in the trash can more often than not. So you tack on an optimum price that isn't so high that people won't buy it, but just high enough that they won't throw it away.So there you have it...two explanations to the puzzling riddle of why there's a $0.95 fire sale for a free book of mormon.So, back to the review. I wish I could say the book is original but it's not. Historians have uncovered evidence that the author got his subject material about the roots of the american indian from other sources (scientists have proven through DNA studies that modern day american-indians are not of jewish descent). And I wish I could say it was well written but unfortunately, it isn't despite all the revisions it has gone through. The really interesting thing is not the book, it's the people who believe it's real. The book is boring but harmless if you read it with a sane mind. And it provides interesting insights into the minds of the mormon faithful.The mormon faithful love to quote a passage in the book telling people to read the book and then ask God if it's true or not. You'll see a lot of that in their reviews (or &quot;testimonies&quot;) here. Most of their converts do just that. They read the book and somewhere through the book they get a good feeling which over the passage of time, gets pumped up from a good feeling to a personal vision or direct revelation from God. The story gets bigger every time they tell it. This is the foundation of their conversion process. Why does it work so well? Think about it. Aren't most of us looking for some kind of indication that we are special? Wouldn't it be really cool if God talked to you personally? So here's how you can start your own religion:Write a &quot;feel good&quot; book. Make it sound like the bible as much as possible. Aw, what the heck, let's just pluck whole passages directly from the bible, nobody owns the rights to the bible anyway. Find someone who needs to feel special, give them the book (or sell it for $.095 on the internet), then tell them that if they read it and get a good feeling while reading it, that it is God talking to you and letting you know it's true. The reader thumbs through the &quot;feel good&quot; Biblish type book, they get an occasional warm fuzzy, and Voila! You just got your first convert. Now you get his/her 10%, print a few more books and throw the rest in the bank. Then you get your new convert to spend as much time as possible peddling the book to others. Now bake this process for 175 years and you've got a few million people under your belt and a lot of money and power. Re-write your history and your rules as times change and you can perpetuate your religion as long as you want.Conclusion: Don't buy the book for the read (unless you're really curious and want to understand the basis of a modern day cult). Just buy the book to support amazon.com. Amazon is a great company and you can get just about anything you want here. Including revelations from God....if that's what you're looking for...."},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"Whether or not one believes this book's outlandish claims, this book is BORING!!! \\"And it came to pass this ... , And it came to pass that...\\" Truly mind-numbing and uninspired text.

First, it is a great American work of fiction (sometimes plagarized from earlier works. Questions being asked during the Great Awakening were being asked by Joseph Smith and others. Which church is true? Where did the lost tribes of Israel go? Where did the American Indians come from? If polygamy was okay in the Old Testament, why is it not today? What is America's role in Christ's work, especially in light of the concept of Manifest Destiny? Etc. This book has a desire to answer those and other questions. Second, the book (along with the other books of the Latter-Day Saints) guides the \\"Christian\\" farther FROM the Scriptures especially in areas where God Himself is made to have had a very \\"human past,\\" that God Himself and not the Holy Spirit empregnated Mary, that the dead can be redeemed because of the work established by Jesus when he descended into the place of the dead and made orderly the work of redeeming the dead, and the sealing of marriage for eternity which contradicts Scipture that states that there are no marriages in heaven. In all honestly, one must believe the Bible or the Book of Mormon, or spend their lives \\"interpeting\\" the Scripture as being corrupt (the use of the King James Version of the Bible as the authentic text of the Bible instead of the Hebrew/Aramaic and Greek texts is puzzling). Finally, the tremendous power of the Mormon priests to sell one's salvation, marriage, etc. focused on the President of the Church is tyrannical and finds no merit in Scripture. In his power, he has replaced Christ and is more powerful in Mormon theology than the Roman Catholic Primate, the Pope. Finally, the experience-oriented nature of the Mormon Church shows the hunger for genuine Christianity that has a strong experiential base as well as an intellectual one.

The book claims to be a translation from gold plates of a record about an ancient civilization that was visited by Jesus Christ. In reality, the book and the story of how it came to be are obviously fabrications by Joseph Smith. Reasons the book has lasted this long without being debunked include the church's revision of it's own history, the cult-like mentality of Mormon culture, and that Mormons are taught to censor themselves and avoid \\"anti-Mormon\\" literature that would reveal uncomplimentary facts surrounding the history of the Book of Mormon, the church, and it's founder, Joseph Smith.Mormons will ask you to ignore that facts and \\"look into your heart\\" to see determine if the book is true.

The Book of Mormon recently voted one of the nations top 20 most influential books, Joseph Smith is Americas greatest religious reformers. Anyone who is a believer in the divinity of Jesus Christ should find this a very inspiring book. The book is very Christ centered which certainly shows Joseph Smiths very deep belief in Christian ideas. The book is highly complex and shows forth astounding consistency (with some acceptions). Although some of the stories are shallow and not really entertaining and the characters fit into simple categories of being good guys or bad guys, the story as a whole is complex and captivating. I have seen that many people bring up the fact that Mark Twain was not impressed with the book. I believe that Mark Twain was likely jealous that he could not produce something this complex. Tom Sawyer and Hucklberry Finn are great but nothing in comparison with the Book of Mormon. Nor can those who bring this up write anything close to it. And I know some superstitious people think the Book of Mormon is inspired of Satan, that is as superstitious as an astrologer. I would recommend the mountain of recent studies done on the Book of Mormon. From a very pro-Mormon point of view I would recommend the works done by the Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies (FARMS). They are many times apolegetic and fall into the same ridiculous category as Christian apologists that actually think religious claims can be verified with physical evidence, but they have produced a mountain of interesting literary studies into the Book of Mormon. From a more secular view of the Book of Mormon I would recommend works that have been published by Signature Books. I also want to bring up one more point about this book. I have seen a lot of people bring up the recent DNA studies showing that the American Indians come from Asia and not the Middle East as the book claims. Although this is true I find it odd most of these people are strict Bible believers and don't realize that the same type of DNA studies show that humans are much older than Adam and Eve and DNA also helps in verifying organic evolution.

It's a loaded question, but also a necessary one that you must honestly ask yourself during your lifetime. If you had discovered a book that contained every principle of truth that God mercifully gave to His children so that they may have a way of returning to His presence one day, and gain exhaultation, would you ignore it? Would you at least give such a book, claiming to contain these truths, a sincere one-time read-through, just to see for yourself what you think? I can only ask... Read the book for yourself and then judge righteuously the contents of its pages. Make no quick, judgemental, fearful remarks before you've read it from cover to cover. The book will either cost you nothing, or next to nothing to obtain---a bit of your time is mostly what you will need to spend. Your time is precious, there's no disputing that, but putting your time to good use can change your life for better and open the doors of happiness to you for eternity.

And finally prayed long and hard every day asking for the divinity of it's truth to cleanse and wash over me so that I might follow with all my heart to know it's truth.But it hasn't happened.

First off divinely translated circa 1830 into English from the heavens themselves, why does this book read like a cheap King James clone? In 1830 we spoke a modern English. No verily's, thou's, lo's, wherefore's, hark's, or shalt's... no none of such language was in vogue. Say when was that language in style, and by whom? Oh yes, that's right, by John Q. Public in the middle ages. Say when was the King James bible translated? Oh yes, that same time. I wonder why they used verily's, thou's, wilt's, wherefore's, hark's, and hitherto's. Oh yes because the goal was to make the Bible assessable to the public. Translated from it's Greek, and Hebrew, and Latin texts into the English Parlance of the day. But the book of mormon wisely realized of course in 1830 we don't speak that way, so why was it written that way?Say that book is pretty thick, I wonder how many golden plates it took to hold the entire volume. Who carried it?C'Mon outside of the ... content the story of it's existence doesn't even have a good enough beat to dance to."},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"I love this book.

Wow! Don't they have anything better to do? From the reviews, it looks as if people either like the Book of Mormon or they don't - there's not much middle ground.As with any book, read it without any pre-conceived notions and decide for yourself if you like it and/or believe it is true.You can request a free copy of the Book of Mormon, Bible, and some great videos about things like Christ, and Families. You can also watch video clips of TV ads, short videos explaining basic beliefs, and videos of Church leaders speaking on many different topics. You don't have to believe anything, but if you are curious, it doesn't hurt to learn enough so that you can make your own decision. Don't believe everything people tell you. You decide.

It wasn't until my third time through that I began to see how it all fit together. It was also about that time when I suddenly realized that it is impossible that this book could be a fabrication...Because of the religious and moral implications of the content of the book, many parties have and probably always will greet it with hostile criticism. Don't be fooled by them.Give the book a chance. You will not be sorry you did."},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"In going through the many reviews of this book one has to be astonished at the so few instances of people sitting on the fence. They either love it or want to destroy it along with any hope that it ever existed. Has there been such a book to accomplish this in society? If you think this book is common, then you are sticking your head in the sand.One thing to notice: The naysayers of this book seem to have a common thread of disenchantment. I won't go through all the negative remarks that are similar, but when a group of people say the same thing while overly attacking, one has to way that fact in deciding whether they are credible. Have you ever given credibility to anyone on TV or in real life that has nothing good to say? There has got to be something in the book that they like; yet they never admit to such or else they haven't read it.So why the depth of distain for this book? The main principle of the Book of Mormon is Faith, Repentance, Baptism and Laying On Of Hands For The Gift Of The Holy Ghost. Did the naysayers miss that? Also, it was hidden away by God to come forth for our society today, so that we might remember the covenants that our fathers had made with God. A person looking at the Book of Mormon with a pessimistic eye will certainly miss this and many other great things contained in the book.The Book of Mormon is a feat in and of itself. It will not be proved true or untrue through evidence, but only through spiritually pondering, studying, praying and listening. I think the naysayers are so focused on their rhetoric they have yet to listen.And that brings up another point. Listening! Isn't that an incredible concept? The prophets and their people in the Book of Mormon actually listened for the spirit, which means that we have the ability here and now to listen also. Isn't this really what all the naysayers are objecting to? Is it that they really don't believe that the Lord God is able to speak to us at this time, therefore it can't be true?There are many evidences for the Book of Mormon and they are readily available to anyone who wishes to look. I'm sure anyone who looks with pure intent will find a better understanding within themselves as to what they eventually believe and what they don't. Isn't that what a testimony is? Knowing what you believe and why can only bring you closer to your faith.So you can't judge a book by its cover. I doubt that many of the naysayers have actually sat down and read, pondered and prayed about the book. Instead they prefer to read books advocating how and why it is wrong, thus they prefer to have a different kind of prophet for their faith: themselves, or another of like mind. It seems odd that each of the naysayers believes that he or she has the right to tell anyone what to believe. Is this in accordance to Galatians 5 and Philippians 2:3 in the King James Bible?Contrast Galatians 5 and Philippians 2:3 with the yeasayers of these reviews. Which do you feel comes closer to the image of Christ?I hope that you will be able to see all the force and negativity against you ordering this book as an attack on your intelligence. I hope that you will not listen to negativism and listen to those, which have the spirit of the quoted scriptures above, and maybe you might, through the Book of Mormon, find the image of Christ being magnified within you as you pray and ponder the lessons throughout the pages of this great book.There is not a book that offers so much peace, hope and joy. Isn't that what our society needs? Isn't that what you and I need?"},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"I tried to read the book of Mormon, here in Brazil.

It mentions pre-Columbian horses, chariots, steel, barley and other items that were not existant in the Americas until after Columbus. It also indicates that the American Indians are descendants of the Israelites and so are of Semitic origin (a 19th century belief).

They are scared to death that a person may actually read the Book of Mormon and find out for themselves that it is a true account of an ancient spiritual people who left Jerusalem around the year 600 B.C. and arrived by boat somewhere in Central America. The most significant part is when the risen Jesus Christ visits and teaches this people after his death.Is it so hard to believe that there are additional records of scripture not found in the New and Old Testament? We know for a fact that there are many books which were not included into the Bible (the bible wasn't put together until the 4th century A.D. by Bishop Eusebius. The Apostles who wrote the books were not around to say what should go into its compilation. So anyone claiming that when the Book of Revelations states \\"not to add to this book,\\" saying it means there should never be additional scripture, is very uneducated and misinformed since Revelations was written before the New Testament was even around and chronologically would not even be the last book.)The Book of Mormon is an amazing additional testament to the Old and New Testaments that has helped millions to learn and know more about Jesus and his teachings and solidify that he is the Christ."},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"I can promise you that if you will read this book and then pray to God - the Father of all, the God of Abraham and Issac- about what you have read and the truths contained therein,He will send a feeling of warmth and peace, a feeling that only He can send.

Mormom is simply the man who collaborated multiple books into one. Every single event mentioned in the Book of Mormon really did happen. The verses are very clear about who is to be worshipped- Jesus Christ.The message is simply this: Serve others as Christ has served you. We are all children of God, and we all chose to come down to earth to prove ourselves worthy to live in the Celestial Kingdom and hopefully make planets of our own one day. Life doesn't end when our body dies. Our spirit lives on. We continue to grow and learn. But what we do now determines where we end up after death. For eternity.

You either love it or hate it, finding it threataning enough to crusade against it. Funny how perspectives change with time. Who knows, maybe LDS is the new Catholic...I agree with other comments that the merits of the Book of Mormon should be considered independently from whichever side of the fence you side on doctrinally. As literature the book is rather stunning really. I would submit that if this book is not the word of God, Joseph Smith deserves the apologies of English Literature programs across the nation. If this is merely good fiction then the book has been grossly underrated. You only need to read several pages to get a sense of how difficult writing such a text would be, especially for a third grade educated farm boy in 1820. In that sense, I don't understand how anyone can give it a one star rating. It's either God's word (5 stars) or one of the most massive literary products in US history (5 stars).Either way, a one star rating on here seems like sour grapes.

In the Editorial Review section, a thorough explaination is included as well as the testimony of those who saw the book (12 all together, if Joseph Smith is counted). The Book contains many doctrinal treasures, eloquent prose as well as poetry and is well organized. The prophets utilized many complex writing forms, and each prophet has something to contribute. I highly recommend reading the record of Jesus' visit to the American Continent as well as King Benjamin's speech. For those who would like evidence for authenticity, there is plenty. LDS scholars answer critics regularly. I have a college education and understand logical fallacies, and I say that the LDS responses and proofs are more than adequate to satisfy one's need for reasons to believe.

Aside from the really bad literary style (Mark Twain was being kind when he called it Chloroform in print) the Book of Mormon is so obviously fiction that nobody with any knowledge could believe in it. Consider:-Read Ether 9 verses 17-19. There are 13 specific items listed here as having been owned by the &quot;Jaredites&quot;, pre-Columbian Jewish residents of the new world. Of those 13 items, only 2 (Gold and Silver) existed in Pre-Columbian America. To assert that Elephants, Horses, Silk etc. were here at that time flies in the face of all that has been learned about the Americas in the past 5 centuries. It is patently false.-The final battles scene where everyone is wiped out. I've read a bit about military history. With any slight knowledge of the ebb and flow of battle, one realizes that any battle or war will end with one side or the other losing completely, unless they can come to some kind of terms or escape. There is a cascading effect. As one side loses it has fewer resources, so it loses more. So the battle will end in complete victory for one side, utter defeat for the other. Yet in the Book of Mormon you have millions of people, even women and kids, duking it out until only the two kings are left. I submit that this is a military impossibility, thereby rendering the Book of Mormon a literary impossibility.-The Book purports to be a history of Jewish people. Jewish people have always taken their core rituals with them wherever they go. They all celebrate Passover and the other Jewish days. Yet in the Book of Mormon these devout Jews are never referred to as performing any of these things. Very unlikely.So you are left with a book that is dumb to read and obviously untrue. Why waste your time with it?"},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"If you want a straight review of the Book of Mormon as a book for you to buy and read, I'd say \\"buy it.\\" It holds your interest from the very beginning. There are some parts that run a little slow or confusing (text from ancient prophets \\"like\\" Isaiah), but the remaining parts run very quickly and keep your interest. In fact, sometimes you will find yourself unable to put it down. Read the stories about Alma and his son. They are especially interesting. Also, anything in Mosiah.If you're looking for a more personal commentary on the Book of Mormon, I'd have to say that the doctrine and principles contained within its pages have changed my life--for the better. The people who lived in ancient times were not much different than I am. They had the same doubts, fears, questions and trials that I have had. I use it as a guide to help get me through each day, just as I do the Bible or any other book of scripture.

The scriptural style of the Book of Mormon is interesting, but a little overdone. Although it starts out exciting, there were a lot of loose ends that constantly had my 'feasibility' alert going.As the hero, Nephi, and his family are leaving Jeruselem to go to the American continent, Nephi goes back to kill and rob a man. Nephi thinks he is justified in killing this guy, Laban, because he thinks he is more righteous than the victim and he wants the victim's records. He said God told him to do it. This was a bit over the top for me. It sounds too similar to the true stories concerning LDS fundementalists that Jon Krakauer wrote about in his book, \\"Under the Banner of Heaven\\". The Lafferty's were locked up for their crimes in 1984. But, in the story, Nephi is praised by his family and by God. I just wasn't convinced. I like the hero to be somewhat believeable.Nephi kills Laban to get some brass plates that supposedly held the Old Testament of the Bible. When the author, Joseph Smith, plagerized chapters from the King James Version of the Bible and included them in this Book of Mormon, he didn't know that years later, translation errors would be discovered in the King James Version of the Old Testament. So, he included them in the parts that quoted these brass plates. These translation errors, then, ended up in the Book of Mormon.The story goes on about cities of millions of people, and wars of 100's of thousands of people who had armor and swords. It says the people had chariots and horses. This stuff is a little too far fetched, even for fiction. No archealogical evidence of these cities, wars, armor, swords, chariots or horses exists on this continent for this time period. Even the Viking colonies, which were established on this continent in roughly the same time period, are made believable by obvious evidence today. This stuff is just too far out there.The book is actually about a group of people it calls 'Lamanites'. They are called that because they are all decendents from the hero's brother, Laman. The book says that this group eventually became the modern Native American Indian. Since, Laman was semetic (from Israel), his progeny would be semetic as well, of course. In 1824, when he wrote the book, the author had no way of knowing that the DNA studies would be done. So, you have to give him a break for that. However, recent DNA studies have shown that the Native American Indian has his origins in Siberia. Now that this is widely known, it strongly dates the book and limits it as an enjoyable read.In the past, the LDS church has made quite a few changes to the Book of Mormon. They've especially tried to take out some of the more obvious racist wording, although much is still there. They have actually changed many of their historical works and claims over the years. Maybe they will consider updating a few more places in the Book of Mormon to make the book a little more believeable."},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"I was going to read the Book of Mormon but thought, \\"Hey! Why not wait until the movie comes out?\\" After long last, the movie came out about a year ago but it was not a very good movie. Most of the actors wore table cloths for costumes and had SuperCuts hair-do's.In all fairness, the movie only depicted a first segment of the Book of Mormon. Maybe as the further chapters are filmed, it might get better. Kinda like a REVERSE of the Star Wars syndrome where the more movies they made, the progressively worse they got and maybe the Book of Mormon gets really interesting later on.I am giving the Book of Mormon 2 stars, not because of the book, but because the star of the BoM movie, Noah Danby, is pretty hot and has done gay nude scenes on Showtime's \\"Queer as Folks.\\""},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"You can discover by looking at the people endorsing it. Do you see a single positive endorsement by anyone who is not at the same time zealously proclaiming the message of the Mormon Church? The great religious texts of the world such as the Koran, the Bible, the Torah, and the Tao Te Ching have messages that resonate strongly across denominational lines. They are enjoyed by theists and non-theists alike; their beauty and insightfulness recognized even by those not professing allegience to their tenets. Not so with the Book of Mormon.If you are an adherent of or are interested in investigating the Mormon faith, this book may be of interest to you. If you are, however, searching for great literature, keep looking. Even as an adherent of the Mormon faith, I found this book to be tedium defined. The author's hackneyed attempts at effecting a King James Bible-type prose comes across flat. The plot is thin and full of holes, defying common sense as well as historical records, and is populated with one-dimensional characters.The one area where this book does generate interest is as a chronicle of 19th century America. It illustrates nicely the racial prejudices of the era (although the most blatantly bigoted material has now, gratefully, been removed by church censors). It also provides insight into the religious and political mindset of 1820's America. It takes a stance on the relevant religious issues of that era such as infant baptism, trinitarianism, polygamy, and grace vs. works in salvation. Interestingly, its stance on many of these issues directly contradicts current Mormon teachings on the subjects. It also looks at many of the political philsophies from that era, advocating such causes as manifest destiny and anti-freemasonry. Thus while utterly implausible as a record of ancient America, the Book of Mormon provides considerable insight into the mindset of early the United States.Ultimately, this book falls far short of the mark as a religious classic, with very little literary or spiritual merit. As a historical document, on the other hand, it does reward those willing to plod through its repetitive prose and ridiculous stories with a certain amount insight into the religious and political climate of 1820's United States."},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"I am a new convert to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, and OVERJOYED! About 6 months ago I was absolutly appauled by the church. My family is Mormon, and I have had, and do have Mormon friends. I could not understand how these people could be so \\"mislead\\" by something that I truly believed was false. I was out to prove it wrong, to \\"save\\" the people I loved from it. I was angry about it, hateful towards (not the people) but the church and the religion.One day I took a good look at myself. I had been a non-denominational christian all my life, and most of my friends were christian. They had the same ideas about the church as I did (in fact thats where I got many of my misconceptions from). I realized it wasn't right to be so angry, and I no longer wished to assaciate myself with hateful people. I had prayed about weather or not the Book of Mormon was the word of God several times, and instead of getting that warm fuzzy feeling the missionaries had talked about, I got sick to my stomach, so of course I thought God was steering me away from it. Ultiamtely, I realized I could not get the truth (or a positive feeling) about the church the way I was constantly reading material opposing it. I couldn't get the truth from people who are angry at, or fearful of, the church. I had to look inside, and I did. The people who I thought I needed to save saved me! The Book of Mormon saved me.

I was familiar with your \\"basic\\" Christian beliefs and dogmas. I had a nagging feeling from an early age though, that something was lacking in the traditional Protestant doctrine.

Two Jewish families are involved and their journeying and travellings are told including the hardships and challenges they faced. They eventually reached a coast, built a ship and launched it upon the seas and were carried by currents/winds to another continent. There they settled,inter-married and expanded their numbers. Their history over many generations and centuries is told, including their disputations, factions, and wars with one another. One group remained faithful to their teaching about a Saviour to come, and lived moral and righteous lives, while the much larger group became decadent and unrighteous. The resurrected Lord Jesus Christ came to visit the righteous group, called Nephites, and delivered the same teachings as He had done during His mortal ministry in Judea in the eastern hemisphere. Now in the western hemisphere, Jesus Christ again calls twelve apostles and others to deliver the Gospel message. However, the Nephites are up against a disbelieving and aggressive host of people who have great superiority of numbers. Eventually the remnants of the righteous group are all killed, but not before the last one remaining, a prophet called Moroni buries a record of the history of this people, which had been engraven on metal plates, on a hillside for a future generation to find. This sacred record is the Book of Mormon.A compelling read to those who have an open mind about God-given revelation in modern times.

Mostly, they make me sad for those people who have entirely missed the purpose of this book. Some have focused on what they perceive to be historical inaccuracies, bringing a self-imposed preclusion to the great spiritual teachings that would otherwise be available to them. Others seem simply close-minded and unwilling to be taught- \\"stiffnecked,\\" to use a Book of Mormon word- seeking solely to find fault and looking for any bit of content that they deem questionable, in an effort to tear down the Church. Still others have viewed the book in terms of entertainment, discarding its value because it didn't provide the instant gratification that the average reader has come to expect in this day.Firstly, scriptural books, of any religion, were not written to entertain. If you are looking for a quick, flashy, read, then you should pick up a John Grisham novel. If, instead, you seek a book rich in spiritual doctrine, to be studied and pored over for many years for its timeless lessons, then read the Book of Mormon. Better yet, if you want God's word, and an additional witness that Jesus is the Christ, than read the Book of Mormon. I have. I continue to do so. I have taught many Sunday School classes by its precepts. My wife and I read it together every night. It has given depth and meaning to my life, and continually reminds me of that which is good, beautiful, and uplifting.The Book of Mormon is not entertainment. Although it contains many historical records of the peoples of the ancient Americas, it is not a history book. It was never intended to be read as a comparative work, as the basis for scholarly theology. And lastly, it was not \\"written\\" by one man. It is a collection of writings of many different ancient prophets, translated by Joseph Smith. You will not find in it the refinement and polish of great authors, reknowned for their profound prose. These were ordinary men, called of God, quite aware of their imperfections, and readily admitting of them. However, the spirit of what they say is unmistakable. It edifies and instructs in a most sublime way.Simply put, this is a religious book of scripture. Its purpose is to invite all to come unto Christ. In terms of importance, it is like the Koran for Muslims, or the Torah for Jews. It is the keystone of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. It is held sacred by its members. As Moroni, the last prophet in the Book of Mormon states, read, ponder, and ask God \\"with real intent\\" if it is His word, and He will make it known unto you. I have put that challenge to the test, and I have come to know, by my own experience, that it is a true book. I love this book.

Nephi wanted another guy's book but the guy wouldn't give it to him so Nephi waited until the guy was drunk and passed out and then Nephi chopped off his head and stole his book. He ran home and after looking through his new book he found out it was the first few books of the Bible that had been written up to 600BC. Now you may think that to go through all the trouble of murdering someone, and them robbing them and finding out all you got was a stupid Bible would be a disappointment, but Nephi was a bit of a religious nut, so he was pretty excited about what he scored.Then Nephi and his family sailed to America with his new book and started a Christian church (using the stolen scriptures as a guide) in America. Nobody is living in America at the time because God preserved it for Nephi and his people. Over time Nephi populated all of America with his family and friends on the boat (kinda like the Noah story) which is a bit of a stretch, but we'll give Joseph Smith some dramitic license here because he needs large populations for the rest of his story.Nephi has a mean brother named Laman, and Laman and his buddies split off from Nephi and his buddies and they form their own tribe called Lamanites. Nephi and his buddies are called Nephites. God hates the Lamanites for some reason and curses them with dark skin and makes them look and dress like Indians. Now, the Nephites keep trying to get the Lamanites to join their church, but the Lamanites don't want to. They prefer to throw spears, live in tee-pees, have sex, get drunk, nap all day and do all the things Indians like to do. The Nephites are white skinned, God fearing Christians, who like to go to church, pray, build temples, etc. This sets up a clash of cultures between the lazy, savage dark-skinned Lamanites, and the god fearing, hard working, white skinned Nephites.The Nephite and Lamanite populations grow over time into populations of millions on each side. They cover all of the Americas from Alaska to the Southern tip of South America. They go to war constantly over religion. Sometimes the Nephites win and they are able to set up their Christian run government, sometimes the Lamanites win and they set up their Indian style, non-religious government except without casinos. The Nephites send missionaries among the Lamanites (much like the mormon missionaries today) and if a Lamanite Indian joins the Nephite church God turns them 'White and Delightsome'.This all leads up to a final battle in which the Nephites lose. The Lamanites butcher all of the Nephites except for one, his name was Moroni. Moroni gathered up all of the journals that the Nephites had kept on Golden Plates and buried them in a hill in rural New York so that whoever found them would know about the extinct Nephite people. Joseph Smith dug them up in the 1820s and translated them into the book you are reading. The Lamanites continue to live without Nephites or any other white man around them for another 1000 years before Columbus comes. These Lamanites are the Native Americans we see today!! Pretty cool huh.The plot sounds exciting, but it is actually pretty boring. The cool bloody battles are seperated by long boring stretches. There are a couple cool parts, like the guy getting his head chopped off by Nephi and another part where a Nephite missionary named Ammon goes postal on a bunch of guys and chops off their arms and then puts all the bloody severed arms in a basket and gives the basket to his friend as a present. I think Ammon needed some professional help, but he is treated as kind of a loveable psycho. The handful of entertaining violent parts doesn't make up for the tediousness of the bulk of the book. Joseph Smith could've benefited from an editor. His writing style shows him to be the uneducated farmer that he was.There are also some anachronisms and unrealistic parts in the book that show Joseph did not do his research. At one point, Jesus gives 3 Nephites immortality. These three Nephites supposedly walked the earth forever and still walk it to this day, yet they are not mentioned again in the book. Where did they go? The book is filled with weird supernatural, magic stuff that doesn't fit the main theme of bloody ethnic wars and religious intolerance. Also, their are some anachronistic goofs, such as several King James Bible quotes that were first written in 1611AD yet the Book of Mormon has them being used in America between 600BC and 400AD. Also, he mentions horses and other animals that did not exist in America before Columbus. Oops, a little research on Joseph's part could have avoided these goofs.Finally, my biggest nitpick is the idea of Native Americans being the cursed descendants of the godless Lamanites and their dark skin was punishment from God is just a bit offensive in this day and age. I realize Joseph lived in a time when such racist assumptions were common, but that just proves the book hasn't aged well. I'm not the overly PC type, but the racial theories in The Book of Mormon are a little too close to 'The Birth of a Nation' for my tastes.These problems unfortunately overshadow the cool, bloody battles, and violent religious extremism that is at the heart of the book. Joseph Smith could have cut out the boring tedious parts and the magic supernatural stuff, eliminated the goofs, and only included the fun stuff and the book would be 1/4 of it's size and it would have been much more fun.Overall, a disappointment."},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"quotes extracted from sections of Moroni- Be peaceable followers of Christ obtain hope by which you enter the rest of the Lord.

It changed my life for the better. It had more impact on me that any other influence in my entire life.The Book of Mormon is an amazing book, and could not possibly be the product of a conspiracy--its just too well-done. The Book of Mormon compliments the Bible like an additional movement of an unfinished symphony. Doctrinally they explain one another, and they are consistent in theme, the dominant of which is that Jesus Christ is indeed the Lord and Savior all ALL the world, and that mankind may live a happier life when they are righteous.If you are already a Christian, this need not threaten your testimony of the Bible. It will augment the Bible and strenghthen your faith.If you are not already a Christian, and perhaps have found the Bible hard to read and understand, this will give you a second chance.

The Bible testifies of the Savior and the Book of Mormon sustains that testimony. I know the Book of Mormon is a true book.The Book of Mormon gives accounts of three different peoples who came to the American continent thousands of years ago. Those who kept the records wrote their testimonies of Jesus Christ and the commandments of our Heavenly Father. They often wrote of the consequences people faced when they did not keep these commandments. If we follow these commandments, then we can live peaceful lives, even though we will have trials we must endure and overcome.The highlight of this book is when the Savior visited the Nephites after His death and resurrection. His great love for all of us is illustrated in His great love for these people. He lets each of the 2500 people present come and feel the prints of the nails in His hands and feet. He heals the sick among them and blesses each of their little children.The Book of Mormon has changed my life and it will change yours too if you read it and live by the teachings found therein."},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"I will admit right off that I am LDS. This book has had more effect on my life than any other book. I know that it is the word of God! (that is not a conditioned response, it is a genuine and personal response given after thorough investigation and experience) As you SINCERELY (meaning: without your mind made up that it isn't true) read this book. You will experience a greater happiness than words can express. As with the Bible the Book of Mormon confirms that Jesus Christ exists and that He is coming again. Extensive time could be wasted arguing archeology, science, doctrine and history to prove or disprove the book. The best way to know for sure that this book is true is if you read it for yourself and make your own educated opinion; instead of taking the opinion of a biased anti-mormon. Just because a fellow reviewer read the book, not wanting it to be true, prayed and didn't get an immediate answer should not make your mind up for you. There is no special voodoo power that captures you as you read and forces you into the church. However, don't be surprised if as you read you feel more joy, peace and love than you have ever felt before in your life. Remember, these things are the fruits of the Spirit of God. (Galatians 5:22) No man could have written this. I know it is true, but I cannot force my opinion on anyone. Read it and you will see that God has once again established His kingdom on the earth to usher in His Glorious second coming.

Moroni kneeling in prayer before raising the Title of Liberty to inspire his army in the defense of their country. You'll witness nations rise and fall as they follow and then forget God. Accounts of courage, loyalty, and love will inspire you. You'll be astounded as faithful Christians are rescued from death on the eve of our Savior's birth.

I am a practicing Mormon and I attend the Mormon Temples. I challenge all Mormons to step outside the box and study early Mormon documents including this book. Don't take it for truth based on emotional verbal testament. Several leaders of the Mormon church have mentioned that this book must be heavily scrutinized given the claim that it is the most correct book on earth. That is a very daunting claim to make. The book claims to be a literal history of several races of people that inhabited the Americas prior to the arrival of the Europeans. Claims like this force the work into other realms of investigation. Not only is it a religious text but it also is a history of the Americas and it's founding populations; therefore, it must be evaluated just as we would any other historical document in existence.Scholarly investigations, by both Mormon and non-Mormon individuals, into the book from outside sources such as archeology, linguistics, anthropology and human genetics provide no historicity for the book whatsoever. I find it odd that a manuscript of this magnitude would appear 1400 years after it was written and yet no other manuscript or record of any type in the world has been found to support it. It is a singular work. I find it perplexing that the advanced, old world descended populations described in the book left absolutely no trace of their existence. Many Mormons now preach that the populations described in the book were isolated and small. This is not what the book itself teaches. It describes populations that numbered in the millions and covered the face of the entire hemisphere. For these populations to leave no trace of their 1000 year existence is just not possible.I wrestle with this book every day of my life. I deeply appreciate my church but we simply must accept the truth. After all, we claim our church is the only true and living church on the face of the earth. We must then embody TRUTH!! This book was written by Brother Joseph and his associates and I believe for a good reason - to teach of Jesus. If Mormons can begin to view the book as a religious text and NOT an actual history of the Americas perhaps this might help us cope with the fact that the Mormon church is one of many in the world and does not have a particular vestige of truth and divinity."},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"Although based entirely on false claims and blatant historical inaccuracy, the Book of Mormon is an interesting work of fiction!

Believing that these books were probably written as fiction for the promotion of the Christian faith, he nonetheless in good faith placed them in his translation of the Bible, advising interested Christians to read them while keeping a suspicious eye. I am afraid that \\"The Book of Mormon,\\" while maintaining a facade of piety, is only fiction promoted to the destruction of Christian faith.The casual Christian reader of The Book of Mormon must be warned that while the book claims to be written by inspiration from the Christian Triune God, the god revealed in it one that is foreign to us. He is neither Triune (three persons in one God) nor one personality ~ there are in fact many gods apparently to be seen in the universe and Mormon theology wishes to you how to become one yourself. Any true Christian can see the problems there. The lies and deceptions in this book are hidden behind a veil of pious-sounding phrases and ideas, so as to make the book all the more attractive to real Christians. And there is no doubt that to our sinful flesh the book is attractive - as it was to America of the 1830s. It offers answers to many questions of the era it was written; Where did the Anerican Indians come from? What happened to the lost 10 tribes of Israel? What are people to think about \\"dark-skinned\\" people, slaves? All these questions are answered in The Book of Mormon - albiet completely unsatisfactorally.The version of the book that I am reading is written as Joseph Smith \\"translated\\" it by peering into his magical stone. (Again, an observant Christian sees the stark contrast to the NT.) It seems oddly King-James-ish and difficult and yet more modern at the same time.

I also want you to know that I like Mormons, and even love a few Mormons, whom I consider some of the finest people who ever walked in shoe leather, as my grandmother used to say.Also, check my one-star reviews of books by Mormon \\"scholars,\\" such as Hugh Nibley (World of the Jaredites), John Sorensen (in \\"Echoes and Evidences for the Book of Mormon\\"), and Milton R. Hunter's books.I also reviewed Grant Palmer's book, \\"An Insiders View of Mormon Origins.\\"An Insider's View of Mormon OriginsSo now for the facts:Joseph Smith demonstrated his ability to write Book of Mormon scripture by composing the scripture-sounding \\"Preface\\" (now dropped) as well as the two testimonies (originally at the end of the book). Note the following:PART OF THE PREFACE TO THE BOOK OF MORMON COMPOSED BY JOSEPH SMITHAs many false reports have been circulated respecting the following work, and also many unlawful measures taken by evil designing persons to destroy me, and also the work....notwithstanding my utmost exertions to recover it again....Satan had put I into their hearts to tempt the Lord their God, by altering the words, that they did read contrary from that which I translated and caused to be written; and if I should bring forth the same words again, or, in other words, if I should translate the same over again, they would publish that which they had stolen, and Satan would stir up the hearts of this generation, that they might not receive this work....Wherefore, to be obedient unto the commandments of God, I have, through his grace and mercy, accomplished that which he hath commandedSLIGHT CHANGES TO SHOW THAT JOSEPH SMITH COULD COMPOSE BOOK OF MORMON SCRIPTURE:As many false reports had been circulated in the land, many unlawful measures were taken against Nephi by the evil designing Lamanite king. But notwithstanding Nephi's utmost exertions, Satan had put it into their hearts to tempt the Lord their God, by altering Nephi's words, that they did read contrary from that which he caused to be written as testimony on gold plates. And it came to pass, that Nephi said, If I should bring forth the same words again, or, in other words, if I should write the same over again, they would publish that which they had stolen, and Satan would stir up the hearts of Lamanites, that they might not receive this work. Wherefore, to be obedient unto the commandments of God, I, Nephi have, through his grace and mercy, accomplished that which he hath commanded.The preface also shows the back-tracking style found throughout the Book of Mormon.Note the following examples:l. \\"I have charity for the Jew--I say Jew, because I mean....\\"2. \\"And now if Christ had not come into the world, speaking of things to come as though....\\" (Supposedly written in 148 BC-before Christ)3. \\"...so long as there should be a band of Christians remain to possess the land--For thus all the true believers of Christ....\\" (Supposedly written in 73 BC)4. \\"And behold in the end of this book...Behold I do not mean the end of the book of Helaman, but I mean....\\"5. \\"...it must needs be expedient that Christ-for in the last night an angel spake unto me that this should be his name....\\" (Written in the sixth century BC)6. \\"...and if I should bring forth the same words again, or, in other words, if I should translate the same over....\\"7. \\"...that my name should be had for good and evil among all nations, kindreds, and tongues, or that it should be both good and evil spoken of among all people.\\"NOTE: Number \\"6\\" (above) was written by Joseph Smith in his 1830 preface of the Book of Mormon, a preface now deleted, and number \\"7\\" was also written by Joseph Smith as he later described his visit with an angel.Also, remember that Joseph Smith didn't know when to quit talking. His prayer for the dedication of the Kirkland Temple, according to the guides, was a couple hours long. Thus, again he demonstrated his ability to spin scripture as fast as his scribe could write it down.Published in 1830, the original Book of Mormon bears all the marks of a novel written by a relatively uneducated man. Some 4000 changes have been made in grammar (also deleting the overuse of \\"and it came to pass\\").Also, some significant errors corrected (King Benjamin was dead at one point and it was changed to Mosiah). In addition, it contains errors that are found in the King James Bible at the time.Taking the popular folklore of the lost white race of \\"Mound Builders\\" and that the Indians were descended from the Jews, Joseph Smith had all the makings of a novel set in his lap. He was not a scholar, but he used a few books as references--notably \\"View of the Hebrews,\\" published in Poultney, Vermont, where his chief scribe and third cousin, Oliver Cowdery, came of age.The project took about a year. At the age of twenty-two-and-half, Joseph Smith dictated 116 pages over a two month period. When these pages were lost or stolen, he waited some nine months (with some composition in between) before starting again. Then after three months, he completed his novel at age twenty-three-and-a-half.At the time, Joseph Smith was not a teenager or \\"farm boy\\" as many Mormon writers say, deliberately confusing Joseph's teenage visions with his dictating of the Book of Mormon. He was a married man of 22-23 when he began his novel.Note, also, that Joseph Smith didn't have to \\"write\\" a single word. He had various scribes do that as he \\"translated\\" from behind a curtain by looking at a magic stone placed in a hat.For a fascinating look at the problems of the Book of Mormon, read \\"American Apocrypha,\\" a collection of essays by former Mormons.American Apocrypha: Essays on the Book of Mormons (Essays on Mormonism Series)The following is from an essay by Professor Edwin Firmage, who tells a compelling story of how he came to abandon his belief that the Book of Mormon is an ancient document. The other essays in this book are also fascinating. Highly recommended for anyone interested in the Book of Mormon.Professor Edwin Firmage, Jr. writes:\\"Nearly twenty years ago, as a first year-graduate student at the University of California, Berkeley, my ambition was to become another Hugh Nibley, whose writings I loved since I was twelve....\\"\\"Still a neophyte, but armed with German and a little Arabic, Greek, and Hebrew, and intent on acquiring the requisite apologetic tools, I cameo Berkeley to study ancient Near Eastern languages, particularly Egyptian, the language of mysteries par excellence.\\"Not long after my arrival, I was asked to teach the Book of Mormon in the Gospel Doctrine class in my Berkeley ward. I welcomed the opportunity, as it would give me a chance to delve deeper into the book. By any standard, my wife and I were faithful Mormons who attended church, visited the temple, and prayed together. I expected my study of the Book of Mormon to result in an increase of faith as it had done on my mission. But within six months, I no longer believed the Book of Mormon to be an ancient text.\\"To this day, I am not sure how it happened, although I can isolate several issues that played a role in my change of mind....I have often thought that what happened to me in Berkeley was fundamentally a conversion, or, if you like, an anti-conversion. The process had all the inscrutable suddenness that characterized some of the conversions I had witnessed as missionary. Like a conversion to faith, the effect of my change of mind propagated with amazing speed. Almost overnight my whole outlook on life was different.\\"\\"The remaining pages of this essay will present a few of what, for me in 1984, were discoveries of some importance. These do not by any means constitute a comprehensive explanation of the Book of Mormon. Nor are they offered as proof of my thesis that the book is modern, but as examples of how the assumption that is modern resolves otherwise significant difficulties.\\"Further, there is no archaeological evidence for the claims of the Book of Mormon. Read the following:Robert J. Sharer is Professor of Anthropology and Curator of the American Section of the University Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology at the University of Pennsylvania. His fascinating and heavy book analyzes the Maya from every angle. Although Sharer does not mention the Book of Mormon, he does give a devastating answer to those who would link Meso-American civilization with the ancient Hebrews, placing such theories squarely in the 19th century.Sharer writes: \\"After more than a century of gathering and analyzing archaeological evidence, we have discovered nothing to support the idea of intervention by people from the Old World.\\" \\"This is not to say that accidental contacts between the Old and New World peoples could not have occurred before the age of European exploration\\" (p. 6).\\"On the basis of the available evidence, then, the courses of cultural development in the New and Old Worlds seem clearly independent of each other and devoid of significant contact until 1492\\" (intro., p. 7).The ancient Maya civilization, Sharer continues, \\"are to be \`explained' not as a product of transplanted Old World civilization, but as the result of the processes that underlie the growth of any culture, including those that develop the kind of complexity we call civilization.\\"\\"The idea, which either explicitly or implicitly asserts that the peoples of the New World were incapable of shaping their own destiny or developing sophisticated cultures independently of Old World influence, is still popular in quarters.\\" \\"But this is but one more popular myth devoid of fact, for the evidence points unmistakably toward the evolution of civilization in the New World independently of developments in the Old World.\\"Every Mormon should read Robert Silverberg's book, \\"The Mound Builders: The Archaeology of a Myth.\\" This book provides the context for the novel called the \\"Book of Mormon.\\"Also, read Robert Wauchope's 150-page book, \\"Lost Tribes and Sunken Continents: Myth and Method in the Study of the American Indians.\\"Check out the following links to two very rewarding books:Mound BuildersLost Tribes & Sunken Continents: Myth and Method in the Study of AmeriYour comments--positive or negative--are appreciated.

As such, many of these negative reviews viciously attack Mormonism's precious tome, yet all-the-while these reviewers are espousing the virtues of the Bible; however, most of these them have simply missed the point. It has been my experience that Mormons love negative publicity, for they seem to believe that somehow this proves they're right. That aside, logically and empirically speaking, neither the Book of Mormon nor the Bible can stand the test of reason, so claiming that one preposterous book is superior to another is akin to asserting that \\"Lord of the Rings\\" is superior to \\"Harry Potter.\\" However, the Bible does at least have the obscuring effect of antiquity on its side, whereas the Book of Mormon is just barefaced nineteenth-century flapdoodle. From a rational perspective, how is it possible - given our current state of scientific knowledge - that modern human beings can believe in such absurdities? Although they claim otherwise, Mormonism is a massive brainwashing and propaganda machine that expects and receives uniformity of thought and belief. This point is evidenced by the homogeneous language and responses that Mormons provide either in person or on web-logs.Even though there isn't a stitch of empirical evidence to support that notion that God exists - in spite of all the wordplay from the World's theologians - the intellectual plebeians have abandoned what reason they possess and are lining up by the thousands in order to join this church. Yet, in spite of all the religious nonsense and violence in the world, the Book of Mormon is perhaps worthy of special mention; accordingly, it is perhaps the crowning achievement of generations of religious idiocy. Like all religions, Mormonism preys on the ignorant, the downtrodden, the emotionally unstable, and the hypocrite who all appear to drink heartily from this church's overflowing Kool-Aid fountain. Yet, any critical analysis of this church's basic tenets will reveal that the Book of Mormon is nothing more than one illiterate man's fantasy; which, by the way, does not bear any resemblance to reality around him. Furthermore, it also reinforces nineteenth-century notions of racial bigotry, and it exposes Smith's lack of scientific understanding of the physical world. To this end, let's take a look at just a few of this ridiculous book's innumerable absurdities:Alma 3:6 - And the skins of the Lamanites were dark, according to the mark which was set upon their fathers, which was a curse upon them because of their transgression and their rebellion against their brethren, who consisted of Nephi, Jacob, and Joseph, and Sam, who were just and holy men.Ok, let me get this straight; even though we know that skin pigmentation has everything to do with genetic inheritance, there are those among us who believe that dark-skinned people are cursed. Skin color has much more to do with sexual selection and biological factors than it does with curses. The Book of Mormon is rife with such racial bigotry. For a much better understanding of human history and geographical information, I recommend reading Jared Diamond's \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel.\\" If people understood the basic principles of evolution then these sorts of logical travesties would likely go the way of the Dodo Bird...1 Nephi 25 - And it came to pass that we did find upon the land of promise, as we journeyed in the wilderness, that there were beasts in the forests of every kind, both the cow and the ox, and the ass and the horse, and the goat and the wild goat, and all manner of wild animals, which were for the use of men.Even a kindergartner will recognize that all of the above-mentioned animal species did not exist in the Americas during this time. All of these species were indigenous to the Eurasian continent and did not exist in the Americas until such time as Columbus arrived in the New World. The chicken might be the exception to this, for some scientists believe that Polynesians deposited that bird in the Americas. Oh yes, I have seen many Mormon apologist try to squirm out of this geographical reality, but they have only succeed in making themselves look foolish. Albeit, this is a position in which I suspect they must be comfortable with...Morm. 9: 32 - And now, behold, we have written this record according to our knowledge, in the characters which are called among us reformed Egyptian, being handed down and altered by us, according to our manner of speech.Although many Mormon apologists will claim that the now missing Golden Tablets were written in what they call reformed Egyptian, there, nevertheless, isn't a stitch of evidence to support the notion that such a language ever existed. To make the claim that God provided these Golden Tablets written in a heretofore unknown language and then took them away is akin to not making a claim at all. Plain and simple, the illiterate Joseph Smith was just making stuff up. Given this simplistic mode of thinking, then I can make up anything and ask you to believe it. Say, here's a thought: God just told me that everyone who reads this review owes me ten-thousand dollars. Pray about it and he will tell you; however, keep in mind that the Devil will try to trick you about the truth of my statement. After you've prayed, simply email me and I will provide the address where you can send your check.Although this book is replete with innumerable examples of such blatant nonsense, a rational person can nevertheless understand some of the absurdities written in the Bible; it was written long before the Age of Enlightenment and the rise of science. To this end, the Book of Mormon satisfies the obtuse, and it surely fails to do little more than ingratiate an ignorant person's notion of race, social class, and political and religious ideology. Ergo, this book is a rather profound testament to human gullibility - one which illuminates the simple fact that if something is emotionally appealing then it is far more likely to be believed; this, in spite of the fact that the basic underlying tenets of this book are entirely and demonstrably falsifiable. So, take heed, join this church or any church, for that matter, at your own peril; all that you have to lose is your intellectual autonomy and, of course, your money..."},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"Like Islam and the Koran, it is difficult to seperate Mormonism from the Book of Mormon.

In fact, many Mormon critics believe that the book was written by Joseph Smith or one of his colleagues, drawing heavily on \\"A View of the Hebrews\\", written by Ethan Smith a few years before the Book of Mormon was published, and with word for word extracts from the King James Bible.While Mormon missionaries and apologists expect you to accept the book on the merits of prayer and warm feelings, I suggest you read other works, like Mormon historians B.H. Robert's \\"Studies of the Book of Mormon\\" or D. Michael Quinn's numerous Mormon histories to get a more balanced viewpoint.

Would you review the Bible or the Koran? At the same time, it's difficult to escape the Book of Mormon, just as you can't seem to get rid of those LDS missonaries roaming up and down the country on their bicycles, with their \\"Elder Johnson\\" nametags and short haircuts. They speak pretty good Swedish too, albeit with a terrible accent. By the way, here in Sweden, the LDS Church wants to look vaguely \\"politically correct\\", so they even use young women as missionaries. \\"Sister Johnson\\", I believe?Many Swedes have seen the Book of Mormon. But how many have actually read it? Very few, I think. I might be the only one. By the way, did I mention that I have \\"Lamanite\\" ancestry? Might impress the sisters.So what can I say about the Book of Mormon? First, it's important to realize that this book isn't the whole of Mormonism. In fact, the more peculiar and exotic doctrines of the Mormons are not to be found in this book. In order to get a real feel for Mormonism, you must also read \\"Doctrine and Covenants\\" and \\"Pearl of Great Price\\". Another good idea might be to read a book about Mormons, written by an outsider. To take just one example, the Book of Mormon condemns polygamy. Later, Joseph Smith got other ideas on the subject...As for the Book of Mormon itself, it's easy to see how it might have inspired settlers in the Wild West during the 19th century. Indeed, it comes across as something of a settler Bible, being a story about migrations from the Old World to America, wars between Whites (\\"Nephites\\") and Indians (\\"Lamanites\\"), and above all, the conviction that America is God's chosen nation. For it's quite obvious that the \\"Nephites\\" and their semi-democratic republic is really a symbol for 19th century frontier America, whatever else it might be besides. And while many non-Mormons find the book tedious and repetitive, I can imagine that it might have looked very different for those who really \\"lived their faith\\" in Jackson County, Nauvoo or Utah.But is it true? I guess that's the $10,000 question. I for one don't believe it. The Book of Mormon is purported to be a translation of a real document found by the Mormon prophet Joseph Smith inside Hill Cumorah. However, modern archeology has completely failed to verify any of its claims. Besides, the original document was supposedly taken to heaven by an angel, making it impossible for historians to examine it! The Book of Mormon is essentially a hyper-diffusionist work, claiming that civilization was brought to the Americas by large-scale migrations of Old World peoples. And while these peoples were presumably Semitic, the Book of Mormon portrays them as lily White. Indeed, the darker skin-color of the American Indians (\\"Lamanites\\") is said to be a divine curse. Of course, these notions of racial superiority over the natives, might also have appealed to the White settlers at the frontier. Even Whites who for pragmatic reasons wanted to reach some kind of accommodation with the Indians - the Mormons surely wanted this - nevertheless felt superior to them. In the Book of Mormon, \\"good\\" Indians are sometimes converted to Christianity and hence become peaceful, and in some cases, even get their White skin-color back.The Book of Mormon is thus best analyzed and understood in its 19th century historical context. It's indeed \\"another testament of Jesus Christ\\", but it's a testament ghost-written by Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet."},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"Whether or not you believe that Mormonism is the way to go, this book is an amazing read and will open your eyes to a new way of life."},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"\\"Concerning this record the Prophet Joseph Smith said: \\"I told the brethren that the Book of Mormon was the most correct of any book on earth, and the keystone of our religion, and a man would get nearer to God by abiding by its precepts, than by any other book.\\"*Paragraph from the introduction pageWe read of our Savior and his good news in the Bible.

I was raised in a devout Mormon family, and had to commit to giving away dozens of these books over the course of my early adulthood. At the time, I sincerely believed that God wanted me to do this. Even then, it was nearly impossible to get people to take it. I had an English teacher kindly take me aside and explain how poorly written the book is, that it was an obvious and well-known fake to any scholar that wasn't Mormon (and even to some that were). And, Ms. Constance Wray, for the record, you were entirely correct about that.But, that was before I grew up, got an education, and realized that this book is a hoax.The LDS church hopes to legitimize this book by selling it in a mainstream market. Luckily, you have access to the internet, so before you buy this book, do a little research about it. Try www.exmormon.org as a start. Or, read Grant Palmer's book on origins of the LDS church (he's a mormon historian that is about to be excommunicated from the church for trying to tell the well-documented truth about the origins of the church).There is a reason that there is a growing trend of people resigning from this church.

I honestly can't feel defensive about this. I love Joseph Smith for translating and giving his life for this book and for restoring Christs church. He was a prophet the same as the men in the Bible and the Book of Mormon. He was so because he was more meek and humble than any other man on the earth at that time.

As a former missionary of the Mormon church, I gave away many copies of this book together with my heartfelt testimony of its truthfulness.At 47 years of age, I encountered some troubling matters concerning the doctrine and history of the church. The more I studied the more I doubted the veracity of Joseph Smith's story. In fact, within two months of honest inquiry into the broader history of the church, I quit believing. Losing one's faith is akin to losing a loved one; it is a very traumatic life phase to come to grips with.Now I am no longer of member of the Mormon church. If I read, hear, or see the church's version of its history today, there is no feeling whatsoever. As a result of what I have learned, I must call the Book of Mormon a work of 18th century fiction, drawing heavily upon the King James Bible and other works of Joseph Smith's day (A View of the Hebrews by Ethan Smith).Apparently, Joseph Smith would place seer stones into a hat, hold it tightly to his face, and dictate lengthy passages of the book. By then, he was well-known for using folk magic of this sort to discover buried treasure, although he was not very successful in the former endeavor.For over 170 years, the Mormon church has grown and they claim about 12 million members today. From what I have observed, their membership is seriously hemorrhaging and inactivity is rampant.Leaders of the church have prophesied that the Book of Mormon would flood the earth. They take in 10% of the faithful's gross income and members themselves pay thousands of dollars for their 19 to 20-year-old sons to go on full-time missions. I am surprised at the church's marketing ploy to sell their book through mainstream retail outlets.If you aren't a member and you buy the book, don't be surprised if two young men come knocking at your door with the rest of the story; but they won't tell you about the \\"unfaithful history\\" or the problems associated with historical mormonism. Neither will they offer much of the meat of the religion, concerning temples and the resultant commitments devolving upon active members.I would suggest that investigators google Joseph Smith and the Book of Mormon and ask the hard questions that Mormons may or may not want to answer.Keith Vaught"},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"some of you might not believe me since this is one of the main books of the church but please listen.

If you want the word of God undiluted, buy a copy of the Bible. And leave the Book of Mormon well alone. Incidentally, the Book of Mormon originally credited Joseph Smith with being the author of the Book of Mormon, rather than the translator.I was also intrigued to discover that as well as claiming to use a translating device supplied by God, Joseph used a seer stone that he had found down a deep hole whilst looking for some buried treasure (or water, I forget which) by using magic.

This is an incredible book, translated through the power of God, that tells plain and simple truths about the purpose of man, our relationship to God, and the divinity of Christ.One of the ways the BoM teaches is through repetition - you can see how the cycle of sin repeats itself: wickedness and destruction -&#62; humility -&#62; acceptance of gospel principles -&#62; people are happy -&#62; wealth and power increase -&#62; pride and sin -&#62; wickedness and destruction. Through these examples I have been able to correct things in my own life, and the book is a constant comfort when I have questions.Whether or not you believe in the manner in which the BoM came into existence, it is worth reading...and learning for yourself.

I read it three times and never got a testimony, went on a mission - and deeply regret the time I threw away on something I never believed and the many baptisms I performed trying to believe. It is easy to see through this book now, since not only is there absolutely no archeological, historical, genetic, geological, etc. evidence of the great civilizations documented therein, but it is now clear that Joseph Smith actually made the same mistakes in his account of the many chapters of the Old Testament Book of Isaiah more or less copied into 2nd Nephi that were made by the team that produced the King James Version of the Bible. Why? Because there was no translation of gold plates; Smith merely copied stuff from many parts of the Bible, inserted Protestant sermons he heard over and over when he was a kid, used local and family stories and names, and his very fertile imagination (read Lucy Mack Smith's accounts of Joseph's stories as a boy) for the rest.I think mormons now believe it only because they don't know what else to do. It was an embarrassment to Smith later in his life, and now to the mormon church, though its members are literally terrified to see it for what it is. Benefit from my experience and use it for a doorstop, or a short table leg.I give it two stars because of its historical significance only.And if you search for Mr. Palmer's book, be careful not to get stuck on Clayton Newell's similarly titled book, which is more fluff for the shorn sheep in the church."},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"It asks you to ask God whether or not it is true.Testing God is a sin.A book written by a true prophet would not ask you to sin.It contradicts other mormon books of theology.Ask any mormon if God and Jesus are the same person.Look at 2 Nephi 31:21.Joseph Smith was a false prophet, predicting the return of Jesus in 1891, and that God would let Smith triumph over his enemies. Smith was killed in a gunfight with an enemy, and Jesus of course, did not come back in 1891.Why, if the American Indians were descended from Lehi, was there such diversity in their languages, and why were there no vestiges of Hebrew in any of them?Why does the Book of Mormon say that Lehi found horses when he arrived in America? The horse did not exist in the Americas until the Spaniards brought them over in the sixteenth century.Why was Nephi stated to have a bow of steel? Jews did not have steel at that time, and no iron was smelted in the Americas until the Spanish colonization.Why does the Book of Mormon mention \\"swords and cimeters\\" when scimitars (the current spelling) did not come about until the rise of Islam after 500 A.D.?Why does the Book of Mormon mention silk, when silk did not exist in the Americas at that time?Faith is only as powerful as the religion you place it in.

It is a surrealistic story even more fantastic than The Lord of the Rings. It has an internal coherence however that may explain the attention it deserves even today.

There have been books written after the official canonical Bible (now called King James Bible) that are divinely inspired, like the Qur'an, the Raatib by Muhammad Ahmad Al Mahdi, the Holy Tablets by Malachi York, just to name a few. Joseph Fielding Smith(1805-1844) is quoted as saying &quot;the teachers of religion...understood the same passages of scripture so differently as to destroy all confidence in settling the question by an appeal to the Bible&quot;. This would explain the reason why he wrote the Book of Mormon, he was tired of traditional Christianity. Note also he was a mason. He became a mason in 1842 borrowing masonic rituals for mormon ceremonies eliminating what he regarded as curruption of the original Hebrew forms. If the Mormon Bible is supposedly an ancient tablet, how are these quotes in the Mormon Bible that are verbatim from the quotes in the King James version of the Bible? Note also that if you look up the name Mormon itself, you will find that it means &quot;A Ghoul, Bugbear, Sceptre, Hobgoblin, A Gargoyle, A Spirit, Spook, Ogre&quot;.Overall, the Book of Mormon is fascinating to read, except if you're a Black person, because on p.61, 21-25 &amp; p. 201 verse 6-9:&quot;And the skin of the Lamanites were dark according to the mark which was set upon their fathers which was a curse upon them because of their transgressions and their rebellion against their brethren.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"When I started reading the BOM I did alittle research about Joseph Smith on the side. His life as a reputable prophet soon became suspect. However I will leave you the reader to find that out for yourself since I'm not interested in \\"second hand information\\".What I found while reading the BOM was very poor archeological evidence, racist attitudes concerning those with dark skin, and a continuation of myths taken from the King James Version.I love to go arrowhead hunting. In my collection I have an arrowhead named the Greeneville Point. It is dated at 1500 to 3000 years old. My point here is that if I, an amateur in the field can find such a tiny find, why have'nt the thousands of professionals over the centuries found the swords, breastplates, chariots, temples and cities disscribed in Mr. Smith's book? We are told in the BOM that literally millions died in numerous wars, but there is just no evidence. Of course Mr. Smith , to his credit, does tell of a few instances where God covers these sites with mountains and sinks some into the sea. However this is not done in everycase which would still leave us with a wealth of evidence. But alas there is none.Slavery was a hot issue in Joseph Smith's time. To the Mormon's credit they were anti-slavery. But people of color, both in Christianity and in Mormonism, were seen to be \\"filthy and loathsome\\" people. Wheather we are talking about the curse of Ham, or the curse of the Lamanites, judging a person's worth by the color of their skin is inexcusable.Then there is the everpresent mythological creatures. Mr. Smith, who is supposedly inspired by divine forces of truth is'nt told to correct these errors which he borrows from the King James Version. We are told of three such creatures. The satyrs, the dragon, and the mischievous cockatrice. (2NEPHI 21:8 and 2NEPHI 23:21-22)SATYRS: Part man part goat this greek myth is more well known as Pan.DRAGON: This one needs little defining. Although some translatters may see this as representing a crocadile, or even Satan himself. The important note here is that Mr. Smith fails to clear-up the confusion, but simply passes it on.COCKATRICE:Part chicken, part snake, this creature could kill you with a glance.Mr.Smith knew he was'nt the best author in the world so he covers his bases by stating imperfection in the text(MORMON 8:12,17 and latter in chapter 9:31-33). So we have to ask ourselves if GOD wanted his word to be accurate and uncorrupted why not write it himself and just let Mr.Smith find it in that form. Perfect, without mistranslation and not in Old English?Then there is God destroying whole communities because of the sins of unbelievers. I guess God does'nt have a problem with \\"collateral damage\\". (2NEPHI 23:16,18/HELAMAN 11:4-6,15:2-3)In my studies I've come to the truth that all religions are based on mythology. I have no doubt that in the future Mr. Smith's book earn him a footnote among the rest. The late Mr. Joseph Campbell once wrote that if you study other peoples religions and mythologies you will get a better sense of mythos in your own religion. As an ex-christian for over 20 years my studies have led me to agree with Mr. Campbell. But as I've stated before in my reviews, don't take my word for it.

The Book of Mormon tells the story of several groups of people who left their homeland and traveled to the \\"promised land\\", just as Moses and his people traveled to their promised land.

What surprised me about the Book of Mormon was how psychotically it reads. I think that's because it IS psychotic (that is, delusional---grossly out of touch with reality). I wasn't expecting this when I opened the book.But what really surprised me is that this psychotic material became the foundation for a major world religion. Of all the psychotic people I've worked with not a one has ever culled a following, let alone others who heart-and-soul believe in his or her ultra-delusional material. (Of course, there is such a thing as \\"shared psychotic disorder,\\" but I haven't seen it.)This all makes me wonder what was up with Joseph Smith.

I am humbly thankful to not be hard-hearted to the point that I cannot be taught the truth of it by the Spirit that accompanies it. I have spoken with many people about the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and am surprised that most folks who &quot;hate&quot; the LDS people have never read this book nor have they attended an LDS Sunday church service. They haven't ever taken the time to meet a Latter-day Saint (which is the perferred term) without trying to evangelize to them, nor have they spoken with a missionary from the Church. Most of them just read literature that feeds thier hate! I think it is sadness that so many would spend so much time and money tearing down others' faith. How offensive to God to have church meetings often titled &quot;Get To Know the Mormons Night&quot; where the spirit of Satan is ever present and influencing those who participate in any capacity to persecute a mostly decent and certainly God-fearing people. The adversary of truth will deceive as long as people let him. Shame on those who do.I have done some research on &quot;anti-Mormon&quot; claims, one of them being that Mormons say the Native Americans were Jewish. DNA has shown the Native Americans not to be decendants of Judah. Does this refute the claims made by Mormons? I have found this NOT to be the case. The Book of Mormon peoples were decendants of Manasseh. They followed the Hebrew faith, but were not of Judah, as are Jews of today.Another misconception that pours out of the mouths of &quot;Mormon-haters&quot; is that pre-Jesus baptisms and other Christian ways found in the Book of Mormon do not fit even a simple timeline of Christianity. This is easy to debate! John the Baptist baptised before Jesus started His ministry. 'Nuff said. =)The only true way to learn about someone or something is to GO TO THE SOURCE. The Book of Mormon is the cornerstone of Mormonism. Beware of authors who would want money in exchange for educating you on the truth of any subject. If it is so true and vital to your relationship with God to know how terrible the Mormons are; if the intent of the authors of &quot;anti-Mormon&quot; literature were concerned for your very soul as a child of our Heavenly Father, then they would be GIVING AWAY THEIR WARES out of love and humility before Him who created them. The &quot;Mormon-haters&quot; message would be one of love and peace, not of disdain and willfull pride. &quot;By their fruits, ye shall know them.&quot;In comparison, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints gives away stuff all the time.

I think the members of the religion are generally good people with good intentions. However, because the Mormons are so invested in their religion, they will only present their religion in the best possible light and avoid controversial issues-- which are many. If you are looking into the religion, be sure to investigate all facets of their beliefs including their views on race and plural marriage before deciding. I think it's only fair that someone be informed of the whole religion and it's history, and not avoiding beliefs that may turn someone off of the church.Some interesting passages in the Book of Mormon include: 2 Nephi 5: 21. 3 Nephi 2: 15"},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"This book was an sad attempt by Joseph Smith to create scripture.

There is no doubt that the Book of Mormon has made an enormous impact on the lives of millions.There is also no doubt that it fails abysmally in what it purports to be. It purports to be a record of the history of early America during the millennium covered by the years 600 BC thru about 400 AD. Absolutely NO archeological evidence has ever been found to support the claim that a band of Hebrews left the Middle East and settled in the New World, becoming the ancestors of Native Americans. Some Mormon apologists have disingenuously claimed that the Smithsonian Institution has used the Book of Mormon in archeological research. Since 1951 the Smithsonian has issued a point blank, categorical denial that they have ever used the Book of Mormon as an aid to archeological research. See their website.This lack of evidence for the historicity of the Book of Mormon contrasts sharply with the wealth of archeological evidence that exists in support of the historicity of the Bible. Biblical scholars might debate issues such as dating and chronology, but none dispute the actual existence of the evidence. The issue for Biblical scholars is not do these places exist, but how do we interpret the data in the light of the text, and vice versa? Mormon scholars on the other hand have to deal with the fact that they have absolutely NO data with which to work, other than the Book of Mormon itself.Another problem for the claims of the Book of Mormon is the fact that the science of genetics has proven conclusively that Native American peoples have absolutely no genetic similarieties to Hebrew peoples but are strongly related to people from eastern Central Asia, especially those from Siberia.The only conclusion one can come to is that the Book of Mormon is what it is, namely a 19th century work by Joseph Smith. As such, it is creatively innovative and clearly the work of a religious genius and will continue to influence the relgious lives of millions. The true believers among them will be unswayed by the fact that there is no evidence for its claim that it is an ancient text. This lack of evidence will keep the rest of us in healthy skepticism re its claims of antiquity, we will continue to recognize that it comes from the fertile mind of Joseph Smith. It is a book reflects the ferment of religious ideas current in early 19th century America.Two stars as nothing more an interesting read of religious and historical fiction."},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"This Book can bring a remarkable power into your life.

If allowed, these missionaries will give you a message about God's extraordinary love, sin, repentance, and salvation. And they will also hand you a copy of one of the world's strangest books.The Book of Mormon, written by Joseph Smith, purports to be a revelation from God on par with the Holy Bible. It is a narrative about a group of Jews who flee Jerusalem and found several large civilizations in the Americas. Most people who try reading it need only a few pages to see that it's a farce. A handful of intelligent, honest, ethical, well-read people instead find it to be so beautiful and moving that it can only be divinely inspired wisdom. Why the difference in opinion? Well, the best way to answer that is to read it for yourself.The Book of Mormon begins with a Jewish man, Levi, fleeing the wrath of King Zedekiah in 600 B.C. Taking his family, they first camp by a river on the east shore of the Red Sea. After spending a time living richly by hunting and gathering fruit in that area, they travel to an uninhabited harbor called Bountiful on the south shore of Arabia. (At this point you may be asking questions such as: How could they flee Zedekiah in 600 B.C. when he didn't become king until years later? Why did they find that river when any map will confirm that there is no such river in that location? How did they hunt and gather in that region when it's a barren wilderness? And where did they find an empty harbor when the southern shore of Arabia was densely inhabited at that time in history? If you ask irritating questions like that, Mormonism probably isn't the religion for you.)After sailing from Arabia to America in a small boat, Lehi's family wastes no time in spawning a thriving civilization. Soon they split into two groups, white-skinned Nephites and inferior Lamanites with dark skin. The bulk of the book is packed with events vaguely reminiscent of the Old Testament. Nations fall into sin and wickedness, God appoints prophets to rant and rave, battles are fought, and so forth. Near the end Jesus Christ drops in (literally) to repeat the Sermon on the Mount and appoint twelve disciples. After that, it seems as if the author got bored since he rushes through centuries of time in just a few pages, kills off the Nephites, and wraps the book up with a bizarre rant against infant baptism.What to make of all this? I feel pretty confident that it's not a genuine revelation from God. Almost every page is stamped with some major mistake. First, much as defenders may hate to admit it, the book clearly says that the Nephite and Lamanite civilizations covered most of North and South America. As not even the slightest trace of either civilization has ever been found, that should wrap the question up right there. Further, Joseph Smith simply copied details from the Bible into his fictional accounts, where they don't fit at all. His civilizations raised flocks of sheep, goats, cattle, and horses, all of which were actually introduced to the Americas from Europe centuries later. The Book of Mormon mentions brass, bronze, iron, copper, and steel, yet none of those metals were mined in the ancient Americas. It mentions keys and locks, metal swords, suits of armor, ships, and anchors, which are also completely anachronistic. It has similar problems with food, drink, fabrics, tools, types of buildings, etc... At the same time, the Book of Mormon makes no mention of any distinctive animals, plants, buildings, or clothing that did exist in pre-Colombian America.As literature, it is equally far off the mark. While a few parts ring with a certain poetic resonance, nothing really stands out. Certainly nothing comes close to matching the magnificent writing of the Bible. Joseph's Smith clearly set out to write prose in imitation of the King James Version, yet his poor grasp of the language produced often hilarious results. For example, not knowing that \\"it came to pass\\" indicates passage of time, he often has dialogues or speeches where every sentence starts with \\"it came to pass\\". Even worse, Smith uses the phrases \\"come in unto\\" and \\"go in unto\\" without knowing that these are biblical euphemisms for sex. Hence those who are fluent in Shakespearean may find themselves chuckling at lines like \\"The Queen desired that Ammon should come in unto her.\\" [Alma 19:2]The morality in the Book of Mormon is basically a match for the history. The ranting prophets pretty much take their cues from the Old Testament with spiels against murder, theft, adultery, and such. Missing is any trace of the true gospel message of radical, transforming love. While your missionaries will no doubt advice that you pray to God concerning the truthfulness of this book, that shouldn't be necessary for any thinking person. It is either true or false. History, literary analysis, and religion all clearly say false.One thing is clear, that despite the notorious antics of their forefathers, today's Mormons are a very straight-laced bunch. Many Christians may see their principles and strong family values and wonder whether, despite the apparent loopiness, there is something in the Book of Mormon after all. If you're in that category, here are some important facts that the missionaries won't tell you.1) The Book of Mormon that you get today is not the original. Joseph Smith's first version, despite its supposedly divine origins, was packed with errors in spelling, grammar, usage, logic, continuity, and chronology. Over the years the LDS Church has been forced to make thousands of changes to cover up these embarrassing mistakes.2) While we can't double-check Smith's translation of the Book of Mormon because an angel conveniently retrieved the original to Heaven, we can double-check something else. Joseph Smith also wrote the Book of Abraham, allegedly translated from ancient Egyptian documents, which is also part of Mormon scripture. However, Egyptologists who have compared Smith's translation to the originals have found that it's a complete fraud.3) Joseph Smith was a professional con artist. Both before and after writing the Book of Mormon, he bilked people with fake treasure hunts. He also ran a fraudulent bank, the Kirtland Safety Society Bank, that issued phony money. He was, in short, very good and deceiving and manipulating people.4) In addition to receiving new scriptures, Joseph Smith also claimed to be a prophet who received many direct revelations from God. Among others divine revelations, he claimed that Solomon's Temple would be rebuilt in Missouri, that Christ would return by 1885, and that missionaries would bring his gospel to the moon and to a secret continent \\"beyond the North Pole\\". (His successor, Brigham Young, continued the space exploration theme by announcing that the sun and planets are inhabited.)5) One of Smith's most important \\"revelations\\" is the Great Endowment Ceremony conducted in Mormon pemples. It involves donning special clothes, being washed in a special basin, watching a hokey play about God's \\"plan of salvation\\", and learning secret code words and handshakes that will supposedly allow you to reach the highest level of Heaven after death. In reality, Joseph Smith copied almost the entire ceremony from the freemasons, who he briefly joined in 1839. Since that time, the LDS Church has changed the ceremony by removing the more embarrassing parts.6) During Joseph Smith's early life in Vermont and New York, the region was jam-packed with all manner of prophets, visionaries, and would-be messiahs, many of whom were making claims very similar to his own. Research names such as Isaac Bullard, Elias Smith, and Asa Wild and you'll see that Joseph Smith copied parts of the Book of Mormon and later revelations more or less directly from other sources.7) But wait, there's more! If you want to know plenty of other things about Mormonism that the missionaries won't tell you just search on google for \\"concerns about Mormonism\\". Then you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free."},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"So how do I describe a book that has meant so much to me?

Some eve believe that he was just a good teacher, although they dislike what he taught. This book is new scripture, on par, but not replacing, the Bible.It shows Jesus Christ as he deals with two groups of peoples, the first was lead out of the old world to the new world at the time of the tower of Babel, and the second group of people was led out of Jerusalem about AD 600, and also led to the Americas.The highlight of the book is when Jesus Christ appeared to the second group of people after his Resurrection, and retells the simple message of the Gospel to the people there.I can't convince anyone to buy, to read, or to believe this book, but I do hope that you would ask God in prayer and then be honest with the answer you receive.The Tile Page of the Book of Mormon:THEBOOK OF MORMONAN ACCOUNT WRITTEN BYTHE HAND OF MORMONUPON PLATESTAKEN FROM THE PLATES OF NEPHIWherefore, it is an abridgment of the record of the people of Nephi, and also of the Lamanites-Written to the Lamanites, who are a remnant of the house of Israel; and also to Jew and Gentile-Written by way of commandment, and also by the spirit of prophecy and of revelation-Written and sealed up, and hid up unto the Lord, that they might not be destroyed-To come forth by the gift and power of God unto the interpretation thereof-Sealed by the hand of Moroni, and hid up unto the Lord, to come forth in due time by way of the Gentile-The interpretation thereof by the gift of God.An abridgment taken from the Book of Ether also, which is a record of the people of Jared, who were scattered at the time the Lord confounded the language of the people, when they were building a tower to get to heaven-Which is to show unto the remnant of the House of Israel what great things the Lord hath done for their fathers; and that they may know the covenants of the Lord, that they are not cast off forever- And also to the convincing of the Jew and Gentile that JESUS is the CHRIST, the ETERNAL GOD, manifesting himself unto all nations-And now, if there are faults they are the mistakes of men; wherefore, condemn not the things of God, that ye may be found spotless at the judgment-seat of Christ.TRANSLATED BY JOSEPH SMITH, JUN."},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"I found the book to be very faith promoting.

Napoleon wars left lots of artifacts behind, Ancient Greece wars left lots of artifacts behind, but the wars of the &quot;historical&quot; Book of Mormon left nothing behind?

But claiming it is from God is an insult to anybody's intelligence."},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"About the Author Joseph Smith is not the author, per se, but rather the translator of the Book of Mormon.Joseph Smith, Jr. (1805-1844), was the founding prophet of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. In the spring of 1820, when Joseph was 14 years-old, he was much disturbed by the competing claims of the ministers in the area, and frustrated that \\"the teachers of religion....understood the same passages of scripture so differently as to destroy all confidence in settling the question by an appeal. Many reviewers on this board are just spouting off at the mouth. There is know way for them to claim that the book of Mormon is fictional. They can't prove it, by them saying that this book is not true is akin to them saying that GOD doesn't answer prayers and doesn't interact with humans anymore. There is no way possible to prove that Joseph Smith didn't see what he said he saw. Since that is the case then you have to take into account that it is possible that GOD preserved this ancient record for the benefit of his church in the latter days. The only way to know if this is the word of GOD is to read it and pray with a sincere heart asking in faith. The arguments against this book on this review board are weak at best. Why wouldn't the Book of Mormon be like reading the Bible. If the Bible is the word of GOD (and it is) then the Book of Mormon would read just like it. 25% of the Book is Isaiah teachings, which are for the benefit of the children of GOD in the last days. To say that the Book of Mormon is stealing from the Bible is just further proof that GOD wants people to understand his teachings better.As for the comment about the Solomon Spaulding book, that is just plain false. They are nothing alike. Read them both and judge for yourself.Read this book it can change your life."},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"This book is ancient scripture of a fallen people who lived in the Americas from 600 B.C. to 400 A.D.. It was revealed by God to the prophet Joseph Smith Jr. in 1820, which he translated by the gift and power of God. It contains the fullness of the everlasting Gospel. It is a companion to the Bible and has been translated into 95 different languages. God wants all to read it and pray about its truthfulness.It contains the teachings of Jesus Christ through the history of the people whose lives were documented by prophets among them. The highlight of the book is when Jesus comes to visit the people to instruct and bless them and their children (see 3 Nephi Chapter 11). Anyone who believes in Christ, reads it and prays about its truthfulness will gain a testimony of it(see Moroni 10:3-5).I have read and studied the book for 5 years now and as a result have united myself with The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. Also as a result of reading and applying the teachings of Christ I have developed a greater love for my wife and child and have found myself having a sincere interest for the people whom I come in contact with.I believe the Book of Mormon to be the word of God and another testament of Jesus Christ. Joseph Smith whom I believe was God's prophet said, \\"A man can grow closer to God by abiding by its precepts than by any other book.\\""},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"\\"The Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ\\" should be retitled \\"The Book of Mormon: A Testament of Another Jesus Christ.\\" For the Jesus Christ of whom the LDS Church speaks is married (and maybe even a polygamist), blue-eyed, blond, a brother to Satan and to each of us, lives in (or visits) more than 100 of the finest homes on earth that money can buy (complete with Marriot-style furniture in the \\"Celestial Rooms\\") and the leader of the Mormon Church.In any event, the book talks about mythical creatures such as cureloms and cumoms; extensive wars that supposedly occured up and down the Eastern coast of the United States, throughout Central America and South America; and at least one human being who struggled for breath AFTER his head was cut clean off his body (by the way, the book is very gruesome).It has absolutely nothing to do with current Mormonism, or more correctly, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. This book does not tell you that:1. Mormons are expected to give 10% of their annual income to the Church.2. Mormons are expected to be interviewed at least annually by \\"bishops\\" (local men in the congregations with no psychological or pastoral training) who then ask private, prurient questions including the type of underwear they have on and whether they engage in self-stimulation.3. Mormons cannot invite their non-Mormon relatives or friends to witness their wedding ceremonies if their weddings take place in one of their temples. Mormons are often encouraged to marry in these temples against the wishes of their non-member or non-worthy Mormon loved ones.There is so much more, but this is a start. For entertainment purposes, the book is passable.

People who refer to themselves as intellectuals usually consider themselves better than other \\"ordinary\\" people and scoff at the thought of tradition and religion. I bought into the whole, \\"dissent will show you the light\\" liberal political stuff. However, I always made it to Church, though I'm not really sure why; it conflicted so much with what I thought I wanted in my life, but in the end the feeling in my heart was so good while I was there. As I grew older, God allowed my heart to be humbled through various (and sometimes painful) experiences; health issues, self-doubt, etc. When I reached the proper age I served a mission for my Church and still maintain to this day, that if you want to know what charity is like, step into the lean-to of a poor Philippino family, teach of Christ, hand them a Book of Mormon, and watch their life change. Amazing things happen, friends...When I grew a little older and started my own family, I became overwhelmed with the responsability and thought of raising children in this world. In the end, isn't that what we all want? To be humble enough to learn how to treat our spouse, raise our children, and help them to be good people? Well, on top of suffering for our sins and providing a way back to live with God, Christ has provided us with help in our everday problems and desires. This book is one of those opportunities.Other than the Book of Mormon, I have never read a book over 10 times. What is interesting is despite the invaluable information contained in the Book, the best part about it is the Spirit entering into the life of the reader. Just simply from reading it. You begin to realize God's hand in your life; how He's been there for you from the very beginning. You begin to understand the nature of the family, and how you can be with your loved ones forever. You can see what God expects of you as a person living in the current world, and experience the blessings. You will learn to be a positive person. You will learn self-reliance. You will learn what true happiness is (not mere joy or fun). You will learn of Christ, and His dealings with the people on the American continent. This book has meant the world to me.Of course you will read here and other places of people who dissaprove of the Book of Mormon and the Mormon religion, but so what? This is simply \\"opposition in all things.\\" These people claim that they have the truth but ask yourself, \\"are they happy?\\" If they are, why do they teach hate?

There is no way Joseph Smith Jr. wrote this book. As you read it, it will sound like the King James Bible. The Book of Mormon is a translation of an ancient record of multiple civilizations' experiences with God. Chronologically, the book entitled 'Ether' in the book takes place first, starting at the tower of babel. It is an abridgment of a man's record called the Brother of Jared. This is an incredible account of a man seeing the Spirit Body of Jesus Christ years before he would be born in the flesh. We learn from this passage (Ether Ch. 3) that all people, Jesus included, exist as a spirit body before being born. This is just one of many unique and exciting doctrines clarified in the Book of Mormon. Read this book if you want to find out what millions of people around the world believe in. This book goes hand in hand with the Bible to show that God not only communicated His word to the peoples of the middle east area, but also in the ancient Americas as well. This book is used by millions as a guide post in their lives to moral living. It teaches of people who can be happy in times of terrible wars and economic struggles.

Later the \\"dark and loathsome\\" (using the Book of Mormon's own words, NOT mine!) native Americans kill all of the \\"white and delightsome\\" ones, and today we are left with dark skinned Hebrews who non-mormons call \\"indians\\".Sound offensive?

However, this can only be procured if the individual has an open mind and does not think that the Lord has stopped speaking to man.I grew up believing that the Book of Mormon is a book of falsehoods, due to my upbringing in the southern United States. My family and my former pastors only condemned those who were of the Latter-Day Saint faith with nonsensical charges. However, when I left home for the military, I began to search for peace and only obtained it after reading this great book. Only after putting away my preconceived notions of the Latter-Day Saints did I find that this book holds great truths.Prophets that ministered among the Nephite civilization wrote many of the truths in this book, which were written for our day. This is a cacophony of voices warning the Gentiles of America not to make the same mistakes they had made. It truly is a warning from the dust (Isaiah 29). When Christ appeared to this civilization, after his resurrection, he spent several chapters focusing on the condemnation that awaits the Gentiles, if they do not repent. If you will but look around, many can see that all is not well in so-called powerful America. Our societal ills are numerous.This book, coupled with the King James Bible, has given me eyes to see and ears to hear.

Are there translation or transcription errors? Maybe. Are there faults? If so, they are the faults of men as the book was written by men--men who on the pre-Columbian American continent and in Jerusalem felt or witnessed the hand of God in their own lives or that of the people they loved.Whether you believe this book is true or not, an unbiased reader cannot help but be inspired by it.

The adventure and characters that are included in the history portion of the record are inspiring and interesting to read about. I particularly like Captain Moroni and the Stripling Warriors. The account of the Savior's visit to the American continent written by Nephi is very moving. It is so good to know that Jesus Christ cares about all people and wanted all to know of his gospel. The account tells of many people witnessing his visit after His resurrection. They felt the nail prints in His hands. He told them who He was, and taught them the same things he taught the people in the old world. He called 12 apostles to help teach the people His gospel after he was gone, just as in the New Testament. I can't believe that this record is not accepted by everyone as a true record. It should be in every home, just as the Bible is. There is one scripture in Moroni Chapter 10 verse three that if put to the test, you will know this is a true record.

I was a faithful Mormon until my mid-forties, and served as a Bishop in the Mormon Church for a full five year term until I eventually began to read and question (violating the strong counsel of Mormon leaders that I not do so), and subsequently moved on to other, more expansive and inclusive, spiritual view points.The Book of Mormon is alleged by its believers to be real history recorded by prophets who had direct communication with God. Hence, most Mormons believe that the lessons it teaches by recounting the relationship between God, His prophets and a people who lived in the Americas, can be relied upon to guide our lives. And most importantly, they believe that since Joseph Smith created the Book of Mormon, its literal truthfulness is proof that all of the other things foundational to Mormonism that Smith said are also true, including that God gave him the exclusive authority to lead God's only \\"true\\" church on Earth.As time passes and science produces more evidence relevant to world the Book of Mormon says existed between 600 B.C.E. and 400 C.E. in the Americas (like recent DNA research related to the ancestry of native Americans - See Simon Sotherton \\"Losing a Lost Tribe\\"), it appears more and more probable that the Book of Mormon is not real history. This makes it, as things now stand, highly probable to be mythology in the classic sense - one of the sacred stories that are used by a people to explain the world in which they live. Virtually all of the people who do not accept this view and insist the Book of Mormon is real history, and the word of God, are those whose vested interest in Mormonism makes it somewhere between difficult and impossible to accurately assess the relevant evidence. Medical doctors do not treat their own children for the same reason that faithful Mormons should not be relied upon for a realistic view of what the Book of Mormon means or is - strong emotions are proven to interfere with the ability of human beings to process the information in front of them.For quite a while times have been rough for mythologies in general. Religious historian Karen Armstrong explains that this is due to the fact that modern man has become science or logic oriented but still needs and uses mythologies. Since mythologies are now written down, they can be analyzed in terms of their \\"truth\\" as defined by the accuracy of the description of the physical world they provide. When mythologies were not written down they could be modified from time to time as circumstances required by those within the society who were charged with the sacred responsibility of remembering and recounting these mythic histories, and so helping to stabilize society. Plato referred to these elites as philosopher kings - those few wise charged with the task of deceiving the masses as required to keep order and lead to them along the way they needed to go. The changes made to mythologies were essential t this, because mythologies need to make sense in light of the rest of what society believes in order to be relied upon to answer the \\"big\\" questions: Why are we here? Where did we come from? Why do we suffer? What happens after death? It is interesting to note that these are precisely the questions Mormons will tell you the Book of Mormon addresses, and definitively answers in most cases.So, what does geology tell us about whether there was, or not, a worldwide flood? What does the study of genetics and linguistics tell us about the origins of mankind, and of language? Etc. Mythologies were not subjected to these tests until relatively recently, and most religious people to one degree or another accept books like those contained in the Bible as being mythic. Was the earth created in seven 24 hour days, or was the story in Genesis some kind of metaphor, or myth? How about the Tower of Babel? Noah and the Ark? Jonah and the whale? The Virgin birth? The Resurrection?You can learn a lot about a Christian sect by simply determining where its members tend to draw the mythology line (usually without calling it that). Christianity has been dealing with this issue for at least a couple of centuries. Mormonism is just starting to deal with it in terms of the Book of Mormon. I predict that the Mormon Church will eventually follow the lead of the organization formerly called the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons who after Joseph Smith's death followed his family instead of Brigham Young) and recognize the Book of Mormon to be mythology.While most of us don't think of mythology in these terms, science has become the mythology - or is central to the mythology - of many people. This is even the case for many religiously inclined people. They use science to answer the big questions to the extent they can, and use religion (or new age philosophy, or common sense, etc.) to deal with what science cannot. This approach has been advocated at least since Galileo and Bacon, and so has had plenty of time to become part of the unconscious background of our society - our wallpaper. And then we have a host of quasi or psuedo-sciences that are really little more than religion dressed in mysticism derived from the fringes of science. The recent film \\"What the Bleep Do We Know\\" provides an interesting (if irritating) glimpse of a classic in this genre.As mythology, the Book of Mormon does not fare well. First, those who created it set expectations high by trying to sell it as real history. As the evidence noted above mounts, many former believers come painfully to the conclusion that they have been sold a grotesquely expensive bill of goods. And second, the book is unpersuasive as mythology except for those who continue to believe that it is a real account. This is because it does not pass the test of making sense in light of the rest of what we think is likely real in the world around us. And as time passes, the distinction between reality as most non-Mormons (and some Mormons) perceive it and the picture painted by the Book of Mormon becomes more stark and so harder to ignore. This, along with the wealth of easily accessible information available over the Internet, is what eventually drew my attention. Even leaders of the Mormon Church close to a hundred years ago, unbeknownst to most Mormons, are on record to the effect that the book is poorly written; shows clear signs of not only unoriginality, but immature authorship; etc. (See B. H. Roberts, \\"Studies of the Book of Mormon\\").In sum, there are countless books in the western canon, and many movies, that are in my view far more important in terms of their mythic contribution to our society than is the Book of Mormon.I continue to believe that it is important that we find our \\"whys\\". Hence, I place a high value on good mythology. However, my experience with Mormonism taught some hard lessons about how a few people tend to use whatever means they can lay their hands on to control the large group around them. I now take special care to avoid those who attempt to use any mythology to control me, and seek out those who will try to help me understand myself and exercise more control over my life as I explore this wonderful experience that we in the democratic west have the privilege to have.So why, might one ask, did I give the Book of Mormon two stars? First, it forms the basis for a large religion that continues to grow, though more slowly than in the past due to issues such as those I mention above coupled with the Internet. That religion also boasts many well-educated members who continue to believe, against the odds, that this book is real history. This, in and of itself, makes the Book of Mormon a matter of significant curiosity.Regrettably, a person who wishes to understand the Book of Mormon's power will not likely be helped by reading it. Its power rests not in its texts, but is a function of the emotional responses that result from being a member of the close-knit Mormon community. That is, when a Mormon or someone looking into Mormonism feels good things as a result community participation, being paid significant attention of one kind or another, etc. they are told that these feelings emanate from their study Book of Mormon - that God is telling them by the good things they feel that the Book of Mormon is indeed His word, and that by extension the Mormon Church is the one and only true church on Earth. The book could work just as well in this regard were it a South Park episode written in socially acceptable, clumsy language and without wit. In fact, as I wrote that I realized that South Park likely has much more mythic value than does the Book of Mormon. At least some episodes do.The second star is for a few ideas that the book contains that Joseph Smith, the book's author, should be at least credited with collecting. These include ideas related to the joy mankind should experience and the central role we may choose to give joy in life. Various philosophers had been saying that for a long time before Smith, but it was not part of the Christian canon and so IF the Book of Mormon had been the word of the Christian God (as Mormons claim it to be), this would have been an innovation. It also contains some nice passages regarding how faith works, the importance of humility and personal agency, and the role of suffering in life. But again, none of this was new when one considers the work of the countless thinkers who preceded Joseph Smith. It appears likely that he either copied these ideas from things he read or had heard, or that he came to the same kind of conclusions about the human predicament that many before him had already reached.In short, I don't think that this book would be useful to the vast majority of people who purchase books on Amazon. But for the curious few who are interested in modern mythologies and how they work, don't mind turgid prose, and have plenty of time on their hands, the Book of Mormon might be just the thing. Overall, my advice even to those few is that they wait for the Coles Notes version. That will be as enlightening, and much less painful to read.My further thoughts regarding the Book of Mormon and Mormonism can be found at http://mccue.cc/bob/spirituality.htm"},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"Regardless of you religous preference The Book of Mormon provides an awsome look into the lives of characters, who much like people today, face struggles to find peace, and happiness.

As I have done some extensive research on the origins of the LDS church and the Book of Mormon in particular, I have come to the realization that it is a fabrication with some shreds of truth mixed in.I totally support any and all who want to align themselves with the LDS religion. Some of the values and virtues taught are certainly worthwhile. Most of my extended family are active LDS. However, I have come to the realization (as hard as it was) that Joseph Smith was not at all what the LDS church is claiming. If you actually look at history, you would be somewhat surprised to learn just how \\"shaky\\" the whole \\"first vision\\" tale is. I no longer believe it even happened. Polygamy was always a sore spot with me, but if you actually read historical accounts of what actually happened, you would be shocked and disgusted and come to the realization that it was a practice invented by Smith alone and was the main factor in his eventual death. In fact, most of the teachings and historical depictions taught by the LDS church - including the recent DVD on the \\"restoration\\" - are, in fact, mostly fiction.From an historical point of view, the Book of Mormon has hundreds of contradictions and problems. Many of the views and doctrines addressed in the book were prominent religious issues of the 1800's period and it was obviously of product of that time.I was first troubled by another book of LDS scripture called the Book of Abraham in the Pearl of Great Price. From my research on that book, it is very obvious that it was a fabrication of Joseph Smith. The actual papyrus from which that book was supposedly \\"translated\\" was recently found. The analysis of the papyrus - even by church authorities - has resulted in the declaration that the validity of the Book of Abraham is in question. I have no doubt that it's a fabrication.When the shocking declarations against the Book of Abraham became known, I began to look at the Book of Mormon with critical eyes as well. The result was a discovery of many problems starting with the way the gold plates were discovered and continuing with problems with how they were translated and ending with major doctrinal problems.There are many in the LDS church who will claim they \\"know\\" the Book of Mormon is \\"true\\" because they have a \\"testimony\\" of it through the power of the Holy Ghost. I certainly claimed as much. However, I have also come to realize that the \\"emotional response\\" of such things is very unreliable. The tingly, warm peaceful feelings one gets from various events and interactions are really nothing more than an \\"emotional response\\" based upon beliefs and experiences. They happen to everybody in many different capacities and religions. They are not manifestations of \\"truth.\\"I respect those who believe in the LDS teachings - including the Book of Mormon. However, I have come to the realization that the Mormon church is a fabricated religion. There are many \\"active\\" members of the church who believe the same thing but are still involved because they enjoy the community and culture. Many in other religions do exactly the same thing.With regards."},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"This book is amazing. Although very similar to the Bible, from a reading standpoint, the Book of Mormon is an entirely separate work. A lot of the people reviewing this book are so incredibly close minded. Why is it so hard to believe that there are two &quot;witness of Christ&quot; like the book explains??? I don't understand what is so mind wrenching about that concept. It is a known fact that the Bible has been translated multiple times and the errors that occur within the text are numberous. It would only make sense that an ALL KNOWING GOD would be able to forsee such an occurance and have other means by which to get the truth out in the open! It is impossible to read this book and not feel something, even if it is a slight desire to improve ones self, right!? So for all of you supposed Biblical fanatics out there who profess to the death that the Bible is the one and only word of God...wake up! If you really understand the Bible then you have to realize that being close minded is NOT an element talked about.

(Compare Coverdale's Bible to a modern translation and you will see what I mean. Joseph Smith had less style in is whole body that Coverdale had in his pinky.)I was astounded at the methodology of the \\"faith experiment\\" of Alma 32. It is poor science at it's very worse - more kith and kin to the \\"science\\" of creationism than any sort of real science.I am also dubious of the thesis that the Native Americans are of Jewish extractions being Lamanities and such and the Polynesians are also Jewish through the Nephite Hagoth. Are the Navajo and Sioux languages (for example) of Hebrew derivation like French and Spanish are to Latin? Was the \\"Tower of Babel\\" a real event as described in Ether? The science is just not there to make and substantiate any such claims. I hear that the BofM is not a book of geography and that you should not try to find where certain places (like Bountiful or Zarahemla) were, but that begs the question: If the BofM is not a book of geography is it a book of history?I have to agree with an earlier review stating that the BofM that the book has almost no distinctive Mormon beliefs - those all reside in the \\"Doctrine and Covenants\\" and the \\"Pearl of Great Price\\". The whole point of the BofM as presented by the missionaries is to establish a belief in Joseph Smith and less of a point to convert someone to a belief in Jesus Christ - since most \\"investigators\\" already have that belief. The logic goes like this:a) BofM is true, therefore:b) Joseph Smith is a prophet, therefore:c) Church he set up is true ( and the one you belong to is not), therefore:d) Everything the Church has done, is doing, and will do is \\"true\\" QED.But the flaw in the reasoning is that is just because the book is \\"true\\" that does not mean that the practice of polygamy (for instance) is \\"true.\\" It only means that Joseph Smith was called to translate this book - Nothing else. The Mary Baker Eddy approach of religion building seems to be a more honest approach. That is just simply writing a text which correlates and \\"corrects\\" the bible to your own personal opinion and use that as a scripture.But in the final analysis, who am I to judge the beliefs of my brother (or sister)? If people say they feel like they are better people for reading the BofM then more power to them. If a belief in the BofM keeps the book's believers from breaking into my house, then by all means let me not tear down your faith in such a book - read it to your heart's content.Two similarities to the Celestine Prophecy make me smile:CP\\"An ancient manuscript discovered in Peru...\\"BofM\\"Ancient golden plates discovered in New York State...\\"CP\\"Government wants to suppress the manuscript...\\"ParleyP.Prat\\"hiring ministers fight the truth\\""},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"Mark Twain made a somewhat in-depth review of the Book of Mormon after reading it, but he summed it all up when he said that the book was &quot;chloroform in print&quot;.

That said, it's quite an impressive work of fantasy, and I mean that in a most respectful manner.If we are to be truly objective about the Book of Mormon, it must be said that it took quite an intellect to create. I know this may sound mocking, but allow me to put the writing of this book into perspective, how many first-time authors in their late teens/early twenties have dictated a great epic featuring dozens of characters that takes place over a thousand years while sticking their heads into hats? Perhaps the earlier editions were rougher, my copy is post-1970, but it must rank up there with other works from young authors such as Chris Paolini.It took a vivid imagination to write such a book. Case in point: where else do you read about Angry Jesus coming down and wreaking havoc? The individual stories and characters are fairly original and the genealogies are complex and consistent as far as I could tell (I have neither the time nor desire to examine it thoroughly). While Smith's style is a bit pompous and ponderous, compared to other works of the 1800's/early 1900's such as Crowley's \\"Book of the Law\\" and Blavatsky's wordy \\"Isis Unveiled\\" and \\"Secret Doctrine\\", it fits right in.To sum it up, if you can take the Book of Mormon objectively without a knee-jerk reaction to its religious nature (positive or negative), it's a rather decent work of fiction. The story is dull at times with annoying Biblesque tangents and anachronistic monikers for Jesus, but it's not a bad bit of writing for a first-time, basically self-published young author. It's just a pity that, like many religious works, it is not seen by its creative merit alone."},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"I was disapponted in this book. It was difficult to follow, repetitive, and had no real message of hope or love. I believe this book promotes racism.I thought the idea of people being cursed with dark skin was racist.

The disciples departed in search of food and Christ remained at the well. Upon arriving at the well, Christ approached a Samarian women who was drawing water. The woman was surprised that the Lord verbally interacted with her, a Samaritian, because the Jews and Samaritians were both socially and politically separated. Samaritians were consider pagan and impure Jewish line corrupted by intermarriage with Assyrians ,after capitivity. Christ would answered the woman's question, \\"How is that thou, being a Jew, asketh drink of men, which am a woman of Samaria\\" with the reply, \\"If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee eternal life.\\"Image yourself in a state of dehyration caused from countless hours of walking in a hostile terrain. The texture of your tongue tasting like cotton paste and the lips split open and bleeding from exposure to the dry wind. The heat of the day and the sound of the wind blowing offer no companionship as the sweat has stopped and the pains of kidney drive one for survival. At times, the mirage of a water provide relief too strained eyes with hopes of eager anticipation of water, but only to step aimlessly toward dry deseret. Suddenly, the sound of water is detect; scrapping feet along the unlevel surface, one stumbles towards the beautiful sound of water. Reaching the waters edge, scoups of waters can not quench the fast enough; so the urge for more water causes a change of posture to a prone position next to the earth allowing increased water intake. The quest for water was never so important. Reflection of those moments of deprivation caused a strong longing not be every return to such hostile terrain and risk water deprivation. Christ is the spiritual water to a thirst world. He understood perfected the need for man to receive the water of eternal life. Without his water we would die spiritually. The Savior distinquished between the water at Jacobs well and his spiritual water by telling the women, \\"But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.\\"Only the faithful can tap into the living spring. \\"But unto him that keepeth my commandments I will give the mysterious of my kingdom, and the same shall be in him a well of living water, springing up unto everlasting life.\\" Why are so many spiritually thirsty? They don't get to the Iron Rod which will lead them to the fountain of living water; they are blinded by the subtle craftiness of men, whereby they lie in wait to deceive, and who are only kept from the truth because they know not where to find it. The Book of Mormon is the word of God. The Book of Mormon is a second witness of Jesus Christ supporting the testimony of the Bible. The Book of Mormon teaches about the Tree of Life and the Fountain of Living water.Image arriving to the tree of life through obedience and faith and seeing the face of Jesus Christ and upon remembering the scripture of the Samaritian ask for eternal life. Would Christ at that moment of reward deprive one of the needed water? If we are worthy to see Christ we can ask for his water of eternal life?

The first of these, Lehi, lived in Jerusalem about 600 BC (around the same time of Zedekiah, King of Judah). The Lord commanded Lehi to leave Jerusalem (as it was soon afterwards destroyed by the Babylonians), and lead a small group of people to the American continent. There, they established a great civilization. God continued to call prophets among these people.The Book of Mormon is a collection of their writings - it is named after one of these prophets. If his name had been \\"Frank\\" it would be called the \\"Book of Frank.\\" Then, when missionaries came knocking on people's doors - parents would yell to their children \\"Quick, Hide, the Franks are coming!!!\\" and there would be a group of bitter \\"Anti-Franks.\\" But his name was Mormon, and it is named after him.The prophets who wrote in the Book of Mormon wrote all about Jesus Christ. They prophesied that he would come, and after his death and resurrection in Jerusalem, he appeared to his \\"other sheep\\" (john 10:16) in the American continent. There, He taught them his Gospel and formed His church among them. This book contains a record of that visit.For centuries, the truth about God's plan for us has been available primarily in the Bible. God has now given us the Book of Mormon. It stands as another witness of Jesus Christ. In the Bible, the Apostle Paul states that \\"...in the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established\\" (2 Cor 13:1)The Book of Mormon contains a promise to all who read it. The Lord has given each of a promise through the last prophet in the book that if we will read from it, ponder it, and pray about it - then God will let us know that it is true.I have had the chance to read this book several times - it helps me feel closer to God.

I read this book because I promised my Mormon friend I would. I love my Mormon friend to pieces, but lordy lordy, how can anyone with any intelligence see this book as a true revelation from God.I also read the Doctrine and the Covenants and The Pearl of Great Price (two more scriptures that Mormons believe in just as much as the B of M) and it is so clear that Joseph Smith was a conman, a trickster, a very dishonest man who created a religion to satisfy his narcisstic desires. The fact that he created polygamy for himself, even marrying women who already had husbands, and designed the Mormon temple ordiances with all it's secret handshakes, code words, and blood oaths, after Freemasonry. Joseph Smith was a devoted Free Mason amongst many other things,.. why the heck are these facts not in the Mormon missionary's lessons? Because they're not faith-promoting that's why.And my Mormon friend who gave me the B of M and the D and C and the P of G P, herself hardly knows the history of the Mormon church. She completely believes the Book of Mormon despite how obvious it is that Joseph Smith made it all up. And she swears on the B of M that Joseph Smith never practiced polygamy. I love my naive Mormon friend, but it's clear that all Mormons have to be this naive and blind in order to believe in such a religion. My poor friend is so sad that she hasn't been able to convert me.

In Stake High Concil Meeting last week the Stake President made a point to discuss the Church's distribution of the Book of Mormon in retail stores as a fulfillment of the promise that the Book of Mormon will flood the earth in the latter-days. He said that there are individuals who don't want the Lord's work to go on and are doing everything they can to thwart the Gospel of Jesus Christ. He said that one particular item that is causing the Bretheren concern is public message boards and book review forums such as the one at Amazon.com. He asked that we pass along the request to visit the review boards and message areas and post thoughtful and uplifting messages and reviews for those who are seeking the truth. If enough people will post uplifting messages then the anti-Mormons will get the message and stop spreading their hate. So, as a friend I am asking that each and every one of you take the time to do something positive in regards to the attacks on the Book of Mormon.

I've been in and out of the church and back in again. I have found the reviews below to be a great cross section of opinions and stories, not so much about this book, but about the reviewers themselves. Many seek to polarize Christians from mormons, many seek to convert others to the truthfulness of this book. As a former lapsed-mormon, I readily recognize the thesis-beating, anti-mormon angles on everything from polygamy to the drab nature of modern day sacrament meetings, to Joseph's polyandry, to the \\"evil\\" corporate structure. I smile. I love to learn about people's biases. I also reconize the stories about how this book has changed lives. It has changed mine for better and worse. Yet they are simply stories about people, not about the Book of Mormon. I look at the book of mormon support/critizism much as I look at the war in Iraq. Something has taken place in Iraq. But if you listen to CNN, you will come away with a much different story than, say, Al-Jezzira Television. And Fox will give you a much different story than Peter Jennings or Dan Rather. The NY Times a much different story than the Washington Post. All stories about the same event ,yielding vastly different interpretations,It is my contention that the stories say much more about the tellers than they do about the event. Same with the book of mormon. It is an event. It was published. It exists. It is examinable, inspectable.The Book of Mormon is what it is.People's reactions must necessarily vary in intensity and response. And many of the responses can be true at the same time, given the heart-felt state of the believer/non-believer. One approach to this book is to read everything Pro and Con about it. Get data, then decide. You'll find this approach initially invigorating and enlightening.If you are coming from an anti-approach, you'll find wonderful ammo with which to surprise the lay member of the church who is not up on history. You can build a case or story begging the question, \\"How can any half-witted dolt buy into this fabrication?\\"If you are reading for pro-mormon reasons, you'll find incredibly poor logic behind much of the attacks and will be pleasantly surprised that some of the smartest thought leaders in secular society also happen to be believing, practicing mormons, i.e. Covey, Bushman, Eyring, Orson Scott Card, and a ton of Senators, business leaders, university presidents, yale philosphy doctorates, oxford press publications, blah blah blah, etc. etc. You'll also find church owned BYU in the forefront of genetic research using scientists who believe in this stuff. In fact the first woman to graduate at the top of Harvard Law School just a few years ago was a mormon girl from Sandy, Utah. But this approach will teach you that opinion repeats itself in many different costumes, forms and levels of articulation. Data does not convice, it just makes you aware of the spectrum of opinion.Again, the Book Of Mormon is what it is. You have to develop your own response by reading it.So what does all this mean? At the very least, one must admit there is something in this book that arises passion and confusion at the same time. Something that brings it to the all time best seller list and to many \\"biggest frauds\\" lists as well.Really the only question is this: What story do you tell about this book, having really read it, and what does that story say about you? It will certainly amplify the skeptic's horse laugh. It will give the believer a real challenge to their sprituality. It will give the debunker a chance to selectively pick through the pages and build a case that reflects the internal bias of the debunker. If you come at it expecting the \\"Koran\\" of the mormons, you may find it to be so. If you happen on it without any precondtioning, without any western provincial attitudes, such as the western african nations have, then it may blow your mind and cause you to start a movement that will convert thousands, as it has. If you grew up in Salt Lake City as a non-mormon, you will certainly be very aware of how you should think of it and if you are a life long mormon it will be so ingrained in your soul you don't even notice when you are telling your own story through it's tales. Bottom line, as Joseph Campbell said, \\"Get a myth and hold on for the ride\\". Many have latched onto the mythical proposition the Book Of Mormon offers. We are all on spritual journeys, and here is a book full of stories you can adopt as your guide.All humans are built to tell stories which reflect our inner self. I feel as though I know each and every one of these reviewers, as I have walked in many of their shoes. but I do not know much more about the book of mormon by scanning the reviews. And neither do you. Read it and find your own bent, prayers or no prayers. Either way it is worth a look see.

It came to me at a time when I was searching for a greater meaning and through this book I found it. I have heard many critics of the book but they are consistantly people who are uninformed, havent read the book or have something to gain by condemnation. But being one who has read, is informed (on both sides) and has absolutly nothing to gain I will tell you my opinion. This book is a beautiful tale of a family. Of love and hate, faithfulness and betrayal. It tells a wonderful story about the realtionship this family and its progenitors have with God. Many joys and many tragedies. In the end it is a story that gives us all hope. The amazing part is .... it's true! Not a work of fiction. It tells me that God is mindfull of not only the Jews - his chosen people - from whom we received the Bible, but he knows all his children throughout the world. The Bible is a beautiful account of how God loved and cared for a people who lived far, far away and long, long ago and i love the book but I also love the Book of Mormon because it tells about God's love for another family who lived not quite so long ago and not very far away at all. I read the book and I wanted to know for myself if what I was reading was true so I went to the \\"Source\\". I prayed. I knew that if there was an answer He would tell me. It was improtant for me to know because the message is so sweet but I couldnt beleive unless I had a witness from heaven. The witness came. It can come to you too. Because of this book I am closer to God and my faith in Christ is now unshakable. He died for ALL people.

It teaches many beautiful and important truths about God which confirm the Bible and also gives greater light on important subjects that will help us grow closer to God and learn more of his will. The mere existence of the Book of Mormon also demonstrates another truth which should be obvious, but which most people have never really considered- that God loves and remembers all of his children and therefore gives all of his children the same opportunity to learn his saving truths. The Bible demonstrates that God blessed the people who lived thousands of years ago in the Middle East by sending them prophets to teach his word. The Book of Mormon shows that he also remembered those who lived in ancient America by giving them prophets so that they could have these same truths. And by giving us prophets today (including Joseph Smith, who translated the Book of Mormon from its original language by power of God), God demonstrates that he also loves and remembers those of us who live today. Just like people in ancient times, we need prophets in our time who receive revelation directly from God and can teach us God's plan with purity, knowledge and power. And God, in his love and mercy, has called such men in our day so that we need not rely solely upon men's fallible interpretations of former prophets' writings.I recommend the Book of Mormon to everyone who sincerely desires to learn of God. I am persuaded that the Book of Mormon will bring to all those who read it with a sincere heart a greater understanding of God's love and his purposes for his children, a greater appreciation for his plan of happiness, and a greater desire to do good."},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"A lot of people believe this book to be the word of God. For them, the spiritual value of this volume is obvious.For everyone else, this book represents the latest significant chapter in the anthology of world religious texts. It illustrates a new and interesting idea of God and man's relationship to him, of the purpose of this life and the nature of the afterlife. It belongs on the shelf right next to the Bhaghavad Gita and the Tao Te Ching and deserves the same respect from religious scholars and anyone else wishing to understand the beliefs of others.Mormonism is one of the fastest growing world religions. Mormons are our neighbors and co-workers. While this book doesn't really help anyone understand why they do a lot of the weird things they do, it goes a long way to helping one understand why they believe what they really believe. Some modern readers may have some minor diffuculty with the 1830's English, but its compelling narrative and brevity make it much easier to digest than most other world religious texts.Many reviewers want to harp on the fact that the book is *false.* Nobody seems to care if the Analects of Confucius are true or false. It's true, the book does make a pretty bold promise. Whether or not that promise pans out, twelve million people today believe it, and over the past hundred years millions more have left homes and families, crossed oceans and plains, and been disowned, defamed, deported, assaulted and killed because they believed it. To me that is more of a challenge than a promise, to take this book seriously, believe it or not."},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"I'm trying to remember the statistics... I think it was either every 1.5 or every 2.5 verses on average it mentions Jesus Christ (can't remember which), claiming His divinity as the Son of God, our Savior and Redeemer, One with the Father, and the ONLY path to Eternal Life.I've read it countless (litterally dozens and dozens) of times - once in it's entirety in 2 days, and another time in 1 week, but usually I don't just read it - I study it taking months, and cross reference it with similar inspiring Biblical passages, even taking years sometimes to go from the beginning to the end.You can read it all online or get the hardcopy I have for free (why buy one?) right here: http://www.mormon.org/bookofmormon. I've never read the particular above publication of it, but on mine the index is huge and remarkably well done so you can find a passage discussing just about anything.If you want to learn about Christ's life on earth then read the Bible, but if you want to further strengthen you belief of the good message of eternal life that he gave his disciples then read the Book of Mormon. You'll find it is in complete agreement with the Inspired writings of the Bible too - a fact that opponents to mormonism downplay and unconvincingly try to refute.But don't take my word for it - try it for yourself (dig into it too, don't just skim and read someone's \\"selected passages\\"), and then pray about it.

This belief generates a feeling that the Book of Mormon is scripture, i.e., the written word of God. Mormons are indoctrinated by the LDS church to believe and feel these things.The LDS church has declared for generations that the Book of Mormon is the keystone of the Mormon faith (take away a keystone and the arch collapses). It also claims that it is the only true church of God on Earth, the only church authorized by Jesus Christ to teach his doctrines and perform the rites necessary for \\"eternal salvation\\". As well, since Joseph Smith's day, the LDS church has grown to be a multi-billion dollar religious/corporate empire. So, there's a great deal riding on the Book of Mormon being what the LDS church claims it to be.In fact, the Book of Mormon is a work of fiction, and a rather boring one (I have read it several times). For example, the phrase, \\"and it came to pass\\" is repeated 3,855 times. The LDS church's senior historian in the early 20th century, B. H. Roberts, carefully reviewed the Book of Mormon and discovered that it contained more than 100 pages worth of Biblical words and phrases. Quoting Roberts from his book, Studies of the Book of Mormon: \\"In the first place there is a certain lack of perspective in the things the book [the Book of Mormon] relates as history that points quite clearly to an undeveloped mind as their origin. The narrative proceeds in characteristic disregard of conditions necessary to its reasonableness, as if it were a tale told by a child, with utter disregard for consistency. (p. 250). That \\"child\\" was Joseph Smith, the author of the Book of Mormon.The Book of Mormon is not a true or even an allegorical history of peoples in the ancient Americas. The mountain of facts proving this statement grows larger with each new archeological, genetic, and other types of scientific discoveries. The lastest has been DNA evidence confirming that the indigenous peoples of the Americas descended from people who came from regions in Asia. The lack of bellows, steel, brass, breast plates, gold and silver currency, elephants, asses, oxen, cows and bulls, domestic goats, swine, horses, and barley (all mentioned in the Book of Mormon) in the Western Hemisphere prior to the arrival of Columbus and the subsequent European migration is strong proof that the Book of Mormon is not what the LDS church claims it to be. As well, people in the ancient Americas did not use the French word, \\"Adieu\\" (ref. Jacob 7:27), nor did they ride around in chariots (ref. 2 Nephi 12:27; Alma 18: 9,10,12 and 20:6; 3 Nephi 3:22 and 21:14).If you are going to read the Book of Mormon, bear in mind that it is used to support a fraud: Mormonism. The LDS church, aware of the scientific and other evidence that disproves its claim about the Book of Mormon, continues to use the book in an attempt to persuade people to join (and stay in) the church (and pay at least 10% of their income to the church).[...]"},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"When you faithfully give your heart, mind, and soul to an organization that you faithfully believe was a restored gospel of Jesus Christ, and then uncover all of the contradictions and lies....you can't help but \\"leave, but not leave it alone.\\" I view those still in the church kind of like I do those in an abusive relationship but don't know that they are in one.

The book is exceedingly dull and insipid to read. It takes a \\"cheer squad\\" of Mormons (R.L.D.S. or L.D.S.) to work up any respect for this piece of tiresome fakery and snooze-inducing, sub-sub-standard prose, which Mark Twain so aptly called \\"chloroform in print\\".Doubleday missed an opportunity to make a trade edition available of this kinky, funky religious classic. The text which Doubleday elected to print for fully commercial distribution is the presently accepted one, copyrighted 1981, of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (L.D.S.), a text which is encrusted with editorial accretions, emendations, and changes inflicted on the torpid fustian of Joseph Smith's tortured prose, perpetuated by now across years within three consecutive centuries. There have been notable attempts to return to a more authentic text of the BoM, and Doubleday should have insisted on printing a more exact text than what is available free from the L.D.S. Mormon cult in its missionary endeavours.Atop that, Doubleday's text is visually bland, downright (and needlessly) glumly stolid. Printing the text in double columns is not at all inviting to the reader's eyes. The currently standard edition as published by the L.D.S. cult itself, in various bindings and of varying physical quality, is much more alluring to a reader's vision. It is difficult enough to trudge through Jospeh Smith's tiresome prose, turgid and pseudo-archaic in the worst way, without having to read it in a form so uninviting as on the pages of this edition.Doubleday also has published Grant Hardy's study edition of the BoM, titled \\"The Book of Mormon: a Reader's Edition\\" (ISBN 0-25207341-X) from the then official L.D.S. 1920 text, thankfully, published full page rather than in double columns. Hardy's study helps are welcome and helpful, at least from an indoctrinated L.D.S. point of view. However, the fulsome stodginess of Joseph Smith Junior's own dreadful English remains, along with the 1920 and prior L.D.S. texts' own array of alterations and emendations which had accumulated by 1920 and now by 19821 to remove the text of Smith's words from the readings of the earliest manuscripts and editions.If the reader really wants, out of a sense of cultural duty or from sheer curiosity, to read the BoM, let him at least acquire the moderately updated rendering done from a better original text, in the \\"Revised Authorized Version\\" (or \\"R.A.V.\\") of the BoM that is available as published by Herald House, thus from the official publisher of the Community of Christ (a.k.a. Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, or \\"R.L.D.S.\\"). The R.L.D.S. \\"Authorized Version\\" (or \\"A.V.\\") BoM's text (ISBN 0-83090275-0) as accepted by the Community of Christ is closer to Joseph Smith Junior's original wording, in all of its authentic turgidity, while the R.L.D.S. \\"Revised Authorized Verson\\" (the ISBN of an economical edition being 0-83090273-2) of the Community of Christ is a modest update in current modern English of the text, the latter hence being a wee bit less tedious to read than the former.If the reader simply wants to have an acquaintance with what the BoM is about, without reading its hundreds of pages of torpid prose, he can procure a breezily appealing and very thorough recast of it into the idiomatic modern English as Lynn Matthews Anderson simplifies it (working from the L.D.S. rather than from a R.L.D.S. text), somewhat abridging the bloated and overly-extended accounts of the putative narratives, visions, and discourses that fill the BoM's pages. Anderson's appealing adaptation is titled \\"Easy-to-Read Book of Mormon\\" (Estes Book Co., 1995) and is available (from Amazon or elsewhere) in a paperback edition (ISBN 0-96449570-8) as well as in an hardcover edition. For readers who wish to have a L.D.S. edition which modernises the English less drastically than Anderson recasts it, while retaining the text of the BoM more fully, a choice (as a L.D.S. alternative to Herald House R.L.D.S.' R.A.V. of the BoM in modern idiom) is \\"A Plain English Reference to the Book of Mormon\\", as Timothy B. Wilson updates Smith's English prose (Bonneville Books, 1998, ISBN 1-55517401-9).The message for the publisher of this trade edition is this: \\"Doubleday, guys, when you are ready to reprint the BoM, why not seek out a superior text in more agreeable presentation? Go to it (next time), dudes!\\"NOTA BENE: As per s.o.p., a L.D.S. Mormon (B. Robert by name) has objected that this review outmodedly reeks merely of anti-Mormon bigotry. Since L.D.S. Mormons are prone to have such knee-jerk reactions to any opinion that varies from their own cultish one, here is added to the text of this review itself part of the reply, adapted, to that reader, as follows:A secular (trade) publisher is not held to printing the current standard text of the BoM; in fact, he is not bound to print any of these three \\"standard\\" sanctioned texts of either of major Mormon groups, the two standard texts of the Community of Chirst (R.L.D.S.) or the copyrighted 1981 standard text of the L.D.S. cult; it remains true that an edition based on a more critical text would have been a better (and far more interesting) choice on the part of Doubleday. The L.D.S. cult itself is preparing critical text and variorum editions of the BoM, for that matter! Why should Doubleday at least not print, for example, a BoM according to the wording of the 1830 (1829) edition, something that would be of interest to many Mormons as well as to others?Any religious group that passes itself off as Christian but is anti-Trinitarian is a cult (so that's how as this review quite legitimately uses the term), thus the L.D.S. group is a cult, while the Trinitarian R.L.D.S. (Community of Christ) group has been a Christian denomination (or an only mildly devient Chistian sect) right from its inception, albeit one that is becoming increasing \\"liberal\\" in its drift (but is not, at least yet, a cult). Trinitarianism (the doctrine of both Christ's simultaneous divinity and humanity, within the Trinity, is among such other crucial doctrines) is not the only possible divide between Church (or denomination, sect) and cult, but it is \\"The Great Divide\\" that is what one usually confronts which makes a group cultic in essence. In addition to rejecting Trinitarianism, the L.D.S. cult embraced polytheism, so that it is not even monotheistic (and L.D.S. arguments that its Mormonism now worships only the Father, among the many gods that it teaches to exist, do not clear it of the charge of polytheism). Mormonism om its L.D.S. really has become a different world religion rather than simply an heretical varian of Christianity. That Mormonism could in its early days branch into Christian (R.L.D.S.) and pagan (L.D.S.) forms is one of the most fascinating aspects of the religion that Joseph Smith bequeathed to a suffering, conflict-besotted planet.No, there is no need to back up to the 1970s to situate this Amazon contributor's reaction. Mainstream, highly doctrinally compromised Protestant denominations may choose, from politeness or from doctrinal indifference, to refer to the L.D.S. cult as a church, but there are plenty of more doctrinally strict Christians who recognise the cult, non-Christian, indeed heathen nature of L.D.S. Mormonism. There is room to disagree about such matters, today as there was yesterday.Incidentally, personal opinion, as here, can sustain an high regard for the religiously intellectual status of both forms of Mormonism, including regularly reading scholarly L.D.S. Mormon publications, to which this writer subscribes, (e.g., \\"B.Y.U. Studies\\", all of the FARMS' serial publications, etc.), with great interest; these periodicals (and many L.D.S. books, too) very often are more rigourously learned and probing than far too many Christian publications, Protestant or Catholic are (though, of course, not thus superior to all such). When one is from an Utah family, it is not surprising that one can find L.D.S. Mormonism so inherently interesting. This contributor has taken care to warn, in several Amazon reviews, that a Christian zealot under-estimates the sophistication of Mormonism to his own peril, especially in apologetic interchanges. It is no compromise of Christian principle to insist on NOT misrepresenting what Mormons believe. The truth about L.D.S. Mormonism is of sufficient concern to a believing Christian that he has no need to distort what Mormonism really does teach and practise. To misrepresent Mormonism is usually either a sign of intellectual dishonesty (and hence, of uncharitable contempt) or of ignorance of Mormonism's own sources and of other more honest Protestant and Catholic evaluations of Mormonism. Neither is it contradictory for a believing Christan to hold a VERY high regard for Mormon accomplishments, artistically, academically, and in other ways. Modern-day L.D.S. Mormonism indeed, fuguratively speaking, has made a silk purse out of the sow's ear of the religion that Joseph Smith Junior founded, as he, Brigham Young, and other L.D.S. Mormon founders formulated it."},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"This book has changed my life, helped me find Christ, helped me become a better, father, husband, friend and employee.

Now that I have read the book and compared it to Smith's book, \\"The Doctrine and Covenants\\", I sadly must conclude the Book of Mormon is nineteenth century literature.If you are looking for some spiritual insight, here are some nice passages. 2 Nephi Chapter 2 has an interesting messianic discussion about opposition in all things. Mosiah Chapters 2-3 have a nice discussion about serving others. Alma Chapter 5 has nice language of having \\"God's image\\" engraven in one's countenance. The visit of Jesus of Nazareth, in 3 Nephi Chapters 9-27, however, was too clever by half and too much like Matthew 5-6, including translation errors that crept into the New Testament texts after the autographs were written in the late first and early second centuries CE.What I found odd but subtle was Smith's doctrinal evolution in the text even as he dictated it. Smith wrote, \\"... God doth not walk in crooked paths ... nor doth he vary from that which he hath said ....\\" (D&C; 3:2). But both the Book of Mormon and the Book of Doctrine and covenants show Smith's changing doctrine.Just take Smith's early ritual of becoming a Mormon convert.Regarding the early evolution of Smith's conversion ritual, his written record probably began in the summer of 1828. Smith wrote a definition of Jesus' doctrine that had two elements:Behold, this is my doctrine-whosoever (1) repenteth and (2) cometh unto me, the same is my church. Whosoever declareth more or less than this, the same is not of me, but is against me; therefore he is not of my church.(D&C; 10: 67-68. Notations added). In this passage, there are two elements that were exclusive to the ritual. The inclusive/exclusive declaration, \\"more or less than this, the same is not of me\\" etc. implicitly excluded everything else. Baptism was not one of the two elements.The King Benjamin \\"camp meeting\\" in the Book of Mormon was probably Smith's next expression of a conversion ritual:O (1) have mercy, and apply the atoning blood of Christ that we may receive forgiveness of our sins, and our hearts may be purified; (2) for we believe in Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who created heaven and earth, and all things; who shall come down among the children of men.(Mosiah 4:2. Notations added). The people's invocation was effective as their two-element ritual, sans baptism, achieved a remission of their sins:\\"And it came to pass that after they had spoken these words the Spirit of the Lord came upon them, and they were filled with joy, having received a remission of their sins, and having peace of conscience, because of the exceeding faith which they had in Jesus Christ who should come, according to the words which King Benjamin had spoken unto them.\\"(Mosiah 4:3). Baptism does not appear anywhere in the corpus of King Benjamin's discourses. Baptism's absence in King Benjamin's doctrine was justified by the people's on-the-spot remission of their sins, and the absence of baptism was implicitly defended by King Benjamin's inclusive/exclusive statement:[N]either are there any conditions whereby man can be saved except the conditions which I have told you.(Mosiah 4:8). This, statement, spoken immediately after the people had received a remission of their sins, qualifies as the inclusive/exclusive declaration element of the conversion ritual that I noted in D&C;, section 10. Perhaps not coincidentally, the statement appears to exclude baptism a requirement for salvation.But back to the subject of conversion, a small step had been taken toward forming an institutional religion, because King Benjamin \\"thought it was expedient . . . that he should take the names of all those who had entered into a covenant with God . . .\\" (Mosiah 6:1). However, there was no formal organization that was joined as a direct result of his people's epiphany.Smith next articulated a conversion ritual with Alma the Elder's charismatic-authority behavior at the Waters of Mormon. An informal statement of requirements for this conversion ritual is found in Mosiah 18: The people must (1) be desirous to come to the fold of God (v. 8), (2) be called his people (v. 8), (3) be willing to bear one another's burdens . . . and mourn etc. (v. 8-9), and (4) stand as witnesses etc. (v. 9).Of special note is baptism. Baptism was added, not as an integral part of Alma's conversion ritual, but as an invitation to the newly converted to show God a sign of their covenant. Thus, an evolutionary step toward including baptism occurred in the conversion ritual:\\"Now I say unto you, if this be the desire of your hearts, what have you against being baptized in the name of the Lord, as a witness before him that ye have entered into a covenant with him, that ye will serve him and keep his commandments, that he may pour out his Spirit more abundantly upon you?\\"(Mosiah 18:10). A new, but optional element in the conversion ritual was baptism in the name of the Lord. It is interesting that Alma the Elder baptized himself once (Mosiah 18:14) by his charismatic authority. It is also interesting that a certain quantity of \\"his Spirit\\" (Mosiah 18:10) appears to be an enabling event for authority. (\\"O Lord, pour out thy Spirit upon thy servant, that he may do this work with holiness of heart.\\" Mosiah 18:12).The book of 3 Nephi, chapter 11 is Smith's next expression of a conversion ritual. This one included baptism. Further, there is a three-element inclusive/exclusive declaration that cannot be reconciled with the two-element inclusive/exclusive declarations in D&C; 10 and Mosiah 4.3 Nephi 11:31. \\"Behold, verily, verily, I say unto you, I will declare unto you my doctrine. 32 And this is my doctrine, and it is the doctrine which the Father hath given unto me; and I bear record of the Father, and the Father beareth record of me, and the Holy Ghost beareth record of the Father and me; and I bear record that the Father commandeth all men, everywhere, to(1) repent and(2a) believe in me. 33. And whoso believeth in me, and is(3) baptized, the same shall be saved; and they are they who shall inherit the kingdom of God. 34. And whoso believeth not in me, and is not baptized, shall be damned . . . .37. And again I say unto you, ye must(1) repent, and(2b) become as a little child, and(3) be baptized in my name, or ye can in nowise receive these things. . . .(inclusive/exclusive declaration) 40. And whoso shall declare more or less than this, and establish it for my doctrine, the same cometh of evil, and is not built upon my rock; but he buildeth upon a sandy foundation, and the gates of hell stand open to receive such when the floods come and the winds beat upon them.\\"(3 Nephi 11:31-40, notations and emphases added). This passage was probably written after the summer of 1828 CE, when D&C; 10 was written. But it was obviously written before the Book of Mormon manuscript went to the printer.A possible insight as to why Smith added baptism to a previously required two-element conversion ritual is that there may have been some uncertainty in his own mind, or disagreement with others or even perhaps in the community generally, over which elements were necessary for conversion. Hence, Jesus is quoted in 3 Nephi as saying:\\"And according as I have commanded you thus shall ye baptize. And there shall be no disputations among you, as there have hitherto been; neither shall there be disputations among you concerning the points of my doctrine, as there have hitherto been.\\"(3 Nephi 11:28, emphasis added). Since we are to presume that in the year 34 BCE that Jesus uttered the three-element conversion ritual, in 3 Nephi 11, Smith was misquoting Jesus in 1828 C.E. when Smith pronounced the two-element conversion ritual in D&C; 10. Otherwise, it was not \\"from God's mouth to Smith's ear\\" in the summer of 1828 C.E.One might put the case that the two-element conversion rituals of King Benjamin and Alma the Elder were defective, i.e. Mormon simply compiled them as he read them, and Jesus cleared up the confusion when he appeared in 34 C.E. However, this theory breaks down because the two-element conversion ritual in D&C; 10 appeared in 1828; D&C; 10 is a contemporaneous writing with the dictation of the identical two-element conversion ritual of King Benjamin in Mosiah 4. No significant revision of D&C; 10 has occurred to amend its two-element conversion ritual, or the King Benjamin conversion ritual for that matter.I have learned, from faithful Mormon scholars that the books of 1st and 2nd Nephi were written by Smith after the book of 3rd Nephi was dictated. Therefore, the conversion ritual in 2 Nephi 31:10-12 was written after the conversion ritual in 3 Nephi 11. Hence, the next conversion ritual written by Smith was:\\"And he said unto the children of men: (1)Follow thou me [believe]. . . . And the Father said: (2) Repent ye and (3) be baptized in the name of my Beloved Son. . . . Wherefore . . . I know that if ye shall follow the Son, with full purpose of heart . . . witnessing unto the Father that ye are willing to take upon you the name of Christ by baptism . . . .\\"(2 Nephi 31:10-12, notations added). Where is the inclusive/exclusive declaration? It appears as a statement that baptism is not optional:\\"And now, if the Lamb of God, he being holy, should have need to be baptized by water, to fulfill all righteousness, O then, how much more need have we, being unholy, to be baptized, yea, even by water!\\"(2 Nephi 31:5). Here, there are the three elements as in the previous pronouncement of 3 Nephi 11, and the older and weaker pronouncement of Alma the Elder in Mosiah 18, in which baptism was an appendage to the ritual. But now, baptism had become indispensable. The commentary, \\"witnessing unto the Father that ye are willing to take upon you the name of Christ by baptism\\" was a foreshadowing of what followed.Later, Smith wrote D&C; 20:37, which explained the manner of conversion. Did this passage have an inclusive/exclusive declaration? Yes. It appears as an echo of his earlier thought processes. His new conversion ritual was \\"given by way of commandment\\" (ibid.). The phrase \\"given by way of commandment\\" reflected the earlier inclusive/exclusive declarations such as \\"more or less than this cometh of evil\\". The elements in Smith's latest conversion ritual were that persons:\\"(1) humble themselves before God,(2) desire to be baptized,(3) come forth with broken hearts and contrite spirits,(4) witness before the Church that they have truly repented of all their sins,(5) are willing to take upon them the name of Jesus Christ,(6) having a determination to serve him to the end,(7) truly manifest by their works that they have received of the Spirit of Christ unto the remission of their sins, and accordingly they(8) shall be received by baptism into his church.\\"Smith's two-element conversion rituals (Mosiah 4 and D&C; 10) condemned his three-element conversion rituals (Mosiah 18, 3 Nephi 11 and 2 Nephi 31) and vice versa. Additionally, the two-element conversion rituals of Mosiah 4 and D&C; 10, condemned Alma the Elder's multiple-element conversion ritual (Mosiah 18) that added baptism, even though it was an act after conversion ritual had been completed. And all of these conversion rituals, condemn what is probably the current Mormon scriptural conversion ritual; D&C; 20:37.This review leaves me wondering what could possibly be meant by \\"... neither doth [God] vary from that which he hath said ....\\" (D&C; 3:2).Thus, there is an end to the early evolution of the Mormon conversion ritual.Salvation RequirementsBut the requirements for a Mormon to achieve salvation were another matter that was closely related to the conversion ritual. King Benjamin had not mentioned baptism as an element of salvation, but he had mentioned\\"salvation might come to him that should put his trust in the Lord, and should be diligent in keeping his commandments, and continue in faith even unto the end of his life . . . \\"(Mosiah 4:6). Thus, although baptism of course is not mentioned by King Benjamin, the two elements that were mentioned were to (1) \\"trust in the Lord\\" and (2) \\"continue in faith even unto the end of his life\\".Chronological parallels to King Benjamin's declarations of salvation requirements, were set forth in the 1833 Book of Commandments (\\"BC\\") First, a revelation given in April 1829 was published as section V:\\"... Say nothing but repentance unto this generation ....\\" (Book of Commandments 'BC', V:4, D&C; 6:9),and\\" ... If thou wilt do good, yea and hold out faithful to the end, thou shalt be saved in the kingdom of God, which is the greatest of all the gifts of God; for there is no gift greater than the gift of salvation.\\" (BC V:5, D&C; 6:13).This salvation-without-baptism concept is repeated in BC XII (June, 1829), where it states:\\"... and if ye keep my commandments, and endure to the end, you shall have eternal life; which gift is the greatest of all the gifts of God.\\" (BC XII:3, D&C; 14:7).A distinct change occurs, however, in the Book of Mormon between Smith's dictation of King Benjamin's address and that in Second Nephi. Baptism has been added as a requirement for salvation in 2 Nephi 31:\\"for my soul delighteth in plainness (v. 3) ... If ye shall follow the Son ... by baptism ... then shall ye receive the Holy Ghost .... (v. 13).\\"And to emphasize that the entire salvation package is contained in this ritual that includes baptism, it states further in verses 21-22:\\"And now ... this is the way; and there is none other way nor name given under heaven whereby man can be saved in the kingdom of God. And now, behold, this is the doctrine of Christ, and the only and true doctrine of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, which is one God, without end. Amen.\\"The \\"only and true doctrine of the Father\\" statement is probably an echo of Smith's inclusive/exclusive declarations regarding the conversion ritual, but now it is applied to salvation requirements.It is notable that Smith used the terms salvation and eternal life synonymously.Once Smith's church became more established, Smith contradicted all previous pronouncements in his \\"Lectures on Faith.\\" In Lecture Sixth. Of Faith, salvation required the sacrifice of all things:Let us here observe, that a religion that does not require the sacrifice of all things, never has the power sufficient to produce the faith necessary unto life and salvation . . .(Book of Doctrine and Covenants (1835) page 50). This was very different from any of Smith's previous declarations of salvation rituals. The \\"atoning blood\\" (Mosiah 4) of Christ was marginalized with respect to an individual's salvation. Smith's adherents had to manage open-ended requirements to \\"sacrifice all things\\" to Smith's religion for life and salvation. And Smith's religion at that time was called \\"Church of the Latter-day Saints\\" (Book of Doctrine and Covenants, title page. 1835).I have tried to be thorough. My favorite \\"fun\\" passage in this book is \\"and as for myself, to me he doth not stink.\\" (Alma 19:5)"},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"This is one of the most powerful books you will ever read.

The imagry used to describe the various types of animals in existance in this fictional world was interesting as were the battle scenes.

It was astounding to me to see so much history! I have since read it seven times over the years and I still love the part about the Anti-Nephi-Lehi's who opt for peace instead of war after they had sworn off killing. What were they to do when the enemy descended from the hill on them? They made a promise and did not want to back track... so they knelt on the earth and bowed down and let the enemy take them, slay them. Until the enemy could kill no more of these defenseless people and they too dropped their swords and joined with them as friends. Powerful stuff.I also like the account in 3Nephi where it discusses Christ's appearance on the American Continent. I just think this is the most amazing thing to ever be recorded. The details are astounding, and it certainly helps clarify a lot of things that other churches have altered or changed in the Holy bible.Two texts that give historical data of Christ's reality, the Holy Bible and this book simply chase off all doubt that He lived and does live!"},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"I have read this book about six or seven times (I lost count). I know this book to be true by praying about it and also studying it. You can feel it is true if you ask if it is after reading it, and I know that it will improve any one's life if they study it and live by it teachings which are paralleled to the Bible.Furthermore, I'd like to ask anyone no matter if they believe or do not believe it could be true to read it. What are you going to lose? If anything, you'll gain more knowledge and also have a clearer understanding of God and your life. There is literature out there that discredits this book as false, but let me remind you that these people don't want to help, but tear down. Also, keep in mind that there's an opposite to everything, and there'll be those who discredit it.My favorite group of verses are in the Book of Jacob. This book gives an allegory to the House of Israel to olive trees. This group of scripture in incredible. It's obviously translated and follows the Hebrew format of writing (ABCDCBA).Also, there's evidence of the Book of Mormon's truth in Native American culture. The Lamanites, who are present day Native Americans, carried with them some of the stories contain in this book, but they have some changes made over time because they weren't hid and were open to changes in oral tradition and Aztec government. Any way, one story (which was written by Ixtlilxochitl in the late 16th century from ancient hieroglyphic writtings pased down from his ancestors), about Quetzalcoatl, is about a white skinned, bearded man who wore a robe who taught them doctrine to live happily and gave good laws of virture and deed. It is also stated in this Aztec account that he'd come again to visit them, and when Cortez arrived, they mistook him for Christ). Interestingly, Christ, in the Book of Mormon, shows himself to the people in the Americas after he is resurrected and taught them. Coincidence? I don't think so.I just want to conclude that I know this book is true. Just have an open mind and pay attention to your feelings. They will tell you if it is true or not, but remember to exercise faith to see if it is or not. I promise any reader it is, as well as almost 12 million other people who believe it is (more than half are outside of the US).

You can learn a lot about human nature from studying their history and perhaps learn to be wiser than they.

I felt inspired to place a copy of the Book of Mormon on my dash and when I did so, the air conditioning started working again.Once I got out of school and found a real job, I had the opportunity to work with several Native Americans. It was my great blessing to be able to share with them the joy of knowing that due to the promises of this book they can someday become a pure and delightsome people if they will only forsake the pagan traditions of their ancestors and embrace this book. God truly loves them! I can remember when President Kimball showed a picture of some of the Lamanites who had become whiter due to their participation in the church's placement program. It was such a strong testimony to me of God's love. I am assuming that the same promise applies to African Americans as well but I don't know for sure. I hope so because God obviously loves all of his children, even those that he turned black because of the indiscretions of their ancestors.I have been trying to heed the prophet's counsel to share the Book of Mormon with everyone. We live in a very industrious neighborhood that has lots of families from India as well as several Jewish families. It was really great to be able to take them a Book of Mormon when we went caroling the other night. It's just so sad that they don't celebrate Christmas, but I'm sure Jesus loves them even though they may not respect him. I think the days of the scourging of the Jews as mentioned in the Book of Mormon is finally over.One thing that was neat about sharing the Book of Mormon with the families from India... They are not United States citizens (here on work visa--don't worry they're not illegal aliens!!) so they don't fully appreciate the Book of Mormon promises that God has made to citizens of this country. I told them how lucky they were to be able to live here (especially in this last dispensation!) and that their ending up in our country was likely a sign of their being more worthy of those blessings than others due to their actions in the pre-existence.The last thing I want to share is that I've been sending lots of copies of the Book of Mormon to our troops overseas. Most of them are unaware of the protection offered to those who believe in the teachings of the book. I know some of our troops are concerned that they do not have adequate protection/armaments in their defense of freedom. I know that (like Helaman's Stripling Warriors) their belief in the Book of Mormon would be a much greater protection against death or physical harm than any supplies our government might provide.I only rate this book as 4 stars because the Isaiah chapters are hard to understand but that is a failing on my part more than anything else. But for people who aren't members of the church, you might want to just skip over those chapters when you get to them because from what I've been told you really need the full Spirit of the Lord to understand their meaning."},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"In exploring the book, I found that it gave peace of mind and a great insight into men's relationship with God.

As one reviewer wrote, why not just abstain if it isnt touching your heart, soul and spirit?

If you are looking for explanations of what God expects of you in this earthly lifetime, or even just a lifeline that brings you a better perspective of us all as children of a living God, this book will take you places you always thought could exist but hadnt found a way to experience until now.

And I exhort you to remember these things; for the time speedily cometh that ye shall know that I lie not, for ye shall see me at the bar of God; and the Lord God will say unto you: Did I not declare my words unto you, which were written by this man, like as one crying from the dead, yea, even as one speaking out of the dust.Moroni also testifies that he will be a witness at Judgment that the Word of Christ written in the Book of Mormon is true. The punishment of the law demands that Justice is not robbed. Moroni teaches that those who die in their sins will not escape justice through the mercy of Jesus Christ. Instead, the word and law of Christ as described in the Book of Mormon will bear testimony against their sins and justice will claim the creature. Thus these words are a sharp rebuke for the wicked to repent and avoid the awful monster of justice. Ignorance is not a defense against the claims of breaking the law. Today is a day of probation, a time to prepare to meet God, a time to repent. Failure to read and study the Book of Mormon is no justification to escape the laws binding to the inhabitants of this earth. Therefore, both member and nonmember are under condemnation and if they do not study and apply the teachings of the Book of Mormon.2 Nephi 28:2929.Wo be unto him that shall say: We have received the word of God, and we need no more of the word of God, fore we have enough.Whenever, the Lord uses the word, \\"wo\\", he indicates a sharp warning; a warning so severe that if this is ignored the wrath of God and calamities of the wicked are sure to follow.2 Nephi 29:3-11 \\"A Bible, we have got a Bible, and we need no more Bible\\".The Lord teaches that in the mouth of two or more witnesses the truth is established God does not favor one nation over another; he is no respecter of person. The canon of scriptural writings will prove that God is the same yesterday, today, and tommorow, unalterable and unchangeable.Ether 12:23-27 \\"Lord, the Gentiles will mock at these things, because of our weakness in writing, for Lord thou has made us mighty in word by faith\\", \\"I fear the gentiles will mock us at our words\\" 26. And when I had said this, the Lord spake unto me saying, Fools mock, but they shall mourn; and my grace is sufficient for the meek, that shall take no advantage of your weakness;The wisdom of the wise shall perish; the learned, who hearken not to the Lord will fall; and the meek shall inherit the earth. I believe in the prophecy that the meek inheriting the earth also suggests they will receive their celestial inheritance. Interestingly, the meek will be blessed with the grace of God, to understand the words of the Book of Mormon.Mormon 8:16-1716. \\"And blessed be he that shall bring this thing to light; for it shall be brought out of darkness unto light, according to the word of God; yea, it shall be brought out of the earth, and it shall shine forth out of darkness, and come unto the knowledge of the people; and it shall be done by the power of God.\\"17. \\"He that condemneth, let him be aware lest he shall be in danger of hell fire.\\"The Book of Mormon is not to be condemned. Those who choose to condemn the Book of Mormon rashly tempt God, or smiteth the righteous bring Judgment against themselves.Oppose and resist secret combinations.Ether 8:18-26. \\"Murder for gain is abominable to the Lord\\". Mormon 8:26-41.The cries of the slain saints will cry up for Justice and the Lord will be unable to turn a deaf earth to their cries. The wrath of God will sweep the wicked from the earth. We are to hope that there is sufficient time for the wicked to repent before the great and dreadful day of the Lord. Time is mercy because it give the wicked an opportunity to see the error of their ways, the lack of fruit in the lies they believe, and the craftiness and deceptions of man. The wild branches needs time to be grafted into the tame fruit of the tree and start producing good fruit.The Book of Mormon is a type of our Day. Murder for gain or theft is the driving force behind war. Scarcity is the product of war and not the forces of free market systems. Righteous moral belief systems abhor war and consider its methods and affects, evil. I do not believe Jesus delights in the conflicts and wars of men. I do not believe that in the last century man has been justified in the cause of war. I say where is the reveal justification that the Lord is command man to fight and kill? Men fight because they have forgotten the teachings of Jesus. Listen to the anquish of Momon:Mormon 6: 17-2217. O ye fair ones, how could ye have departed from the ways of the Lord! O ye fair ones, how could ye have rejected that Jesus, who stood with open arms to receive you!18. Behold, if ye have done this, ye would have not fallen. But hehold, ye are fallen, and I mourn your loss.19. O ye fair sons and daughters, ye fathers and mothers, ye husbands and wives, ye fair ones, how is it that ye could have fallen!20. But hehold, ye are gone, and my sorrows cannot bring your return21. And the day cometh that your mortal must put on immortality, and these bodies which are now moldering in corruption must soon become incorruptible bodies; and then ye must stand before the judgment-seat of Christ, to be judged according to your works; and if it so be that ye are righteous, then are ye blessed with your fathers who have gone before you.22. O that ye had repented before this great destruction had come upon you. But behold ye are gone and the Father yea the Eternal Father of heaven knoweth your state; and he doeth with you according to his justice and mercy.Pride leads to the fall of civilizations.Moroni 8:27 Pride destroyed the Nephites.2 Nephi 28:15-16 The proud are puffed up, they teach false doctrines, commit whoredoms, and pervert the right way of the Lord. The proud are full of iniquity and ripe for destruction. The rotten fruit analogy versuses the beautiful fruit analogy should be a point of focus. The righteous have radiant countenances, bright and illuminated like the crystal lights of a beautiful light. The righteous radiate with happiness, contentment, and intelligence and they are a delight to behold. The fruit of the tree can be directly witnesses by the countenances of the righteous saint. There inner light is so transparent that all can see and glorify our father, in heaven. In contrast the rotten fruit demonstrates a countenance of anger, pride, arrogance, and decept. A rotten fruit can not bring forth good fruit.Alma 32:14 Blessed are those that are not compelled to be humble.Pride leads to the fall because a untrue hypothesis is undefeatable and irrational. The mind can not grasp and sustain a lie indefinitely. The pain associated with embracing a lie will eventually cause the individual too abandon the lie. Interestingly, as the group discovers and abandons the lie often in force. As true is revealed, a stronger and more compelling force substitutes and dissolves the lie. The power of the true is so tremendous that complete systems based on pride will dissolve instantaneously. The either means the system repented and turned from their error or they were destroyed. Now, Jesus Christ understands our case and has pleads for us. If we will discover the truth, we will find that Jesus has been careful orchestrating events designed to assist in our success, all along. Destruction only occurs when the fruit is rotten and the devil has seal these servants as his own. At that point, there is not use in trying to redeem the bad fruit. The fruit is only salvageable in the early stages of sin.The Lord warns against the curse of unbelief.Mormon 9:7-10 The Lord speaks against those who deny the revelations of God telling them if they willfully deny revelations, prophecies, gifts, healing, speaking in tongues, and interpretation of tongues, then they must think God is a changeable God. Furthermore, these individuals must think God is not a God of miracles. Therefore, they deny that the power of God exists.Mormon 9: 15-21 \\"Miracles cease because of unbelief\\"Moroni 7:37-38 \\"It is by faith that miracles are wrought\\". Men have faith in Jesus Christ because of their meekness; if we do not have faith in Jesus Christ then we are not fit for membership in his church. Moroni 10:24-34 \\"If the day comes that the power and gifts of God are done away with\\" it will because of unbelief and those that do good possess the gift and power of God to act.30. And again I would exhort you that ye would come unto Christ, and lay hold upon every good gift, and touch not the evil gift, nor the unclean thing.31. And awake, and arrive from the dust, O Jerusalem; yea, and put on thy beautiful garments, O daughter of Zion; and strengthen thy stakes and enlarge thy borders forever.The priesthood is the power and glory of God manifest through the actions of worthy priesthood holders. The glory of God is intelligence. Priesthood holders are too act and not be acted upon. A good measure of faith is required too act. A priesthood holder should \\"Invoke\\" the powers of heaven rather than passively request assistance. The priests of Levi exercised great faith by stepping into the waters of the Jordon before the river parted and they crossed over dry ground. Faith must proceed the miracle.Mormon 9:2,5 (To the unbeliever) 2. Behold, will ye believe in the day of your visitation-behold, when the Lord shall come, yea, even that great day when the earth shall be rolled together as a scroll, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, yea, in the great day when ye shall be brought to stand before the Lamb of God-then will ye say there is not God?5. For behold, when ye shall be brought to see your nakeness before God, and also the glory of God, and the holiness of Jesus Christ, it will kindle a flame of unquenchable fire upon you.6. O then ye unbelieving, turn ye unto the Lord; cry mightily unto the Father in the name of Jesus, that perhaps ye may be found spotless, pure, fair, and white, having been cleansed by the blood of the Lamb, at the great last day.Mormon 5:22-2422. And they, O ye Gentiles, how can ye stand before the power of God, except ye shall repent and turn from your evil ways?23. Know ye not that ye are in the hands of God? Know ye not that he hath all power, and at his great command the earth shall be rolled together as a scroll?24. Therefore, repent ye, and humble yourselves before him, lest he shall come out in justice against you-lest a remnant of the seed of Jacob shall go forth among you as a lion, and tear you in pieces, and there is none to deliver.In SummaryThe message of the Book of Mormon: 1. Deny not the power of God 2. Jesus is the Christ 3. Beware of Pride 4. Flee from the wickedness of secret combinations 5. Repent and be baptized. 6. We will be judged out of the books given to us by God, including the words of the Book of Mormon.See2 Ne 26:16-23; 2 Ne 27-30; Morm 6:16-22; Morm 8:26-41; Morm 9:1-6; Morm 9:7-10,15-19,27-31,35; Moro 8:9-24; Moro 9:8-24; Moro 10:24-34; 2 Ne 33:10-15; Eth 8:18-26; Moro 8:27; D&C; 20:9, 38-39; 3 Ne 25:1; Morm 5:22-24; Hel 12; He 6:17; Eth 2:9-11; 2 Ne 1:20; Hel 13:12-14; 3 Ne 9:11"},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"I love this book, it has changed my life and many people I know.

The book gives a historical account of the earliest inhabitants of the Americas, who are of middle-Eastern descent. It chronicles the social, political and religious practices of this people, their wars and contentions, and ultimately the rise and fall of an entire civilization.The historical portions of the Book of Mormon, however, serve only to provide a background of events to its primary purpose, which is the interaction between God and the early inhabitants of these continents. The chapters detail miraculous experiences and great prosperity when the people live in righteousness, and the great chaos and destruction that occurs when they choose to disobey the prophets called to warn them of their pending destruction.The penultimate experience is the account given of the appearance of Jesus Christ to this people shortly after his ascension to Heaven after His crucifixion. According to the prophet Nephi, the Savior dwelled with this people for a period of time, called apostles and organized His church among the people.The teachings and stories in the Book of Mormon are fascinating from many points of view, whether religious, political, historical or for education. Regardless of why you choose to read the Book of Mormon, one thing is certain: you will have a much better understanding of the purpose of life, of life after death, and the true account of the original inhabitants of the American continents."},{"Title":"The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ (The Doctrine and Convenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Pearl of Great Price)","review":"I am so thankful for the Book of Mormon.

In many ways, it laid out the blue print for a two state solution and the advantages for both Israel and the Palestinians. His vision eventually for the most part became the course that Israel followed it its efforts to give the Palestinians a state, which the Palestinians in turn rejected at Camp David in 2000. While the current conflict may well render this work out of date, it still give an excellent view of what might have been and where Israel was willing to go. What was once cutting edge modeling, now makes excellent history."},{"Title":"The Peasants' Revolt of 1381 (History in Depth)","review":"This book offers an exstensive collection of primary documents relating to the Peasant's Revolt of 1381.

As a college student in the US, I found this book useful for a few classes, and always managed to impress my professors with the sources in here."},{"Title":"Sharky's Machine","review":"This is the book they made into a movie starring Burt Reynolds back in the early 1980's. The movie shares a lot with this book, which is usually pretty rare for Hollywood. I quickly got sucked into the story, even though I already knew the high points of the tale.The book is about a cop named Sharky, who works the narcotics beat. After a shootout with a dealer, Sharky gets demoted to the vice department, where he quickly hooks up with several hard bitten cops that carry grudges because they are considered the lowest of the low in the police department. A phone tap on a prostitute leads to a rapid series of events that involves stolen gold, Mafia killers, a presidential candidate, and a shadowy figure that wants unlimited power. All of this activity unfolds in Atlanta, Georgia.This book is absolutely overflowing with pornographic sex and gory violence. Heads get blasted off, fingers are chopped off and people get beaten to bloody pulps. The sex scenes are definitely X-rated stuff. It's one of the sauciest books I've read in a long time. Anyone looking for quick action certainly won't be disappointed with this book. I haven't read any other books by William Diehl, but if they're anything like this one, they'll raise eyebrows.This thriller has several corny moments. The whole story unfolds in a very short time frame (a couple of days) and there are so many lucky breaks for the cops and amazing coincidences that it's impossible not to groan out loud a few times. I had to chuckle to myself when the vice squad investigates a murder and doesn't call the homicide department because they don't want them to take all the credit. Come on! Totally unbelievable! But these books aren't written as paragons of literature. They're a quick, fun and mindless diversion, and this book certainly fits that bill. Be sure and keep an eye out for Friscoe, the head of the vice department. He's hilarious and makes for effective comic relief."},{"Title":"Sharky's Machine","review":"I have just read this as the hard cover is out of print and this came to life as a paperback. It is as good as ANY book he has written in his later years (I believe this was his first). While TAI HORSE still his best on my list, this is an exciting read. I finished it in two seatings.

This book would have been stronger if it had cut the first 55 pages and started at chapter 3. I really didn't get the first three prologues and the first 2 chapters to me didn't progress the story along for me to stick around. I really didn't care how Sharkey got to Vice; that he was there was enough. If the writer felt the necessity to let us know, he could have worked it in when he showed up at Vice instead of having a long, drawn out narritive. So just 2 stars from me."},{"Title":"The New New Left: How American Politics Works Today","review":"On one of the flaps of this book, a reviewer states: \\"American politics is not about parties, it is about special interest group against special interest group\\". Very true. Increasingly, the Left is dominated by what Steven Malanga calls \\"tax eaters\\", which are mostly public unions in large U.S. cities that exist to consume tax funds (and provide \\"services\\" to client groups, but in a very inefficient way that does not solve the underlying problem). It is interesting to note that as the U.S. moves more to the \\"Right\\" (free market economics, individual responsibility and low taxes), the big cities are dominated by groups perpetualy stuck in the 1960s Welfare State (tax heavily to fund a huge public bureaucracy that ostensibly redistributes money to victim groups and minorities). The latter is, as the late 20th century shows, increasingly inefficient and decrepit. Go to any big city and see the inner city stagnating, and the periphery growing and thriving (that is really the case where I live, which is Dallas, Texas). Public unions increasingly use the rhetoric of \\"helping the poor\\", when in reality, they are just out to defend their own power. This is very clear, for example, when Walmart attempts to move into a ghetto. Mostly, the people living there are for Walmart, becuase to them it means shopping cheaper, and thus, an increase in their disposible income. Then, inevitably, \\"activists\\" show up (mostly from outside the community that they perportedly speak for), claiming to \\"speak for the community\\". Those groups mainly object to Walmart because Walmart is non-union, not because Walmart \\"oppresses the poor\\". Thus, the special interest groups involved want to defend their own power, above all else. This is especially true of the teachers' unions in big cities. The sheer cynicism coupled with the hypocrisy is so startling (\\"activist\\" organizations demanding that companies pay their workers \\"a living wage\\", but then not paying their own workers the minimum wage !). The book provides short, readable chapters on Walmart, Barbara Ehrenreich (who \\"job slums\\" at low end jobs all to \\"prove\\" her tendentious point that the poor get the shaft in America). I highly recommend this book for a real look at the dynamics of how big city politics works today, and why our big cities are so dysfunctional."},{"Title":"The New New Left: How American Politics Works Today","review":"The New New Left of the 21st century is the heir to the 1960s New Left, demolished so well by Ayn Rand in her book The New Left: The Anti Industrial Revolution. The movement that Malanga investigates is still ideological but far more cynical. In place of the earlier hippies, they are dedicated careerists. Now it is all about wielding power on the local level, especially in the inner cities, in order to benefit themselves. Like all leftists they are parasites and Malanga quite rightly labels them Tax Eaters.Who are they? Coalitions of politicians, state-funded social service agencies, public employee unions, community activists and interest groups of various stripes. They aim to expand government programmes in order to reap more of the good life from the sweat of the labor of others, and they use the language of social justice and political correctness to further this aim. In the process they invariably do more harm than good to their communities.Unions are one of the remaining redoubts of the Left and the reason that the Democrats still control many cities. Once that support dissipates with the decline in union membership, the leftist inner city councils like that of New York City will be all that remains. Describing how they have reversed Giuliani's reforms, the author predicts the return of urban decay. The Tax Eaters are driving out the Tax Payers.The book also deals with the continuing attempt to demonise Wal-Mart. Malanga demonstrates how caring this company really is and its popularity amongst poor people. The non-union chain is a threat to union control over the labor market and it undermines leftist theories of \\"market failure.\\" Those who oppose it are doing so for their own selfish and ideological ends, whilst denying the poor the chance to find jobs and save money.For a broader look at this latest manifestation of the Left on the national level, I recommendThe Vast Left Wing Conspiracy: The Untold Story of the Democrats' Desperate Fight to Reclaim Powerby Byron York. That book also looks at the eccentric billionaires and Hollywood celebrities and how this crowd have taken over the Democratic Party.Do As I Say (Not As I Do): Profiles in Liberal Hypocrisyby Peter Schweizer exposes these types for the hypocrites that they are. For a juicy history of the shameful record of the Dems, I highly recommendDonkey Cons: Sex, Crime, and Corruption in the Democratic Partyby Lynn Vincent and Robert McCain."},{"Title":"The New New Left: How American Politics Works Today","review":"Absolutely the most depressing book I have ever read, all the more depressing because everything in it is true. Essentially, Mr. Malanga outlines in detail how ACORN and the Democrat party, in concert with the academy and the \\"creative\\" class, have succeeded in eating away at the very foundations of the republic and frog-marched us inexorably toward socialism. Must be read in installments, one chapter at a sitting, because consuming the whole book at once will cause a fatal increase in blood pressure."},{"Title":"The New New Left: How American Politics Works Today","review":"Politics in modern America doesn't just contrast left and right attitudes: a new dynamic has been emerging between those who benefit from an expanding government, and those who have to pay for it: that's the focus of Steven Malanga's The New New Left, a history which examines these two movements and their sources. From the growth of public-sector employee unions in the 1950s which produced political ties to the war on poverty in the 1960s, funded by neighborhood grassroots efforts, The New New Left: How American Politics Works Today brings all the pieces of the puzzle together."},{"Title":"The New New Left: How American Politics Works Today","review":"small businesses are not threatened by walmart- businesses that can't compete with walmart are threatened by walmart. further, walmart is threatened by small businesses. should walmart ever attempt to become the monopoly the economically illiterate left stupidly thinks it is, then, thanks to laissez-faire capitalism, it will lose out to businesses that step into fill the demand walmart thought it could ignore. but , of course, walmart won't do that. if 'small' businesses want to compete with walmart, they should complain about city taxes and anti-growth do-gooder professors and their liberal stoner lapdogs passing zoning restrictions that limit competition and thus allow mom and pop shops to charge monopolistic like prices to cover their exorbitant rent which has the effect of driving people to go to...well....walmart.thus, the book is right. entrepeneurship is the answer to city woes and that requires laissez-faire capitalism and elimination of all the protection rackets that pass themselves off as socially enlightened when in point of fact they differ little from medieval guilds......choking off walmart just means that only the rich left-wing do-gooders who shell out ten dollars for pretentious euro-chic products in downtown boutiques will get to enjoy the consumer society they wish to deny to the rest of us.LONG LIVE WALMART!!!!"},{"Title":"Sharamitaro","review":"This book came my across my desk when I was way too busy to give it any time. I thought it would be in my \\"to be read\\" list for quite a while. However, I read the first chapter. I was delightfully surprised and intrigued enough to shift priorities and finish the book.I recommend this first book of The Milhavior Chronicles even as I eagerly reach for Book Two in the series.The main characters are well-drawn and engage the reader's sympathy. The setting is realistic with descriptions that awake images in the reader's mind. The story as a page-turner, late night light-burner. I haven't enjoyed a fantasy as much as this one in a long time."},{"Title":"Sharamitaro","review":"After having read this book I was amazed to find this is the first work this author has published. I liken this book to the feeling you get after a friend has recommended an obscure movie you've never heard of- only to find it's one of the best movies you've ever seen.Sharamitaro is a real find, a gem! This book just goes to show you that you CAN find amazing books without sticking to the 'big name' authors. I'd recommend this book to anyone who enjoys fantasy novels. The story line is very in-depth and leaves you wanting more by stories end. I can hardly wait for the next release.Again, this book is GREAT and I enjoyed it thoroughly. The characters were very well developed and the story was told in an extremely descriptive manner... not to mention it's a very fast read!"},{"Title":"Sharamitaro","review":"If you plan on trying one new fantasy author this year--or next --make it Jonathan M. Rudder. His book, &quot;Sharamitaro: Book I of the Milhavior Chronicles,&quot; combines the grandeur of Tolkien, the earthiness of McKiernan, and the ideals of Lewis into one fast-paced High Fantasy adventure. Many fantasy novels portray a reluctant hero, but Rudder's protagonist, Brendys, is not only reluctant but downright rebellious! He has no desire for the role thrust upon him, no loyalty to the Dawn King who's called him, and no ability to use the fabled sword entrusted to his keeping. Brendy's journey into self-discovery take him from rolling foothills to murderous mountain passages, from peaceful vallies to the center of a sorceror's rampage and the bloody fields of war. If the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; has whetted your appetite for adventure, I'd recommend &quot;Sharamitaro&quot; to satisfy that craving!"},{"Title":"Sharamitaro","review":"I've encountered reluctant heroes in my life but never one as defiantly blind to his potential as Brendys. Sharamitaro, the first volume of the Milhavior Chronicles by Jonathan M. Rudder, introduced me to the humble and sometimes slightly rebellious teenage son of the town's Horsemaster. Brendys finds that he is the prophesized \\"Bearer of the Flame\\", the warrior that is to precede the true king, the Heir of Ascon and drive the evil Thanatos from the mortal realm. Where most teenage boys would eagerly embrace the idea that they were destined to be a great warrior with great powers, Brendys mother was lost to the plague years before and he now allows his bitterness and anger with the Dawn King, over her death, to prevent him from willingly serving as the Flame's bearer. The young, reluctant hero must first wage his own inner battle if he is to become the great warrior prophesied.Jonathan has done a tremendous job in creating a realm I found it easy to lose myself in. The characters are complex and well thought out as is the creative story line. I honestly don't have much time for reading but will create whatever time I need to finish the Chronicle's other two volumes, The Road to Elekar and A Howl on the Wind. I am sure I will be a Jonathan Rudder fan for some time to come."},{"Title":"Sharamitaro","review":"I met the author at a gaming convention and, as a courtesy, purchased his book, not knowing what to expect. Technically the work is a gem. The language, dialogue, symbols, and images are exceptional. That being said, it is the exquisite crafting of his characters that pull the reader into an unforgettable tale with depth that spans human experience to include concepts that every man eventually faces--honor and dishonor, life and death, love and hatred, the follies of life and the experiences that transcend life. In short the concepts explored are relevant in our world just as they are in the wonderful fantasy world Mr. Rudder has created."},{"Title":"Sharamitaro","review":"When I had first heard of this series I wasn't too interested, I had read a couple \\"professional\\" reviews that had put it down and made it seem like a copy of Lord of the Rings with different names.After going to the bookstore and picking it up to read the first chapter or so I was hooked and bought the first 3 books on the spot.I burned through the books in about 3 days by only reading in my free time because they are so well written that they grab your attention and refuse to let you put them down until you read the last page.After reading all 4 books that are out so far I have this burning desire to read the next book in the series and itch for when Mr. Rudder will finish and release the 5th book."},{"Title":"Sharamitaro","review":"I met the author a few months ago and being a Tolkien fan, he mentioned I might want to read his books, as he was inspired by him. What a terrific read! The characters are not pat, or caricatures, but feel very real, and express real emotions. The action and fantasy are reminiscent of Lord of the Rings, but Rudder uses his own unique spin to create memorable characters and a great story! Can't wait to see what happens next!"},{"Title":"Sharamitaro","review":"Rudder's book is a page-turner, and tells a beautiful tale. It's great to read a fun fantasy tale that doesn't simply copy The Lord of the Rings. Rudder's got a great writing style, and you'd think he'd been writing for 40 years. What's wonderful is this is only his first book so when you finish you can take comfort in the fact that there's much more to read from him."},{"Title":"The Korean War 1950-53 (Men-at-Arms)","review":"This book provides exactly what a frequent reader of the Osprey Men-at-Arms series would expect to see in a book about the Korean War. Within the tight constraints of the format, the various ground combatants and the ground war are described nicely. Air and naval aspects of the war are not covered in the book.My only complaint with the book is that the illustrator does a nice job with uniforms and equipment but is less capable with the human form and faces. It's not a major issue, but that is the sort of thing that separates 4 star ratings from 5 star ratings."},{"Title":"The Korean War 1950-53 (Men-at-Arms)","review":"I'm an army brat and my father was in from the late 1930s to the mid-'70s, including direct participation in three full-scale foreign wars. But the one he always seemed to have the strongest memories of was Korea, where (having been in the occupation army in Japan) he was the first medical officer on the beach in September 1950, waiting for the evac and hospital units to catch up with him. Technically, he wasn't a combatant, but -- as the author makes clear -- that was just the theory and most people with a red cross on their helmets also wore an M1911 on their hip.The invasion of South Korea by the north was sudden and unexpected (it probably shouldn't have been), and the reaction of the United Nations was quick and pointed. Four months after the invasion, UN troops had pushed the North Korean Army back nearly to its border with China and it looked like Korean reunification was about to take place. Then China got involved in defense of its North Korean client and it was a whole new war -- which, technically, was \\"put on pause\\" but has never ended. Thomas does an excellent job of laying all this out, both from the Northern and the Southern perspective, and making sure the other UN contingents are covered, and not just the much larger U.S. force. (There's a tendency in this country to ignore the Canadians, British, French, Thai, Australian, and other units that participated.) Because of the terrain -- and regardless of the original high hopes that the U.S. Air Force could just wrap things up with a minimum of hassle -- it turned into a long, dirty, bloody infantry war, fought mostly by GIs and Marines. Most of the equipment on the UN side was World War II vintage, or even older, and while the North Koreans and Chinese were fierce fighters (don't let anyone tell you different), their equipment was also pretty basic.Osprey's special thing, of course, is color plates of uniforms, insignia, and personal equipage, and all that is here. These uniforms, the summer khakis and the \\"pinks and greens\\" my Dad wore, are how I thought of \\"Army\\" when I was a kid. Korea is often referred to as \\"the forgotten war,\\" but it shouldn't be. This is a first-rate overview, especially for those to whom even Vietnam is ancient history."},{"Title":"The Korean War 1950-53 (Men-at-Arms)","review":"There has been a lot of hoopla in recent years about the &quot;Forgotten War&quot; referring to the Korean War. This war was the first war fought by the forces of the West against the surrogate forces of the Red East. After a year of back and forth open mechanized warfare it settled down into a heavily fortified trench war similar to the Western Front of WW I.It is also vilified and thought of as the first war the U.S. lost and there was a lot of political mud slinging at home about the causes and conduct of the war. But cool heads prevailed and it did not turn out to be act one of WW III. Everyone involved finally signed an armistice which continues to this day and though there have been border raids and incidents, general war has been avoided. While the south has prospered as part of the western world economic system the north still hunkers down menacingly behind its borders.When I served it was just two plus years after the armistice and the Army was full of veterans of both WW II and Korea. The experience was remembered and contributed to some of the missteps later in Vietnam."},{"Title":"The Professional Cleaner's Personal Handbook","review":"Not only did this book give information on how/what to clean but, how to set standards for yourself, how to take pride in your work, what is expected of you as an employee or as an employer.

It was to be the introductory text. While it is full of information, I found it not well written or laid out, and the authors seemed like they were using the book as a \\"data dump\\" for their pockets of information and expertise. My biggest complaint is the book lacked focus in the sense that it did not develop the most important information, and conversely, seemed to spend far too many pages on remote issues that are not likely going to be part of a generalist CFP. I am very surprised that the book is not more polished as it was the 8th edition (9th recently came out). Why this book was chosen by the faculty, I have no idea. In the past, I had other CPF-related courses and we used Personal Financial Planning by Hallman and Rosenbloom --- An excellent text and resource book. Much more readable.

Glad I did."},{"Title":"The Tools & Techniques of Financial Planning","review":"Financial planning can be a dry topic, but as someone who is passionate about the subject and wants to pursue the profession, I thought this book can extinguish any interest in even the most committed student. The authors made no attempt to organize the topics in any relatable, logical way: life stage would be an obvious way, or accumulating - protecting - decumulating of wealth. The chapters are poorly written, often emphasizing the most obscure financial tactics while the reader must try to decipher which are relevant and common. Entire pages of the CFP values were included with no insights; note to the authors - we could have viewed these ourselves online!What about practical applications, or learning tools such as review exercises and case studies? This book offered zero. Surely financial planning is fertile ground for personal stories, analytical problems and recommended solutions from which we could learn! As a textbook that costs so much money, and for a subject that could help so many especially in this new economy, this book falls way short of my expectations.If you are an instructor using this book, please reconsider. If you are a student taking or have taken a course for which this book is required, let your teacher know about the poor reviews for this book and pressure them to seek better alternatives."},{"Title":"The Tools & Techniques of Financial Planning","review":"I find this book to be incredibly frustrating.

I have been in the financial advice industry for over 18 years and even I am confused by the way this book communicates what could be easy to understand concepts. There are times when I have had to read a single paragraph 3 or more times to attempt to understand what is being said. I find that ridiculous!

Hopkins wishes to argue, through a careful examination of the relevant biblical texts, that Latter-day Saint doctrines are eminently defensible from the Bible.... Hopkins's careful analysis and lucid exposition more than repay a thoughtful reading of the book.&quot; This book is not intended to convince the unconvincable.

It was also easy to read, even for someone with no training in Biblical languages, etc."},{"Title":"Biblical Mormonism: Responding to evangelical criticism of LDS theology","review":"An excellent book for any Christian who wishes to understand the Bible better.

I went into reading this book confused by all the competing theologies and came out sure that this is the true church. Very impressed!"},{"Title":"Biblical Mormonism: Responding to evangelical criticism of LDS theology","review":"Firstly, let me state that, at the time of writing, I am in my final year of a BATh in theology and anthropology, and am trained, to some efficiency, in \\"Biblical Sciences.\\"I found this book by Richard Hopkins to be a strong, solid Biblical defence of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, supporting \\"Mormon\\" beliefs in the nature of God, the number of God, soteriology, and the after-life, often blowing anti-Mormon \\"proof-texts\\" out of the water. I do suggest this book for those interested in the relationship between \\"Mormonism\\" and the Bible.With that said, I should note a few problems with this text. The first is the rather annoying habit among Latter-day Saints to (unintentionally) staw-man Nicean Orthodoxy, with Hopkins presenting an often-times Modalistic understanding of the Father, Son and the Holy Ghost. The fact that, at the baptism of Jesus in Matthew, the Father speaks from Heaven and the Holy Ghost decends from the sky does *not* refute the Trinity per Catholicism and Protestantism, only modalism, where the members of the Godhead are three manifestations or \\"modes\\" (whence \\"modalism\\") of the one person. However, the fact that the theological concept of \\"person\\" being differentiated from \\"being\\" is a Nicean COnstruct, something no ancient would have known about (e.g., the New Testament authors) but Hopkins does not go into this topic.Another thing is his discussion of 1 Corinthians 15:29. Hopkins does not note that the pronoun \\"they\\" is not extant in the Greek New Testament text of this verse. The Greek instead uses the present passive participle. This is important, as Evangelical critics often claim that the use of the pronoun \\"they\\" is Paul's attempt to seperate Christians from the allegedly pagan practice of baptism for ancestors. However, the use of the present passive participle indicates that Paul is discussing, positively, the *Christian* practice of baptism for the dead. Furthermore, *t&ograve;n nekron* (the dead) is in the Genitive case, indicating that the preposition *huper* is in the genitive. This, too, is significant, as *huper* followed by a accusative means \\"under,\\" with some tying the practice for baptism for the dead, again, with Paganism, with Pagans sprinking water on themselves on top of ancestors' graves. However, the use of the genitive case simply means *huper* carries the meaning of \\"on behalf of.\\" In short, the Greek text is further conducive to the Mormon practice being that of ancient Christianity.One other thing is that the word translated \\"man\\" in passages in Numbers and Hosea is *\`ish* which is a _comparative_ form of the word man. When God is said to not be a man, the ancient authors of the Bible were not comparing apples with oranges, but one type of man with another, with God being an exalted, perfect man. To be fair, Hopkins did note this in his 1998 book, \\"How Greek philosophy corrupted the Christian concept of God.\\" Furthermore, Hopkins correctly notes that the point of such passages is not the physiological nature of God, but His perfect nature in comparison to sinful men.Notwithstanding some problems, I feel that this book is a good defence of the doctrines and practices of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and I, for one, recommend it."},{"Title":"Biblical Mormonism: Responding to evangelical criticism of LDS theology","review":"This book objectively compares modern evangelical doctrine and the teachings of the LDS Church. By using only the Bible as its base of reference, it looks at the misconceptions that evangelicals have regarding LDS theology. It exposes the &quot;yellow journalism&quot; and shock statements that those who attack the Mormons use so often. This book is a must for any Mormon or Evangelical who wants an honest, no-holes barred look at what the Bible says about the Mormons. Such topics include The Nature of God, Baptism for the Dead, Method of Baptism, etc."},{"Title":"Biblical Mormonism: Responding to evangelical criticism of LDS theology","review":"Many conservative Protestants (as witnessed in one of the comments here) confuse their reading of the Bible with the Bible itself. For such folks, the notion of &quot;biblical Mormonism&quot; is no more intelligible than the idea of a square circle. This book is a direct challenge to such dogmatism. I will simply note in passing that, contrary to one reader who has left his thoughts behind here, neither Latter-day Saints in general nor Richard Hopkins in particular deny the deity of Christ. Nor do they exalt Satan to equality with him. Nor do they deny the concept of divine grace. They view such things somewhat differently from Protestant fundamentalism or evangelicalism, but that is all. A little precision here would help a great deal. Inflammatory distortions serve nobody, in the long run, though they may score a few cheap points in the tactical short term."},{"Title":"Biblical Mormonism: Responding to evangelical criticism of LDS theology","review":"I couldn't wait to get my hands on this book. As a Protestant, my biggest criticism of the LDS church is it's doctrines in relation to the Bible. I don't care about BoM archaeology or history, all I am really interested in is doctrinal comparisons.So here is a book that claims A) Mormonism is very biblical and B) Mormon doctrine is more biblical than Evangelical dotrines. I had to get into a mindset for reading this book. I try not to have presuppositionalism, and wanted to see if Hopkins could do as his title suggests, make Mormonism biblical.The first problem I have with this book is it's overall content type. The book is divided into three parts (pg. 7-9), two of which I have little interest in. They are the 'Mormon Soteriology' and 'Mormon Eschatology' (excluding the three levels of heaven and baptism part).From reading the baptism piece (the chapters don't seem very intertwined), I have concluded that Hopkins is at least to some extent, not interested in total, objective accuracy. An example of this is his examination of Mark 16:16. The general synopsis is that this passage was NOT part of the original gospel, but Hopkins tells us there is &quot;substaintial evidence&quot; (pg. 23) that it actually was. From there he gives a very jaded look at the evidence surrounding Mark 16:16. Take where he tells us that it is &quot;found in all the Greek mss., except B (Vaticanus) and Aleph (Sinaiticus)....&quot; The problem is is that those two manuscripts that don't have Mark 16:16 (the one he mentions) are the two earliest manuscripts we have. They are a substaintial reason to believe that Mark 16:16 was NOT part of the original. Needless-to-say I think his weighing of the evidence was at least slightly sophistic.So the only part I had a real interest in was &quot;Part I -- Mormon Theology&quot; where I also found most of his arguments to be unimpressive. In his attempt to prove God is a man, for example, he does the old 'image' argument that is rather weak -- his thesis for God having a body was LESS then impressive.His third section of 'Mormon theology' titled &quot;The Number of God&quot; picked up the pace a bit, but I still was not convinced. His conclusion that &quot;There is no convincing argument for the Nicene Creed is either logical or biblical...&quot; (pg. 96) is quite ahead of itself.The forth section, &quot;God and Man&quot; (pg. 97) is where he presents his most interesting arguments, though I am (yet again) not convinced. He does the standard 'child of God' arguments and he doesn't even bother attempting to respond to the criticism (such the biblical passages John 1:12; Gal. 3:26; Eph. 1:5). This is a key problem, I feel. Though in the chapter where he attempts to prove God is a man he does respond to the criticism (John 4:24; Num. 23:19) overall he doesn't respond to the passages that most would conclude contradict his theology (for example Zech. 12:1 in the preexistence chapter).I was almost shocked at how innacurate Hopkins was when he gave us the actual translation of Acts 17:29 for the work &quot;offspring&quot;. He writes, &quot;In this passage, the word &quot;offspring&quot; is translated from the Greek word genos, meaning 'race.'....&quot; (pg. 99). This is very innacurate as genos can also mean &quot;kind&quot; or &quot;kindred&quot; which substaintially changes the meaning of the passage than what &quot;race&quot; would. Again, I felt Hopkins' accuracy here was very low. Hopkins' also does the standard biblical defense of preexistence which is quite tired (I'm not conviced, YET AGAIN!!)He concludes by giving the standard defense of theosis in the Bible and the 'eternal families' bit that we've all grown to love.I believe that FAIR and FARMS put's out some better arguments than the ones put out in the Bible. I was sadly disapointed by this for I was expecting more. I can't say I feel this book deserves the 20 dollars to purchase it.Oh, and I will bet that some Mormons will give me a &quot;no&quot; to the 'was this review helpful' bit. My question is &quot;why?&quot; I spent twenty dollars to buy this book. I had an open mind, and read through it earnestly to see if he presents a good case. And I was not convinced. Thereby I gave Hopkins a three, which is what I feel is most appropriate. I feel it is uncalled-for to give me a 'no' on the basis that I gave a low-rating to a LDS apologist book. I was open-minded and not convinced."},{"Title":"Biblical Mormonism: Responding to evangelical criticism of LDS theology","review":"An excellent book for any Christian who wishes to understand the Bible better.

I read it in two days and am on to the second book. I think the author did something very unique. Shuler took a character of great legend--Kokopelli--and made him a living and breathing person. I had to chuckle at her portrayal of him, but don't believe it gratuitous in any way. The ancient ones were very superstitious due to the primitiveness of their times. If there was no plausible explanation for something it was given a mystical or magical source or a person was endowed with super human powers. Shuler's portrayal of Anasazi life, as best we know it, seems realistic and her detail is terrific. Women were alternately revered as life givers but dismissed as having any value if they failed to be submissive. While some readers might find it repugnant that women used sex to attain a certain outcome, is it really that different today?Shuler set an excellent example for other authors in her listing of sources and giving credit for the detail that made her book such a treasure. Not that books by Cassie Edwards are even in the same league--which they are not--anytime an author relies on someone else's research for their literary effort, whether it is romance or nonfiction, sources should be credited.My only disappointment is that it appears Shuler quit writing after three books.

Kwani will touch your heart like you never thought possible. Her tribe's cruel rejection of her because she was different proves that prejudice has existed throughout time and the pain it causes is always the same. Her unexpected friendship and love for a tribal medicine man also proves that there is hope in even the bleakest times. Contained within Kwani's story is also a very entertaining history lesson about the earliest beginnings of our country and it's people. Perhaps after reading this wonderful story we will realize how far we have strayed from mother nature and our own history. There is something to be learned from Kwani and her people, and that will make for a book you can't put down until you have turned the last page and leave you wishing for more"},{"Title":"She Who Remembers","review":"I had all but given up on reading, due to my exquisitely perfectionistic outlook on &quot;What is a good book?&quot;.Thanks to Linda Lay Shuler's &quot;She Who Remembers&quot;, I am, once more, on that neverending quest for one more morsel of &quot;pure and exalting literary quisine&quot;.Not only was this book virtually impossible to put down, it transported me so smoothly into a world of it's own, that I found the journey back to my world to be one of the saddest I've ever made.I look forward to all sequels to this &quot;Native American Tour of Triumph&quot;,in the further adventures of Kwani.Linda Lay Shuler has reserved a seat for me in her stadium of enthusiasts, and I will ever remain there,as &quot;She Who Will Never Forget&quot;"},{"Title":"She Who Remembers","review":"She Who Remberbers is a wonderful tale of a time of early Native Americans of the Southwest who were so close to nature and mother earth that they could communicate with plants and animals and the spirit world without questioning. The descriptions of the enviornments, the emotions, the sounds, smells and textures take the reader to the place where the world seemed more beautiful and fresh and innocent. The simplicity of the lives of the characters are paradoxically complex in how they use ancient knowledge to guide their interaction with their world. For anyone who has ever asked the question &quot;how did they know?&quot; about ancient people, She Who Remembers offers a moving response. Women will appreciate the authors perspective on the power of womankind presented through the lead character and the other women she had contact with. This story is romantic in all senses of the word. I was swept away and found it difficult to put the book down and leave the dream"},{"Title":"She Who Remembers","review":"I loved this book and can hardly wait to read the next in the series.The depiction of Anasazi Indian customs and tribes is so vivid you feel as if you were there."},{"Title":"She Who Remembers","review":"I am so glad that I had a chance to read all 3 books. I found them wonderful and I couldn't put them down. It put me back in time of what it may have been. I felt I could have been part of this past. Thank-you for a great time of reading. Margaret Rowe"},{"Title":"She Who Remembers","review":"I bought this book because the cover looked good and I thought it was going to be a realistic story about the Anasazi Indians. What a complete disappointment! It started out ok, although the remote and supposedly sparsely-populated woods around where this tribe lived was like Grand Central Station, with everybody running into each other all the time. I could overlook that. But when she ended up in this other village and everybody started doing this ceremony where they got naked and \\"gave birth\\" to her and a rival woman urinated on her so she bit the woman's breast and then they got into a knock-down drag-out, I had had enough! What a complete insult to the Anasazi, and what an insult to the reader! I must admit I don't know what happened after that, I was disgusted and didn't read the rest."},{"Title":"She Who Remembers","review":"Great Book! Love it and have read it over and over.

An interesting fictional story interwoven with historically accurate facts."},{"Title":"She Who Remembers","review":"im trying to find this book in hard back. You only have it paper back. I would really appreatiate if you can find this book in hard back thankyou"},{"Title":"She Who Remembers","review":"This book is really, really good AND really, really boring and predictable!What's good about it are the parts where the author, who obviously did a lot of research, writes about the customs and the life-style of the Anaszi. As a Wiccan who is interested in the Ancient Ways and Native American beliefs, I really enjoyed that part. I feel I learned a lot of things that I can incorporate into my own practices. However, I found the potrayal of the Anaszi as ignorant and superstitous rather offensive!As a life-long, voracious reader, I just want to say that I don't like romance novels! Damsels in distress bore me! Especially if they're in distress because of some incredibly stupid thing that they did to GET themselves into distress. I also prefer heras(femminine of hero)who rescue themselves without a BIG, STRONG(and of course, INCREDIBLY HANDSOME,(who is also a passionate and expert lover)MAN to save them! I find the romantic adventures of Kwani(She's a wee bit promiscous! The time span of the novel seems to be appx. a year and a half and she has five lovers over the course of it.)boring! I also think that she's an idiot for getting together with Okalake when Woshee(one of the few people who treats Kwani well)has volunteered to share in any punishment that Kwani may incurr by breaking any of the rules of the Eagle Clan! See what I mean about getting themselves into distress!When I read the book, I found myself hurrying through the parts that were about the loves of Kwani-Who-Doesn't-Seem-To-Remember-That-For-Every-Action-There-Is-An Equal-And-Opposite-Reaction. I know that this particular law hadn't been discovered yet, but the Anaszi obviously believed in the interrconnection of ALL life, which is pretty much just another way of stating it! This book is fairly long, but it is fast reading!Basically, this book is just a long romance novel with a twist!"},{"Title":"She Who Remembers","review":"This is quite possibly the best book I've ever read. &quot;Let the Drum Speak&quot; and &quot;Voice of the Eagle&quot; (which were written by the same author) were very good also. But &quot;She Who Remembers&quot; is my favorite in this series. As a matter of fact, I liked it so well that I've read it numerous times while waiting for something new to come out by Linda Lay Shuler. The reader is transported to another time and place and we hear a wonderful, intricate, and compelling story about the people living in that time and place. The book has many elements including adventure, romance, deceit and female rivalry. Reviews of many other books state &quot;this book was hard to put down&quot; but that statement is an especially fitting description of &quot;She Who Remembers&quot;. I liked it even better than Jean Auel's books which is really saying something!"},{"Title":"She Who Remembers","review":"This is one of those books you just can't put down because you just gotta see what's going to happen next. By looking at her references in the back, I can tell Shuler did a lot of research for this book. Although many will say, that this book is not historically accurate. So who cares? We all need a little fantasy and imagination in our lives. What is the definition of fiction anyway? I would descibe this book as a mix of a historical novel that reads as a romance novel, a suspense novel, and even an erotic novel at times. This book is a must read. Actually, I just bought the second book today and plan on reading all three in the series."},{"Title":"She Who Remembers","review":"This book is mesmerising. I could not put it down. This first book in a trilogy will grab you and keep you begging for more. You'll want to get a hold of the next 2 in this series. &quot;Voice of an Eagle&quot; and &quot;Let the Drum Speak&quot;."},{"Title":"She Who Remembers","review":"The story is slow in the beginning (stick with it), but towards the middle, expect all kinds of twists and turns. It kind of reminds me of Clan of the Cave Bear book. The story is similar with a woman that is adopted by a tribe that never accepts her differences. If you like the idea of learning what it might have been like to be a Native American in New Mexico, this has lots of details! She is a strong headed character that always seems to get herself into trouble. The main focus is not her romance with her male counter parts, but more a story of her trying to find her place in the world."},{"Title":"She Who Remembers","review":"She Who Remembers, by Linda Lay Shuler, was a fabulous book on the lifestyles of Native Americans. Her use of imagery to portray the endless landscape of the plains adds a mystical allure to the story. The extensive research that went into the story was clear in Shuler's discription of the people and their lifestyles. The story of Kwani is moving, adventurous, and on the edge of your seat exciting. The story is romantic in parts and sad in others. If you do not believe in ancient magic and multiple Gods, you will by the end. Shuler's choice of diction to continually refer to the sun as sunfather and the moon as moonwoman etc., allows the reader to feel like they are actually inside of the story with the other characters. She portrays human instinct with conflict and lust. She proves that the pilgrims were not the first to create witches to solve why death and drought come upon a community. She Who Remembers is the number one novel on Americas prehistory."},{"Title":"She Who Remembers","review":"I've always enjoyed learning about Native American life, but I hesitated at the start of this book, not thinking I would enjoy this long of a book on Native American historical fiction. I quickly learned how wrong I was. This book is fantasic. There is always something going on, not a boring telling of Native American life, but a constant adventure through the lives of various tribes and a brilliant development of special women and men of early American life. It gives an excellent telling of the hierarchy of the clans. I could not put this book down and so look forward to reading the two sequels."},{"Title":"She Who Remembers","review":"Our neighborhood bar offers a free book exchange. We took it because of the comment by Jane Auel.(My husband loved her books.) I think &quot;She Who Remembers&quot; is a better story than the Clan books. The action takes place in 13th century America and creates a tale about the elusive Anasazi's. The story blends archeological data and Ameriand legend. It is action packed and a quick read. It hardly stops for a breath. I would reccommend it to any reader who enjoyed &quot;Mists of Avalon."},{"Title":"She Who Remembers","review":"Linda Lay Shuler is often compared to Jean M. Auel - author of the tales of prehistoric Wonder Woman Ayla. It is true that both center their books around a strong woman, that the spiritual world is an important element and that both enjoy packing their stories with details on everyday processes such as how to grind corn, how to make herbal tea, how to weave a basket, how to treat menstrual flow, diseases etc.However, Jean M. Auel can get away with being a bit inaccurate here and there. A story that takes place several thousand years ago leaves space for a few colourful additions to make the story more entertaining.Linda Lay Shuler has written a book about life in what is now New Mexico a couple of centuries before Colombus. And she has clearly set out to make her description of the pueblos of Mesa Verde as accurate as possible. The list of sources is vast. That leaves less space for the author to treat the historical material casually, and it seems to me that Linda Lay Shuler generally tends to stick pretty much to fact or at least to what seems credible. Her main character, the pueblo woman Kwani, is not a semi-goddess like Ayla. She is beautiful, she is strong but she doesn't ride around on lions while she treats rheumatism with one hand and slays a mammoth with the other.Kwani has blue eyes from the Viking forefathers that &quot;discovered&quot; America long before Colombus, and sets out to find a mysterious blue-eyed tribe far to the East to get protection. Her eyes have caused her to be cast out from her tribe, accused of witchery.Her travel turns out to be at least as much an inwards journey as an exhausting, often very dangerous, meeting with harsh nature, tribes suspicious of her blue eyes and jealous of her beaty and men that seem to either hate or love her. Some of them both.The story of Kwani's change from an unsecure outcast to a self-assured woman of power in close contact with the spiritual world is to me the story's most satisfying aspect, more so because it seems enti! rely credible. The description of the different tribes also avoids the danger of being too rosy. They quarrel, they fight, they gossip as well as talk to spirits and hunt buffalo.However, I found some of the details too elaborate. Not only are some of them unessarily long, but now and again they also tend to break the flow of the story itself - something an author should do only with extreme care and for better reasons than insight on pueblo handicraft if it doesn't help the story along. This has all the markings of &quot;look at all the research I've done to get it just right&quot;.Well, some of it isn't right. I am not an expert on ancient Native Americans but, being Danish, I do know about culture in the Scandinavian countries.According to Linda Lay Shuler the story takes place in the late 13th Century. In the story Kwani meets the Viking Thorvald - an uncivilized Northener that seems to want only to rape the women and steal the treasures of the tribes - a man that despises the spirit world and only believes in his own cruel Norse gods.That part annoys me immensely. The Vikings were long gone in the year 1270. They hadn't existed for close to 200 years. All the Scandinavian countries were christened and had been for more than 200 years. Actually, the church had so much power at the time that it caused some fairly lively years not long after as the kings tried to get some of the influence back.The description of Thorvald the Viking would be more accurate had the story taken place before or just around the year 1000 and even then there would be very few brutes like him around. In the year 1270 it is a gross anachronism and an annoying one as Linda Lay Shuler seems to have gone to extremes in her effort to do justice to Native Americans.Having said so I will still recommend &quot;She who remembers&quot;. It is entertaining, hard to put down, you get involved with the characters - and you can start your own &quot;how to live the pueblo way&quot;-course afterwards."},{"Title":"She Who Remembers","review":"i loved this book! linda lay shuler happens to be one of my favorite authors. after you read *she who remembers* which i might also add, you will not be able to put down. you will HAVE to go on to read the next 2 in the series, which are,*voice of the eagle*, and then onto, *let the drum speak*these are 3 of the best historical novels i have ever had the pleasure of reading. i guarantee you will not be able to put any of them down, once you begin to read them. you will fall in love with them!pinkyvi"},{"Title":"She Who Remembers","review":"Mrs. Shuler is in a class by herself, she is the only author that I know of that received a nod from Mrs. Auel. This book is beautiful, filled with very colorfull characters and a gripping plot and the most wonderfull backdrop, the American Southwest.(I have been out there and it is as Mrs. Shuler writes it, the sky does go on forever!)"},{"Title":"She Who Remembers","review":"I absolutely LOVED this book! It kept me so interested I didn't do homework for about a week! :-) I just finished reading the two sequels, and I still can't get my mind off of it. The book was compassionate, reveals a perspective of life often overlooked, and provides helpful insight as to the real nature of human beings. Although these people lived long ago, they are people, just like you and me, with the same wants and desires. I highly recommend this book to all, and I really look forward to reading more of Mrs. Shuler's novels. (P.S. Are these three books part of a quartet? or is this the last book of the series? And if it is the last book, will Mrs. Shuler be writing more? Please say YES!!!!) Thanks Linda Lay Shuler for writing the best book of all-time."},{"Title":"She Who Remembers","review":"I should have quit after the first chapter, but so many people had recommended this book that I kept going, thinking it would improve. It just got more absurd. Finally it was just that goofiness that kept me reading.The character of Kwani, far from being a brave, heroic female as the author seems to want her to be, is a silly ditz who claims that all she wants is a protector, a home, and some children. In pursuit of this goal, apparently, she \\"mates\\" with every hottie who catches her eye - regardless of the consequences. Seems like every time she turns around, there's another Thrusting Man Part (the author's words!!) seeking her attention. The sex is more silly than erotic. Sillier still is a ceremony in which Kwani (she of the cactus fruit nipples!) is \\"reborn\\" into a tribe - crawling naked between the legs of all the women as they grunt in simulated labor, then attempting to nurse from their breasts. One bad mama deliberately pees on Kwani as she passes between her legs...and Kwani retaliates by biting her nipple until it bleeds. Everyone has a great time watching the two women roll around the stone floor, gouging eyes and pulling hair.But when Thorvald, the Viking, showed up in the story, I had to laugh out loud. There weren't any Vikings in America or anywhere else by the 1200's! Ok, it's fiction. But come on. I also don't remember learning that the Pueblo Indians did much buffalo hunting. So much for the author's \\"careful research.\\"I am not a fan of bodice-ripper romances, but I do like historical fiction. This book was just trite, silly, and insulting."},{"Title":"She Who Remembers","review":"I read this book some time ago.... after I finished Jean Auel's books... I found these three by Linda Lay Shuler..

The read is enjoyable. Shuler takes you back to a world unknown to many using fact and fiction. The book captivated me and I couldn't get enough. I only wish the series kept going as I became Kwani and Antelope and wanted more. The series brings a spritual look at what some native americans may have experienced using Shulers inmagination. The series allowed my inmagination to run wild and I found myself more intuned with my womenly intuition. As I moved on to Clan of the Cave Bear and Sacajawea...great books indeed, no other author has moved me as much as the She Who Remebers series. Thank you Shuler"},{"Title":"She Who Remembers","review":"She Who Remembers is an excelent choice of reading material for teens to adults.

The characters are well defined. The historical research is flawless. Kwani is an amazingly real character.

The characters feel like people you may have known and the story like one you heard long ago. It is a truly unforgettable story."},{"Title":"She Who Remembers","review":"The story of Kwani and her voyage to find her heratage made an interesting story line that made me want the book to never end. I read it three years ago and to this day I still consider it my favorite book in the whole entire world. Linda Lay Shuler had a way of making Kwani's trouble fitting into her world so familiar but then again different in the since of time and the ways of life. I could not explain my love for this book enough all I know is that it made a person who didn't like to read take another look at books"},{"Title":"She Who Remembers","review":"Well, I've read the whole series 3 times now. I was only 13 the first time I read it, so it was much more interesting that time. But as I get older, I look at it as an interesting diversian. It was the first book of this genre I ever read, and I should say, that I am now addicted. I then went on to Clan of the Cave Bear, etc...I agree somewhat with a previous reviewer, as I am also Wiccan, I found the witchcraft issue offensive. But I also realize that, although it seems offensive, it is a very accurate description of the beliefs of that time. Also, they had a different opinion of what made a \\"witch.\\" As a Wiccan, we are more closely in tune with their Holy men and woman, not the \\"witches\\" witches to them, were evil spirits, and people, who seeked only to harm people, and gain for themselves, whereas Wiccans today, and the Holy men and woman of yesterday, seek to help people. Do what thou will but harm None.This aside, let's get to the book itself.Although I find the story very entertaining, Kwani's love life does indeed get very boring. It's just one man after another. And the issue about a Viking of that time is a little far fetched. But we call this genre Fiction for a reason.I do find Shuler's theory on Kokepelli very interesting though. For the reason that the Anazasi, and similar tribes, did worship a Fertillity God... he was painted as a man with a flute, sometimes his penis was the flute. And so, she incorperated this into the story. I find the religion a little odd though, because the Anazasi seem to have worshipped this Kokepelli, and then it looks as though they converted to the Katchina's. Shuler mentions neither as a God/s. So what are they worshipping?Actually, if someone is looking for a very good depiction of the Anazasi, I suggest Kathleen and Michael O'Neal Gear's books People of the Silence... very good indeed, and The Anazasi Mystery Series, also by them. They are historians and archaeologists, I find their books much more accurate, also they add a certain degree of speculation to get you thinking.But in the end, She Who Remembers is an interesting story, losely based on a real artifact, the necklace, and it is an entertaining light read... especially for those with no interest in complete accuracy, only a fun book. Although, the last of the series Let the drum Speak, is not very good at all. A very weak ending to an otherwise, good story. I believe any good plot ended when a main male character dies... it's all down hill from there. So She Who Remembers, and the sequel Voice of the Eagle are interesting and fun, but the last is really very boring. I wonder why so many authors of this genre end their series with a story about the original characters children? It seems like a very weak way to wrap it up to me."},{"Title":"She Who Remembers","review":"i picked this book up during midterms and i couldnt put it down"},{"Title":"She Who Remembers","review":"I purchased this book due to numerous favorable comparisons of this series to Auel's Earth's Children series among the reviews - plus the favorable recommendation given to the book by Ms. Auel, herself. But this is not in the same league of Clan of the Cave Bear, or, even, Valley of the Horses. She Who Remembers lacks in the opulent detail of Auel's work - the fauna, flora, survival strategies including hunting, gathering and tool making, etc. This is a garden-variety adventure. The romances of Kwani, the protagonist, are shallow. The setting does not envelope the reader, transporting you back to a different place and time. Both the Earth's Children series and &quot;She Who Remembers&quot; are about extrordinary women who are set-apart from their own people and going on a journey of discovery. But there the similarities end. Auel's work soars, while Shuler's falls flat."},{"Title":"She Who Remembers","review":"While vacationing in Sedona, Az I went to find an historical fiction to connect me to the ancient inhabitants I was learning about in this incredible area.This book is not the connection I'd hoped for. While the physical environs were well researched and covered in her book, for me Shuler's character's were unbelievable and simplistic. The story was not interesting and I found myself easily distracted while reading. I finished it mostly because I was on vacation with few other options.Based on the many great reviews here, I ordered all 3 books in this trilogy but now have no real interest in picking up the other 2."},{"Title":"She Who Remembers","review":"She Who Remembers, by Linda Lay Shuler is an emotionally beautiful story of the ancient Anasazi peoples, their daily lives, loves and struggles. Kwani, the main character starts her early adult life homeless and wandering, outcast from her own people. Why was she so hated and outcast at the age of sixteen? Where will she live, how will she live? Alone, with no protector and no experience of how to survive in the dangerous wild land of the desert and mesas, she must learn to hunt and provide for herself. Will she find a Pueblo, with kind people to take her in, or will she come face to face with her peoples enemies and suffer at their hands?Linda Lay Shuler did a remarkable job of thorough research for her fictional story of Kwani and the Anasazi tribes of the Four Corners region. Ms. Shuler has re-created the lives of people from long ago with her detailed descriptions and story line. From the design of baskets, clothing, hair styles, daily chores, to the complicated and spiritual meanings of ceremonial masks, dances, rituals, prayers and songs of the people, the images she gives us are vivid and touching. She has an expert way of drawing the reader right in to the emotional and exciting aspects of living in caves and cliff dwellings. The experiences and emotions the characters feel are felt also by the reader who does not want to miss one word of this compelling drama.She Who Remembers was Ms. Shuler's first novel and is one I will keep in my personal library. I purchased the book several years ago, and read it breathessly. I just finished reading it again. Both times the story touched me deeply and brought the characters alive. Characters that became a part of my daily life and nightly reading. Memorable characters not easy to let go of.Alone in the wilderness, Kwani comes up against enemies, wild animals and situations beyond her control. Who will help her? Will Kokopelli ever come back to her land and maybe find her? Kokopelli! He comes this way every year for the Spring Trading and to bestow his seed upon one woman in each clan. Will he choose her this time? Will he find her, Kwani, and save her and give her what she needs, a home and children? Will Kwani find the man her mother told her about that will be her protector and take her in as family? What has become of the loving mother Kwani had to leave with the clan that made her an outcast?Kwani's mind wanders amid all the possibilities, the fantasies, the fears and unknown dangers she may face in the wilderness alone. Her mind wanders aimlessly as her feet wander ever southeast to ... where? All she wants is a home, a place to belong, a people she belongs to.Ms. Shuler has given us a tender story of love and struggles, filled with details of how the ancient Anasazi must have lived. This is a story that leaves one on the edge, waiting for the ever surprising events within a book that is exciting and compelling. A must read for those who love to know about peoples of the past.*******"},{"Title":"She Who Remembers","review":"Thoroughly enjoyed this book and the other 2 in the series.

I really felt touched by his book and his communion with nature. Looking to explore further into this new vision, I came across Chris Drury. In your book reviews you compare him to Andy Goldworthy and somebody even calls him more soulful. When I got Chris Drury's book, I was disappointed, almost cheated. No doubt Chris Drury is a capable craftsman, but it's unfair to compare the two artists. Chris Drury's art doesn't even come close to reaching the depths Andy Goldworthy's does. Chris Drury utilizes nature for his art, whereas Andy Goldworthy blends with nature and together they do art."},{"Title":"Chris Drury","review":"This book is an inspriation.

Powerfully written, it is the centerpiece of the book, and in 1977 was adapted into a very popular and much-praised film starring Jane Fonda and Vanessa Redgrave.It was at this point, however, that controversy arose. The film caught the attention of Muriel Gardner, who promptly asserted that she was 'Julia' and the story itself was significantly based on her own life and work in pre-World War II Germany. She also stated that she had never met Lillian Hellman--but it transpired that she and Hellman had at one time shared the same attorney, who was well aware of her past and who could have described it to Hellman.Hellman flatly stated that Gardner was not 'Julia' and insisted that the story, while altered re details and circumstances to protect the identities of those involved, was indeed factual. As more details of Gardner's life came to light, however, it seemed increasingly likely that Hellman had indeed made use of it in creating the story, and the dispute continues to provoke strong feelings even some thirty years after the deaths of both Hellman and Gardner.It was not the first time Hellman had been accused of literary fraud and it would not be last. During her long love affair with novelist Dashiell Hammett, Hellman was frequently accused of draining his ideas to further her own work. In 1979 writer and critic Mary McCarthy prompted a suit for slander when she described Hellman's work by saying \\"every word she writes is a lie, and that includes 'and' and 'the!'\\" But regardless of how Hellman came by her ideas, there is no getting around the fact that she had the gift: at her best, she was the equal of the best of the best, turning out several masterpiece dramas and three autobiographical works that jolted best seller lists from end of the country to the other.PENTIMENTO is the second of these autobiographies, published in 1973 between the equally famous UNFINISHED WOMAN (1969) and SCOUNDREL TIME (1976.) And although \\"Julia\\" remains the most famous--or perhaps most infamous--work in the collection, Hellman is actually at her finest in the other stories she tells, most particularly those that center on her childhood home of New Orleans.In both these writings and others, Hellman shows a remarkable gift for capturing place, time, and character, zeroing in on her New Orleans family, her lover Hammett, and the legendary Tallulah Bankhead to name but a few. From the lunacy of personalizing condoms in Hollywood to the drunken jitters of opening night on Broadway, Hellman makes you see it, feel it, touch it, taste it. It is a brilliant accomplishment--and if you suspect that the stories on which she hangs these talents are at best misrecalled, at worst deliberate falsifications--is this not, after all, what we demand that writers do? Recast reality in order to spin a good story? Strongly recommended.GFT, Amazon Reviewer"},{"Title":"Pentimento","review":"Pentimento is a brilliant--and entertaining--portrait of a woman's life seen through the doubleness of \\"then and now.\\" Hellman sketches the people within her life, now housed in her memory. Although dubbed a memoir, it transcends a mere record of Lillian Hellman's life and portrays instead the way in which a woman's history merges with the memory of it. Each chapter is a portrait of someone or something symbolically important, and each is written in a different style reflecting its content and theme. Not history, not autobiography, not fiction, Hellman tried instead to get the feeling of her life right, to find something individual and universal. Drama, humor, tragedy--it's here, and it's important."},{"Title":"Pentimento","review":"Lillian Hellman, one of the greatest playwrights of the Twentieth Century, bares her soul in this electrifying collection of vignettes about her life in the theatre; her friends and family; her complex relationship with the great Dashiell Hammett; and much more.Reading this book is like listening to Hellman talk intimately about her life. It is a true memoir; she does not remember details; the conversations tend to be fragmented, and she freely admits that her memories may have been blurred by the passage of time (and in some instances, Hellman's enthusiastic consumption of liquor).Hellman was an extraordinary writer and an extraordinary woman. In PENTIMENTO she reveals herself as few writers have ever done. She makes no attempt to portray herself as a hero or a villain, but as a real, living, breathing woman with changing views and difficult but fascinating relationships.One of the vignettes tells of her friendship with \\"Julia,\\" a woman whom she had known from girlhood who became an anti-Nazi resistance fighter and eventually was murdered by the Gestapo. There have been several cries of \\"FAKE!\\" and \\"LIAR!\\" concerning the Julia chapter, particularly from a woman named Muriel Gardiner, who claimed to be the model for the Julia character in both Hellmann's book and the subsequent film adaptation (a brilliant one directed by Fred Zinnemann). To be sure, Hellmann was known by her friends and family to be a woman who exaggerated things; it's what made her such a great playwright. But the only thing I can say in Hellmann's defense regarding the \\"Julia\\" chapter is that Muriel Gardiner, what ever she herself did or did not do during WWII, it is indisputable that she emerged from it with life and limb intact. Assuming that she was in fact a real person, \\"Julia,\\" whoever she was, did not.In fact the very weaknesses that have been cited for this book over the years are, to me, its greatest strengths. The memory lapses, the sometimes fragmented nature of what she recalls and what she does not (And when she did not recall, she simply said so. Certainly she did not make up cover stories; if she did, one suspects that she would have played the role of the heroine in the Julia tale when in point of fact she was such a klutz when it came to subterfuge that she nearly got caught several times.Hellman does not claim to be an historian; she is merely a human being talking about the things, places, and people of her life. And like most reminiscences, there are always things forgotten, things only half remembered, things you THINK you remember only to discover later that you were quite mistaken, and so on. Had she been making it up, one suspects the dominant figure of the story would have been not Julia, but Hellmann Which is precisely what happened in the film because they decided to go with a frame storyline in which Hellmann is the narrator, making Jane Fonda the titular female lead and relegating Vanessa Redgrave (who won an Oscar) to the background. Yet despite Vanessa's win as SUPPORTING actress, and despite the fact that Hellmann is sort of the \\"front woman\\" of this tale, the Julia character, despite limited screen time, permeates the whole film. As she does in the book: it is Hellmann's voice, but often it is Julia's words we hear.It is precisely because the book is so fragmented and uneven that it rings so true.All in all, a MUST READ!!"},{"Title":"Pentimento","review":"I do not have the knowledge or tools to judge whether Hellman has written the truth here. However, what I do know is that it is splendidly written in a quirky style, which I studied when younger, and the stories are full of psychological depth and personal reflection. While I find her plays and scripts somewhat shallow with easy-to-label characters, I admit that I liked this book as a fully realized work of art.While I do think it matters if she consciously fictionalized her life, whatever the facts this is a good read. I will leave it to scholars and critics to hash out the debate.There are many memorable scenes that live in my mind: her floating in a storm and remembering an incident of killing a snapping turtle, with reminiscences of Hammett as her great love. The scene wanders into a rumination of death and loss, which I thought was real literature. Of course, there is the story of Julia, but there are many other notable scenes, like Hemingway competing with Hammett over his sppon-bending abilities. It is also a window into the past that is vividly rendered.Warmly recommended."},{"Title":"Pentimento","review":"Pentimento is a fine example, not only of Hellman's writing, but of her imaginative style. The story 'Julia' stands out in this collection because of its basis in reality.The character of Julia is based, at least partly, on the adventures of the New York psychiatrist, Muriel Gardiner. Like the fictitious Julia, Gardiner studied in pre-war Vienna where she became involved with an anti-Nazi group. Hellman, who also lived for a time in New York, heard bits and pieces of Gardiner's story. Though Gardiner did not lose a leg and obviously survived, her story piqued Hellman's imagination. Hellman's portrait of Julia does not exactly parallel the life of Muriel Gardiner but it was sufficiently close, especially the Vienna section, for some critics to accuse Hellman of purloining Dr Gardiner's story.Dr Gardiner produced her own memoir in 1983, a book titled 'Code Name \\"Mary\\" '. Though she had an exciting time in Vienna, her story is not nearly as fascinating as Hellman's 'Julia'. The ending is especially poignant and avoids the happy ending that brought Dr. Gardiner's book to a close."},{"Title":"Pentimento","review":"Pentimento: A Book of Portraits is electrfying in its earnestness and candor, incisive in its tone, acerbic in its wit and picturesque in its mental imagery - a memoir (unlike An Unfinished Woman) that is a bit more honed and focused and less formless in how the recollections and diary entries jump from one to the next. Be that as it may, let it not mitigate the merit of An Unfinished Woman, for in its own right, it is a very worthy read and most deserving of its National Book Award. Each chapter in Pentimento is framed, each segment representing a person, place or experience that had a certain signifigance to Lillian Hellman's life and development not only as a playwrite but as a person. The book chapters are listed as thus: Bethe, Willy, Julia, Theatre, Arthur W.A. Cowan, Turtle, and Pentimento. The writing fluidity is fragmented, almost jarring, but the fierce, explicit prose enhances the flavor of the volatile, broken mishmash of truth and hyperbole, a choice style that is not a detriment to what Hellman has to say. With magnetic intimacy, the portraits all have something meaningful to declare; they range from the profound to the wittily bizarre. The latter is best represented in the portraits entitled &quot;Arthur W.A. Cowan&quot; and &quot;Turtle.&quot; It is in these two portraits where Hellman's mordant humor especially shines.From Arthur W.A. Cowan:I said, &quot;Oh, shut up, Arthur.&quot;And he did, but that night as he paid the dinner check, he wrote out another check and handed it to me. It was for a thousand dollars.I said, &quot;What's this for?&quot; &quot;Anybody you want.&quot;I handed it back.He said, &quot;Oh, for Christ sake take it and tell yourself it's for putting up with me.&quot;&quot;Then it's not enough money.&quot; (P.235)AndFrom Turtle:Toward afternoon I telephoned the New York Zoological Society of which I was a member. I had a hard time being transferred to somebody who knew about turtles. When I finished, the young voice said, &quot;Yes, the Chelydra serpentina. A ferocious foe. Where did you meet it?&quot;&quot;Meet it?&quot;&quot;Encounter it?&quot;&quot;At a literary cocktail party by a lake.&quot; (P.278)Considering the period, the one-liners are quite sharp; the portrait that obviously stands out the most is &quot;Julia,&quot; the 'supposed' friendship that developed between Hellman and a Freud disciple who happened to be an anti-facist supporter - a 'friendship' that later formed the basis for the Academy Award-winning film of the same title. Whether the story is fact or fiction, that is up for the reader to decide. Whether &quot;Julia&quot; represented a single woman or a group of dedicated individuals fighting to stop/lessen the evils of war whom Hellman truly admired and who thus wanted her name associated with, may also never be known. But what can be said of the Julia portrait is that it is a written down homage to a person or persons who tried to make a positive difference in that dark epoch of our global history."},{"Title":"Pentimento","review":"If you have never read \\"Pentimento,\\" you should find a way to rectify that fact.

Fylling"},{"Title":"Huntingtower","review":"A lesser known John Buchan work, 'Huntingtower' (published in 1922) is still a very enjoyable adventure book in which a most unlikely person in the world of fiction plays the central role. He is Dickeson McCunn, newly retired gorcery shop owner, whose life has been very 'respectable.' Now, free from his business (and his wife being away from home), Dickson leaves the city to spend time walking in the countryside of Scotland.But while visiting the village called Dalquharter, Dickson meets a young English poet Mr. Heritage, who tries to convince him that in the ruined mansion Huntingtower, a young woman is held against her will, and the poet claims that he knows her personally. Moreover, Heritage believes that the woman is a Russian princess. Unconvinced, Dickson refuses to take part in his 'rescue' plans ... at first.The plot is vintage Buchan, with lots of actions (exciting and incredible ones), plus well-observed descritions of characters. Dickson is not as active or heroic as Richard Hannay, but the situation is similar to that of 'The Thirty-Nine Steps.' The difference is inclusion of historical references to the post-revolution Russia, and 'the Gorbals Die-Hards,' group of local kids who assist the jobs of Dickson. The colorful Scottish background is also attarctive.The book is a thriller, but unlike 'Greenmantle,' it is not political. It's more like reading Scott or Stevenson, with sly and often comical commentary to the contemporary social situations here and there, such as deft description of one boy who recounts his experience joining in sociliast's meeting, thinking that it's a football club. And of course, Russian princess reminds us of the legend of Anastasia.The book fails to be convincing when it tries to show the 'villains' who are only stock characters, and the idea of putting a respectable middle-class Glassgow grocery store owner does not work in the latter half of the book, in which Dickson McCunn is less interesting presence than the 'Die-Hards.' And you probably don't like the book's occasional derogatory commentary on certain group (especially Jewish people). Some of the values here are those of the 1920s, and they are clearly dated.But the actions and the characters (if not all) are still good, and the narrator draws vivid sketches of people with clever and pithy wording. The catalogue of people Dickson meets on the road (including Heritage) is all lively, and the entire mood of the book is surprisingly optimistic. The book is readable and entertaining in a different way than Buchan's spy novels."},{"Title":"Huntingtower","review":"Huntingtower is a rare book and a pleasure to read. On one level it's a gripping adventure story. On another level it's a vindication of the overlooked characters of the thriller-world. The heroes here aren't soldiers, aren't highly-trained spies, aren't adventurers. They are a married, middle-aged grocer; an old lady; a gang of indomitable street-kids; a cynical poet; and a gang of disabled soldiers. And there's a dispossessed Russian princess-turned-spy in there, too, with a dispossessed Russian prince.On another level the tale's pure allegory--about the Realist (the cynical poet) and the Romanticist (the grocer) stumbling upon a slice of real adventure and finding out that it's nothing like either of them expected. It's a vindication of fairy-tales (there's a princess in a tower!) and a judgement of thoughtless sentimentalism.But all those levels work together to make up an often funny, often moving, surprisingly candid adventure through a Scotland lovingly evoked--yet another of Buchan's unusual tales."},{"Title":"Huntingtower","review":"A very enjoyable escape, adventuring with a recently-retired grocer and his assorted acquaintances.

Not to be missed!"},{"Title":"Huntingtower","review":"Thrilling and intense, this book is perfect for the adventurers in all of us.

In addition, it contains many passages from such poets as Homer, Shakespeare, and several others of a more modern origin. Written in fine, if rather flowery script, this book portrays its myths just as one would assume the ingenious writers and story tellers who created them would like them to be told. A vast accomplishment, this document has been printed and reprinted ever since it was first written over a hundred years ago. Every known god or goddess is allotted their tales, which include various versions, stating the details that differ from version to version.

The lilac, flowery planners with poor typography turned me off. There were many such organizers to choose from at B&N; but this one caught my eye because of its bright colors and modern, clean design on the glossy, belly-band style dust jacket. I flipped through the pages and just LOVED the smooth, heavy-weight paper- perfect for ballpoint pen without it showing up on the other side of the page. The design inside is impeccable, and the photography is so gorgeous and inspiring that I have actually chosen pink and orange as my wedding colors as a result!While this is a lovely book, it does have some faults, but not enough that I wouldn't recommend this book.PROS:1. VERY sturdy, heavy-duty cover. Perfect for support while taking notes on the go.2. Gorgeous design.3. Good tips for anyone regardless of their stage in the planning. I especially like their notes and surveys on finding your own personal wedding style. I work in the wedding industry myself and thought that I wouldn't find as much use for a planner, but this brought up a LOT of small details I might have overlooked until the last minute.4. Heavy-duty clear pockets, one for each section. Perfect for holding samples and other such things.5. Color coded tabs. This really appeals to me, it helps tremendously in the organizational process and it is often overlooked by most people.6. A big section for inspiration, including gridded paper, which I use for sketching our wedding logo and graphics. Nice touch.CONS:1. Odd size. This is the biggest fault. The binder itself is square- aprox. 9\\"x9\\". Thus, the paper inside is an odd size as well. It is 8.5\\" high by 7.80\\" or something similar long. What an ODD size. Why not square inside? Anyway, its annoying. You can't store letter-sized papers (contracts, etc) without folding them, which adds bulk to the binder, and also I hate folding stuff like that, I would much prefer to add them to the binder so that I can flip back and forth to them for reference. Now I'm forced to take them from the pockets, and if there are multiple papers of different sizes in there, I may have to take them all out or risk spilling them on the floor. Also, the holes are an odd distance apart as well, which means you can't use a standard hole punch. This is a problem because...(on to point 2)2. The planner should have more tabs and be better organized, perhaps by timeline or a tab for each vendor contract or something similar. The wedding transportation, gift list tracker, and wedding accommodations are hidden behind the many pages of the guestlist section. The guestlist is a waste of space as the best thing you can do for yourself is to make an Excel spread sheet or at least keep the guestlist typed in Word or some equivalent. I am going to add tabs for each specific vendor but it will require a lot of work to cut the paper down specifically to size.3. Its a bit outdated (well, it IS five years old at this point) and sometimes inaccurate. Deejay is not a word. DJ is the abbreviation of Disc Jockey. Asking the photographer for negatives is no longer relevant as most professionals have switched to digital. Also, why suggest asking what type of camera they use? Are you going to research the differences between DSLRs? Seeing the quality of their work and asking about their experience is more important than the brand of camera they use. My best advice to my fellow brides is to do their research for these things on the internet, and be sure to work with experienced, established companies who are up-to-date on the latest technology.4. It would have been nice for the binder to come with an elastic closure, like the ones you see on moleskine notebooks.Anyway, despite my few nitpicks it is an excellent book, a worthy investment for $20.

You will find in this book music, food, fashion, etc all together under \\"Design Workshop\\" category.5. There is a \\"Bride Attire Checklist\\" page but there is no groom's one...Most of these problems can be solved in one way: There are about 10+ blank note pages at the end of the planner. I have taken them out and inserted them into places I need more space. I even rearranged the categories like I want it to be.I have researched a lot of planners in stores and the internet. I personally don't like those chunky, heavy, and loosely glued planners. The moment i weight them I put them down.

The binder is helpful to keep things organized."},{"Title":"Shiloh","review":"Foote structures this novel brilliantly. Each narrator describes a different aspect of the battle, thereby providing readers with sense of what various soldiers' duties were during the engagement and how they responded to combat. The book also unfolds chronologically, so Foote provides us with the key strategy and major tactics used in the battle as well as the major points of conflict, including Shiloh Church, the Peach Orchard, The Hornet's Nest and the Fallen Timbers. It was especially interesting how he sometimes omits, or only vaguely references, other landmark events, such as the pounding of Union forces from Ruggles' Battery and the poignancy of Bloody Pond as a hellish haven in the battle. Maybe the 21st Century emphasis on these two icons of Shiloh is part of a contemporary way of thinking about the battle that wasn't as key to Foote's 1950s consciousness. Perhaps Foote effectively avoids being specific about some of these icons to make the point that ways we perceive the site are not necessarily how Civil War soldiers actually thought about the fracas. Another very subtle but effective technique that Foote uses is to interconnect each section told by the various narrators. We discover what happened to Fountain, for example, by reading another narrator's chapter, and attentive readers will discover clever ways that various narrators and characters encounter each other in the various accounts. Throughout the book, Foote's storytelling is superb. This novel mirrors the way veterans tell stories to each other. Part of the reason why veterans tell stories to each other relates to their interest in using other soldiers' accounts to come up with a better understanding of the entire experience. In this way, the line between storyteller and historian is blurred, and Foote, as a WW II veteran and fine writer, is a master at this creative, yet accurate and honest, approach to thinking about history."},{"Title":"Shiloh","review":"A classic from Shelby Foote. Loved it and looking forward to reading more narrative history. It's not at all like the history books you remember from high school!"},{"Title":"Shiloh","review":"Mr. Foote was such a great writer. This was one of the books that inspired me to writeChase The Wild Pigeons: A novel of the Civil War. Mr. Foote knew the Civil War and he knew Shiloh. He puts you right smack dab on the battlefield. Get the book."},{"Title":"Shiloh","review":"Shelby Foote's Shiloh, a faced-paced page-turning novel, was a delight to read on the heels of finishing James Lee McDonough's historical narrative of Shiloh. After acquiring the historical background of the battle from McDonough, I was excited to delve into this fictional, yet historically accurate, narrative by Mr. Foote. This approach made reading the novel that much more pleasurable, because I had already become acquainted with the major characters, such as Generals Albert Sidney Johnston, Beauregard, Grant, Sherman, Prentiss and Nathan Bedford Forrest, as well as the battle itself.Shelby Foote narrated each chapter in the first person, playing the role of either a soldier in the Union or Confederate camp, whether he be an infantryman, artilleryman, calvaryman or staff officer. Foote entertains the reader by placing fictional characters in historically accurate battle settings, showing their reactions to the different events and battle scenes. Some of the memorable scenes included the death of General Albert Sidney Johnston and the daring cavalry ride by then Colonel N.B. Forrest into Union territory at Fallen Timbers.In the last chapter, a Confederate narrator reminisced of a scene that took place at the Louisana State Military Academy where then Superintendent Sherman warned of the South's inevitable defeat by the North, stressing their superior resources and strong will to fight. The Confederate narrator, disturbed by the memory, then countered it with the encouraging remembrance of Forrest's display of gallantry at Timber Falls, where he appeared to singlehandedly stave off, or at least discourage, a potential Union pursuit at the end of the Battle of Shiloh.Thumbs up and much gratitude to the late Mr. Shelby Foote for his fine talent and gift of this great novel!"},{"Title":"Shiloh","review":"I enjoyed reading this book very much. I read it to my husband. The map was very helpful. We have been to Shiloh two times so this book helped us remember the battlefield.

Thanks for a good read."},{"Title":"Shiloh","review":"\\"Shiloh\\" is a remarkable read. It brings a battle of the Civil War alive through the eyes of the soldiers that fought it. Each chapter is an anthology and a unique perspective of the battle. At times the characters from the other chapters will be receive a brief mention, but that is more of the exception to the rule. What this does is that it allows the reader to see the battle as a real life entity - the emotions of the battle are readily explored (bravery, cowardice, anticipation). You can feel the adrenaline and your heart races with the fear. It really is an amazing novel.The credit for this highly readable but historically accurate novel goes to Shelby Foote - with a notable assist to fellow native Mississippian William Faulkner. The series of perspectives is similar toAs I Lay Dyingbut it offers the accuracy of a seasoned historian. In truth, \\"Shiloh\\" is (to me) more readable than Faulkner and engages in a level that I was never able to find with Foote's idle.Final Verdict - I rarely say this, but this should be required reading at the High School level. It is written at a very high level and it offers a highly entertaining an accurate retelling of the battle of Shiloh.5 Stars"},{"Title":"Shiloh","review":"The Battle of Shiloh has always been one of my favorite battles of the American Civil War to study. I have been to the battlefield three times and I'm still in awe of it. The battlefield is wonderfully preserved to this day by the National Park Service. The battle itself is also preserved in Shelby Foote's novel 'Shiloh'. Foote needs no introduction but I think this novel is a bit in the shadow of his epic three volume work on the Civil War. I really think this book brings the battle to life and is very much in the same league of great modern day Civil War novels like, 'The Killer Angels' and 'The Black Flower'. I like Foote's changing cast of characters through the novel and how they are usually the average foot soldier who has to do the fighting. They are scared and hungry and usually very brave. The history of the battle is very well depicted and you will often wonder what happened to some of the fictional characters after their stories are completed in the book. The battle was really just the beginning of the brutality of the war. It would grow much worse before the war was over. Foote has captured this time in early April 1862 that you will think you are on the banks of the Tennessee River witnessing the battle. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Shiloh","review":"Shelby Foote, the author of the massive Civil War: A narrative, looks at one battle (Shiloh) through the lives of six soliders. Although the soliders may be fictional, the author gives the impression that these were actual soliders. Although this book is no Killer Angels it is a very good account of the battle at Shiloh"},{"Title":"Shiloh","review":"The Civil War defined this nation's past and its future, and, like it or not, our present. And in this novel Foote explores those ideas by using the Battle of Shiloh as a backdrop.The novel itself is literary in structure. Foote goes out of his way to make it literary, and his choice of structure works. He presents disparate people in each chapter from both sides to narrate the action. In one chapter he tells the story from all twelve members of a Union squad, the 23rd Indiana.And it works.I suppose it's almost impossible to read any Civil War novel without comparing it to Stephen Crane's The Red Badge of Courage. But Red Badge was an idealized examination of a Civil War battle. Foote doesn't fall into that trap. He portrays war, and the men who fought it, under the cold light of reality. He doesn't shy away from the horror and the heartache and the seeming futility that is inherent in armed conflict. Nor does he fling it into the reader's face using hyperbole and wild emotion. He simply shows us the battle, lets us look into the hearts of the men who are fighting it, and allows us to draw our own conclusions.Therefore, unlike Red Badge, Foote's story doesn't preach an overarching message. Any message you take away is one you find in your heart after you've read it. To my way of thinking that's more powerful.One historical note: In this battle 23, 746 men were killed or wounded, more than all the casualties of the Revolutionary War, the War of 1812 and the Mexican-American War combined. \\"Shiloh\\", it should be noted, is a Hebrew word that mean's \\"place of peace.\\"This is a very good book. I highly recommend it. Give it a peek."},{"Title":"Shiloh","review":"If one has read Foote's 3 volume history of the Civil War the quality of this book comes as no surprise. One of the amazing things about Foote's 3 volume history was the readability. It felt as if you were reading a novel. This novel is the other side of the coin. It feels as if the characters would have done and said exactly what Foote has them do. Even though the characters are fictionalized the events are covered with the same attention to factual detail as the best history. Each character in the book can only tell of their small part in this terrible battle but all the accounts are tied in to make the book very coherent. This is a great companion to the 3 volume history but can easily stand on its own."},{"Title":"Shiloh","review":"In this beautifully written book, Shelby Foote takes the reader straight to the battlefield of Shiloh. By telling the story from the points of view of the participants, both North and South, there is a real sense of being present. The guns fire and the smoke and rain penetrate the entire area. We are wet and cold and scared and puzzled by the battle and how it moves. Any student of the Civil War should enjoy this story emensely."},{"Title":"Shiloh","review":"Shelby Foote has maintained that he is a story teller above all things. Yet, he has come to be considered a leading expert on the American Civil War because of his trilogy on the war. In Shiloh: A Novel, he gives us a fictional account of the two-day battle of April 1862.Foote tells the story of 6 different participants in the battle, both Union and Confederate. The men are tired, scared, brave, leaders, and runners. The book is short, only 226 pages, but we feel their fear and excitment, even if only for a moment, along with their short-sighted view of the fighting. Here there is no grand view of the entire battle nor of the tactics and planning. These are largely the fighters who carry out the orders, not knowing why most of the time, only that they are soldiers and this is what they do.Originally published well before the Shaara trilogy, Shiloh ranks with them and The Red Badge of Courage in the emotion and story telling. The reader becomes part of the action for a short while, until you can almost smell the gunpowder."},{"Title":"Shiloh","review":"Who better than Shelby Foote to write a Civil War based novel? He does what he does best here, presenting history not from the viewpoint of historians but from the soldier in the field. Foote strips away the glory that military writing often wraps itself in, the noble causes and fighting the good fight. He shows the randomness of who survives and who doesn't, the fear that some men overcome and others are overcome by. A very good read, intersting, exciting and informative."},{"Title":"Shiloh","review":"Quietly, insistently, Shelby Foote leads the reader into the all-too-real chaos of a major Civil War battle. The anecdotal stream becomes a flood, washing you away, a flood of terror, despair, pain, horror, and a little bit of bravery, good military sense, and good luck. But the humanity of Foote's vision is the ultimately ascendant characteristic of his work. As Foote says elsewhere, any good, honest book about war will be anti-war. It isn't that war destroys humans; it's that war does permanent damage to the human soul. The only distracting thing in the book is the author's over-use of similes. Thank goodness 90% of them are excellent."},{"Title":"Shiloh","review":"Shelby Foote's closely fact-based novel Shiloh offers what I have long searched for--unromanticized historical fiction. Beginning the day of the battle and ending the day after, Shiloh brings the reader into the thick of the action.Shiloh is divided into eight chapters. Each chapter is narrated by a different character--and one chapter by the individual members of a twelve-man squad--skipping back and forth between the Union and Confederate sides. Narrators as diverse as an aide to Confederate General A.S. Johnston, a Mississippi farmboy, a Minnesotan deserter, and an Ohioan officer all contribute to this novel's grunt's-eye view of the battle, and the subtly interconnected perspectives combine, in the end, to give the reader a panoramic view of what this battle meant to the men who fought it.Shiloh is not just a book on battle, however. Through his narrators' thoughts, Foote points out the differing motives and ideals of the two sides--the differing attitudes among Northern troops and the perhaps fatal devotion to honor of the Confederates. Shiloh is a fast read--I read it in an afternoon and an evening--but by no means shallow. This is a beautifully-written, thoughtful, and moving novel.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Shiloh","review":"Shelby Foote is best known for his authoritative 3 volume history of Civil War, but readers may not realize that he was equally adept at penning historical fiction. In Shiloh, he tells the story of the battle which took place April 6-7 1862 through the eyes of six participants, equally split between union and confederate. The novel builds slowly, but by the time you reach the crescendo of the battle, Foote's prose becomes so hauntingly descriptive and detailed that you feel as if you are there, and the rest of the novel flies by in a page-turning blur. At first I didn't think I was going to like the structure of the novel, because the 6 perspectives are only very loosely tied together with no transition in between, but after I read awhile I realized that the author used this particular story-telling device as a way to try to communicate a sense of the fog of war to the reader. You see events from the ground level, just as the characters do, and it's not until you finish the novel that you begin to get a complete picture of the battle. One of the narrators sums up this approach to history by commenting that \\"books about war were written to be read by God Almighty, because no one but God ever saw it that way. A book about war, to be read by men, ought to tell what each of the twelve of us saw in our own little corner. Then it would be the way it was - not to God but to us.\\" Foote uses this technique with great effect, making this novel grippingly readable. While it's not the best Civil War novel I've read, it's certainly in the top 5. Shiloh is a must for Civil War buffs and Shelby Foote fans alike."},{"Title":"Shiloh","review":"Shelby Foote's non-fiction book about a great Civil War battle, Shiloh, is a gruesome story about death, battle, courage, and cowardice. Foote described the true parts of battle, but wasted much of the book describing each main character's life before the war. Foote, however, shows his knowledge of Civil War battle strategies and allows the reader to enter the Shiloh battlefield in which two huge lines of soldiers collided. My favorite parts of Foote's description of Shiloh--death, blood, battle, exhaustion, and fear--I still remember now. For example, I enjoyed reading when Foote described a man running, getting shot, and not stopping: &quot;I saw one man come over . . . I saw the front of his coat jump where the shots came through . . . this man kept going for nearly fifty yards downhill&quot; (p.79). Another gruesome part was when Foote described the surgeons in the medical room on the battlefield. The surgeons were drinking liquor to be drunk so that they could amputate the injured soldiers' shattered arms and legs. The pile of cut off arms and legs was up to the window. But the most horrifying part of the surgeries was the absence of anesthesia and antiseptics. Each hurt man would have to be held down as he experienced excruciating pain, but many passed out and later died of infection. Finally, I realized how much suffering two opposing forces can bring upon one country: dying soldiers, devastated country, and unbearable sadness. For example, Foote describes the mile-long lines of men from the South and North opposing each other. Each side would test the cannon's range, and, after a while, would be destroying huge groups of men and creating gaping holes in the earth. As a northern infantryman said as he watched the mini balls cut down his friends, &quot;they died for nothing&quot; (p.191). The front line would also shoot grapeshot that would burst into thousands of tiny pieces and destroy the other army's front line. All of Shiloh was about two sides of America fighting over slaver! y and secession. About 26, 000 men died without respect, a prayer, or a marked grave. Shiloh is a historically accurate book that would interest anyone who likes to read about the Civil War and wants to understand the pain and suffering our country went through on April 6-7, 1862."},{"Title":"Shiloh","review":"This book was actually bought as a gift for my husband, who likes the writer Shelby Foote. I ended up reading it too and I am not much on historical books. Great book. Easy read, even for people who are not history buffs!!"},{"Title":"Shiloh","review":"Of American Civil War novels there seems to be little that gets behind the eyes of rank-and-file soldiers to depict the war as close to realistic as possible. Novels set in during the war deal with either the commanders, such as with Micheal and Jeff Shaara's trilogy, or with the rewriting of history such as the works produced by the Newt Gingrich/William R. Forstchen team. There are also novels of the more romantic, epic variety such as Bernard Cornwell's Nathaniel Starbuck Chronicles and John Jakes North and South trilogy. Novels of literary realism that depict the common soldier in action, such as Stephen Crane's ever-present The Red Badge of Courage, are far less common. Shelby Foote's Shiloh: A Novel, however, fits in this category while including gems for fans of history.Unlike Michael Shaara's The Killer Angels, which places the reader behind the eyes of the pivotal characters of the Battle of Gettysburg such as Lee, Longstreet, Buford and Chamberlain among others, Noted Civil War historian Shelby Foote's work instead views the central characters and events of the two day battle through the eyes of fictional characters in an episodic fashion. A staff officer under Albert Sydney Johnston spends a restless evening in preparation for battle. A Union regimental adjutant feels the shock of the lead regiments of advancing Rebel infantry. A wounded Confederate private comes under the grip of fear, heat of battle, and witnesses the death of a beloved commander. A stampeded Federal artilleryman huddles on the bank of the Tennessee River with thousands of others and attempts to rationalize his own cowardice. A Confederate cavalry sergeant rides on a night recon to witness Union reinforcements coming ashore at Pittsburg Landing, and wayward Union squad with a late division feels the wrath of their compatriots for their tardiness before going on to counterattack the Confederates.Figures of the battle and American Civil War history such Nathan Bedford Forrest, Don Carlos Buell, P.G.T. Beauregard, John C. Breckinridge, Lew Wallace and Ulysses S. Grant all dot the landscape of the prose. Their traditional voice is heard through the ears of the principle characters. Foote delicately introduces them in a way that manages to avoid a tongue-in-cheek, or worse, a forced feel. Scenes involving Grant and Johnston are particularly touching while scenes involving Forrest are poignant and telling as to the true precarious disposition of the Army of Mississippi on the night of April 6 and late April 7. Foote, who was an admitted fan of Nathan Bedford Forrest, spends a fair amount of time in his company in the latter half of the novel, including recounting his dramatic interaction with Sherman's infantry at the Rebel rearguard action at Fallen Timbers.Though the novel offers an incredible amount of detail as to the actions of soldiers on both sides of the line, a reader uninitiated to the Battle of Shiloh could find themselves somewhat lost. There is a hand-drawn map at the beginning of the novel that identifies the location and movements of the various characters throughout the novel, but it does little to illustrate the general path of the armies and is even a little hard to read in some areas. The episodic nature of the work does not help to engender empathy toward the characters.Despite this, the Vintage Books edition of the novel is a fast, entertaining read, clocking in at 226 pages with large font. A steady reader could cut through it over a long weekend. Unfortunately, it seems Foote's venerable trilogy has arguably slid the novel, which incidentally prompted Random House to give Foote the contract for The Civil War: A Narrative trilogy, into the back-matter of his works on the American Civil War and the dark halls of semi-forgotten Civil War novels. The book is worth the read, however, and stands on its own as a crucial piece of Civil War literature."},{"Title":"Shiloh","review":"Shelby Foote's Shiloh is a Civil War Classic. It is one of the absolute best novels of the American Civil War. Mr. Foote is able to capture not only the sense of the battle, but the spirit of the soldiers who fought there as well. It is not a detailed analysis of troop movements or tactics, but rather a study of the human condition and how it deals with the horrors of war as seen through the eyes of the soldiers. According to Mr. Foote, \\"A book about war, to be read by men, ought to tell what each of ..... us saw in our own little corner. Then it would be the way it was-not to God but to us.\\" BUT TO US. And that is exactly how Mr. Shelby Foote wrote this book. As you read you will see, smell, taste, hear, and feel what the soldiers did, and experience both their glory and shame. A masterpiece.No gratuitious language, sex or violence. Some of the battle scenes are graphic but that is war in all its uglyness.Very highly recommended for anyone interested in war and soldiers; especially the Civil War.

One character does not happen to be in all the right places at all the right times. Neither does it champion the Union or the Confederate viewpoint. Nor does if follow multiple characters during the battle from the first shot fired until its conclusion. It is rather the story of a battle told in the form of a relay.\\"Shiloh,\\" Foote's fourth novel, tells the story of the two day battle at Pittsburg Landing on the western bank of the Tennessee River, eight miles south of Savannah, Tennessee, told through multiple viewpoints. One chapter per character (with two exceptions) in which one piece of the battle is told through its narrator's point of view. The flow of the battle is never once interrupted by the novel's constantly changing narrators, instead each character picks up narrative of the battle where the previous character's ended. From the battle's beginning until its conclusion, the narrative is passed from character to character, much like the baton in a 4x100 meter relay race.Foote begins with Lieutenant Palmer Metcalf, an Aide-de-Camp of General Albert Sidney Johnston, commander of the Confederate Army. Through his eyes the reader is witness to the march of the Army of Mississippi from Corinth, Mississippi to Pittsburg Landing, and the firing of the first shots of the battle.The story continues as Captain Walter Fountain, Adjutant of the 53rd Ohio Infantry, in Ulysses S. Grant's Army of the Tennessee, who has the misfortune of being on duty as Officer of the Day in the early hours of April 6th, 1862 when the swarming Confederate army overwhelms the unsuspecting camps of their Federal counterparts.Switching back to the Confederate viewpoint Foote's next narrator, Private Luther Dade of the 6th Mississippi Infantry, continues as the waves of Confederates gradually push the Union Army from their campsites and witnesses the death of General Johnston.Private Otto Flickner of the 1st Minnesota Artillery bears witness to the hard fighting at \\"The Hornet's Nest,\\" and having abandoned his post just before the Union line collapses makes his way at the close of the first fight to the shelter of the riverbank bluffs of Pittsburg Landing, where several other \\"demoralized\\" Union soldiers have also sought refuge.Continuing into Sunday night, Foote's narrative switches once again to the Confederates with Sergeant Jefferson Polly, a scout in Nathan Bedford's cavalry who from atop the Indian mounds next to the river witnesses the Major General Don Carlos Buell's Army of the Ohio crossing the Tennessee River to reinforce Grant's troops.The second day of the battle is carried forward by the first of Foote's narrative exceptions. Instead of being told from one character's point of view, he instead splits it up into twelve short vignettes, each told by a member of a squad from the 23rd Indiana Infantry of Lew Wallace's division.In the novel's final chapter Lieutenant Palmer Metcalf, in Foote's second narrative exception, returns as the narrator and from his vantage point, relates the details of the Confederate withdrawal from Pittsburg Landing and Nathan Bedford Forrest's stand at Fallen Timbers.Each chapter builds from each previous chapter, and as the narrative progresses, characters from prior chapters appear, if only briefly. Lieutenant Metcalf, is the only character to reprieve his role as narrator, and appearing in the novel's first and last chapter is a satisfying conclusion to Foote's narrative.The book's best feature is easily its map of the battlefield. Each chapter's corresponding number appears on the map is where the chapter begins. Arrows trace the journey of each character across the battlefield, allowing the reader to easily follow the action.\\"Shiloh\\" is not your typical Civil War novel. Foote has deconstructed the battle, and reconstructed it piece by piece, covering the dramatic ark of the battle, in its entirety, in a clear linear narrative, which is easily followed, and never once overwhelms the reader."},{"Title":"Shiloh","review":"Shelby Foote is far and away my favorite Civil War author. This book is but one of several of his that I have in my library. The book arrived in good condition on the last day of the estimated time of delivery. No disappointments at all. I continue to have excellent experience ordering through Amazon \\"one click\\"."},{"Title":"Shiloh","review":"SHILOH was the novel Shelby Foote was always expected to write - a novel of the Civil War, with which he will always be inextricably linked. It's an unusual little book - fans of his massive narrative history of the war will be surprised to see that it weighs in at a trim 221 pages - and if it commits a sin, it is in perhaps not being an epic. But its lack of greatness is in a way part of its charm. Foote was always at his best explaining how flesh-and-blood human beings shaped history with their doings and don't-ings, and SHILOH is less a novel about the decisive battle of the West and more about the ordinary people who fought it.The novel is written from six points of view: Palmer Metcalfe, an officer on the staff of the rebel army under General Johnston; Walter Fountain, a Union staff officer; Luther Dade, a Mississippi rifleman; Otto Flickner, a canoneer from Minnesota; Jefferson Polly, a cavalryman under Nathan Bedford Forrest, and Robert Winter, who speaks for all twelve of the men of Squad 6, 23rd Indiana. The way the men relate their tales to the reader varies; some write it in epistolary (letter) form, while others speak directly to the audience. The personalities of the characters vary widely, with some of the men well-educated and others \\"barefoot in their speech.\\" The one unifying factory is that except when recounting the doings of others, there are no heroes.In writing SHILOH, Foote tried hard, and I think succeeded, in presenting war - especially 19th century war - as controlled chaos, with the emphasis on the \\"chaos\\" and not the \\"control.\\" Also in presenting human motives as what they were and not what we'd like them to be. Metcalfe is confident his paper plans will come to fruition, and bewildered when reality refuses to correspond. Fountain has no idea what he is getting into. Winter records that nobody in his squad likes anyone else. But the show is stolen by Flickner, who, after running away from the battle, challenges another skulker to a fight for calling him a coward. The skulker says, \\"If you're so alfired brave, sonny, what you doing back here with us skulkers then?\\" Polly replies with dignity: \\"I ain't scared the way you made out. I'm what you call demoralized.\\" Only a Southerner like Foote could write dialogue so true to the 1860s, and only a man so steeped in the history of the war could reproduce its atmosphere so completely.The weaknesses of the story are bound up with its strengths. Having six characters writing six in voices gives the reader the feel of working through a book of essays or recollections rather than a novel, and the fact that several of the stories loosely interweave doesn't really do much to pull them all together. What's more, those who have real Foote's Civil War Trilogy will recognize many passages taken almost word for word from those books and transplanted here; Foote was unable to resist doing this apparently, when he was writing exposition.Overall, however, I can't do anything but recommend this book, particularly if you've never read Foote's nonfiction work on the war. He writes beautifully when he wants to (\\"I'd done as poor a job of making a bad man as I had of making a good one\\", says Polly), and always with wit and a certain melancholy (Metcalfe's father suffers from \\"Regret...regret of a particularly regional form.\\"). What's more, he sums up the reason for the South's defeat as only a man born and raised in Mississippi could: \\"We were sick with an old malady; incurable romanticism and misplaced chivalry...We were in love with the past, in love with death.\\" Foote said in an interview once that the Civil War was the war that defined America, and to understand that definition you could do worse than reading SHILOH."},{"Title":"Shiloh","review":"This book puts you right next to the soldiers that it talks about. It goes into great detail, which the author does a very good job at, and makes you feel like you are on the battlefield fighting along side them. I would purchase another book from this author because of how well this book is written."},{"Title":"Shiloh","review":"I read this as a study in prose styles; and ended up reading most the book in one night simply because I wanted to see what the different guys experienced! The juxtapositions of the different narratives leads the reader quite naturally through the two day battle, But the real charm is Shelby Foote's natural cadence and uncanny knack for capturing the \\"voice\\" of the different character's from different regions and all so seemingly. I wasn't even interested in the civil war before this book, and my interest in the conflict itself hasn't gone up tremendously, but this little novel woke up the human side of it for me... it well worth the read."},{"Title":"Shiloh","review":"It's hard to miss the fact that in \\"Shiloh\\" Shelby Foote has created the literary template used so effectively by Michael Shaara in his amazing masterpiece \\"Killer Angels\\". Focusing on one battle as seen through the eyes of several participants on both sides, from the common soldier, to the commanding generals, may not have been invented by Foote, but it is one of the earliest examples of the format. And there can be little doubt that Jeff shaara has become a very rich man due to the genius of Shelby Foote and Michael Shaara."},{"Title":"Shiloh","review":"\\"Shiloh\\" by noted Civil War historian Shelby Foote, is set during the Battle of Shiloh which was one of the most important battles of the Civil War. In this Battle Ulysses S. Grant showed himself to be a fighting general, and the South was threatened with being cut in two. This novel is told from a first person perspective by various Union and Confederate private soldiers. Foote succeeds admirably in capturing an atmosphere of authenticity, which is buttressed by his thorough historical research and knowledge of the war. Foote is a noted pro-Southerner, but for all that this novel is pretty even-handed. It makes for an enjoyable and insightful read.This one will not teach the reader the strategic details of this pivotal battle. Instead, it tells of the battle from the perspective of those fighting it, clouded by the fog of war, often not sure of who was winning and who was losing. Recommended. RJB."},{"Title":"Shiloh","review":"Fans of Shelby Foote's massive three volume Narrative History of the Civil War, (and I am the work's biggest fan), will surely find something they like in Foote's earlier novel about the battle of Shiloh. I couldn't help thinking, however, that Foote's real calling is as historian and commentator, and his effort to write a novel here seems to be a bit off the mark.Perhaps unfairly, novels of the Civil War tend to get compared to Michael Shaara's brilliant Killer Angels, a comparison that does not bode well for Shiloh. Here Foote tries to tell the story of the battle by providing first person narratives by a number of foot soldiers and adjutants, who often spend most of the battle lost, since I think Foote was trying to portray the confusion of this first great battle of the Civil War, with about 100,000 soldiers on the field and almost 25% casualties. However his narrative style ends up creating a jumbled mess, with no interaction between the characters, and not enough personal insight to make the reader remember or care about any of the narrators.It seemed to me that Foote the historian is effectively telling the history of the battle and providing biographical info of certain major players, like Albert Sidney Johnston, Ulysses Grant and Nathan Bedford Forrest, and he occasionally throws in a forced reference to a girlfriend back home or a memory from school to remind the reader this is a novel. In particular the very beginning, where assistants tell the reader all about the history of Generals Johnston and Grant (under whom they supposedly serve), seemed contrived. If you enjoyed the campfire banter of Lee and Longstreet in Killer Angels, or the heroic determination of Lewis Armistead to do his duty without harming his good friend Winfield Hancock, you will find nothing comparable here.I should point out that the audio version of this book had an excellent afterword by the author, where Foote puts the battle in context, discusses his views on literature and especially literature about war, and recounts a trip to Shiloh battlefield he made with William Faulkner in 1952 around the 90th anniversary of the battle. Here is Foote at his finest, spinning a yarn and discussing topics including &quot;Grant was drunk&quot; - (which he denies) and &quot;Grant was surprised&quot; (Foote thinks surely he was, which is a testament to his genius as a general). The excellent afterword, which I enjoyed a lot more than novel, elevated this audio set to 3 1/2 stars in my opinion."},{"Title":"Shiloh","review":"Good, personal observations of the Battle of Shiloh. Enjoyed Shelby Foote's writing very much."},{"Title":"Shiloh","review":"Foote did a good job of holding my interest and educating me about the Battle of Shiloh, life during the Civil War and visualize how the Battle went. Haven't studied Shiloh for some time and this was a great way to get back into it. Immediately started another Shiloh book, and plan more. Thanks.for rekindling my interest."},{"Title":"Shiloh","review":"Well done from the standpoint of a soldiers point of view. However, not quite up to the scope his exceptional trilogy."},{"Title":"Shiloh","review":"Shiloh was a great story!"},{"Title":"Shiloh","review":"I highly regard Foote's earlier works as a author of the Civil War such as his Civil War Trilogy and Vicksburg Beleagured City. Encouraged by his previous books I wanted to try this one. I was a bit discouraged by a novel-like writing although each story is based from history and tends build a great feel and understanding for the battle. In comparison to his Vicksburg book, this can not be done. If you are seeking a book based on events, dates, places, people and casualties this book isn't the one. If you are looking at a fictional character's account backed by history simply to feel certain aspects of the battle this is a great book. It reminds me of Shaara's Killer Angels about Gettysburg though doesn't live up to the expectations set by such a book. It is a mere attempt at fictional characters derived from actual history to portray events. On a brighter note, the writing is descriptive and truly places the reader on or at the events written."},{"Title":"Shiloh","review":"tom die"},{"Title":"Shiloh","review":"This book was very good when I read it, but it is very vague as to where the people (it's all first person accounts - fiction)are. The first person accounts are very good, and it does show there lives. There were little details that were very accurate that I enjoyed like: &quot;...I saw I was going to have it with a Big Yank wearing his coat unbuttoned half way showing a red flannel undershirt...An it occured to me, the words shooting through my mind: What kind of a man is this, who would wear a red wool undershirt in April?&quot;This highly shows what the federal government issued, scratchy,red, white, or brown wool-flannel undershirts. I liked that alot. It akso has other little details. Like I said, it's a little vague."},{"Title":"Shiloh","review":"This book is about a boy named Marty who is trying to save his dog Shilo. A man named Judd Travers, a man who never had any kindness, gets help from Marty and his dog. I think this book encourages young people to read. I give this book 5 stars."},{"Title":"Shiloh","review":"Sorry I have not read your book however, I have an original hand written document of the battle of shiloh written by one of the personal bodyguards of general grant. It is a non-fictional minute by minute account of what happened and who did it. It seems to follow the story in your other reviews very close. I must get the book and read it."},{"Title":"Shiloh","review":"If you enjoy war tales, you'll find this one well told. For myself, I cannot determine what the point of the exercise is. Mr. Foote thinks the War of Northern Aggression was &quot;the American Iliad,&quot; but to my mind, Homeric ethics are at least 2,000 years passe'. Neither the neo-Gnostic Union nor the black-hating Confederacy strikes me as wonderful (though I certainly think one had a better legal argument than the other), so I don't get too worked up over these events. (My ancestors all fought in the U.S. Army, BTW.) Skip this one."},{"Title":"Shiloh","review":"This is as much a cutting edge literary endeavor as it is a civil war novel. Slightly before the Civil War started a parable of four blind men touching different parts of the elephant and then arguing over what they saw was brought to Europeans by Rudyard Kipling. Out of the same concept perhaps, some of the Confederate soldiers referred to being in combat as &quot;Seeing the Elephant&quot;. With this story Shelby Foote endeavored to avoid giving us the chessboard overview of the battlefield and instead offer us glimpses of what the indvidual participants might have seen. The result is a too fast and barely coherent a glimpse into the action on the battlefield, which is perhaps even more than what an average combatant perceives from the battle in which they take part. It is not for nothing that terms such as &quot;Fog of war&quot; and &quot;Controlled chaos&quot; have been invented by mankind in describing battle.Because of that, much of the criticism that Shelby Foote draws for this novel is undeserved. In his own words, the story is not about people, it's about the Battle of Shiloh. The real beauty of this is that Foote has painstakingly researched the lives of its participants and the book is more about their lives than it is about troop movements on the battlefield. Few people realize that terms such as &quot;Aircraft&quot; and &quot;Electric Current&quot; are contemporaries of the Civil War, and Shelby Foote does an admirable job illustrating the modernity of the thinking of the Civil War's participants in words and deeds that historically occured during the battle of Shiloh with such skill, that we take it for granted that those characters are just like us, the modern people.The book's only shortcoming is that it lacks a good sense of geography and terrain. The woods and the peach orchards and the sense of place are mere abstractions, as are distances and the surroundings. Because of that we tend to get lost in the biographies of the people rather than on the battlefield about which the novel was written."},{"Title":"Shiloh","review":"The essence of Shelby Foote's book Shiloh is summed up by one of his narrators, Corporal Blake, who speaking to the men in his squad says,\\"books about war were written to be read by God Almighty, because no one but God ever saw it that way. A book about war, to be read by men, ought to tell what each of the twelve of us saw in our own little corner. Then it would be the way it was - not to God but to us.\\" Shiloh is definitely a \\"man's-eye\\" view of the battle - every chapter consisting of first person accounts from various narrators, Union and Confederate, telling only of what transpires in their own little corner. This proves to be an effective device for dramatically portraying the battle as it was experienced by those who fought it rather than giving the perspective of the historians who study it.Foote avoids not only the omniscient perspective, but that of the commanders as well; equally rejecting God and generals in telling his tale. The narrators that Foote uses in his story are the young men who fought the battle. They are all either common soldiers or young junior officers with no voice in the planning of strategy or authority to direct its execution.Because of Foote's choice of narrators, it proved difficult to include certain background information about the commanders of the armies that fought the battle. Rather than leave this information out, Foote included it in expositional passages that sounded forced and awkward coming from his young narrators. This is the only flaw in an otherwise outstanding \\"boots on the ground\\" tale of war, and is easy to forgive when balanced against the books many virtues.Theo Logos"},{"Title":"Shiloh","review":"Published in 1952, Shelby Foote's fourth novel, attracted minimal public attention, but the critics and individuals in publishing took notice. One of them was Bennett Cerf of Random House who then afforded Foote the oppurtunity to write a short, one volume history of the Civil War. The rest, as they say, is history.Back to the novel. Shiloh is simple enough, a relatively short novel which is simply about what the title says, a story of the April 1862 battle which produced the first battle where the casualties equalled that of Waterloo, some 47 years earlier. Foote does what Michael Shaara would do in his Pulitzer Prize winning Killer Angels nearly 20 years later; view the battle with altering Union and Confederate viewpoints. The difference is that when Foote has a historical character speak (like Ulysses Grant or Nathan Bedford Forrest) it's the words they were definitely known to use at the battle. Nothing on the real life characters is made up. Not that Killer Angels comes up short. It's arguably the greatest Civil War novel ever written, but you can see the blueprint of it in Shiloh.I enjoyed this novel very much. It got me to want to read the three volume narrative. I think that this is probably better than most historical accounts of Shiloh. It's certainly more entertaining."},{"Title":"Shiloh","review":"You can tell Shelby Foote really did his research before sitting down to write this book. The book alternates point of view from chapter to chapter from the Confederacy to Union soldiers. Throughout the civil war novel, their are letters from the soldiers to their wives which Foote obtained from old manuscripts. In my opinion, even the weather adds to the accuracy of the novel. The major turning point of this book is when Johnston of the Confederacy is killed in battle which led to the advance of lost territory by the Union.

B. Forrest's calvalrymen, an Ohio infantry squad leader), this first person narrative tells the tale of the first great cataclysm in the ACW's western theatre with convincing insight and emotion. The axiom of war - no strategy can survive contact with the enemy - was never proven truer than at Shiloh. Foote's narrative (this work undoubtedly proved to hone Mr. Foote's great skills for his monumental American Iliad - Civil War Narrative ) takes the reader to the most basic level of human experience. These are not troops - they are unique individuals, each with their own unique story to tell. Confusion, noise, smoke bombard overwrought senses - there are no God's eye view maps with red and blue arrows diagramming troop movements to try to give false sense to the chaos. Heroes and cowards, leaders and followers from North and South, crash into each other in a cacophony of violence near a Methodist meeting house named for Place of Peace, a few miles west of Pittsburg Landing on the Tennessee River. Albert Sidney Johnston's plan for the destruction of Grant's Army of Tennessee achieves limited success on the first day, only to be defeated on the second day after Buell comes up with the Union Army of Ohio. (Woe to the South at the loss of the great man Johnston, the South's first soldier.) The lives of each of the narrators are inextricably and forever linked by their experiences on 6 and 7 April (a Sunday and a Monday, lest we forget) 1862. What brought them together at that place, at that time; what were their thoughts and cares; why and for what and for whom did they fight, and how? These are basic, difficult questions to answer. Mr. Foote addresses each of these questions, for each individual, in a thoughtful manner, as a sort of personal history. This work is much over-looked and under-appreciated. It should stand next to Crane's 'Red Badge of Courage' in our national treasury of works of art, filed under: 'Fiction - American Civil War'."},{"Title":"Shiloh","review":"The description of the battle's gore and the common soldiers' reaction to it make the battle come alive. The battle seems to literally unfold infront of you. If you have prior knowledge of the Civil War or are just getting into it buy this book."},{"Title":"Shiloh","review":"Few authors can write narrative history on the same level as Shelby Foote. This book is a wonderful example of his abilities and deals with the battle of Shiloh through the eyes of several men on both sides of the conflict. His characters are not the generals on the field, rather they are common soldiers ranging from privates who have never seen battle up to a colonel (Forrest) -- people that don't have all the answers, others who are still searching for the questions. The wonderful thing about Foote's writing is his ability to make you feel like you were there without bogging the story down with too many numbers and statistics, but allowing the viewer a much deeper understanding of the events of the battle by giving us a glimpse through the eyes of those who were there. If you want stats, get an almanac, if you want a great story about one of the most interesting events in the American Civil War written by one of the best authors of our time, read this book!"},{"Title":"Shiloh","review":"Shelby Foote's Shiloh is a novel about a real Civil War battle told from the point of view of a few common soldiers, both northern and southern, who fought there. Because he chose to depict the action from these points of view, he limits what can be said of the big picture. If one can ignore that big picture, the book works very well at showing the reader what the experience must have been like for individuals caught up in different parts of the fight. Yet needing to provide some of that picture, Foote has each character present background on specific generals and their actions leading up to Shiloh. This exposition is, for the most part, pretty clumsy and simply detracts from the first person focus.The problem I have with the book is that the reader doesn't get to know any of the characters very well and overall outcome of the battle is unclear. This is a really small book (just over 200 pages) and while the images are graphic and the characters accessable, the author just doesn't have the space to spread out and let the reader develop a real emotional response to these characters and their actions. Nor is he able to provide any perspective on the battle and what it means - even for the individual characters he has presented.I think it helps to have read the section in his narrative history of the Civil War that deals with Shiloh. But this means that the novel doesn't really stand on its own. The reader must come equiped with prior knowledge or be left with questions that will require some research. Perhaps not bad, but I would have preferred a more comprehensive treatment - something more like Tom Wicker's Unto This Hour. That's just personal taste. Foote did what he intended and did it well.
