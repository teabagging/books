I found myself going back to this book, at least monthly, because it lists \\"what you may be feeling\\" and \\"what the baby is doing/looks like\\". I found this very informational especially with my first pregnancy because you just don't know what to expect when expecting. One nice thing is that it also has a 'dad' section, for the Dad to read.I RECOMMEND THIS TO ALL NEW MOMS AND DADS!!"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"First- time parents are always looking for answers to questions and they often seek the guidance offered via publications and periodicals. \\"What to Expect when You're Expecting\\" is the book chosen most often to fulfill this task. It contains advice, facts, visuals, and lists to help new parents find the answers to the mysteries of pregnancy.This book is written in an outline format and it is broken into five different sections. The area that new readers turn to most frequently is Part 2, because this is where the book breaks out the different months of pregnancy and lets you know what you should expect at each stage. Months one through nine each have their own chapter and they explain things like what changes a woman might be feeling at each stage; the size of the baby; what tests to run during a visit to the doctor; and much more.I am a new parent and I found this guide to be very useful and informative. I like the lists and the outline- style format with its bulleted text, boldface, and italics to separate similar statements and facts for easy reference. I also like the fact that the guide pays attention not just to numbers and statistics, but also to the emotional side of things, letting you know what bodily changes will take place for a woman and how it can affect her relationship with her spouse.This book is very helpful but I can see how some people will find it too basic to take seriously. Those who have already experienced a previous pregnancy or two will probably write this book off as being too simplistic. This is a valid point, since this book is generally concerned with covering the most important questions that first time moms and dads want answered. Still, I think it can be helpful as a general reference guide, even for those who already know what to expect. No one can remember everything, and this guide can help to fill in the blanks about pregnancy issues.Another thing that needs to be emphasized is that the lists for specific months of one's pregnancy are not necessarily true for all people. For example, the list of possible changes to how one is feeling is not going to be one- hundred percent true for every woman. Lists like this one only illustrate possible changes that might occur at the time. And even though the book clearly states that these are only possible changes, there are still some (particularly first- time moms) who will read this and get nervous, thinking there is something wrong with them because they are not experiencing exactly what the book says.Overall, this book is still one of the better ones on the market for those who want to know more about their pregnancy and \\"what to expect\\". It is probably the best- selling of its kind and it makes a good choice of gifts for the parent to be. I referred to mine many times over the course of the nine months and it proved to be a valuable resource for finding answers to the many questions that arise during this exciting time in a person's life."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I am almost complete with my first trimester. This is the time of pregnancy where every week of your progression seems like a huge milestone. This book lumps weeks together, making the expected mother feel as if there is really nothing special from one week to the next. I have to disagree with this approach. I am eager to learn every new thing; and if I could, I would learn about every single day. I would recommend Your Pregnancy Week by Week, Fifth Edition over this book. Each week has a new picture of development, along with an object to compare the size of the fetus. My child is currently a small plum! :)I also agree with one of the reviewers that a lot of the pregnancy books out there are extremely medically oriented. I found the Magical Beginnings, Enchanted Lives to be much more exciting and holistic. But keep in mind, even this book is written by MDs."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I want to say up front that I only read pieces of this book. Yes, me, a man. But my wife was expecting and there were times that I had to figure out what in the heck was going on. So, I read. For this, the book was really helpful. I won't say it was a lifesaver, but it was really helpful. My wife found it a lifesaver, though.A book highly recommended by \\"Dad\\"!---Reviewed by Dayne Sherman,Author of a new novel, Welcome to the Fallen Paradise"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I must say that this book is a godsend, as I am a first time mom-to-be, and had no idea what to expect with being pregnant. The book walks you through the changes both you and the baby experience each month, with a comprehensive look into questions that may arise with the barrage of changes that come your way. The book also has a section on diet and exercise as well as complications during pregnancy. I found the last section helpful to determine that my endless worries were nothing but that, the worries of a new and inexperienced mom. This book has served as a great reference to calm my worries, a starting point for questions to ask your OB/GYN, to prepare for the months and changes ahead, and to enjoy the amazing time and changes of being pregnant. I recommend this book to any mom-to-be (especially a first timer) who needs some answers, guidance and a little comfort along the way."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I am entering my ninth month and have read a lot of books on pregnancy, taken classes, collected magazine articles but I would have missed so much if I hadn't had this book. Every single question I had about weird things happening with my body, emotional issues or questions about the stages of growth of the fetus were answered in this book. I found that the clarity and amount of information provided allowed me to be more peaceful during my pregnancy. Instead of calling my OB all the time, I was able to refer to the book and relax.Some of the reviewers indicate that this book has made them more anxious. In my own experience, this book has made me much more serene. If being prepared and informed helps you be more relaxed, then this is the book for you."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I bought this book to add to my library (used). The nurse at my Dr's office warned me that it can make you paranoid. I can understand that. A lot of people rave about this one. It does have a lot of information and can be a good reference; however, I found myself skipping over large sections. Very much focused on medical birth so if you're interested in going the natural route, you'll have to research this further on your own. I prefered the Dr Sears book even though it's not quite encyclopedic in nature."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I get so tired of people saying dumb things about this book. Very few books will have everything that you need. Surely you know this by now? This is a book that will teach a lot in a lot time or a little in a little time. This means, read a section and then let it sink in before you go on to get the maxium benefit. It will be around forever and I am very happy that it will be a treasure for ever more. There are certainly other books that will fill in other gaps for different areas in your life with your family: Gentle Baby Care, by an author who has been around, Elizabeth Pantley, and for when the baby goes into toddler hood and preschool stages, Mommy-CEO, revised edition, by Jodie Lynn. All of these authors are surely in every household as they should be especially for the first five years of life."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This is a great book if you're interested in what's happening with your baby each month along the way. It contains good information on your body's changes and is reassuring if you're wondering if something is normal or not. I found myself picking it up almost every day. A few other books I would recommend that you look at while you're shopping: The Pregancy Book by Sears and Gentle Baby Care by Pantley."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This is my first pregnancy, so I thought I would go with the standard pregnancy book, which is, What to Expect When Your Expecting. Unfortuately, I found alot of misnomers and straight out myths in this book; my favorate is that drinking green tea will stunt a babies growth, while drinking coffee and a glass of wine every so often is A OKAY. I had to keep looking online at more medical resources to see if what was in the book was actually true. Alot of the symptoms of very dangerous conditions in the book, could be things any woman, pregnant or not could be going through and weren't very helpiful. This book only made me and my boyfriend more stressed out and concerned then we were before. Despite this, I have to admit I use it as a referance guide. Never having been pregnant before, I found the basic information and month to month guide useful. I also found the description of the birth and afterbirth useful, as well as the details about the postpartum period, which I didn't know about. However, it may have been more effective to talk to just another woman who had gone through pregnancy, then to read this book."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"The WTE series are HORRIBLE books. I would suggest really researching pregnancy books before buying them.This book needs to be more encouraging to expectant moms, especially when it comes to NATURAL childbirth and BREASTFEEDING. It needs to give the pros (if any) and cons (there are a lot) of having medicated births, and the benefits of breastfeeding.It's unfortunate that this is one of the most popular books among pregnant woman."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"While this book has some essential information, other pregnancy books do, too, and they'll probably be better written. This book has some built-in biases that are hard to get around, and the major question-answer format of the book means that if your question does not exactly match the one in the book, you might feel frustrated wanting a complete answer. Furthermore, the word choice of this book may leave a pregnant woman feeling much more alarmed than reassured. Likewise, if you're not married and you're gaining average weight or more, you're going to feel slighted. Although this book is often called \\"The Bible\\" for pregnant moms, it's got its problems. It's inflexible and uncompassionate, and a sensitive woman with raging hormones might feel it. This book doesn't seem to recognize the varieties of ways a woman can get through a pregnancy, and it doesn't encourage a woman to think for herself. As a first-time mom, I was really relying on this book, and I was really let down. Buy any book but this one; it's way over-rated. P.S. --For a really humorous look at how absurd this book is, read Jennifer Reese's essay, \\"Expecting the Worst,\\" in the (wonderful) book _Mothers Who Think_."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"Like so many expectant mothers, I ordered this book. I thought that with so many positive reviews, this had to be THE book to buy. Truthfully, I think I read about 2-3 pages. I attempted to read it some more at other times, but I really lost interest with this book when I started reading 'Your Pregnancy Week by Week'. Buy at your own risk..."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"First I'd like to start off by saying that I read some of the bad reviews for this book because I couldn't understand why it had so few stars, and boy-oh-boy are people picky! Not EVERY book has EVERYTHING that EVERYONE wants ALL the time!! Who ever wrote those awful reviews should have read the editorial reviews and taken advantage of the &quot;Look Inside This Book&quot; feature by Amazon before they bought the book.Second, this is a GREAT book. It is SO well organized, and I thouroughly enjoyed how each month was broken down into symptoms and what to expect at the doctor's visits. I loved being able to see what I should expect each month, what new pregnancy symptons to expect, and I was more informed at my doctor's appointments than I would have been if I had not had this book. In fact, when I went to the doctor's each visit, I already knew EVERYTHING she told me because of this book.Third, the section on special symptoms and complications during pregnancy are great too. I carried this book around with me everywhere, every time I traveled somewhere, so if I thought something was wrong, I could check the book.I would highly recomend this book to all pregnant women. And if you know someone who is pregnant, it makes a great gift! I received it as a gift and I read it cover to cover!!"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I would have given this book 0 stars if that was an option. This book is definately one of the worst books on the market. It does not prepare the reader for labor and delivery at all. After reading this book (several times), and thinking I was prepared for labor--I found myself having an unnecessary c-section under general anesthetic (when all I wanted was a natural birth). I wish this book would have spoken more about the risks of pitocen, epidurals, internal fetal monitering, etc...and the plusses of natural births with a midwife at home or in a birthing center."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"There is some information in this book that is useful- especially if you're new to the whole pregnancy &amp; birth thing. My advice is to read &quot;Husband-Coached Childbirth&quot;, &quot;Natural Childbirth The Bradley Way&quot;, &quot;The Baby Book&quot;, &amp; &quot;The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding&quot; THEN read this book. You'll find you'll mentally discard 95% of it. Content that will either make you laugh, or genuinlly make you angry. But either way you'll feel great concern for those women who consider this book the end all be all of pregnancy advice."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"As a book editor and mother of three I found this book far too alarming for mother and father alike. The first baby is the hardest, as all mothers know, and the range of advice and information is not only confusing, but also darn scary. Many of the helpful information, however, I believe will be useful for those who need more education on nutrition and supplements, shots, etc., though I think it would be more helpful to pair this book with Gangi's newest release, \\"Forget the Cures, Find the Cause, Book II, as it covers pre-pregnancy through high school in its information for parents. All-in-all, this book does help get parents off on the right foot and give them a partial guide that's understandable and easy to read(even if the diet seems hard.)Forget the Cures, Find the Cause: Book 2: The Circle"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This book clearly illustrates the total authority the general public gives medical doctors, and the lack of power people perceive they have in making decisions about their health care. Instead of telling you about options you have in regards to tests (which you might not really need, or want) and how you should be progressing, it reads as an alarmist list of directions on how to be pregnant and submit to your doctor without question. Scary stuff."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"The book contains useful information in one place, however, I thought it would have been more practical. A lot of the information summarized in the book was information I already knew or obtained from my doctor. If you don't have a computer, then buy the book, but everything in it can be found on baby internet websites."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This book was my Bible. I was completely clueless about pregnancy and what to expect. I don't think there was a day that went by that I didn't look up something in this book! It was a God Send! Every single ache or pain I felt was explained to me in terms I could understand. It answered all my questions. I don't think I could have made it through without it.My husband enjoyed the book as much as I did. It answered questions for him about what I was going through and gave him a greater understanding of the whole pregnancy process and the changes taking place with me both physically and emotionally.A very good friend of mine called to tell me she just found out she is expecting. My initial thought was to give her my copy of &quot;What to Expect When You're Expecting&quot;, but I couldn't bare giving it up! So, I ordered her a copy for her very own. Any one having their first child NEEDS this book!!"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"The format of the book is by the month. However, my doctor and all other literature refer to the week from the date of last period. I have absolutely no idea where in the book to refer to in order to guage development of baby or my own progress ! I dont recommend the book unless the format is changed."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"The readers who give this book negative reviews are taking themselves, their pregnancies or at least this book too seriously. This book is very comprehensive, and no one woman could or would find every passage in this book relevant. But it's great as a REFERENCE precisely because it is so comprehensive.So, ladies, don't get scared that everything discussed in this book will happen to you. Skip the parts that are not applicable to you. But use it if you're having symptoms or need guidelines. That's what it's great for!"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This book has been a great help to my wife and I during her pregnancy (our first).If ever we wondered &quot;is that normal?&quot; we could turn to the book and the information we needed was there. While no book can take the place of a doctor, it was a great comfort many times.From my perspective, the book helped teach me what to expect, and how to help my wife with all of the things she was going through. Fathers-to-be will all learn something from this book.There isn't anything this book doesn't discuss in a mature, candid, but often humorous manner. And what is discussed is done in detail. Never was I left wondering if there was something else that the authors weren't letting on. No pregnant couple should be without it."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I first read this book when I was pregnant with my first child. During my second pregnancy, I actually gave my copy away to a friend. I, like another reviewer here, found it needlessly alarmist, but that has to do with my philosophy of pregnancy and childbirth.I think if there is reason for a woman to be concerned about a troublesome pregnancy or birth, then this book could provide some good, basic information. Also, any woman who really trusts the standard medical protocol regarding childbirth and pregnancy, will probably like this book.For women who tend to question EVERYTHING their doctor or midwife does, they will not like this book! Just about everything that can go wrong is discussed and the standard procedures that doctors do are not questioned.For the rebellious mother, I would advise that you skip this one and get &quot;Husband-Coached Childbirth&quot; and one of the books by Dr. Brewer.And have a happy pregnancy and birth!"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This book provides fine information, in the format of questions and answers, along with a brief synopsis of each week of pregnancy. The thing I really dislike about it is that it really seems to focus on the negative. There are rare conditions discussed as if they are possible for MOST pregnant women. It also uses a lot of scare tactics to try to convince pregnant mothers to stay away from things that are \\"bad\\" for them- highlights, lunch meat, cats, etc. I think it's possible to inform the public of things without trying to scare them into behaving! There's also a section on eating for pregnant women, but I honestly don't know anyone with that kind of willpower. It basically suggest that you should eat PERFECTLY for your unborn child. There are lots of moms who eat healthy without having to follow such a strict guideline.Overall, I'd spend my time reading something that is more helpful, and less scare tactics. Same thing goes for the rest of the series, especially What To Expect The First Year. After a few months of reading that, my husband threw it away so I would quit beating myself up about \\"doing it right\\", according to this book. I can honestly say I was a better mother once I got rid of the book!"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"Excellent book! A month by month guide for moms-to-be that are also interested in how their babies develop.This is not a substitute of your Doctor's advice (actually a Doctor does not have enough time to answer all the questions you may have).This book is intended for impatient moms-to-be that want to know what happens at each stage of their pregnancy (plus their what ifs).I found this book at a library; nobody recommended it. I chose it from a dozen books that usually tell you only what you might be feeling at certain stage in your pregnancy. This book is different because it actually gives you advice on topics like \\"what if I am supposed to be feeling this and I don't feel it\\"; \\"how do I sleep to be comfortable and avoid cramps at night\\"; \\"how do I avoid stretch-marks\\"; and others like analysis your doctor might need (and what they are for); what to take to the hospital; what AFTER the baby is born...It gives advice but it's clear that if you don't care for certain steamed veggies, you don't have to take them (honestly I ignored all the diet stuff the first two times, but the third time I needed it since it is not the same after 30). I got the best from the book each time, and I loved it.I see some reviews here that say this is the worst book ever, and it will make your wife miserable and so on. I respect those opinions, but just think about it: We are going to be moody, tearful, and miserable anyway. Example: The book suggests helping labor with gravity; it tells to walk if you are in labor since movement and exercise will help the overall process (it does not tell you to have your baby there in the kitchen). Don't follow that advice and move on. If you don't want to walk, then ask your husband/partner to drive you to the hospital immediately. Take the stuff that fits you! (Gravity worked for me though, no c-sections or anything like that).I Just want to say that this book was a very close-to-reality picture of pregnancy at 25, 30, and 33 yrs old (all three of them very different pregnancies, plus age takes its toll).Yes, that was it for me, no more babies =)Good luck!"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"If there was a star lower then One I would use it..I know some moms felt like this book scared them, I feel like this book was too preachy about things, but did not tell Pregnant women that YES you can do EVERYTHING right and STILL lose that baby..I know because I HAD the textbook pregnancy..perfect..then had my 9.8 pound and 22.5 inch long beautiful baby (healthy by all standards) and guess what..he died 3 days after birth due to an suspected inborn error in metabloism ..and do you think that anything I did or did not do could have caused a break down in my son's genetic code? I think not...I know many women who have lost their babies and IT IS not their fault as this book wants people to believe..It glosses over realities of complications that do happen and make them seem to be nothing...avoid this book..BTW I thought at one time that this was a good book until I lost my first born baby then I realized that the book made me feel like I was alone in the world..the one by Ann Douglas has got to better, I have her book written for moms who have lost babies and go on to have Sub pregnancies and it is excellent, I wish I had that book instead of the I got from my OB for free..The book is obselete because it does not cover new medical procedures and tests that could save your babies life."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"The best advice I ever received from my midwife was to stop reading What To Expect and go buy The Pregnancy Book by Dr. Sears. All I gleaned from What To Expect was that there were a whole host of possibly bad things that could happen throughout the pregnancy. We don't need to read all that negative stuff when we are starting the journey of a lifetime. The Dr. Sears books are all wonderful, giving you practical advice and information about development (and yes, it covers the possibly bad stuff too, just not in an alarmist way). What To Expect is negative and alarmist, while The Pregnancy Book is possitive and affirming. After all, pregnancy is a time to celebrate our bodies and the baby growing inside! So go buy The Pregnancy Book, put your feet up, read and relax."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"A clear, concise and invaluable resource for anyone who is expecting. I found the prequel, What Not to Expect When You Are Not Expecting to be much more informative and useful.

You wouldn't expect grasshoppers, beetroot farmers or the planet Mars! Yet all this and more get their own chapters with diagrams, maps and instructions included. A helpful hologram of John Cleese on the cover helps set the mood of this joyous book.The sequel, What to Expect When Expected to be Expecting is a great source of inspiration to those who are being pressured into becoming pregnant by annoying in-laws.I really EXPECT you will get a KICK out of this book.8 Thumbs."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"After reading all of the critism of this book, I just had to add my $.02.

I found their possible symptoms for each month very helpful when trying to decide if something was &quot;normal&quot;. It wasn't overwhelming to read as you could follow along a little at a time each month. I'm getting ready to purchase it for a friend who is expecting her 1st child and I know she'll feel the same way. No book is going to be a word for word, perfect account of your pregnancy.

This book has the typical what to expect each month of your pregnancy. For me it was spot on. Each month I experienced the things that were being described in the book. What I found particularly helpful (sets this book apart from the rest) is the month by month Q&A section. The reader questions that the authors answered were typically questions that I had had. There were also detailed sections on: Labor and Delivery, Postpartum, Diet, Pre-natal Tests, Expectant Fathers, Complications, Chronic Conditions, If you get sick and Choosing a Practitioner. I can't think of a better or more inclusive book on pregnancy. It is definitely a must have for every pregnant woman."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"Hi ladies. If you are a first-timer and you want to avoid a cesarean section, you will need a much more powerful book than this to get you through labor. This book is a good resource when it comes to any issues that might come up during pregnancy. However, it gives little or no education on how to have a normal birth. Pregnancy is important, but you will remember you delivery for the rest of your life. Make sure to equip yourself with books like: The Thinking Womans Guide to a Better Birth by Henci Goer and Rhonda Wheeler or Christ Centered Childbirth by Kelly Townsend for all you Christians out there. You birth is important to you and to your baby. Hospital childbirth classes won't be enough. You must begin on a quest to educate yourself on how to get through birth with power and confidence. It is quite possible, and very rewarding! However, this is not the book to help you do that."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I'm only writing to counter some of the bad reviews written about this book. Really, out of all the pregnancy books I read, this book and _Your Pregnancy Week by Week_ by Glade Curtis helped me get through a miscarriage and a full term pregnancy without fear. I have read reviews and even had one midwife tell me, \\"Don't read _What to Expect\\"; it'll just scare you.\\" Nothing could be farther from the truth! The book frankly discusses the weird, beautiful, scary, funny things that the body goes through during pregnancy.Examples: During the first trimester, I read most of the book. Then, I went back and focused, month by month, on what I was going through vs. what was written. There were a lot of symptoms listed that I never had, but that didn't frighten me. There were a lot of suggestions about diet that sounded really hard to do, so I compromised, using the book as a guideline.If i couldn't do what the book said, I didn't panic. If I slept on my back, I didn't feel guilty! The book is a guideline, and questions or concerns that it raises should be discussed with your medical provider. What the book tries to do is head a lot of questions off at the pass, and, if that means that there are weird or scary examples included, it's because there is a significant proportion of women who have them. If you aren't experiencing such symptoms, count yourself lucky!!!!Overall, this was a great resource for my husband and I. We appreciated it's candor, depth, and user friendliness. It's not a difinitive work- I used it side by side with the Curtis Book- but I really believe that it explains well for women and men what the heck is going on mentally and physicall during pregnancy."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I have had this book for the 8 months and feel now that the girl on the front should have warned me to stay away. She looks positivly miserable and most of the book is the same. Very dry in it's contents. This is not the book to read if you have any sense of humor about your pregnancy or want to get the real scoop! Do yourself a favor, Go for Pregnancy for Dummies or the Girlfriends Guide, they are much better reads."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"While there is definitely some good and factual information in this book, it is so peppered with outdated old-school western medical b.s. that it is often maddening and could easily frighten someone who doesn't know any better. It touts things like episiotomy as normal (and often helpful - ?!) and pregnancy weight gain beyond 25 lbs as being the result of &quot;overindulgence&quot; during pregnancy -- never mind such other health indicators as blood pressure, hemoglobin and glucose levels, etc. I found this book to be patronizing and obnoxious and it's going right into the recycling bin. A *FAR* better book (and series), in my opinion, is The Pregnancy Book by William &amp; Martha Sears (an MD &amp; RN couple - but open to progressive and more sensible ideas)."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I have several pregnancy books in my house right now.

I love the way the chapters take a new mom through each month of her pregnancy, showing the progress of the developing fetus step by step, and letting her know what to expect.

Use this book as a reference book only, don't let it substitute for your doctor's advice, and buy The Girlfriends' Guide to Pregnancy if you want a book that won't scare you and WILL inform and entertain you!

So, the day after getting a positive home pregnancy test, I marched out to the bookstore to get it.But after reading a few chapters, I noticed the authors tone. And I didn't like it. I found the book unrealistic in its expectations of pregnant women. The diet you're supposed to eat--no processed flour, only 7 or 9 grain bread for example--isn't something a lot of women I know would want to do.I got the feeling that this book was written by a woman who drank soy milk and made her own baby food from fresh vegetables with a food processor. And that if I didn't do the same I would somehow be harming my child.Also, this book is like a lot of other pregnancy books in that it scares women in the first trimester. Every mother I know has told me that either they or their husbands put away this book for a few weeks because it was making them paranoid about miscarriage.Still, I recomm! ! end this book. Pregnant women should keep it on hand because it breaks out the changes in the mother and the baby over each month. It covers a lot of topics and answers a number of questions.Readers should, however, keep the biases of the author in mind, and not let the tone of the book make them feel guilty for not following the diet and exercise recommendations."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"They should change the title: What to freak you out with, when you are expecting!This book is all about telling you EVERYTHING that will go wrong!!!Motherhood is one of the most beautiful things that has happened to me; yes, it is hard, yes it can have complications, but you are better off asking your doctor about what might concern you. This book will go on explaining very rare things! that chances are, you will NEVER need to know about.Also, your imagination gets very active while pregnant (hormonal) and having all this negative information can trigger night terrors, and night mares.... talking by experience.My doctor forbid me from reading it any more.There are other books that will provide detail information about your current stages (and websites) without having to read through everything bad that can happen!"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I did NOT like this book, it doesn't seem to help at all and is very preachy. I am healthy and am doing everything right in pregnancy, but this book makes me doubt myself. A good pregnancy book should not incite anxieties and false fears. PLUS, there is minimal info on morning sickness, which is my worst problem. Very disappointing. The diet section is just ridiculous - I am a very healthy eater who eats organic foods as much as possible but this book still made me feel like a junk-food hog (and I am NOT). I would only recommend this book for women with little-to-no prior knowledge of pregnancy, because it does have most of the basic clinical information. Women who are already educated about pregnancy basics would benefit more by reading other books."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This book is the most over rated book out there. This is my first pregnancy and I have *tons* of questions, especially in my first trimester. This book answered NONE of them. Simple questions like, I'm spotting is that commom (yes).

I love The Mother of all Pregnancy Books and Merriam (sp) Stoppard's The Complete Guide to Pregnancy."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I purchased this book before becoming pregnant. I found it HORRIFYING, I've told my friends to put a piece of paper over the cover and write on it \\"What to live in fear of while you're pregnant!\\" The message in this book is that your Doctor and Hospital are in charge, and that a woman's body should be closely monitored to ensure that everything has not gone wrong. It's a crock that this is the best selling pregnancy book. This book gives no consideration to the emotional needs of a pregnant woman, does NOT help mentally prepare you for birth, and does NOT help you feel emotionally connected to your baby. It also makes breastfeeding sound extremely difficult unusual and painful! Read \\"Birthing from Within,\\" and \\"Ina Mae's Guide to Childbirth.\\" These books are far more helpful, and the message in these books is that giving birth is what your body is designed to do, and if allowed, will do flawlessly and beautifully (yes, even outside of a hospital). These books help build a bond between mother and baby, which makes it easier to sacrifice your comfort for the baby's well being. If I'd only read \\"What to Expect,\\" I never could've given birth to the beautiful and healthy baby boy that I now have. Ultimately, \\"What to Expect\\" perpetuates the current American fallacy that pregnancy is a pathological state. The Sears books are awesome parenting and birth books, too."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"In my case, the idea of pregnancy was a little scary at first, so I bought this book in order to be as well informed as I could... the results were: a whole week crying in desperation and fear that all those awful things could happen to me at once, and the urge to burn the book in the fireplace at the first opportunity.Another thing that gave me shivers was the authors' obsession with the nearly demonic effects of eating refined sugar. It seems that all problems in pregnancy are caused by sugar... It's amazing to think how millions of women throughout the decades have had so many kids and are still alive, in spite of their sinful sugar consumption.Luckily, I have understanding people around me who eased off my mind from the horrors of pregnancy. Now I am prepared to enjoy every stage of this awesome part of my life. With another book, of course."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I am a working mom - physician to be exact - with two healthy kids. Both my pregnancies occurred during the rigors of my training and proved to be full of challenges. I got this book as a gift during my first pregnancy. I read through sections of it and then threw it away.The good:The detail it gives about the development of your baby is very nice. You need this....however, you can get it elsewhere with less BADThe Bad:The diet section...really...these women are Nazi's. I agree that too many women \\"eat for two\\" which is inappropriate. You reallly should only gain up to 30 pounds. However, this book will make you think that if you eat a slice of pizza or buy non-organic food your child will be born with some horrible genetic deformity. I practically survived on cereal, pudding and sweets because it was the ONLY stuff I could keep down (hyperemesis). I didn't need to be made to feel guilty about it.The other listed \\"NO, NO's\\"...I went gray very early in life. Pregnancy made me sick...really sick...I felt tired, threw up all the time, needed IV fluids...I got my hair colored once during my pregnancy. This is a \\"MUST NOT DO\\" according to the book because you may absorb something toxic through your scalp. I assure you, I breathed more toxins walking around downtown than I ever did during that hair coloring.Working....While there is a section about working, the tone is \\"IF you absolutely MUST go back to work...(but you really won't want to and you shouldn't)....I love my job, I'm good at my job, I need my job...my husband and I work hard to limit nanny hours, spend free time playing with the kids...I will not abide by a book that attempts to make me feel like a bad person because I like my work.There are better books out there.

The authors are very condescending and make you feel bad at every page turn. I think that most of the information in the book is correct but they way that they deliver it is uncalled for. Who needs to be belittled and berated when pregnancy is supposed to be a happy time. Instead I would recommend:Pregnancy Childbirth and the Newborn : The Complete Guide By: Penny SimkinIt is much better written and enjoyable to read. It also helped quell my fears of labor and childbirth."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"Like others, I wish there was a no star rating. This book is TERRIBLE! When a former co-worker was pregnant, I saw her reading this book daily. So when my husband and I found out we were expecting, we went out and bought this book. What a waste of money!! My husband is a nurse, and found the just for dads chapter ridiculous, not to mention insane. I got so nervous about Labor and Delivery after reading this book I went out and bought 3 more books, just on L&D. I found the Sears' book, The Birth Book, to be the best guide. I wish I'd had their Pregnancy book, I'm sure I would have liked it much better. The diet that others mention in their reviews is completely insane and the authors make you feel like if you don't follow it, you'll have a child that has problems.(I didn't, I ate what I wanted, took my prenatal vitamin every day, and had a healthy 9lb+ baby.) Plus, if you're having a fairly normal typical pregancy, and you are a worrier, this book is awful- I worried for 8 months about all that could go wrong.(and all that happened was that I was slightly anemic and delivered one week early.) I would recommend that any new expecting woman go to the bookstore one evening, sit down in the pregnancy section(or get a selection of books and go sit down) and scan through the books. Find the one that seems to fit you the best and buy it. Or check them out of the library before buying. I wish I had. With my next one, I probably will. And I will never give this book to anyone who's expecting."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I got this book the day I found out I was pregnant. I *thought* it was THE book an expectant mother to buy. It really is a good resource for questions regarding basic biological changes during pregnancy. However, it made me feel like every breath I took I was one moment closer to a miscarriage.For example, soda pop. This book will tell you that soda has no place in your pregnancy - because it either has too much sugar, is diet (and *we all know* how *bad* diet drinks are, right?), or contains caffiene. The only thing I could drink while going through the roughest Morning Sickness was Dr. Pepper - everything else I threw-up. This book made me feel like I was going to kill my baby!Another example would be coffee - should I drink it? Yet again, it uses the scare tactic: \\"Well, you can drink some coffee, but the more you drink the more likely you are to miscarry.\\"So, if you can read between the lines in the book - you will do just fine!"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This is a great book, but you must remember that it is just a reference guide and should not be taken as gospel. Every woman and every pregnancy is different. Use it as a guide, it will help you through every step of your pregnancy, but don't get upset or scared if thing don't match up perfectly. I read every segment over and over again and drove myself nuts at first, but then I relaxed and enjoyed the pregnancy."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I have always had liked the book. I have been very surprized by the many poor reviews. I suggest this book but at the same time keep this in mind.I am the type of person that reads severl books at a time. I am also the type to remember that the books are a general reference NOT a pregancy bible. There was nothing in the book that scared me in the least bit. The weight gain part is a generalized rule of thumb not a strict rule. I never got the feeling that there was something wrong with me. All of my other books mention the weight gain with the same formula so it is not all that different. Yes, everyone is different and every pregancy is different. That is why I look at books as a general rule of thumb and if I really had a question that was an issue then I should be discussing with my doctor not a book. About the weight gain from this book as well as others I have come to the conclusion that the weight gain is for the average sized woman which I am not. But that did not faze me because to me everything in life refers to the average sized woman, I have learned at a young age that I have to adjust the info for the averaged sized woman and adjust it. I have one book that had the same quide lines as what to expecting for weight gain and it went on to say that if you are shorter/smaller than average then you may not have to gain as much and if you were taller than average then you may gain more.I recommend this book for those that want a generalized rule of thumb. I have found other books that are as good or better. Each book is suited for different personalities. I suggest going to the book store and begin reading the books at the store before you buy them.Remember that if it is really important then it should be discussed with your doctor not the book."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"After recently finding out that I was pregnant, I purchased this book as I figured it was the \\"bible of pregnancy\\". What I found instead was an outdated and superficial overview of pregnancy. On a basic level, the authors continually refer to one's husband, which I find so outdated in 2002 when one may have a same sex partner, or no partner at all. While this seemingly superficial complaint is obviously not a reason to buy the book, I do find that it encapsulates the sophomoric and provincial ways of the author. If I could return the book, I would have. Instead I put it out with the recycling."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"If you want to know what to expect if you are a sheep-like worrier who focuses on things that could go wrong rather than enjoying and understanding what is going right, and you like the idea of the biggest emotional and spiritual experience of your life boiled down to some fun 'n' handy bulleted lists about how other people will run your pregnancy and delivery, this book is for you!If, on the other hand, you believe (no, I mean REALLY believe, not just pay lip-service to) the idea that pregnancy and childbirth are not illnesses that need to be treated with neurotic concern, I recommend you look elsewhere--the Sears's books are a good start.The thing I found most important in pregnancy and young motherhood was listening to my own body and mind--basically the opposite of the WTEWYE emphasis on &quot;expert advice&quot; (in quotes because much of the info is not even backed by current research) and a long list of &quot;shoulds&quot; and &quot;musn'ts.&quot;This book, which is trying to be so warm and fuzzy, so 'reassuring'--is just a pat on your pretty li'l head when you are actually looking for solid information.good luck and don't panic!"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This is my first pregnancy and I bought this book after reading two other pregnancy books.

There's a reason it's been around for so long."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I found this book very helpful during my pregnancy.

While the overall layout leaves something to be desired (it appears monthly, but then other information is spread throughout), and the tone may be somewhat alarmist, I found that it gave me the general information that I needed. I knew almost nothing about what to expect and would rather be extra cautious my first pregnancy than to do a big no-no because of ignorance.I woudl recommend this book to someone who needs the general information, but also has enough common sense to adapt some of it's guidelines to their own lifestyle (for example, one soda is not a good drink choice in this book, but if you like soda and would feel comfortable drinking one every other day or even every day, making sure to intake enough water etc, then go ahead and do it!)."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This book is full of idiotic statements and scare tactics andthe majority of \\"information,\\" it seems, is about all the discomforts and illness you might have during what is supposed to be a very joyous time in your life.First of all, I'd like to say that I don't condone smoking during pregnancy, but the book tells us that if you smoke while pregnant your uterus becomes filled with smoke and causes your baby to cough. Uhm, exactly how deep would one have to inhale for the smoke to reach and fill the uterus? And, how can the baby cough when it doesn't even breathe until it first reaches the air outside thewomb? You'll get tons of tips like that...oh, and God forbid you eat something they don't allow and gain more than 25 lbs in your entire pregnancy! If that doesn't make you feel bad enough, it says that miscarriage in the second trimester is usually the fault of the mother. Isn't that nice? To me, the book is not much more than a sermon and as many others have said, it takes the mostnatural experience the world and makes it into a serious medical condition.

Not only is much of the information inaccurate the writing and organization are terrible, the author is condescending and pedantic. It's words and advice are geared toward making expectant moms feel frightened, stupid, and unable to make their own choices. It also offers tips that put the mother in danger . Avoid this book. Instead pick up A Good Birth, A Safe Birth. It is much better, very empowering, and provides more accurate information."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This book was my first purchase when I found out I was pregnant. I had to put the book away after the first few chapters due to the alarmist writing style of the three authors. Being pregnant for the first time can be intimidating enough. Now factor into the equation this book and you may just really freak about what lies ahead for you. The book tends to focus on the problems associated with pregnancy and what can go wrong as opposed to all that can go right. I believe a pregnant woman needs a lot of positive feedback during this wonderful time. The book just doesn't provide that. I would not recommend reading this book prior to getting pregnant as it just may work as the most effective method of birth control around today.There are a couple of helpful chapters such as the three stages of labor. But I think that one can find both an informative book combined with positive feedback from the author(s) elsewhere."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This was the first book on pregnancy I read when I was pregnant. The diet and nutrition section scared the Hell out of me! By the time I was done reading that section, I was terrified that eating a peanut butter or having a cup of coffee would result in my giving birth to Quasimodo.The information is mostly provided in a question and answer artcle format, that I personally found annoying and tracking down information was difficult.After reading this book, I felt scared and depressed, and very grateful I had checked the book out from the library instead of actually purchasing it. So back to the library I went in search of a better books on pregnancy, and discovered Dr. Sears Pregnancy Book. A much better source of information, with a more realistic view of diet and nutrition, and easier reading format."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"The mother-hating message that oozes through this text nullifies whatever decent information you could get from it. Yes, the book breaks down \\"what to expect\\" month by month. But a lot of good pregnancy books do the same. The other portion of the text is medical advice, most of which is in the vein on what you, The Evil Mother, can do to avoid all the selfish habits you have and stupid things you might do. Fantastic advice on pregnancy, such as going on a Nazi diet plan (you know, when you're vomiting your brains out and your gut is slowly quiting on you) with enforced meal times (\\"never, never skip a meal\\" - you might kill your fetus. Huh? About 50% of women spend 3-4 months or longer chucking up at least one meal a day.) and a required ton of vegetables, preferably raw (yeah, that will go down well).In the chapters on labor, the patronizing tone becomes something out of a 1950's manual: try timidly asking your doctor if you can avoid being shaved or having an enema during labor, with the understanding that he has the final say (really? I thought it was a woman's choice what treatment she had). The same holds true with having an IV, an episiotomy, a drink of water (contrary to what most people are told, the chances of aspirating and then dying under general anesthesia is about the same as winning Powerball), even touching your baby's head during crowning (\\"If your practioner approves\\"). How about this gem - advice to the labor coach that if the expectant mother requests pain medication, relay the information to the nurse, but ask her to wait a while to see if Mom changes her mind. By the time a woman requests pain meds, she's likely to have been in agony for some time. That appears not to be a factor. When the physician approves of pain medication (pain medication being necessarily good, because hospitals back the use of them), the Evil Mother must allow herself the pain relief while remembering \\"the innocent bystander\\", the baby she is imposing her selfish need for pain relief on.Seriously, the biggest qualms I have with this book is that it is misleading about a woman's rights to treatment and bodily integrity during pregnancy. For instance, the book advises \\"...you can't always make the decision over whether or not you should have an IV.\\" Um, yes you can. You simply say, \\"I refuse to have an IV and accept responsibility for that decision.\\" Eisenberg, Murkoff and Hathaway are apparently so desperate to get official approval from physicians and hospitals that they are making up their own laws! Other books have the same information, but without the condescending, mother-hating (even woman-hating) attitudes."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"You might like this book if you are not a thoughtful person. For me, the more I read it, the more I hated it. It is very condescending and fear mongering. Much of the advice they give seems to be trying to justify the choices they made in their pregnancies, and they are very judgmental of everything else (this is true of their later books on childrearing as well). They give worst case scenarios for everything and chastise pregnant women for normal activities (drinking herbal tea, eating anything with sugar in it, using an electric blanket, coloring their hair). Since most of their advice is just \\"the doctor knows best,\\" you might as well turn the whole pregnancy over to your doctor and not bother with the book. I wound up so exasperated with this book that I couldn't bear to give it to anyone I liked, so I took it to a used book store, figuring that someone who was already going to get it would buy it, and at least they wouldn't pay full-price.

After spending a few hours perusing this book's contents, your wife, girlfriend, whomever will become so overworked and paranoid that every little ache, pain, and irritation will become a sign of the baby being born with a forked tongue and three heads. The diet your partner will be instructed to keep is impossible for any human being alive to follow. She will be told to try and avoid ... damn near everything it seems like.I'll be blunt, WTEWYE seems to be an EXTREMELY popular gift for someone who's pregnant for the first time and it's probably unavoidable. I came into three copies without any effort at all. I'm not going to stand here and pretend I know of a better source for information either, because (outside of ... oh I don't know ... a doctor) I don't.

Your mission is to \\"lose it.\\" If you're already stuck with it and you can't hide it or burn it, at least do your best to temper its pages with as much perspective as you possibly can. Again, for a first-time mom-to-be, who, frankly, is probably a bit nervous anyway about all the changes her body is going through, all this volume is going to accomplish is completely freaking her out.Batten down the hatches and break out the antacid my friends, it's gonna be a long nine months."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I am happily pregnant with my third child after a 14 year hiatus after number two. My friends and family were quick to tell me that a lot has changed and recommended this book as \\"the bible\\" of pregnancy.As I read chapter by chapter I became more and more horrified that first time mothers actually believe the utter drivel contained in this book. Worse, they hold it as godspell. I don't think the authors intended harm but the recent upsurge in over-anxious, neurotic mothers must be directly attributable to this book.Whatever happened to trusting your own body? The diet plan is draconean and impossible for any normal pregnant women to follow. Carbs ARE good for you and your baby. After two c-sections I am looking forward to my third for a host of reasons - NO incontinence, great sex life, stiches in my stomach and not my \\"you know where\\" to name a few. Finally, I am not mentally unstable, irritable (excluding this review),absent minded or anxious. Emotionally I am excited, happy, content and focused on the life changes unfolding for my family. Why are these not listed each month?To be fair the book does present a plethora of physical symptoms and what could be real questions from readers. Most are handled professionally and reasonably.My point is this - pregnancy is about moderation and your natural instincts. Listen to them. Don't let all this over-cautious, politically correct \\"sky is falling\\" tone allow you to abandon your sense of \\"reasonableness\\". Billions of women have successfully raised happy, healthy children without this \\"bible\\". I recommend you do too."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"Here's what the one star is for: I liked tracking my baby's development month by month. It was nice to know what was growing, what was new, what she could do each month. Other than that, it was useless. The worst thing about this book is that it tells the reader that they cannot trust their own intuition but instead to take their physician's word as gospel. Instead of providing calm advice about things that might be going on of concern during a woman's pregnancy, it tells you to run to your doctor. The message this book sends it that everything is something to worry about and women shouldn't be trusted to know their bodies well enough to have an opinion. Ladies, DON'T READ THIS BOOK! Get Ina May's Guide to Childbirth for a far more realistic book that looks out for the woman rather than the medical industry."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"Every pregnancy is different, including how much weight a woman puts on. There are so many variables, and yet the authors of this book again and again generalize and imply that any woman who puts on more weight than THEY recommend has been sitting around snacking on bon-bons and watching television. What about a woman who is simply too sick to get out of bed with her pregnancy? I found myself increasingly frustrated and insulted by the constant, smug rehashing of this issue.My ob-gyn and perinatal care coordinator both pooh-poohed this one, too, specifically because of these broad generalizations."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"While this book is filled with information, it's mainly a list of things not to do when you are pregnant.

I'm not in the medical field and thought it would be helpful.I did like the beginning of each chapter of \\"what to expect this month\\". Other then that it didn't address much of anything that helped me. I found all the information I used online or from other women. I felt the information in this book was stuff you hear anyway from other women, or in your classes."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This is a good book for a new mother-to-be, but if you are a worrier, I would definitely not recommend this book. It gives a lot of useful information, but it also talks about what can go wrong in every stage of pregnancy with a lot of detail. If you want to know everything, what is happening when in your body or in your child's, then this is a good book for you.I think that the information in plain text format would have been better rather than using Question & Answer format.I used this book with my first pregnancy in 2002, but not with my second one in 2007. I worried a lot about complications during my first and I did not want to experience the same with the second."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This goes month by month through all the changes you will experience!

It even includes information about the first 6 weeks after your child is born and what to expect then. I read both this one and The Girlfriends Guide to Pregnancy, I highly recommend reading both!"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I bought this book when I started to finally feel my baby moving, I wanted to make sure everything was ok. I like this book when Im having a new symptom I've never had before and need a quick reference but it seems to focus on the negative sides of things more than the positive and at times seems to be scary! The book goes month by month also which I didn't like, Ide rather have a week by week reference but its nice to know what to expect for the month."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This book was pretty boring even though it had an abundant amount of information.

I've used them as references in my work as a Telephone Triage nurse for many years. I gifted our grandson and granddaughter with a set and this copy is a replacement for one I loaned but wasn't returned. Now that I'm a greatgramy, they are even more helpful in understanding, supporting and teaching. Life has changed a lot since mine were born...but pregnancy, babies and toddlers continue.

Everything else was pretty helpful, but a common pregnancy condition that can potentially be dangerous during labor and delivery should be covered in this book in my opinion. For everything else, this book has been like my bible. But very disappointed in the lack of info regarding group B strep. There is an enormous and detailed section on pregnancy ailments and complications and it seems to cover everything else. Very surprised and disappointed."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This book does an excellent job at scaring you to death! Even if you aren't already a little worried and are totally thrilled to be pregnant, this book will change your mind after reading a few chapters. One friend recently told me she was not feeling good about her and her husbands planned pregnancy because she was so freaked out something was going to happen to her baby, I asked her what she was reading and she said this book. I agree and had only read a few months of it before I put it aside several years ago, but not to early as to have fingered though it and found a chapter on dealing with the death of your baby. Being pregnant should be one of the most magical and wonderful times of your life, hormones and uncomfortableness put aside. You have enough to deal with, why be freaked out because some ad agency did a great job at selling a terrible book that everyone thinks you must have. On the flip side this book might be good for midwives or nurses to read for a general knowledge refresher, however lacks the detail needed to be a medical reference. I highly recommend having What to expect the First Year, it is an excellent reference for you once your baby is born. If someone gave you what to expect while expecting, please kindly tell them it was a mistake and they may have been misguided. As for if you already have the book and can't decide what to do with it, might I recommend... burring it, taking it to a shooting range, ripping it apart chapter by chapter (might be therapeutic), or even might I suggest burning it! Look for a book that briefly outlines how your baby is developing each week, one that does not tell you what can go wrong.Enjoy the little miracle that God created and is growing in your tummy.

I was given this book from a friend when i found out i was pregnant. I didn't have internet access and i was away from family and close friends at the time so i had no one to go for advice and to know a little more of what i should expect.

I kept telling my husband, \\"My God! Listen to what could happen to me,\\" and he kept responding, \\"Stop reading that book already!\\"If you are prone to worrying about your pregnancy, do not, I repeat, DO NOT buy this book! It will just get you worrying about symptoms and problems that you may never even experience. However, if you are the type who would only use this book as a reference & who would not read it cover to cover in order to have more things to worry about, it might be a good book for you.Overall, keep in mind that there are LOTS of other books about pregnancy that are informative while being less scary than What to Expect. There are also books that are more entertaining, more reassuring, more spiritual, etc. I would hardly call this particular book necessary when there are so many resources out there."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This book was not only scary to read, it took the joy and excitement and miracle out of having a baby. Yes, it has lot's of information, about things you'll most likely never need to know about (unless you read this book). I found it depressing and frightening."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"The book did cover a lot of ground right from nutrition to labor. Nothing was too detailed however.The main problem I had with this book was the way it was organized. The information was given in the form of questions and their relavent answers.These were then categorized into chapters based on which month the problem or whatever else will occur. So lets say you want to know about how much weight to gain, stretch marks or about pain in the pelvic region, where do you look? Month 1? Month 5? The result is you end up using the index extensively."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"Even though every mother-to-be will receive this book as soon as she announces she's pregnant, it's not the best book out there. It does cover a lot of good information, but it focuses entirely on the negatives of pregnancy. It does not include a week by week description, only month by month and the information is mostly contained in answers to common questions like, \\"I'm feeling... is this normal?\\" or \\"Should I be concerned about...?\\" I prefer pregnancy books that first explain what is going on- the good and the bad- and then have a section for common questions like You and Your Baby Pregnancy: your ultimate week by week by Dr. Laura Riley or The Mother of All Pregnancy Books by Ann Douglas."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"Being pregnant for the first time, I consulted this book for every little ache, pain or question I had during my pregnancy instead of just calling my doctor. I found that more often than not, I was misdiagnosing myself or overreacting to something very minor. This book is quite informative; however, a lot of the information can be misconstrued. I do not recommend this book for first time mothers - just ask your doctor - he/she knows best!"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I got this book because it was so hyped and I have to say there are far far better ones out there! It reads poorly and seems to be condescending and points out all that can go wrong with you pregnancy. I would stick with The Mother of All Pregnancy Books by Ann Douglas and Your Pregnancy Week by Week by Glade B. Curtis, Judith Schuler. I would buy What to Expect When You're Expecting only if I found it used or at a great sale price and use it only as a reference. Do not make it the only book you buy!"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"What to expect does have a lot of information regarding child and mother to be development, but there is also a lot of information in there which talks about the problems that can occur during pregnancy. While the risks and potential problems are important to be aware of, there is a way in which the risks and problems can be discussed realistically without causing fear. After getting anxious about all of the potential complications, I put the book down and only read the sections which didn't loosely or incompletely discuss what can go wrong during pregnancy."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I'm mid-way through my first pregnancy and this is the only book I have so far on the subject. At this point, there are a few things I'm already dissappointed about in it.-This book will make you so paranoid about everything, from a ridiculously stringent no processed sugar at all diet [ketchup is on the big NO NO list], to making you believe that just about everything you do will harm your baby including taking a shower. I have friends who go to different OB practices who do not recommend the book for this reason alone.-It doesn't cover the full scope of symptoms you could be having and I personally feel it downplays a few of them. So if you're like me and had some more extreme symptoms [like your breasts are not tender, they hurt to the point you want to cry], you're left worrying that something is wrong even though they really are normal symptoms.And lastly,-It doesn't really tell you *everything* you need to know which I recently found out. My Maternal Serum scan came back negative and I thought everything was fine until we had the u/s done and they found a potential problem. WTEWYE covers false positives and what can cause them, but it leaves out that you can also have false negatives and the problems it scans for can still exist. Considering the otherwise overly paranoid tone of the book, it was strange something as important as this was left out to leave room for the evils of sugar and white flour in your diet.The fetal development sections are great, the rest of the book, not so much and I'm sure there has to be a better book out there that doesn't worry about the small stuff."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I loves this book and found it very informative as a first time mom. I liked the question and answer style it was written in and found it easy to read. I was not scared by the truth of all the things that could possibly go wrong. You have to face those things eventually. It doesn't mean they are going to happen. With my next baby, I will probably get another book just because this one is just the basics that I already know now. Great, informative book!!"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I found this book and What To Expect The First Year to be very mixed. It is comprehensive about many aspects of pregnancy but the authors seem to be at a loss as to to what REALLY happens to women when they become mothers, especially to their relationships with their husbands and their work/life identities. The book is written in an \\"institutional\\" style, and has tons of information but little life to it. When I was pregnant, I vastly preferred The Girlfriend's Guide, because it was funny and true. After I had my baby, I devoured \\"How To Avoid The Mommy Trap\\" and still keep it at my bedside. My husband looks in it too. The Mommy Trap showed us why we fell into the roles we did (partly because we had a sanitized, rosy view of parenthood encouraged by What To Expect) and how to get out of them when we slip. What To Expect is a good start, but it's not enough. Modern motherhood is difficult. And funny."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"The book has been around for a while now. It does have a lot of good information. Many of the &quot;stars from Beverly Hills&quot; have bought it and said so on TV. The public realtion of the book has been pushed to the limits. Is it worth it? After giving birth to four children, I'd say it's worth reading. Don't take it too literally and don't listen to everything that is mentioned on food and diet. If you're already overweight, it will scare you and make you feel sad. If you've already lost and kept off weight it might make you mad. In my family we are all pretty small and my doctor said to ignore most of the &quot;food focused&quot; sections. Don't take it too personally. It might be tough to do. Don't beleive everything for it most likely won't happen to all of us. We're all very different. Keep this in mind and &quot;in check&quot; when reading. Take it to your OB/GYN for any questions..........he'll counsel you better for your individual situation. We're all different. As soon as you get a chance to catch your breath, I'd recommend another book my pediatrician told me and my husband about: Mommy-CEO (Constantly Evaluating Others) 5 Golden Rules, by Jodie Lynn. It's from birth to teens. Unlike this prengancy book, she will touch on topics on parenting for a wider spectrum of ages. Similar to this book she will have points to ponder on keeping yourself and your family healthy without leaving out dad. What is helpful about What to Expect is it gives a pretty good rounded idea of what could happen during your nine months. For first time moms I think it's not so bad. &quot;To your own self be true.&quot;"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"As with any guide, use only the sections that pertain to your situation. It was very informative to both of us. I have read the reviews here. Personally, I think being truly educated about something means that you know the good and bad side of things. This is a realistic approach and I can appreciate the wisdom in it. I don't want to be sheltered from facts and information because it is &quot;depressing&quot; or &quot;non-supportive&quot;. Come on. We miscarried three times before now. Couples who don't want to worry, and then breeze thru pregnancy, have no clue how lucky (blind?) they really are. Remember, birth is a miracle (or a series of many miracles, depending on how deep you want to think). For traditional OB/hospital-type pregnancies and parents, this is a very good read. For alternative methods, buy an alternative book. Any pregnancy book that claims to cover everything, doesn't. This book's diet in totality is EXTREME, but some parts of it are helpful as a tip/guide. I withhold one star for this reason."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I have to weigh in with the folks who said it was much too negative. I totally agree. I am in my 4th month of an easy pregnancy (knock wood) but in month one I was wondering if I had an eptopic pregnancy and kept looking to see if I was miscarrying. I get very tired of opening this book and seeing &quot;I'm very worried about...&quot; or &quot;Am I normal if I have...&quot; It gets old and depressing very fast. I am treating my pregnancy like a healthy, normal female activity and am enjoying it!"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I am a first-time mom and eagerly bought this book. I think it is way too basic, fear-mongering and just plain boring. My other major complaint is that she continually uses the word &quot;husband&quot; and &quot;father&quot;. Not all of us out there fit into these categories - other books out there talk about raising a child alone and/or use the word &quot;partner&quot;. This book is just awful."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"As a childbirth educator, I found that even though this book is well organized and is easy to read, it does not provide risks, side affects, and natural alternatives for many medical procedures presented. It encourages kind of a wait and see attitude in terms of preparing for labor and birth instead of really providing the information in a factual way so that women and think about and make the best informed decisions regarding procedures and meds. I found that to be quite irresponsible. I think this may be one of the reasons we have a 25% ceserean rate in the US."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I am currently 7 months pregnant and was given this book to me by an acquaintance. As I started reading it, I realized that the risks of epidurals and c-sections were non-existent. This book leaves women in the dark about the hazards and dangers of such things. This book has been in the mainstream for so long that it has lost the audience of scrutiny and proper proofreading. Is this book informative?? Sure if you're convinced and ready to have an all-medicated, non-natural birth. A good book?? NO!! It's outdated, un-educating, and leaves women with little choice to have the truth told to them. It's been belt-fed for so long we're not aware of what's really out there in regards to birthing choices and education.If you want a REAL book, read \\"Hey, Who's Having This Baby Anyways??\\" (author Breck Hawk). This book, is a woman's right to freedom and education over her birth, an INFORMED, subjective educational tool. Every woman should have Breck Hawk's book. Any book that has 18 pages of RISKS on epidurals (vs 1 page in \\"What to expect...) is a GOOD, EDUCATIONAL book.Leave \\"What to Expect When You're Expecting\\" on the shelf!! and buy Breck Hawk's book...you'll be better off!!!"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I agree with most of the negative reviews here--this book is extremely annoying and filled with many pieces of advice (such as the diet stuff) that are just plain nonsense from absolutely any viewpoint. I appreciated the month-by-month summaries at the head of each chapter, but that was about it. The tone is judgmental, sexist, paranoid and patronizing. In many cases the assumption is made that all women have a rather peculiar perspective on some issue (which I suppose is the authors' perspective). Then this same peculiar perspective drives ALL of the questions on an issue, to the exclusion of the fact that they are probably speaking to the actual experiences of very few women. For example, my baby was in a somewhat transverse lie with a large head and I (after 20 hrs of labor and 4 of pushing) eventually had a needed and much appreciated C-section: I was pleased as punch to have the baby out, both of us healthy and him immediately able to nurse. I now have two very lovely kids to show for my pregnancies. But the authors of this book assume that I automatically must be feeling like a failure as a woman for not having a vaginal birth, or that I will resent the baby or fail to bond with it because of which hole it came out. How bizarre and absurd. As many other people have noted, I received this book as a gift about the time I told folks my pregnancy test came up positive.I did actually read this whole book (I had to be off of my feet for part of pregnancy, so had some time on my hands after all) I have to say that, after the 7 or 8 references I found to knitting in place of all of the destructive things I MUST be wanting to do with my body, it started to seem like a big joke. And at about that point the insurance company sent the Mayo Clinic's Complete Book of Pregnancy--just the basics but still not as annoying as THIS book!Women, can we make a rule here and just stop giving this #$%! book to other people when they become pregnant?"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I'm probably breaking all kinds of professional ethics rules but here goes: What to Expect When You're Expecting is the Queen of the pregnancy books.I was surprised when I clicked over here to find so many totally negative 1-star reviews, so I read several of those to see why others wouldn't like this book.Here's what I found: For those who didn't like it, the information is too honest. Murkoff tells the truth about the fact that Mothers who take better care of themselves in terms of nutrition, exercise, smoking, alcohol, etc are more likely, statistically, to have a healthy pregnancy. It also mentions several of the rare disorders that can't be prevented, making the point that the expecting parents can do everything perfectly, along with their OB providers, and a bad outcome can still occur. To specifically NOT seek to become educated is a \\"head in the sand\\" approach to pregnancy. The truth is that most pregnancies that make it far enough to \\"show\\" are going to be \\"successful\\" anyway, but what harm is done in becoming educated?Education is never a bad thing. Knowing not only \\"what to expect\\" but especially \\"what to do\\" can actually help the mom to AVOID some of these bad things. For patients who are prone to irrational anxieties, I can see how this book may fuel the fire - but it's not the fault of the author.The book takes a quite comprehensive look at a broad field - Obstetrics - and breaks it down into plain language with little short sections on the various topics. The book should be a starting place - if something you read in the book scares you, the expectant parents should bring it up with their OB provider. Your obstetrician (or Family Physician or Midwife) should be able to answer your questions and perform the necessary tests or, if required, to refer you to a High Risk specialist - if you need it.Again - a little education is never a bad thing. Enjoy, and best wishes for your pregnancies!"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"Worst. Book. Ever. That's really all that needs to be said. Very preachy and makes you worry about everything. Try Sheila Kitzinger's Complete Book of Pregnancy and Childbirth, Ina May's Guide to Childbirth, Spiritual Midwifery by Ina May Gaskin, Gentle Birth Choices by Barbara Harper, or anything else with a positive upbeat tone. What to Expect When You're Expecting was recommended to me during my first pregnancy and it made me worry endlessly. It focuses on negativity and all of the things that could go wrong and speaks very little about the joys and natural wonder of pregnancy and childbirth. Thankfully at some point between my first and second pregnancies, the book got wet and grew mold so I threw it where it belonged all along - in the trash."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I read What To Expect (most of it) during my first pregnancy, and I subsequently sold it at a yard sale (both copies I had). Yes, there is a lot of good information in it, but it does come across making you feel like a bad mom if you don't do most of it's suggestions. Yes, they may be what's best for your baby, but I think what you need to take with you when you're done with this book is the general rule of trying to eat healthy when you can, don't smoke, don't chance it with alcohol even though most people say a glass of wine here and there is fine, and limit (you can have a little) caffeine (face it, with morning sickness, there are some things you just can't handle, and some of those things may be the healthiest things in the world). I did think it was pretty useful for info about what you definitely should avoid (although a little extreme). Also, it has good info about normal symptoms that you may experience (constipation, pains caused by your uterus stretching, etc.) that you don't normally know about in your first pregnancy. You just have to keep in mind that sometimes, a pain is just a pain and you shouldn't panic. Overall, OK, but you should always talk to your doctor about anything that concerns you."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"A useful book, it gave an overview of what to expect each month, and then went into more detail in some areas. The only thing I didn't like is that it was a little scary regarding some of the things that can go wrong! It is good to be informed, but the book didn't really give enough information (e.g. the likelihood of THIS happening is 1%, and that sort of thing). We made a somewhat panicky visit to the doctor because of it. As long as the reader is aware of this, then I'd recommend it."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I do absolutely reccommend this book. I found it very helpful.

More bang for my book buck was 10 Principles For Spiritual Parenting. It helped me decide how I wanted to &quot;be&quot; when my baby was born 4 months ago.....it's been such a great guide since. This book seemed to make me fearful rather than radiant."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I read &quot;What to Expect&quot; quite a bit in my first few months. It was a useful guide to answer questions between doctor's visits. However, I picked it up again recently, in my eighth month, and was astounded by how negative it sounded. Its focus on &quot;Concerns you may have&quot; really began to scare me, as it made me worry about things I hadn't thought to worry about! It is not helpful to dwell so much about what might theoretically, rarely go wrong. I also found that the Best Odds Diet was totally annoying and unrealistic. For a more positive, comprehensive book, try &quot;The Baby Book&quot; by Bill and Martha Sears."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"My OB actually GAVE me this book on my first visit. It's horrible. I never was quite sure how they divided up there months(which weeks were which months- every book does it differently). Plus, it didn't seem like they actually had information corresponding to the correct month in that particular chapter. Not to mention that it never talked about anything except what could go wrong. Oh, and the &quot;Best Odds Diet&quot;- are you kidding me! I AM NOT a bad mother just because I ate a candy bar or a piece of cake! This book was made me feel horrible about myself, and I was constantly worried. &quot;The Pregnancy Book&quot; by Sears was much more reassuring,uplifting, and answered many many more questions."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I'm not pregnant, nor even planning it any time soon. I am, however, a student researching childbirth. I have read this book, along with others, without the added anxiety of actually being pregnant at the time. I have to say that I find this book irritating, condescending and not very helpful.Although the authors do provide lots of helpful information about changes month-by-month, and so forth, isn't that what ANY worthwhile pregnancy guide should do?I find their tone objectionable--it is patronizing to women, overly deferent to the medical establishment and only seems to address problems in pregnancy, but not very thoroughly at that. Though not vitally important, I also find the format makes it difficult to read.I would recommend Sheila Kitzinger's &quot;Complete Book of Pregnancy and Childbirth&quot; over this one any day. She actually explains things to you, is not preachy about nutrition, provides both the pros and cons to every aspect and treats the reader like an intelligent capable human being!Kitzinger is realistic and sensitive. What to Expect makes me think of a corny 50s sitcom. Just because it has a clever title is no reason to buy this disappointing book."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"It's no wonder so many people are getting fed up with this book. I can't believe how obnoxious the authors can be at times. Here's a direct quote: &quot;Before you close your mouth on a forkful of food, consider: 'Is this the best bite I can give my baby?' If it will benefit your baby, chew away. If it'll only benefit your sweet tooth or appease your appetite, put your fork down.'&quot; Why is this book a bestseller?"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This book sells because of marketing. The RN authors want to ensure that the jobs of their sister RN's are easy, and that the job of their bosses, the OB's, are easy as well. Learn to be a good patient by reading this tripe. The format is awfully annoying and the information is given so slackly that it's no wonder that a reader of this book referred to birth being full of medical mystery. You sure aren't learning much of value here, I'm sad to say. The authors have the same thoughts that a reader of Sheila Kitzenger's &quot;Complete Book of Pregnancy and Childbirth&quot;- and that's that &quot;Ob's know what they're doing and we need to trust them.&quot; Yes, in the best world that is true, but like all professions, obstetrics have their protocols and they like to follow their comfort levels, not their patients. Pregnant and laboring women need to learn how to be comfortable and to get what they need. This book does little for that- I don't recall that they even mention doulas or other labor assistants.Get this book if you are willing to let someone else tell you what is right for you. Get &quot;the Complete Book of Pregnancy and Childbirth&quot; if you want to learn something."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"If you're in your first pregnancy and looking for a good reference guide, skip this book. This was one of several books we purchased and every time we'd look up some perfectly normal symptom during our first pregnancy, we'd get alarmed by its dire predictions of dead babies, brain damaged babies, \\"see your doctor IMMEDIATELY\\" warnings. If we didn't have other references, we'd be seriously stressed out about a perfectly normal, healthy first pregnancy. The information is generally accurate, if a bit over-reactive and designed to keep you on the phone with your doctor 24 hours a day. After the first couple of months, it was put on the bookshelf and never opened again.Save your money. We strongly preferred \\"The Pregnancy Book\\" by Dr. Sears. ISBN 0316779199. And all of the other books in that series after you have your healthy baby. Buy it on amazon and save yourself unneeded stress that accompanies any of the books in the \\"What to expect...\\" series."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"There are more than 1000 titles in Amazon under parenthood, and I feel this is the best-written, most helpful guide to the beginner parent. Every Mom and Dad will have a few key chapters they return to over and over, and large portions of the book they ignore. Here are two more books you can't live without--first, the funniest and most insightful book ever written about parenting, &quot;I SLEEP AT RED LIGHTS: A TRUE STORY OF LIFE AFTER TRIPLETS,&quot; by Bruce Stockler, a really amazing and unique book about how parenthood changes your life forever; and Operating Instructions, by Annie LaMott, the first and best-written of the parenting memoirs."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I don't know how on earth this book got its reputation as &quot;the place to go&quot; for pregnancy-related information. It preys on women's fears about pregnancy, using scare techniques to convince them not to question the outdated &quot;facts&quot; presented. The science is overly simplified, the &quot;best odds diet&quot; is exaggerated (apparently because the authors don't believe women will take all their advice, so some is better than none) and the answers to the hypothetical questions posed are guilt-mongering and almost uniformly worst-case-scenario.For example, the beginning of the book presents three personality types: she who puts blind and unquestioning faith in her doctor; she who wants to make informed decisions and take charge of the experience; and she who lets the doctor make all the big decisions while leaving the smaller ones to her. There's nothing wrong with the second type. But the authors manage to imply that any woman who dares question a doctor's wisdom is misguided at best, self-destructive at worst. This is so wrong! Today's health care consumer needs to educate herself and make up her own mind instead of blindly relying on one person for all her information.Unfortunately, this patronizing, condescending tone dominates the book. I got so sick of feeling like the authors were patting me on the head and saying, &quot;Oh, don't worry your pretty little head. Just put all your faith in your doctor; he'll take care of you.&quot; This is NOT what today's informed consumers need to hear.If you're looking for a *real* book of information on pregnancy, I recommend Dr. Sears' &quot;The Pregnancy Book.&quot; His information is much more factual, and he treats women like human beings with brains instead of talking down to them."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This is one of the few books I've ever read that made me want to throw it across the room. If you are pregnant and looking to be both patronized and terrified, this is the book for you. The &quot;Best Odds&quot; diet is the most absurd: be prepared to feel guilty if you don't follow it, or to gain 50 lbs. if you do."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This is my first pregnancy, so I went out and bought this book right away, having heard it was so great. After having read it, I think that it has its good parts and its parts that are not so good. One thing that I really did not like was the so-called \\"Best Odds Diet\\" that is featured in the first few chapters. How in God's name is anyone supposed to eat THAT much food in one day--not to mention the fact that most of the food listed was enough to make me want to puke just thinking about it (molasses?? lentils?? Gag me!!) Who are these authors to tell me what to put in my mouth and make me feel like I'm \\"harming\\" my baby if I don't follow this granola/earth mother diet to the tee?? Another thing that I did not like was the fact that it doesn't really show you any realistic pictures of what the developing baby looks like. I really wanted to know that! The pictures are crudely drawn and more of an afterthought than anything else. The thing that bothered me the most was how the book suggested in one part that if you are feeling queasy and having morning sickness that perhaps you are just stressed out and worred about becoming a mother!!!!! How downright patroninzing!!!! I had to check to see if this book was REALLY written by a woman when I read that! Other sources that I've read have linked nausea to elevated HCG and hormone levels in your body--which makes a heckuva lot more sense!!! Ugh!!! It just goes to show how little some people really know about a woman's body and being pregnant.Some of the question and answer type parts of the book were informative and I did glean some basic information from the book. But basic is the key word here. Go find some other books if you want to completely educate yourself on pregnancy and childbirth. This one is just for the occasional reference, and that's it."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This book didn't have the information I was looking for. I wanted to know more about what was going on with the baby develpmentally. I wanted specific information about teratogens, not just advice to avoid all drugs. I had a very difficult pregnancy--seven months of nausea--and the frequent admonitions of the author about diet were just too much. The tone and repetition of the book made it seem like it was written for a slow child. Looking for a great book that respects the intelligence of the reader? Get 1000 Questions About Your Pregnancy by Jeffrey Thurston."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"It is entirely beyond me how this book has become a classic. We were out with several other expectant couples the other night when this volume came up during our (no surprise here) book-and-baby-oriented discussion.In short, our collective reading seems to be that this book seem to 1) pander to your basest fears and anxieties; 2) assumes that the reader is gushingly thinking about baby all of the time; and 3) society is stuck somewhere in the 1950s in terms of relationships and marriage. We all just wanted sound advice and science, not fear mongering, emotional mush, or strange relationship advice."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I bought this book because it is one of the best selling pregnancy books in the nation. Unfortunately I didn't read a sample passage before purchasing. I was sorely disappointed with the content and writing style (and later my RN and other pregnant women told me they had made the same mistake and disliked the book too). This book gives a long list of potential symptoms a pregnant woman can feel during each month of pregnancy. It does not address the emotional aspect of pregnancy (just some bullet points on what you may be feeling). We have since read other books that we enjoyed much more. My husband is enjoying \\"Mack Daddy: Mastering Fatherhood Without Losing Your Style, Your Cool, or Your Mind\\" by Larry Bleidner. While I'm enjoying \\"A Girlfriend's Guide to Pregnancy by Vicki Iovine.\\" And together we are reading \\"The Baby Book\\" by William and Martha Sears -- a book that focuses on parenthood (i.e. what to do after the baby comes)."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"Many people consider this book to be a staple for pregnant women and partners. Why?? Ladies, have you met a nurse who talked to you as if you were ignorant and condescended to you with every sentence? Those kind of nurses wrote this book. They write their book as if should be the Bible of pregnancy, and women who disagree are idiots. Let's not forget their obsession with keeping to a perfect diet. After reading this book you may fear an occasional cookie will leave your child with birth defects. They frequently overstate the harm of various activities, and treat the reader as if she were unable to do her own research or read other books. They also frequently insult the overweight mother, and reading the book as one I was left infuriated. I practically wanted to burn the book. If you're not an example of nurse's ideal physical perfection (overweight, underweight, underexcercising, bad eating habits, diabetic, asthmatic etc) prepare to be made to feel like crap for having the gall to get pregnant in the first place. How dare we? Not only does the book manage to do all this, but it manages to read as if you're being told this golden information from a greater being on high who has deigned to speak with us lowly types, and plainly has a better grasp on everything than we do. Personally I prefer a book with balanced views, that backs up it's conclusions with hard evidence, and speaks to me as if I were an equal. As far as pregnancy books in general go, I recommend Kitzlinger's Book of Pregnancy and Childbirth, which has a pleasant writing style and tasteful photos of birth itself. Overall though I would say that investigating your condition via the internet will give you all those things you want from a book and give you a better chance to find what you want when you want it."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I got this book when I first found out I was pregnant. Overall, it's a good book &amp; worth having, but it's a little heavy on the absolutes. For instance, it says that a woman who selects peanut butter over tuna fish as a source of protein is doing her unborn child a disservice, because tuna has more protein &amp; less fat per ounce. Well, when I read that, I was eating peanut butter &amp; not tuna because I was dealing with morning sickness &amp; the mere thought of tuna made me physically ill. But having someone tell me- albeit in print- that I was not making wise choices for my child made me feel very guilty. I really could have done without that. That's just one example.Overall, I'm glad that I have the book, but it didn't have to be so heavy-handed about what you eat. There's good info about the growth of the child, what's going on month-by-month, &amp; I'm very glad I have it. Just take it with a grain of salt."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"To be honest, the best use of this book I've found is propping up the car seat base to get the best angle. Other than that, it's worthless unless you actually enjoy being patronized for being a woman and pregnant. I read this book cover to cover several times to figure out what my problem was with its tone. It finally hit me that though the book is written supposedly for women, the authors address the fathers to be as if they are the reasonable, rational, more informed, and more powerful half of the partnership. Women are treated as if we inherently are out to ruin our fetuses through irresponsible behaviour and that we can't possibly have a healthy pregnancy on our own. Bah, whatever. My midwife told me to chuck this book and find anything else. I didn't even find the summaries of what was supposed to be happening in a particular month all that helpful. I too went to the library and found much better books. Read it if you want to know how the world at large will treat you when you're pregnant, but by all means, read something else for pregnancy information."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I am greatly relieved to find that others found WTEWYE as awful as my entire birth group and I did. When the subject of what pregnancy books people were reading was raised, each woman present had either borrowed or had been given WTEWYE and had completely detested it: the condescending tone, the stuffy, doctor-centered attitude, the fascination with medical technology, the fear-based anecdotes and time-consuming, energy-sapping, unnecessary recommendations and advice. I gave this book one star only because the form required me to fill in the field, and I do so under protest.Luckily, there are many other interesting books on the market. Among my favorites for bringing up baby are the books by Penelope Leach. Her writing and attitude is loving and sensible and reassuring to first time parents who need to learn to trust themselves and to take the time to fall in love with their kids."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"If you are ultra paranoid, this is the book to buy. If you want a relaxed, healthy, worry-free pregnancy, avoid this book like the plague. This book does not discuss pregnancy in general, it does not prepare you for birth, it does not prepare you for motherhood, and it certainly does not discuss the mental and spiritual side of being pregnant, it only focuses on the medical stuff.It is basically a guide to all possible pregnancy symptoms and complications and it does not even illustrate in detail what to do to avoid complications. It only tells you what is normal and what is not. Mostly it focuses on telling you what is normal to experience in various stages of pregnancy. Everything in this book is something your doctor or midwife will explain to you, in more detail than this book does."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"If you plan on being nerotic and scared out of your mind your whole pregnancy then this is the book for you! I cringe when a mom to be tells me they are or have read this book. There are a dozen or so other books out there that are more beneficial to a mom/parents to be to read ( Anything by Aviva Romm). If you wind up with a copy use it for kindling."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I will admit that I agree with other reviewers in the fact that this book tells a few too many worse case situations. And it caused me to worry (and also bother my husband) slightly more than nessecary during our pregnancy. But during my 7th month of pregnancy I developed preeclampsia and HELLP syndrome, which is a problem with high blood pressure, platelet counts and liver enzymes. This can be VERY serious to both mom and baby if not caught in time. After noticing a few of the symptoms I used this book to look them up and read that I may have preeclampsia. So I imediately went to the doctor and ended up having a emergency c-section 3 days later because my liver was about to shut down. I had a 3 lb 5 oz baby at 30 weeks gestation. We are both doing well but I hate to think of what might've happened if we hadn't caught the problem when we did.So maybe all the worse case situations are there for good reason-to warn people of serious, life threatening problems and give them early warning signs to watch for.Note to husbands-NEVER criticize your wife for worrying too much during the pregnancy. She knows more about her body and this pregnancy than you!"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I found this book offensive. It seemed to be almost entirely devoted to diet and how NOT TO GET FAT DURING PREGNANCY. Oh please, make the preaching stop. I finally had to put it down. I can't recommend it. The other information in the book is given in Q &amp; A form which I found unhelpful. If you happen to have the same question or a similar concern as someone who contributed to the book has then you'll get an answer. But you have to wade through the muck to get there.I give it a big thumbs down."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"Women (and their doctors) love this book because it reassures them that the highly complicated and dangerous business of \\"delivering\\" babies is best managed in a hospital with specialized care of an OB, whose training is to discover and fix serious problems. This view has been statistically shown to be false in other countries where hospitalized, medicated, managed birth is not the norm. Of course there is a need for OB/GYNs, Cesarean surgery, medication, intervention, WHEN JUDICIOUSLY USED. When routinely or inappropriately used, these things INCREASE risk for both mom and baby, and this fact is sorrowfully ignored in this country, as well as by this book.My concern about this book is not a matter of wanting to \\"sugar-coat\\" or not wanting to hear the bad stuff that occasionally happens in pregnancy, just as in any other aspect of life. My concern is that it's not looking at the normal, simple, uncomplicated process of having a baby as just that; rather it views it as an accident waiting to happen. This book is like discussing the process of breathing in the context of lung cancer. Of course things can happen, but in labor, most often that is due to the intervention into a process that TYPICALLY works best left alone. And when intervention or medication is needed, there are ways to do it more safely and with the full educated knowledge and understanding of the parents.So much is lacking in this book. There is no discussion of the baby's position and its effect on labor, which is highly managed by Cesarean surgery. There is no discussion of fear and its affect on labor, or how to face and acknowledge it beforehand. And the glorification of calm, controlled Cesarean surgery versus out-of-control, painful, un-enjoyable vaginal birth is appalling and irresponsible.You may not see the problems with this book until you see the other perspective so wonderfully presented in books like Birthing From Within by Pam England, or The Thinking Woman's Guide by Henci Goer, or anything by Sheila Kitzinger. I'm not saying all-natural, non-medicated, home birth is the only way to go. Every labor, woman and baby is different. But your choices DO affect your labor and birth outcome. It is your responsibility to educate yourself - do NOT rely on any one caregiver, friend, author, relative. Seek out ALL of your options.This book probably presents a pretty good honest look into typical hospital birth in America. Unfortunately, this seriously limits women and reduces birth to a controlled \\"condition\\" that is to be survived and gotten over with. The fact that this is the best selling pregnancy book illustrates that we will probably never as a culture fully realize the impact of this."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I personally have gone through some tough pregnancies and i have to say this book helped me soooo much. I dont think this book is intended to scare anyone, its actually intended for everyone. Though most pregnancies may be normal, a lot aren't, so its great that anyone can use it depending on what you are going through. True you may not experience alot of the things in this book, but its intended for all types of pregnancies, not just normal ones. Its really nice to know that you can find any type of information in this book, especially for me since i am a high risk pregnancy. I recommend it for everyone wether its your first or fifth pregnancy!"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I read this book as soon as I found out I was pregnant, and was sure that every little thing was something going drastically wrong. I tried to follow their diet plan, but it was impossible, plus making sure I got all the things that were just CRITICAL to baby's healthy development - I gained 11 pounds the first month!

My doctor highly recomended this book so I added it to my collection and I hate this book. Even though it does have a lot of good information it is very condescending.

The text is appropriate, the content addresses \\"everything\\" a new pregnant woman should know.

She's not pregnant, but I thought this book (presented at a celebratory gathering of twenty or so close friends and too-close family) might just be the subtle tip she needs to start shedding those pounds she put on about 4 years ago when she was pregnant. I lovingly inscribed it to &quot;Beautifully BIG Bessie: When are the quintuplets due? Try Exercise. Love, Hops.&quot; A worthy attempt, but yet another failure."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This is a useful and detailed book that follows pregnancy and the changes in a woman's body and psyche during the nine months. It is particularly useful for women who are pregnant for the first time but I did consult it also during my second pregnancy to recall what I should expect each month. the only flaw of the book is that it can be too detailed about symptoms of pregnancy that are quite rare and that can make an expecting mother worry: will this happen to me? why do I not experience this or that symptom? the book tries to show that all the symptoms are natural and can be dealt with but in this effort it may become a touch too heavy for new mothers-to-be. Nonetheless not only did I read it thoroughly but I also gave it as a present to several friends who were expecting because I thought it helps and it can be read by fathers too!!"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"When I was not pregnant I thought of this as THE book for pregnant women. Once I got pregnant I realized that it left a lot of holes in the story, had a weird flow to it, and really only made two or three points over and over and over and over.If you're looking for a gift for your baby-crazy friend who won't be having kids anytime really soon but still wants to dream, get this. If you want something for your pregnant friend, don't waste your money.There are a million other books with actual information, organized in a logical manner, and displayed in a slightly less \\"friend-y\\" way. Please, go for them first and if you still feel like you need this one after reading a real reference (perhaps written by medical professionals) go ahead and buy this. But don't pay full price, I beg you."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"What can I say? For the first time mom, it is a must-have, and a good refresher for those second and third timers too. The end chapters were a little scary to me as a newly pregnant lady. I think every new mom worries that something will go wrong with her pregnancy. Helpful but talk to your OB before you truly freak out."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I decided to read some other reviews on this book and then throw my own thoughts into the fray. Of the 3 pregnancy books I had the other 2 being (\\"Girlfriend's Guide\\" and \\"Your Pregnancy Week by Week\\") I found this one the most useful. I really got a lot out of it. It prevented me from calling the doctor's office with a lot of idiot questions because when stuff happened I could look it up, understand it, and know what to do about it.When I read books, I tend to take the approach of \\"take what works for you and leave the rest.\\" I threw out the conventional wisdom section on diet. I am an Atkins evangelist and tend to believe that refined sugar is a greater evil in today's diets than fat.I did not find the book overly scary as others have commented on. I was glad to hear what can go wrong, what the symptoms are, and what happens. I frown on the \\"ignorance is bliss\\" approach to pregnancy. But then I am the one who watched all the Discovery Health Channel shows on difficult pregnancies and deliveries just so I would be \\"mentally prepared\\" for any eventuality. Yea, scary stuff scares me, but life can be scary sometimes, you've got to deal with it. Better to embrace fear and work through it then run away from it.I understand the Attachment Parenting community's concerns about the book. I've attended a few LLLI meetings, read a number of articles on the Sears family website. Sears can be alarmist too, like saying my child will have social aggression issues because I weaned her rather than letting her nurse until she quit on her own. I read a Bradley book on natural childbirth, but ended up chickening out due to painful back labor (I probaby could have used a good doula too). I agree that modern childbirth is probably still overly medically managed, but I found this book a good starting point for a person who like myself had no biases coming into my first pregnancy and no bad experiences my prior pregnancies and deliveries to react to. I will note that based on the information I read both from LLLI and the Sears website that our family does as much Attachment Parenting as we feel we can and use common sense for the rest.I used this book as a starting point, and then jumped off to other books and topics as my interest led me. I recommend you do the same."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"When I was pregnant in 1990, I had no family near me and no friends who were pregnant or had kids. Also, there was no Internet. As a result, this book was like my stand-in mother and I am forever grateful for it. I still recommend it to all pregnant women, although the edition I had is likely an earlier edition than the current one. I just felt prompted to write this review to counterbalance some of the negative comments by other reviewers -- although we are all certainly entitled to our individual opinions, I wanted to share how meaningful and relevant this book was for me as a clueless and very young expectant mother."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I was insisted on reading this book as an expectant first time mom, even though my friends who already had kids warned me not to...They said I would be scared by it...they were right.There is very good information in this book, but it is mixed with a healthy dose of worst case scenarios and I can assure you that I was not the only pregnant woman who thought her unborn child had a disease that affects less than 1% of all children born in the world!My doctor told me to \\"put the book away\\". I recommend if you MUST read this book (and you will) make sure to discuss any worries it brings up with you to your doctor ASAP! Don't let yourself get stressed.Just try to look for the valuable information in the middle of the scary stuff!"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I purchased this book for my sister when she was pregnant three years ago. It has a lot of good information in it and I wouldn't completely discount it.However, I have purchased The Mayo Clinic Guide to A Healthy Pregnancy in addition to this book for myself and I must say that it is more thorough, scientifically based, and better organized. I like its \\"just the facts\\" approach and tone better than this book, and I think the information in the Mayo Clinic Guide is better-organized.What to Expect is a great resource, but I wouldn't recommend that it be relied on as a primary reference to pregnancy. There is simply better stuff out there nowadays!"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I've read several pregnancy books, and while this one had a lot of good information, it was never a book I wanted to sit and read cover-to-cover. It was a book I went to if I had a specific question about something. Even with that, it would sort of answer my questions, but the answers would leave me unsatisfied and wanting more. I'm really not sure why this is considered to be the be-all and end-all of pregnancy books. Think of it as a good reference book to have, like a dictionary. But if you want a book about your pregnancy that's both informative AND fun to read, capturing the excitement, anticipation, confusion, and fear that goes hand-in-hand with being pregnant - look elsewhere."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"The day we found out i was pregnant, we ran out to get this....i am a first time mother and this book helped out alot...it put me at ease with simple worries.

It was full of useful information that helped me along the way. However I did not like the question and answer format. I didnt like the way she addressed the information. She used questions that people asked and then answered them as she felt fit. I would have rather read a book that gives you useful information not based on other peoples questions about there pregnancy. I did not enjoy reading other peoples questions and reading the information based on that question. I would not recommend this book nor would I buy her what to expect the first year. There are many other books I read and enjoyed more than this one."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I just don't understand the appeal of this book. Everyone who knows I'm pregnant told me I had to rush out and buy it, so I did. What a mistake. I've since found other books that have far more information and that are a whole lot less preachy--like The Pregnancy Book by the Sears, The Unofficial Guide to Having A Baby by John Sussman, and Pregnancy, Conception, and Birth by Dr Miriam Stoppard. It's a good thing that everyone thinks they're supposed to have this book or the authors would be in trouble. No one would buy it on its own merits. If and when the authors revise the book, they might think of scrapping the chapter on diet altogether. It's just plain insulting."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This book was awful. Condescending and patronizing, even the cover left me cold. It implies pregnancy is supposed to be a time of waiting around in a rocking chair. Throw this book out."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"&quot;What to Expect...&quot; obsesses on diet, blames the expectant parent for what might go wrong, and expects sainthood on the part of expected moms.A few examples: When discussing over-the-counter and prescription drugs, they entitle the section &quot;playing baby roulette&quot; as though you are pointing a gun at the baby with a bullet in one chamber if you take a pill. In other places, too, they imply that NO drugs should be taken during pregnancy. They make a woman who takes a tylenol for a killer pregnancy headache feel like she is endangering her baby's life, which almost any doctor will tell you is ridiculous. There are quite a few drugs that are safe in pregnancy and we should not be made to feel guilty for taking them.On diet, naming it the &quot;best odds&quot; diet implies again that you are risking your baby's life if you dare to indulge in anything other than whole grains, raw vegies, etc. Under &quot;cheating&quot; they say: &quot;once a week! give in to something that is not quite perfect but not totally terrible: a bagel,... &quot; I should feel guilty for eating a bagel? Later, they state that frequent servings of white pasta, white rice, or white bread will diminish the odds in your Best-Odds Diet, again, as though you are putting your child at risk.At the same time, they omit warnings about unpasturized cheeses (brie and blue cheese, for example), that can pose a very real risk to the fetus.On backache (and a lot of other things), an often inevitable side-effect of pregnancy, they tend to blame the mother--for not being physically fit before pregnancy, for poor posture, and for (AGAIN) eating too much.On medical information, I found it weak, with little data on the baby's development over time, and little or hard-to-find information about things like relaxin, a hormone that loosens your joints (sometimes making them sore and causing &quot;the pregnancy waddle&quot;) during pregnancy.Finally, the! re is some just nutty stuff, like the statement that a cert! ain form of sexual relations can cause an air embolism which might prove deadly to mother and baby.I cannot fathom why this book is so popular ..."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This book can deeply damage the most wonderful experience of a lifetime. It is written with no thought to empowering woman at this important time but instead is directed to the pregnant woman who views her condition as an illness to be cured by doctors. The section on diet suggests you have all day to run around preparing the perfect healthy meal. If you are a working mother, much of the advice will cause anxiety because you can't follow it (i.e. take several days off to recover from jetlag). The content of this book will make pregnancy seem like the most devastating moment of your life. Throw it away and buy anything by Dr. and Martha Sears instead. They assume pregnant woman are capable healthy adults and natural mothers."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"As a student studying child development under a multitude of child developmentalists, this book is a one word joke. Not one of my professors respect this book, as it is ancient, written for mothers from the 1960's. After during a presentation on this book last semester, we got into a detailed discussion on the limited choices this fear mongering books offers. Do yourself a favor, save yourself from the extra stress (very bad for a baby) and do some more research. Don't reach for the old standby."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This book drove me nuts. It is one huge condescending guilt trip. You are smart enough to know that you need to eat well and take care of yourself.I followed the diet, ended up with gestational diabetes at 11 weeks, and spent the next two years losing the water I gained from the ill-advised diet. The diet did not give me diabetes. But there should be more discussion and forgiveness of other health factors that may alter the diet and other recommendations. My doctor put me on a diet very different from this book's recommended diet, and I felt like I was cheating my child because I could not eat the \\"perfect\\" diet.I strongly recommend Vicki Iovine's The Girlfriends' Guide to Pregnancy."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This is the WORST book out there on childbirth. I bought this book with my first baby as it was highly recommended to me by my OB, and no wonder?! It teaches you how to be a completely passive patient with little or no information on side effects of medications and procedures done in the hospital. Don't waste your money, do an internet search on what you want to find out. I would recommend instead The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth. The only plus side to this book is how it tells you month by month what your baby looks like, but again you can find that on the internet. This book makes you a good patient for the OB and not an active informed birther. Women do not NEED episiotomies, IVs, External Fetal Monitors, Epidurals etc. like this book makes it seem to birth safely. Please don't waste your money on this. Inform and empower yourself, be strong enough to be a bad patient and instead an awesome mom and terrific birther!!!"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"Take a look at the coverart and you'll get an accurate feel for the book. The woman looks completely miserable and worried. Exactly how you'll feel when your through reading the book. The condescending attitude of the author and anxiety-producing information in the book is enough to make any mother-to-be feel like she is an inadequate \\"little woman\\". Also, the cover art is so outdated...looks like all pregnant women should look frumpy and wear clothes from 20 years ago. The message -- you are not strong and confident. And forget sexy. The quilted background and rocking chair top it all off. Pregnant women, stay home and sew, but only after you are done cooking and cleaning for your \\"husband.\\" If you don't have a \\"husband\\", for shame! The cover art of the book is a big clue that the book is outdated and better suited to the 1980s.Don't waste your money."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This is a terrible book. My informal survey of friends shows that women scientists and engineers tend to hate this book. It's wordy, it's filled with obvious common sense suggestions, and it lacks precise information. This book insulted my intelligence and wasted my time."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"When I got pregnant, people gave me this book as the \\"bible\\" of pregnancy. Both me and my husband read through parts of it, and neither of us liked it. I couldn't make myself read through all of it, because it makes pregnancy and birthing sound like a hazardous journey of everything that can and will go wrong. There's very little of the book that focuses on the things that go right, and the positive aspects of pregnancy and birthing. If this had been the only book I read, I'd be spending my entire pregnancy living in worry and fear."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This is the best guide ever when you are pregnant, specially for the first time. It will save you to call the doctor and friends when you have any questions because they are all answered in this fantastic book. It is a must when you are expectiong."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I was a naive 19 year old when I was pregnant with my first child and this book was my bible. I would look up every question I had because I didn't have the best OB doc. That was before the internet was as popular. Now I can type entire phrases on a search engine and find at least one other pregnant person going through the same thing. I don't know if that is a good thing because the information is sometimes inaccurate. I am in the early trimester of my second pregnancy and I find that this book is just as helpful now as it 9 years ago. This book has clear concise information. I remember how reassuring it was then and it still is. Many people feel that this book tries to scare you but pregnancy is not something to be taken lightly. I like having a book that I can turn to whenever I have a questions. Just because something I am experiencing is not in the month that I am in doesn't mean it's not helpful! All I have to do is search in the index. Maybe some people do not want to acknowledge that things can go wrong in a pregnancy but I am realistic. This book speaks in a frank voice and I am glad to have it again."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This book is great. Reading is informative, but also calms your nerves. If you tend to worry about things, get this book because it will really put your worrys at rest. I also recommend the SNOOGLE pillow......if you are pregnant and trying NOT to sleep on your stomach this pillow is a must."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"We were amazed by the amount of information this book brought us. Really informative, lots of times made me really confident about my feelings being alright and not to bug my ob/gyn so much!Highly recommended to any mom-to-be. In fact, that's the first gift we give our friends who find out they are expecting!"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I read this book early in my pregnancy with triplets. The information contained within it is invaluable to those who have a multiple gestation pregnancy. The diet outlined by Dr. Luke enabled me to go to 35 weeks and deliver healthy triplets, whose combined weight broke the local hospital record. I followed the diet, which upon first review seemed to be a lot to eat and much different than my regular low-fat diet. However, as my pregnancy progressed and I got updates on the weights of my babies, I knew Dr. Luke knew what she was talking about. Her wealth of knowledge and experience working with pregnant mothers is impressive, and her research record speaks for itself. My ob/gyn at first balked at my weight gain ( a total of 75 pounds), but I soon learned that he had not dealt with too many triplet mothers and certainly did not publish research as Dr. Luke did. She \\"promises\\" that if you follow her diet and suggestions, you will go two weeks longer in your pregnancy and lower the chances of having your babies go to NICU. Both were true in my case. I scheduled a C-section at 35 weeks and my babies never went to the NICU or nursery. We all left the hospital three days later. In addition, Dr. Luke is available through her website for consultations, which are well worth the time and money. Anyone who finds themselves pregnant with multiples, MUST follow her advice. While at the hospital, the nurses were so impressed with my babies weights, they said, \\"You should write a book\\". My response was, \\"It is already written!!!\\""},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"what can i say this is bible for pregnant women. we would be lost without it. there is not a pregnancy book out there that even comes close to this one. the whole series. every question that i had in my pregnancy was answered and then some in this book. there is not a pregnancy book out there that talks about inverted nipples adn breast feeding. this one does. it let me know that it is possible. what a god send. this book has also saved my life and my babys life.. with the things i learned in the book, i could tell that something was wrong, and got the the hospital asap. without the book, i would have just thought it was gas or soething and not even gave it a second thought. thank you so much to the authors for being my best friends and holding my hands through my pregnancy!

I AM IN MY SECOND PREGNANCY AND STILL LOOK BACK ON THE BOOK TO ANSWER QUESTIONS THAT I MAY HAVE. IT DOES NOT GO INTO MUCH DETAIL ABOUT THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE FETUS, BUT MAINLY TALKS ABOUT HOW YOU ARE FEELING DURING PREGNANCY AND ANSWERS EVERY POSSIBLE MEDICAL QUESTION YOU MAY HAVE ABOUT PREGNANCY AND DELIVERY. MY DOCTORS OFFICE GAVE OUT LITTLE FREE BOOKS THAT GO OVER THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE FETUS SO THAT DRAWBACK IN THE BOOK DID NOT DISAPPOINT ME AT ALL."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I am very surprised at all the negative reviews. I bought this book and used read it almost every day with both of my pregnancies and I buy it for all my friends when I find out they are expecting.

I highly recommend this book to anyone expecting!"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"It just helps to have the book and any time I think of a concern- I look it up and I feel so much better.

All the information can be found elsewhere in a much more user-friendly format. I also agree with others that the tone it takes makes one feel inadequate and a failure. I don't think I've ever had such a viseral reaction to a book before...then again...I've never been pregnant before."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"Good only if you're more interested in getting your figure back after the birth than in actually enjoying your pregnancy and then loving your baby."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I am expecting my first baby at the age of 43. Well-meaning friends insisted from the beginning that I MUST have &quot;What To Expect&quot;--&quot;It's the Bible.&quot; &quot;It answers all your questions.&quot; Even my doctor's office gives out copies.I have found the book less than helpful. I want to know much more about my baby's development and much less about me. I need to know when my child develops toes. I want to know what he/she hears and sees in there. I don't need to know about hair dyes or diets that I will never follow.I also need a lighter approach than is found in &quot;What To Expect.&quot; The writing style strikes me as chilly and clinical. This is a joyous and often very humorous life experience. Novice moms-to-be need a laugh along with the facts.In short, &quot;What To Expect&quot; has answered very few of my questions. It's decent reference for the bookshelf, but not my Bible, by any means."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I was very disappointed by this book. This is my first pregnancy and it's not just another flu season for me. I take this event as an emotional one, and I want a guide that approaches it the same way. This book focused so much on what could go wrong with the baby and not at all on how I am feeling. My husband had to put it down after 50 pages of the terrifying diseases our child could have. And yet, when I needed information on HG (a very serious condition that lands pregnant women in the emergency room because of extreme morning sickness) there was no mention of it. All I got to explain and comfort me on the 25lbs I lost from 2 months of vomiting is a tiny paragraph saying it was &quot;normal&quot; and &quot;EATING 6 meals a day&quot; would help!...like &quot;eating&quot; is an option !!I am sure it is a helpful reference book on my ob's shelf, but there is better guides out there for pregnant women. I am having a baby not battling cancer!"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I'll be honest, I really don't like this book! When I was pregnant with my first child, it was, as a previous reveiwer put it, my &quot;bible&quot;. Now, having gone through pregnancy and being pregnant with my second child, I find the book rather depressing! Pregnancy is suppose to be a time of joy, getting familiar with the changes in you body and the life that is growing inside you, etc. Instead of listing all the things a pregnant woman has to look forward to, this book is filled with a lot of &quot;No!&quot; and &quot;Don't&quot;.I recommend instead reading the Sears Family Library's book on pregnancy!"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This book will make the first time parents contantly checking and rechecking symptoms of every cold, over-examining ever ache and pain. Perfect for hypocondriacs (sp?). This book has no real useful information, just symptoms of the 1 in a million problems. If you want a great pregnancy book try Pregnancy Week-by-Week by MacDougal. It's doesn't have that 'better than you' attitude and the weekly updates, rather than monthly are far more satisfying. I would avoid this book if I were you. I bought it because it is 'THE pregnancy book' that everyone has but it really is a waste of money. Don't even bother with &quot;What to eat...&quot; either. Anyone who tells a pregnant woman to stay away from ANY sugar or chocolate is a sadist!"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"1. The Best-Odds Diet: give me a break. I eat a healthy, varied diet with plenty of fresh produce, milk, etc. A bagel is a once-a-week &quot;cheat&quot; treat? A slice of pie is &quot;terribly wicked&quot;? Like I said: give me a break. (I read the section on &quot;Best-Odds Cheating&quot; out loud to my husband for laughs.)2. Breastfeeding: &quot;Millions of happy, healthy babies have been raised on the bottle.&quot; The encouraging-but-lukewarm attitude towards breastfeeding wouldn't bother me quite so much if they weren't so militant about their stupid diet. Breastfeeding your baby is way, WAY more important than abstaining from white bread while you're pregnant.3. Choices in birthing: WTEWYE encourages you to &quot;discuss&quot; with your obstetrician whether it's okay for you to do such radical things as not lie flat on your back with your feet strapped into stirrups. Overwhelmingly, the attitude is that your doctor Knows Best and having tentatively expressed the opinion that you might like to be able to walk around during labor, you should be a good girl and do whatever your doctor tells you. The fact is that some hospital policies are actively detrimental to mothers and babies -- and the other fact is that it's YOUR BODY, and (in a U.S. hospital, at least), you can refuse to consent to unnecessary interventions.There's useful information in here, but for goodness' sake don't use this as your ONLY reference. I recommend the Sears &quot;Pregnancy Book&quot; as a useful adjunct to the information in here."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I can credit this book with actually saving my life. I understand how the &quot;What could go wrong&quot; section could scare you if you are having a normal pregnancy. I had a placental abruption at 28 weeks, and though I was very asymptomatic, the book encourages you to call your doctor if you even THINK something might be wrong. I did, and I had to have an emergency c-section. For a first time mom, the experience was very scary, but if I hadn't had a book that looked at what may go wrong in 1% of pregnancies, I would have died. It's definately not the be-all and end-all of pregnancy books, but I found it to be very informative and helpful."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This is the worst pregnancy book out there. The information is presented with a lot of gloom and doom; it would make any expectant mother think that she is not doing a good job if she's not following every piece of advice in the book.I don't understand why this book is so prevalent as a gift at baby showers--maybe because it is inexpensive and has a catchy title.As far as trouble shooting or dealing with any kind of problems that arise, the book doesn't deal with them well. And this book is TERRIBLE for anyone that is hoping to breastfeed.I would NOT buy this book if it were the last thing on the shelves."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"As soon as I found out I was pregnant I ordered this book from Amazon.

If you need a book to tell you to run to your doctor every time you have a question or concern then this book is for you. If you want to be patronized page after page then this book is for you. Overall I think this book is written for people who are a) easily influenced, b) believe everything the read and c) are susceptible to scare tactics.

Great for first-time mothers."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This book help me so much through my pregnancy. I would recommend this book to anyone. The book eased my mine about a lot of things I was nerves about (I'm a first time mom). There were times when I was ready to run to the emergency room, before I went I would look in the book and there it was, I took the advice of the writers and it worked just find. GOD Bless the Writers and whom ever else had something to do with this book. You guys deserve the Pulitzer Prize for this book/guide"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"The book was a good starting point, but had a lot of misleading information. Seemed like every other day I thought I was having a miscarriage (during the first trimester) because of this book. My husband took it away from me and bought &quot;Your Pregnancy Week by Week&quot;, which was much more positive and informative."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This book includes some really great information for the newly-pregnant woman. However, the section on diet is absolutely ridiculous and unrealistic. It makes the reader feel completely inadequate and changes mealtime into an ordeal."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This was the first book I bought when I found outI was pregnant. I found the information helpful,but somewhat limited.The book tends to focus on the negative aspectsof pregnancy so often that my husband took the book away from me so I would quit worrying so much. I'm not sorry I bought it, but if I could only have one book on pregnancy, this would not be it."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"While this book provides much information about medicalized prenatal care and hospital labor and birth, it is as biased as it comes. I disliked the unsubstantiated anti-midwife stance, and the way the author presented the list of prenatal tests as inevitable and unquestionable. The discussions about the safety and accurace of these tests were incomplete and biased. I also found it absurd to include a chapter about possible complications and tell women not to read it. I also disliked the question-answer format. All of the information in this book can be found in other consumer-oriented books without the intervention-as-normal-and-desireable attitude"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"As this is my first pregnancy, I was totally unprepared for the physical changes that tookplace. I couldn't have lived these past monthswithout this book. I'm glad that it isn't technically written, so that it is very understandable. I'd recommend this book to anyfirst time parent. There are no bad points about this book, only good ones"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"Most women like the developmental information, but find the rest of the book unrealistic, condenscending, and irritating. The authors- a couple of RN's, so no, they aren't physicians- seem to assume that you will treat your mainstream obstetrician or midwife as a god and final authority. If that's what you want, fine. If you want a safe, empowering birth, and a good outcome, look for information elsewhere. Try &quot;The Birth Book&quot; by Wm and Martha Sears, &quot;A Good Birth, A Safe Birth&quot;... and by all means, avoid the rest of the books in the WTE series- most are worse than this one.I found that I was nauseated by reading the book by about the 5th month the first time around, and it was relegated to bathroom reading the second time around."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"If you are at all interested in natural childbirth and/or what your options are during pregnancy and birth, this book definity does not cover that. However, it was very reassuring during my first pregnancy when I had no idea what to expect from my body. If this is not your first pregnancy, you can probably skip this book"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I received three copies of this book while I was pregnant, from other women who already had children. I was happy to see that the book answered all of the questions I had and fully explained everything that I needed to know, like what was going to happen to my body, what would happen at each month's doctor visit, etc. This book has a question-answer approach that really helps, since they were some of the same questions that were floating through my head (like, &quot;Will I have to have an amniocentesis?&quot;). I went into labor before I could read the final chapters though and I really wish I had been able to read those, about coming home and the first few days, how I was going to feel and all of that. This book was a lifesaver for 9 months!"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I found this book to be very much what I needed during my (second) pregnancy.It gives a lot of information in an easy-to-understand language.The month-by-month format is helpful,but it did not stop me from reading ahead and skipping back and forth.It answers many questions I didn't even realize I could ask,and explains everything very clearly.I liked that this book did not make doctors and other medical professionals to be always right,and that it tells you to trust yourself too! I do not follow the book religiously,but I appreciate knowing all that I can do.This book isn't my only resource - I talk to my OB,friends,family, and I read a lot.All in all,it is a very good,informative and caring book.I think it's a good reference to have."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I live in Germany and since the language is different I was very nervous about having a Baby and being able to communicate well with my Doctor. This book was perfect, exact, helpful and informative. It helped answer my questions when I was worried at 2 a.m. in the morning. I was able to make a good list of questions when visiting my Doctor and made sure I knew exactly what to expect even though it was difficult for me to understand the German language. Living in the U.S.A. or Germany, I can't imagine having another Baby without this book by my side."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This book gives you an expansive breath of knowledge related to all facets of pregnancy. Providing woman with the clinical knowledge they need, this book allows women to be &quot;on top of their care.&quot; I especially appreciate hearing about the experiences of other women. I also enjoy the &quot;Best Odds Recipes&quot;-the virgin sangria is festive and delicious. We all need to treat ourselves to this book.A great companion for this book if I must say so myself is: Today's Woman... Prenatal Care And Beyond. These two books need to be in every woman's pregnancy library. They are complimentary to each other, providing the most important nutrients of a woman's life, empowerment, nurturance, support, encouragement and &quot;true love&quot;. Today's Woman...Prenatal Care and Beyond written by Paula Baran is also available on Amazon.com, so why not take a peek. Happy Reading!"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"If you're the type of woman who reads a medical manual and develops the symptoms of an enlarged prostate, then definitely do not read this book. However, if you can use this book as a reference, with an open mind, and with the sense of reality that there is more than one GOOD way to do something, then this is an excellent choice. I liked the way it was lain out, month by month and also indexed. You can get a basic idea of what's going on in there, what could happen and also look up what you are specifically concerned about. But, remember, this isn't the Holy Bible, every woman and every pregnancy is different. Just keep an open mind and diversify your references. Oh, and congratulations!"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I found this entire series to be my #1 resource during pregnancy and the first three years of both my daughter and sons' life. I was always amazed that I could ask any question and open the book to find the answer. If you're a person who likes to know answers, you will call this book your bible. I agree, The Best Odds Diet is complete - and more than I could ever manage to keep up with - but it seemed to me that's why they called it The Best Odds. No matter how healthy the diet, I would have cheated, after all ice-cream was my favorite source of calcium. But at the same time, if the diet had been less complete I wouldn't have picked up some great tips, and I would probably not have been as encouraged to really &quot;clean-up&quot; the rest of my diet - I never reached the book's state of eating bliss- but that's ok - and I think the books have exactly that attitude. Do the best you can and trust yourself."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"Great book! Gave lots of good anwers to common pregnancy complaints.. however organization wasnt the best, but it was still a good read!"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"As a birth doula, this is the one book that I refer absolutely every expecting mom and dad to every time. This book addresses every possible concern and pregnancy scenario by week, month and trimester. There is a diary in the back of the book to help keep track of every aspect of your pregnancy. It is great fun to go back later and read about your pregnancy after baby comes! I recommend this book to expecting parents, grandparents, aunts and uncles. The birth experience is a family affair and with this book, everyone is on the same page!"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This book is excellent as a guide and reference. By far the best pregnancy book I read. You just need this book and don't waste money to buy any other similar guides.I give it 5-star because it has everything I expected to find in a pregnancy book; a detailed week-by-week and month-by-month explanation on what to expect and how the body changes. It is not a boring medical book, instead it is made easy to understand without compromising on information. It also addresses some questions that pregnant moms have which they never get to ask anyone else, or think that it's too trivial to ask. This 3rd edition sure has good updates. It must have taken so much effort to compile and write this book. I love it!!"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"As a woman with an 8 week old, I can't tell you how much I referred to this book. It was so exciting to get to every new month of pregnancy and read it. I never allowed myself to go ahead of where I was out. So it was always a special treat when I reched a new month to read a new chapter! This book has so much information. I walked into all of my doctors appointments prepared. It's the one book to have on your bed stand!"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"My doctor told me to get this book and I did. I am soooooo glad I did. The information was helpful, informative, easy to understand, and I loved reading what my baby was doing at each stage of pregnancy. Hey nine months is a long time, it is good to know what is going on in there. It also have sections on how to get pregnant, how to pick the right doctor, questions to ask, and on to the first month home with your new baby!Now don't take everything the book says to heart (hypochondriacs stay away from this book), read it knowing that alot of the information is \\"just in case\\". It just so happened that just in case saved my babies life! Had the book not told me to count the babies movements (since my doctor never mentioned it) I would have never called the doctor when he stopped moving. Needless to say my son was induced a month early and was a happy, healthy, baby."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I have to say that this is one of the best books that I own. I read/looked up something about my pregnancy everyday and didn't think I was going to use it that much during my second pregnancy, but I read it more during my second pregnancy, since both of my pregnancies were different. It's a great book and helps calm your nerves about many little things when the doctor can't be reached. A lot of my friends have also borrowed this book from me during their pregnancies and it has helped them too. Highly recommended!!!!"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I bought this book during my first pregnancy. It was very helpful to me. But, during my subsequent pregnancies it was too basic. I would recommend this only to a first-time mom. Once you've already &quot;been there, done that&quot; this book is of limited use.One other thing...read the chapter on c-sections. I thought it would never happen to me...natural childbirth, the whole nine yards, was my vision...God had other plans. It is just best to be prepared for anything."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I thought this book was very useful during my first pregnancy. I am now pregnant with my second baby and am continuing to refer to this book if I have questions. I have to admit the Pregnancy Diet is a little bit of a joke which is why I only gave it 4 stars. I am on prenatal vitamins like most women and feel no need to worry myself to death about what I eat. I use common sense to make healthy food choices. I noticed a lot of reviewers said this book made them paranoid. I, personally, want to be informed of what could go wrong with my pregnancy however rare the case may be...and this book does let you know how rare certain conditons and problems are. This book didn't make me feel like a moron...like some reviewers say. If you let a BOOK make you feel like a moron, then that's your problem and not the authors'. The authors wrote the book assuming people don't know anything about pregnancy. I think that is a good approach to writing an information-based book. I would tell any pregnant woman to buy this book."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I purchased this book with great hope that it would give me answers to all the questions of Pregnancy. Seems like all it did was tell me the same things...symptoms...what is going on...how I should be feeling. For my it was not worth the money. I purchased &quot;Your pregnancy week by week&quot; and it was MUCH better. Gave a lot more information about what was happening with my body and also the length and weight (later) of the baby and what was developing each week."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This is the ultimate baby book, i have read a couple and i find this one to be the best, sure some chapters may be frightening but it only speaks the truth, it had answers to all my questions, and worries as a first time mom. I love this book. Buy it you will not regret it."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This is filled with detailed, specific information month by month. It's a wonderful book. It's also quite big so your gettting it at a great price!"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"The Best Odds Diet is but one chapter of this vast and informative book, and let's be serious - the advice they give on diet is absolutely right on! Did I follow the diet? Nope. However, you have only so many calories you can eat without becoming a blimp and in order to pack the most nutrition into those calories, enriched flour and sugar aren't your best bet. That said, I did manage to produce a very healthy baby boy, but I did gain over 50 pounds!It's a shame that the reviews dwell on this chapter because there is so much other information available in this book, which I read over and over again.New Moms! Get this book, you won't be sorry."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I borrowed this book from my cousin and at first I didn't like it because it tells you everything, from the good to the bad. I just decided not to scare myself with the bad things that could go wrong with the prenancy unless I had questions about them. Otherwise the information was very helpful!! I have to give to book back because she is expecting again and I am going to go out and buy my own. Definatly a must for new moms!!"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"this book was so helpful. i had so many questions with my pregnancy (this being my first). this book kept me from calling my doctor with every little worry. i highly recommend it."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I find this book to be extremely informative for mothers-to-be. A wonderful reference! I really appreciated the portions of the book that let you know what to expect at each office visit. I could really relate to the question and answer portions of the book as well.I read in a lot of the comments that this book could frighten a mother or throw them into paranoia and guilt. I didn't pick that up from the text at all. I've used this book in addition to advice from my OB-GYN and things have worked out fine."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I bought this book a year before I got pregnant, which is a good thing because it gave me enough time to follow its advice to quit smoking and change my eating habits. Now I feel both physically and mentally prepared. Contrary to what others said, I thought the information given about things that could go wrong was very helpful. The only negative thing I can think of is that the book was very repetitive in some parts, which made it a little boring to read."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I did read this cover to cover for both of my pregnancies because friends told me to. I was lucky to be a calm expectant mother, and to have an excellent OB who spent time with me, and answered my every concern. After he asked me what I was reading, and I replied, he said,&quot;Toss that book in the garbage!&quot; Who needs to be in such a constant state of anxiety? Certainly not a pregnant mom. Go for the Good Housekeeping Illustrated Guide to Pregnancy. Also check out 125 Things You Must Know About Being Pregnant, by Nina Landi. Totally sweet, cute, and not one second of alarm. Good luck with your pregnancies!"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I am pregnant with my third child and this book was my bible through my two previous pregnancies. It helped me answer questions without having to call my doctor every time something happened."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This book has guided me through my pregnancy well. It contains many information which I need to know and answered almost all the questions I had.One thing I like about this book is that it summarises at the beginning of every chapter what you will be expecting during that particular month. You have to read the book to appreciate the book!"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I was not very pleased with this book at all. I found the organization and structure to be not very good. For example, I'm in my second month, but I had to search all over the book for answers to questions I had about things I'm experiencing now! Also, the Best Odds diet is not only restrictive (at best), it's also unrealistic. Do you consider a bagel made with refined flour a once-a-week treat? Moreover, the childbirth section is painfully lacking in thorough information. While this book does contain useful information, don't make it your only resource. For a wonderfully thorough, detailed, and well-written resource, I really recommend &quot;With You and Your Baby All the Way,&quot; by Jerri Colonero."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"Although there is very beneficial information in this book, I found that it is actually better to not read cover to cover. The first 1/3 of the book deals with all of the possibilities of what can go wrong that it can leave a first time expectant mother overly worried and as the authors themself sugest..can be skipped over or briefly skimmed. The second 1/3 of the book is where the &quot;meat&quot; is where is discusses the actual changes to expect during the course of each month which is really what the expectant mother wants to know, therefore, it can be disappointing to finally be reading about things that have already passed you by because it takes so long to get to this part of the book in addition to the reality that some women may already be in their starting the second month of pregnancy by the time they discover they are pregnant and can be well into their third or fourth month by the time we start actually reading anything...thus just give us the facts easily and get to the point! Good for the mother who hasplanned in advance and can read beforehand (My baby is now 1 month and half and I still haven't finished reading it!"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This book is the best one out there when you are pregnant. I have recommend and bought this book for all of my friends who have become pregnant. This book answers every question you may have. I also highly recommend &quot;What to expect the first year&quot;I don't understand why the negative comments, I did not find this book scary at all. I found it to be very informative and reassuring. I highly recommend this book as must have when you are expecting!!"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I agree with other readers that the Best-Odds diet is somewhat impractical, but I think its a nice goal to reach for! I did get some good diet tips from the book and actually tried a few recipes. The book is very thorough--there are not many questions I had about my pregnancy that were not answered somewhere in the book. I could not have survived pregnancy without it!"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"Everything seems to be a scare tactic. Very little is put in perspective for the (sometimes emotional) expectant mother. This book was given away by the hospital, so we're glad we didn't waste $10."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I gave this book 2 stars rather than one due to the kernels of knowledge that you can find throughout this book. HOWEVER, and this is a huge one, when you're throwing up, dizzy, and barely finding the energy to take a shower, how in the world are you supposed to be able to follow the strict diet that they are recommending? While I agree that going out the seek a double whopper daily is a bad idea, how many of us pregnant ladies have enough time and energy to whip up gourmet maximum nutrition foods? Spinach leaves have been making me gag......... as well as other weird taste aversions that I've had. Perhaps if you are able to stay home as a housewife, you might be able to somewhat realistically follow this plan..... but what about the ladies who work full time, better yet, work full time with non-traditional hours? (I work 12-9 daily with Sunday and Mondays off).... this book desperately needs to address what women in my own (and many others) can do, without breaking your bank eating out to seek healthier foods?"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I found this book a little preachy and negative. I eat a pretty healthy diet, but couldn't stand the section on nutrition. It's unnecessarily restrictive and not completely accurate. It will only make you feel guilty.There is some good information, but there are other books with better and more complete information and better organization. My favorites are \\"1000 Questions About Your Pregnancy\\" and \\"Mayo Clinic Complete Book of Pregnancy & Baby's First Year\\". They are both extremely thorough, well-organized, and work great for reference. Both of these books tend to put things in perspective, maintain a positive tone and really present you with all the facts. In general, I think the pregnancy books written by doctors are the best.That being said, I still pick up this book from time to time to compare information. It's OK, but definitely not the best."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I didn't care for this book - even though it seems that some love it. I felt like there was a lot of focus on \\"bad\\" things that could happen. It just made me worry more, which isn't good."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I bought this book immediately after we found out I was pregnant and was really expecting it to be \\"the guide\\" to pregnancy. Basically, it gives pretty accurate and complete information, but every time I pick it up, I am quite turned off by the condescending tone (i.e. if you eat a slice of white bread with butter, vs. whole grain with nothing, you are probably not fit to be a mother sort of notion). This book doesn't even make me feel guilty...just irritated that an authority on the subject could be so demeaning. As a first time mom, I would advise you NOT to get this book. I know I am not alone either because every time I see used pregnancy books for sale or for free, it is among them. Many of my pregnant friends have gotten rid of this book for the same reason. In terms of getting good info, the internet is great and of course there are many many pregnancy books out there. It is really unfortunate that this is considered to be \\"THE\\" pregnancy book, when it is such a disappointing read. If you insist on buying this book, check a garage sale or Goodwill. There you will probaly find an abundance of rejects."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This is almost meant to be read as a story, which isn't what I was looking for. The bulk of the book pretends to be organized by the various time segments of your pregnancy. (Month 1, Month 2) But only the first page or two of the chapter discusses the changes you and the baby are going through at that time. Instead each chapter has a random mix of Q and A's that you would have at any point in the pregnancy. I just didn't follow it at all."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"Talks down to readers, as though we are all 6 graders, but has a wide range of question and answer facts that the medical associations recommend. Talks about what you should and shound not do in black and white terms."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I loved this book and together with the book, &quot;Your Pregnancy Week by Week&quot;, I felt I was well armed in pregnancy. Although this book scared and worried some readers, I think it gave an overview of any of the situations that can happen during pregnancy. It is not to worry you but to inform you. If you want to belive that all pregnancies are fun and easy and turn out well, I wouldn't read this book. But this book is very realistic and incredibly informative. It covers everything you should and shouldn't do and what you should expect, hence the title. My only complaint is that the authors are a bit extreme on some topics such as nutrition. It is by far the best general pregnancy book out there."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"My sister in law insisted I borrow this book from her claiming that it was the &quot;best pregnancy book ever&quot;. What I found was a lot of fear mongering that treated pregnancy more like a terminal illness than the joyful occasion it really is. I literally couldn't force myself to read very much of it, and the parts I did read made me feel like every little bit of queasiness was a miscarriage waiting to happen or if I ate a bite of ice cream my baby would come out sick. If you are looking for a guide to pregnancy with a bit of heart, I suggest Dr. Sears' The Pregnancy Book; if you are looking for a nutrition guide that is easy to follow and well researched, I recommend Barbara Luke's Program your Baby's Health: The Pregnancy Diet for your Child's Lifelong Well-being."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This book is informative, however on several occasions I used it as a research tool before calling my doctor with my concerns, and it only made me reach for the phone even faster. It does not explain that many things that you think are strange during pregancy are actually VERY NORMAL!!!! I also do not like the set up of this book. It works on calendar months instead of by weeks of pregnancy that my doctor uses."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"Before I read this book this past weekend, I read through others' reviews and wasn't sure what to expect when I read it. I'm a little in the middle. I don't think that the Best-Odds Diet is too unrealistic, especially if you were used to eating a very healthy diet before you became pregnant. However, I am struggling with the weight gain calculations. I'm only 7 weeks along and I have already gained my 3 lbs. I don't know how realistic the weight scale is since we all are very different in height, size, weight, etc. I skipped the section on what can go wrong in your pregnancy. I will only refer to that IF I HAVE TO! otherwise, why torture yourself on reading the &quot;what ifs&quot;. I also have only read ahead through month &quot;4&quot; because I won't remember anything I read today 6 months from now. I suggest reading it, but don't limit yourself to just this ONE. I'm going to try Sears book as well. I see a lot of positive words about his book."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This book is unfortunately considered the pregnancy bible of the moment. It is preachy, condescending, and treats women like they can't think for themselves. The diet recommendations are a bit absurd, and not practical in any way.I would recommend Girlfriend's Guide to Prenancy well above this one."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"They issued a new edition with the same old outdated information. Save your money - these authors aren't selling you this &quot;book&quot; to give you good information: they are selling it to make themselves money because they know it's a popular book. If you care about your pregnancy even one inch and are PROUD to be pregnant, then get another book like &quot;Pregnancy, Childbirth and the Newborn&quot; (most recent edition) by Penny Simkin, Ann Keppler and Janet Whalley. PCN will give you a fuller picture, be respectful of your intelligence, and assume that you want to be informed about what is happening, instead of the constant whining that accompanies WTEWYE. &quot;The Pregnancy Book&quot; by Sears is also a good read.There's a reason that this book is in every thrift store and recycle bin - it's garbage!"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I read many books during my pregnancy and this one was my least favorite. I detest the question/answer format and their tone. Who are the writers anyway? Do they have a degree or anything?many of the information given is inaccurate when compared to the scientific research out there...but the reader wouldn't know...they don't tell us where they get their facts from!Get &quot;The Pregnancy Book&quot; by Dr Sears instead, and if you already have this one-throw it in the recycling bin!"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"If you want to be scared and paranoid through your first pregnancy, then this is the book for you. This book has no insight on anything. It is vague. It doesnt explain anything in detail. It talks about every possible thing that could go wrong but probably wont. Each chapter lists all the symptoms you might be expeiriencing, but that is as far as that goes. Its not a very good book to turn to you if you have concerns because it will just make you have more! You might as well ask your doctor because this book constantly refers you to your doctor. It has no insight or answer for anything unless you have a high-risk pregnancy."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I won't recommend this book. The authors spend too much time listing things that have not been shown to impact a pregnancy and labeling them as \\"BAD\\". I spent my pregnancy worrying about things that in retrospect were silly (is decaf green tea really going to give me a mutated baby). It had a tendency to suggest the worst was going to happen - I didn't even finish it. I usually love to read about what is going on and find out what to expect. I even read sections of an embryology textbook. But I had my husband read the section on delivery and births, because I knew reading it myself would make things worse not better. While the other books in this series are extremely helpful, this title is not - DON'T GET IT!"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"After four children my wife and I have probably read as many pregnancy books as anyone. My wife carried four healthy children on a vegan diet. We had children in birthing centers, the hospital and at home, so we have a rather complete picture of the possibilities. What to expect was on our book shelf and generally remained there unless we wanted to check a specific subject.The book tries very hard to meet the needs of its readerhsip and in many ways it succeeds such as its month-to-month overview of the pregnancy, but these fine points never quite enable it to overcome the numerous negatives which include:1. An overriding tendancy to speak patronizingly to the reader.2. A strong bias toward medical intravention.3. Using fear to motivate compliance with said intraventions.4. An absolutely terrible section on diet, which is even moreoutdated and scientifically unsound regarding vegan diets.5. A tendancy to look down on any alternative birthingarrangements.If you tend to implicitly trust doctors and other medical professionals, and there is nothing wrong with this if it's your cup of tea, then this book is right up your alley.Even if you don't fully agree with everything. there is much good solid information that few will disagree with, but as we shared, the attitude may trouble some readers.If you are considering other birth alternatives outside of the hospital, this book will not be helpful or encouraging.If you are fearful the long list of unlikely complications will do nothing to calm you.Finally do not pay attention ot the nutritional information!!!This is not a bad book but it does illustrate the impossiblity of being all things to all people."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I am a mother of six children, I read this book with baby number three. I was scared out of my wits. I didn't need the hassle. I think that educating your self about chidbirth is a good thing, but, it gets to the point in this book that you are afraid of EVERYTHING. I was worried about every test I didn't have, I was worried about every test I DID have. I think this book should have focused on basic need to know details, especially for first time mothers who really worry to begin with. There is such a thing as too much info to take in and digest."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This book supports a myth that childbirth, motherhood, pregnancy are easy, natural and an etheral expereince. It does not give you any &quot;real&quot; data or information (ex; probability of birth defects, nor does it give any research on the reality of bottle feeding with formula as a valid feeeding method). It does give you a nice pat on the back that may reassure you. The bottom line though is it can make you feel very guilty if you decide to do what generations of parents (probably including your own) have done, and that is do what works for YOU to keep yourself HEALTHY and HAPPY. My advice, chuck all of these books out the window, have your mom, or mom n law or sister, or all of them move in for the first couple months with the newborn and learn from those who have done it before. You can not get from this book what you can get from mothers around you."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"As an expectant first time parent, naturally there were many questions about the whole process. And advice for first time parents is literally a dime a dozen - this book being no exception. Therefore my parenting caveat &quot;Follow your gut.&quot; Yet there are times when you have questions of whether what you are experiencing and feeling is normal. In these cases, my wife and I found this book helpful. (For example, &quot;What can I do for hemrrhoids?&quot; &quot;How long will this morning sickness last?&quot; &quot;Is it ok for me to eat sushi?&quot;) While every woman and every pregnancy is different, I recommend this book as a reference only.I did take issue with the book's advice and tone on issues that seem to me to be more of a personal nature - for example whether or not to breast feed your baby. Or what type of sleeping arrangements should you make for your newborn. On these issues I found the book preachy, and frankly a bit fascist. Again - follow your gut on those decisions: its your baby. Use What To Expect When You're Expecting as a medical reference only."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I was given this when I was pregnant with my first child- and it terrified me! Every time my little girl wiggled I consulted the book and ended up -slightly hysterical- in the GPs surgery. I finally put all of my books on the shelf and focussed on getting acquainted with my child. That said, when I was pregnant with my fourth child, I was able to use the book successfully to self-diagnose gestational diabetes. No book will teach you anything about YOUR child. Each child and pregnancy is unique. That said, this book is a useful reference, and I keep it on the shelf to consult when my own experience is lacking."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I was disappointed in this book. I found it to be extremely patronizing and absolutely humorless. I want specific information about the baby's development on a week-to-week basis, and this book barely describes fetal development. The diet it recommends is a joke. The cover is offensive- that woman looks like she's been drugged. Pregnancy is a healthy, normal developmental state, not a disease. As a pregnant woman, I want lots of information about every aspect of pregnancy. I can make my own decisions and judgements, with the aid of my doctor. I don't need a book to tell me what to do, I need a book to educate me. I wish this book weren't the top seller- I hope women are finding other books that provide more useful, positive information."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"the book itself is great even though i didn't buy the latest version,... i did buy a used copy for a very low price... but when i received it i understood why the low price... the book had coffee stains all over the first quarter of the book ... still a good read though"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"It's very helpful for a first-time mom to be.

It great information for expectant mothers and fathers too! I'd recommend it to all mothers and fathers who are expecting!"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This book is the first one you will reach for if it is your first pregnancy. Save your cash and get it from the library. Then read something that expects you to be a thinking woman, not a child taking orders or information without question. If you want to go through pregnancy, labor and birth, and have no say at all or learn anything useful, then stick with this book; i.e., go to the hospital, have an epidural, episiotomy, then finally the c-section that 'must' have been necessary, this is it.Beyond that, read Ina May Gaskins, Henci Goer, the Sears' books, and \\"Childbirth Without Fear.\\" Read a broader selection - many of which you can also get from a library or spend a night thumbing through at a bookstore. I am a mother of 4; have had healthier, more positive birth experiences than anyone I know. This book is misleading and negative.Make it the joyful event you deserve!"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I received this book from my friend when I first announced I was pregnant. Although it is a good guideline, it should not be regarded as an information \\"bible\\". Just keep in mind that this is a guideline not a \\"know-it-all\\" book. Although it includes a lot of good, basic \\"black and white\\" information, there is a lot of \\"gray\\" that is left out. This book brought out the \\"worry-rat\\" in me when I used the index to find out if certain things were normal in pregnancy. I have seen other books out there which offer better information and indices for quick reference."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This book is quite high-level and gets into very little detail. The Q&amp;A format is not my favourite and I found the style a bit patronizing. It is also a U.S. book and doesn't provide any information on Canada-specific options. The Mother of All Pregnancy Books is a better resource and I recommend it for anyone seeking this &quot;overview&quot; kind of literature. Unlike &quot;What to Expect,&quot; it is Canadian, and a more detailed book that covers an equal or greater breadth of topics. It is also less focused on the negative, though it covers issues and fears in detail."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This book was really a list of pregnant women complaining about their symptoms, or the ones their friend had and they didn't. There are a lot of complaints about the way the body changes (Yes, you are going to lose your waist and, yes, you are going to gain weight). These things are obvious and not worth the plethora of pages dedicated to selfish complaining. I purchased the book, brought it home, and returned it two hours later. There wasn't anything informative or helpful. I would recommend to anyone who wants real information to purchase The Pregnancy Book: A Month by Month Guide by William M. Sears and Martha Sears (who are a pediatrician and a nurse, respectively)."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"For some strange reason, this book has become \\"the book\\" for pregnant women to read. It is unfortunate, because it is *not* the best book out there by any means. In all likelihood, it's expectant mothers' penchant for feeling guity that drive sales of this one. The facts in it are fine for the most part and agree with other materials I have read. But the presentation . . .If you have a (very common - 30% of women) problem like light spotting in the first trimester, do not expect any comfort - or even much information from this book on the troubling event.If you enjoy learning about a very strict diet (called \\"Best odds\\") and reminded throughout the book of what a loser you are if you eat something that's 'not very best-odds,' you might enjoy this one. There is no question that nutrition is important during pregnancy. This book would have you believe, however, that eating *anything* that's not:1. packed with vitamins and/or calcium and/or protein and2. low fatis more or less akin to a very grave sin (practically murder.) It is so pedantic!! Ice cream, for ex, craved by many pregnant women (though not me) is just \\"not very best odds.\\" You can just hear the sneer when the authors say something they don't want you to eat \\"isn't very 'best odds' anyway.\\"Get off the high horse, authors. Most responsible pregnant women will try to eat healthy food and most will also indulge some of the cravings for foods that just aren't \\"best odds\\" according to you.These authors will make you feel that eating anything they don't consider best-odds is harming your babies gravely, depriving them of the very source of life - blah blah blah.Read here about your odds of having every weirdo and odd-ball pregnancy malady - that'll make you feel good - and about all your various odds of having deformed babies.I hated this book and fail to understand its popularity but I gave it 2 stars because it is accurate, I think."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I had a VERY difficult pregnancy, and the information in this book really minimized the problems I was having. It made me feel stupid, like a whiner, and not take my symptoms seriously enough, and feel guilty for being such a wimp. I ended up in the the hospital with some very scary complications. Very few people sail through their pregnancies like the book describes, and as most OB's will also minimize your discomforts, you really need to stand up for yourself and get a support group (like Babycenter.com) where you can talk to other women and figure out what to demand that your doctor do for you. I think that if I had not read this book, I would have taken my symptoms more seriously and not tried to ignore them for so long."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"My mom gave me this when I first got pregnant, and I dutifully read it every month for the first half of my pregnancy.Not too surprisingly, I felt worried about all the tests and complications described, guilty because I didn't manage to follow their diet perfectly, and found myself anxiously awaiting the onset of the pregnancy side effects described. I also thought the tone was pretty patronizing.I stopped reading it about 3-4 months ago and since then have felt great, have a healthy pregnancy and much less anxiety."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I started reading this book when I still suffered from slight morning sickness, but now, almost halfway my pregnancy, reading this book still makes me fel sick. I think the emphasis on weight gain and food issues is very annoying. I appreciate some advice, but there is a limit. This books makes me feel guilty every time I eat a cookie or some ice cream.Also, I will decide if I want to spend a fortune on maternity clothes or not. Maybe I have a fortune to spend?Moreover, I believe that many complications mentioned in hte normal month to month chapters are so exotic, they should be in a seperate section named 'very rare complications and problems'.I say no to this book, being pregnant is worrysome enough without this book!"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I wish I didn't buy this book. It only made me think that there was something wrong. It also only had about 1 or 2 pages related to a twin pregnancy."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"So many people recommended this book to me, not to mention the television coverage and the best-sellers listing. I definietly would not recommend this book. Compared to my doctor's advice and other pregnancy books, I found this one very alarmist in tone. Also, while it looks like it is organized by month, you soon realize that information is spread out all over the place in a confusing and limiting question and answer format. Try &quot;Pregnancy, Childbirth and the Newborn&quot; by Penny Simkin instead - much better. That's the book my OB recommended."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This book is full of information that can be hard to gather from the doctor and other sources."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This book is awesome and answers alot of questions one may have during their pregnancy.

For the first several weeks of my pregnancy I thought I was going to lose my baby as a result of reading this book. When I went to my doctor practically in tears thinking something had to be wrong, she suggested I throw the book away.

And upon finding myself unexpectedly pregnant with my 5th child, my first purchase was the updated edition of this book. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is expecting or planning to conceive. This book gives wonderful information and no-nonsense assurances to every question I ever had about pregnancy. I was never frightened by the information given, and in fact have found myself relieved to find that my symptoms and worries were nothing unusual. This book has always been a great source of stress-relief to me, and I never hesitate to give this book as a gift to friends who are pregnant for the first time."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"When I found out I was pregnant I went straight to the store to find a book about pregnancy. I had heard about this one so it's the one I purchased. I wish I would have waited, once I started reading it I started to panic. As most 1st time moms I knew nothing about being pregnant & this book made me feel like everything I was experiencing was a problem. When I told my doctor that I had this book, she told me to put it in the back of the closet & not look at it again. I did pick it up again after my son was born; the chapter on the first few weeks of life was the only thing worth reading that did not cause panic.

As a first time expecting mother, I don't won't to be frighten at the fact that I \\"did color my hair\\" before I found out I was pregnant. And I don't want to worry for the entire pregnancy if I harmed my baby. I don't want to think that every normal pain I feel like stretching, is cause for concern. Don't waste your money, buy another book!"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This was by far the worst book I read when pregnant. The last thing anyone needs when expecting their first child is a 624 page detailed list of anything and everything that could ever go wrong during a pregnancy. I found myslef being paranoid all the time. I finally threw the blasted thing away and began to feel much much better both physically and emotionally.I liked Pregnancy Week-by-Week because it described how the baby was growing and developing weekly. That was very interesting. My husband read a chapter to me every Sunday night. I also enjoyed HypnoBirthing: A Celebration of Life. I did Hypnobirthing with the birth of my second child. It was AMAZING. No drugs, completely relaxed and a totally different experience than the first."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"Wow, it's interesting to see all of the strong opinions on here both pro and con.I was 4 weeks pregnant with my very first pregnancy when I had a miscarriage. This book really helped me understand what was going on with my body and what to expect.I must admit, I was a little skeptical about this book when I saw the hokey looking lady on the cover. Not the most modern view of a mom in the year 2005! I don't scare easily - I'm a really laid back person so this book didn't freak me out at all. I found some of the advice a bit neanderthal. I don't know about you ladies, but I'm a 30 year old full time career woman who has a very busy life. Our household absolutely requires TWO incomes so I don't have the luxury of cutting back my work hours to part time or quitting my job (we would starve!) I'm not a feminist but I found myself getting annoyed with the old school, 1950's \\"Donna Reed\\" vibe of this book. I got sick of the \\"lie down and rest\\" solution they recommend each and every time you feel the slightest of fatigue or run down. PLEEEEEASE GIRL!!! If I \\"laid down and rested\\" every time I felt like crap, I'd never get a dang thing done! The same goes for calling or running to the doctor every time I don't feel good.Like I said, I'm very grateful for the helpful advice regarding miscarriage because it definitely helped me get through mine but it would be nice to see a more modern and realistic portrayal of pregnancy in today's society. I am going to look into the book by Dr. Sears that you guys have suggested and I'm also going to check out the Girlfriends Guide to Pregnancy too. Bottom line ladies: TAKE THIS BOOK WITH A HUGE GRAIN OF SALT. It has its good points, it has its bad points and it's certainly not the gospel."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I am an aspiring midwife and have been doing a big study on the mainstream literature made available to expectant parents as an indendent study at my college. For each book I read I write a review. Here is what I felt about this book:I read this book because the midwives I have talked to, as well as some moms, told me it was awful. Then someone stuck up for it telling me that it was a pioneer in its day. I wanted to find out for myself. I found that times indeed do change and this book is now far from being a pioneer. With each book I read I take notes of interesting facts etc. My notes on this book are full of sudden outbursts on the frustration this book is stirring in me. There is a steady air of assumption that the reader/mother is exceedingly ignorant. I tried very hard to be objective and put myself in the place of the uninformed, expectant mother reading this as her first and/or prime source of information. A daunting prospect. It has a very cheery, overly settling, repetitive style while at the same time telling you everything that could possibly go wrong. This book would only be fitting for the most neurotic of women, and even then I think it would do anything but ease her stress. It is good in reassuring you that the day to day aches and pains that come with pregnancy are normal. This book should only be used by already informed and knowledgeable women, and certainly not as an only source by any women. I do not see that it would do anyone much good and I would not recommend it."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"Okay, so it's not as entertaining as the &quot;Girlfriend's Guide&quot; and it doesn't have the weekly illustrations of &quot;Your Pregnancy, Week by Week.&quot; However, there's a reason that this book has been a leader in pregnancy preparedness since it was first published. The book is logically organized by trimester and includes separate chapters for the dad and for special issues. Some people are turned off by the somewhat authoritative tone of the book, but I think this is because the authors convey the information in a Q and A form. There are sample questions from mothers which the authors answer instead of just having textbook-like headings followed by dry, technical details. Often I found myself having exactly the same questions as the ones asked. Other times I was glad they anticipated questions that I would have never thought to ask. Inevitably, the authors have their biases (e.g., all caffeine is forbidden during pregnancy), but that doesn't change the fact that this is a very informative and complete guide. Before you allow yourself to be turned off by the authors' style and tone, at least take a look at this book and consider adding it as a reference guide to your pregnancy book library."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This book gave only a minimum amount of information and I was very disappointed after hearing how great this book was supposed to be. This is my first pregnancy and I've found only a few useful items in this book. Other books that give way more detail are 'The Pregnancy Journal - A Day to Day Guide' and 'Your Pregnancy - Week by Week'. These books gave details of exactly what was going on inside with the baby and with my body. What to Expect is too vague and extremely outdated - especially that horrible picture on the cover - could they make pregnancy look any uglier and 1950's??"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I found that this book spent too much time dealing with the negative aspects of pregnancy, and far too little time discussing the positives. I have made many sacrifices for my pregnancy and for the life of my baby, but still felt as if I was making mistakes at every turn because of this book. After discussing my issues with my doctor, he assured me that my diet and lifestyle was more than satisfactory for me and my baby. He advised me to put the book on my shelf, and consult it if I had a medical concern that I wanted to research before contacting him. This is what I have done, and I haven't opened it since. I've turned to Dr. Sears &quot;The Pregnancy Book&quot; where I have found the information to be more thorough, and far more positive. Yes, &quot;What to expect...&quot; has some useful information, but if you want a more positive view of your pregnancy, you may want to look elsewhere."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"To me, this was the source to turn to when nobody else was around (especially during the middle of the night!) and also a book to turn to in anticipation of what my unborn daughter may/may not be doing as she grew. Let's face it, at 2:00 a.m. when you start feeling little &quot;beats&quot; in your stomach and are convinced your baby is having convulsions, it's nice to be able to turn to someone/something in the middle of the night to discover that it's probably only the baby's hiccups. Okay, so the Best-Odds diet is slightly extreme, but for people who have that discipline, it is very informative. While you may not be able to follow the entire best-odds plan, it is useful information when making food choices. Adapt it to your own lifestyle. And if it makes some of you feel guilty, GOOD! This is a life that you are carrying and you are responsible for giving it the best possible chance of everything (in utero and out!). I also loved the beginning of each chapter so that I could follow along with my baby's growth and determine how I may be feeling that month-physically and mentally.It was also extremely useful to my husband, who was able to read up on things I was experiencing that maybe I couldn't explain. This book is the first thing that I buy for everyone I know who becomes pregnant!"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"In reading the reviews, it is obvious that there are many differing opinions on the tone &amp; manner in which advice is offered in this book. Regardless of the approach, this book encompasses just about any question or concern that may occur during your pregnancy. I received many, many books during my 2 pregnancies &amp; this book was the most used--by far! The book is arranged in chapters that follow your pregnancy on a month-by-month format. Each chapter consists of &quot;what to expect&quot; in terms of your body change, along with questions (and answers) that usually would come to you at that time. There are also chapters that deal with special topics (i.e. medical complications, concerns for dad, discussions on the differences between the various birthing methods, etc.)There has to be a reason that this is the most popular book in this category--this book has become a standard with parents today. (By the way, their next book--&quot;What to Expect the First Year&quot;--is also fantastic for first-time parents!)"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"When I became pregnant with my first daughter I was overwhelmed with many questions, some I felt were too stupid to ask my doctor or mother. I was much relieved when I found the answers to my questions in this book! It seemed like all I had to do was think it and the book had an answer. It was a big relief to know that I was a normal expectant mother with normal worries, proven by the fact that the question was even published! I can't fathom why some mothers don't think this book is fabulous or find it condescending. I can only assume that they find difficulty in refraining from possible dangers to their babies. I think the book encourages an ideal yet tries to set at ease the worries of mothers that unwittingly consumed alchohol, for example, before they were aware of their pregnancy. I didn't follow the best-odds diet myself, but I read every other page of the book numerous times. When I found myself expecting the next time it was the first thing I dug out of the boxes. I even started reading it before we told everyone #2 was coming! It was just as helpful, because my second pregnancy was very different, and helped me determine whether or not my concerns were such that they should be discussed with my doctor. I embraced this wonderfully informative book, and HIGHLY recommend it to all expectant parents. It is a must-read."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"As a first time mom to be, I slept with this book under my pillow. Only kidding (almost). Although I am an avid reader, I had no clue what to expect during my pregnancy. What was going to happen to my body and my mind? What was going on with the baby? How was he growing? What was he doing? My most obsessive thoughts when I was pregnant had to do with the upcoming labor and delivery. What should I eat? Was what I was thinking &quot;normal&quot;? I couldn't even think past the delivery. I assumed that I could care for the baby easily once he was born. Of course, this is when you need &quot;What to expect the First Year&quot;. I have many years of schooling. Big Deal. I had no clue what to expect and this book gave me peace of mind. If you have already given birth, you do not need this book although you would probably enjoy it. My husband, who is not a reader, actually read some of the chapters. The authors are very funny and terrific at anticipating questions you may have. I have given this book as a gift for friends having their first child and have yet to hear a complaint. Highly, highly recommended!"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"Any question you could possibly have during your pregnancy is answered in this book.

This book I got the feeling was written to create good patients, and keep people ignorent to the great options out there when it comes to childbirth. When speaking highly of c-sections and pain killing options, it lacked a great deal of facts and I feel even hides some very important research. When speaking of &quot;natural&quot; options such as home and water birth, this auther just does not know her stuff. She either did not research before writing this book, or she is trying to down right perswade people to stay in the tipicle docter's office and hospitals for chilbirth. I agree with one coment that this book was written on a 5th grade level. For what the auther expects it's reader to be able to comprehend that is. It's Books like these that keep people ignorent. In my opinion, if you read this book and only this book, you have chosen to go along with the crowed, like sheep, and have turned your back on some possible options for your baby that could be life changing. To me, this book is for the lazy person. You have to ask yourself, is my baby, and myself for that mater worth more research. I recomend The complete Book of Pregnacy and Childbirth by Kitzinger. While she is more for the natural childbirth experience, her book can prepare you for either hospital or home birth. She provides facts based on research that enable the mother and father to make informed choices during prenatal care and childbirth. Even if you want a traditional birthing experience in the hospital, with an episiotomy, and epidural, at least you will be quite aware of what the procedures are and the pros and cons. That's what this is all about, looking at the pros and cons. There is no doupt that all procedures are at some point needed, but we must understand all the routine procedures, and know that they can be naggative as well as posative. What to expect when you're expecting does not list in extent if at all, the cons to anything the auther is promoting, where as a well written book on pregnacy will inform you with fact and research to back it up, on both sides of every option and procedure. I wouldn't even recomend only reading Kitzingers book, I would recomend using it as your main guide, as well as taking a trip to the local library to really research and get an idea of fact verses fiction, and truth verses untruth, and some authers opinions verses compiled information based on years of experience. Find a book written by someone who has experience on both sides of the coin. Me? I had my first child at age nineteen at home and had all prenatal care and delivery done by a lay midwife. When going into that pregnacy, I planned on a tipical docter and hospital delivery, until I went to the library that is. I am eight months pregnant with my second, and I am with the same midwife who is now certified by the state of California, and the best midwife in the Palm Springs area (according to not only me, but a front page article in our local news paper). My husband and I are so thankful for books that are written to inform people not conform them. There was a red flag that went up about a month ago that made us all think I might end up in the hospital for this one, and I can say, that while I still prefer my own bed, I'd be ok with whatever happens, because I am well informed and prepared for both sides of the coin. I read more then What to expect when you're expecting! I have two older cousins, one who delivered naturaly in water, and the other who was two months premature with as much &quot;hospital&quot; as you and a baby could experience, and both would agree that while they both felt equally safest in there delivery enviroment, one needs to read more then What to expect while you're expecting.I sort of wrote more then I had planned, and typed to fast. So, please excuse typos and spelling errors. :)"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I'm more of an emotional reader so I liked \\"The Girlfriend's Guide to Pregnancy\\" better. This book talked about all the things I didn't need to worry about. What normal mother needs to worry about drugs and pregnancy. I skipped the entire section. It seemed like common sense to me. It was dry reading in my opinion. It still had some good facts. It's one you keep in your library just in case. If you're looking for facts and laughs read \\"The Girlfriend's Guide to Pregnancy\\" it's laugh out loud funny and easy to relate to."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This is a reference book, an all-around, kitchen-sink atlas of babyhood for new parents, from diaper rash to speech impediments. If you want a more liberal, baby-first approach, go to Penelope Leach; more conservative, discipline-oriented, try Ferber. Still the best, general \\"apolitical\\" baby book, for all its faults. There are also lots of great, more specific baby books. For clueless Dads, there's \\"The Expectant Father\\" by Armin Brott, a classic. And for the insightful, intelligent, first-person memoir of parenthod, I go with Bruce Stockler's \\"I Sleep At Red Lights: A True Story of Life After Triplets.\\""},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I used this book with both of my children, there is a 13 year gap between them. It was extremly helpful the first time and it was even more so the second time. The format is great, the information is plentiful. I saw that some reviewers said it was idealistic, there is nothing wrong with helping a woman have the best possible pregnancy. Each woman should take from it what is good for her and leave what is not. No one book is going to be specific to Mary, Jane or Sue, but this books covers so much that each of these women will be able to gain a great deal of information about their preganancy. Please enjoy it, I did, twice."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I am expecting my first child soon and when my husband and I found out we were expecting, we immediatly went and bought this book. I have looked up everything in this book that I don't understand. When it comes to how big baby is they don't say much, but how can they possibly tell you how big your baby is at any given point. I found the index to be the greatest thing. They tell you everypage that the subject your looking for is on. HOW GREAT IS THAT!!! I loved this I even bought a copy for my husband, to take with him overseas.I would recomend this book to everyone I know."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I'm now 8 month pregnant, and when I first got to know that I was pregnant, I was very excited but also very confused and scared. Naturally I headed straight to the bookstore and started to find a nice pregnancy guide book, which I wanted to buy JUST ONE! Well, I've seen this &quot;What to expect...&quot; then, but didn't buy it, since I thought it was TOO boring and TOO much! So I bought something else, more illustrated and colourful. Then about a month ago, someone gave me this book, and Ifound out that this was what I really needed. This &quot;What to expect...&quot; has every information that you seek, from serious abnormalities to stuffed and bleeding nose. Now I know what to recommend to a new mom-to-bes out there... This one's it! You'll never need anything else."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"Unfortunately, this book is appropriately named - it indeed trains you on \\"what to expect\\" - instead of teaching you how to expect better! I never recommend this book to participants in my childbirth class. Dr. Sears has great books and so does Sheila Kitzinger and Penny Simkin."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"The book is a little informative but, unrealistic, not my type of book. I don't recommend it to anyone!"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"Althoug this is the one you hear about over and over again, I have heard several doctors advise against it... now I know why. It is a lot of unnecessarily scary stories and &quot;what ifs.&quot; There are many better books out there. My personal favorite was the new one put out by the Mayo clinic."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I'm a first time Mom-to-be, and I must admit, the hype surrounding this book pushed me to purchase it, but I was somewhat disappointed. It's not the sort of book that held my attention, only because a lot of the information is oversimplified. If you have a simple a question about something and you need a general answer, this book is OK. But the format of question - answer, question - answer, just wasn't appealing at all. It's written in a boring and condescending tone. The month-by-month guide is misleading as well. There's great information, but not well organized in each month.If you don't know very much about your body or what pregnancy is about, then this may be an informative book for you to read. Otherwise, it's not as essential as everyone makes it out to be. Save your money. Don't buy this book."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"After hearing about this book for years, the first thing I did when I learned I was pregnant was to order a copy on Amazon, along with \\"The Girlfriend's Guide to Pregnancy.\\" Although I like the fact this book addresses a myriad of pregnancy concerns in a comforting \\"you are normal\\" sort of way, I found the science in it very lacking. I want to know exactly what's going on with the fetus and the pregnancy month-by-month in terms of hormones, organ development - general science. My problem with this book is that it seems to dumb down pregnancy into a to-do list and a catalogue of symptoms, instead of giving a good, solid scientific explanation of what's happening.Now, if you're looking to find out whether you're normal in that you're experiencing any number of things from swelling and bloating to belching, this book will certainly reassure you that you're not alone. But if you actually want to know what the heck is happening internally, for instance in terms of what hormones are higher and lower than normal, you'll have to find a more scientifically written book, which is what I'm planning to do.This is not to say that this book is not without value; I admire the authors for compiling a thorough and understandable catalogue of pregnancy do's, don'ts, and so on. But the reader who wants her material to have a little more scientific heft than your average issue of \\"Ladies Home Journal\\" will probably have to get other, supplemental books as well."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I originally bought this book for my 1st pregnancy &amp; it was a great guide month to month. I bought it again for my 3rd pregnancy &amp; I still liked it for refresher info. I recomend this book if you are in your 1st pregnancy."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"When I found out I was pregnant with my first I was so thirsty for information regarding pregnancy I bought this book at a book store due to the lack of selection they offered. I had skimmed through most of it, and found it a little disturbing. I then read through all of it and wanted to burn it. The advise that it gives is not what you need to read when you have so many unknowns. This book made me feel that if I did not subscribe to their philosophy of gestational living I was a bad person, and my baby would be less of a person because of it.When my sister in law became pregnant- single parent that she was- I told her specificlly not to get this book because of how horrible it would make her feel for not having a father right there with her throughout her pregnancy.The book did not give a large enough account of the &quot;what if's&quot; in pregnancy, rather it just gave you what you did wrong to make them happen. Having a my first born three months premature was scary enough, and having this book make me feel like it was something I did, didn't make it any better.If you are looking for real, practical, sound advise that is through andreassuring I recommend &quot;The Pregnancy Book&quot; by Dr. William Sears. Actually all the books in his library have been invaluable to me in raising out children.Bottom line- this book does not offer enough of the &quot;what to expect&quot; advise it proclaims it does."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"Being a first time mother, I practically grabbed this book off the shelf, when I first saw it. I should have known better and did some reviewing here. I would not recommend this book to anyone at all. It's so frighteningly STRICT! I think I would have failed in most aspects...and it was difficult to refer to. It's now used as a paperweight."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This book is not one I would ever recommend for someone to buy. The whole book is a book of questions and answers, which makes it very hard to find information. And the authors deal with topics in later months that can occur a lot earlier! And the questions aren't even ones that apply to a lot of people. For example, most of Chapter 3 deals with alcohol, smoking and drug use during pregnancy. It even has someone asking a question about occasional cocaine use!!!! Since books are usually arranged by topics of most importance, I certainly hope that the 3rd most important topic on my mind during my pregnancy wouldn't be occasional cocaine use!!! I wish I could take this book back!!!!"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I bought this and Girlfriends Guide to Pregnancy at the same time because I was warned by a friend that What to Expect can make you paranoid if this is your only source of information. My friend was right. HOWEVER, I have to say that I appreciate the thoroughness of this book. They seem to cover everything. My first pregnancy ended in miscarriage at 8 weeks and the information in this book actually helped me get through this time with a more realistic attitude. When I experienced bleeding during my current pregnancy, What to Expect provided some reassuring facts that prevented me from panicking (too much!). Just don't mistake this book for gospel and you'll find it very useful."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I first read this book when I was in my second month of pregnancy. I put it down and was immediately overcome with fear. I couldn't help but think that everything I was doing was wrong, and that I would ultimately suffer a miscarriage or have serious problems with the pregnancy.I understand the need to provide good information about risks and possible complications, but this book seems to revisit those topics over and over again. What not put the &quot;bad stuff&quot; in the same one or two chapters? I realize that the book covers pregnancy month by month, but some of the same information was covered over several months.I found the information about monthly checkups and physical/emotional changes to be informative, but I think the rest of the information could be better organized and presented in a less-threatening way. Afterall, this should be a happy time- and while pregnancy isn't always fun and easy, the first resource you turn to shouldn't make you doubt yourself as a mom-to-be."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I have had one prior miscarriage. I obtained my copy of WTEWYE for that first pregnancy. It was useful then for someone who had no idea of what she was facing. On my second pregnancy, because of my age and my fear of another miscarriage, I have found much better pregnancy guides with more information and less rabid recommendations about what to avoid and what to eat. However, it is a good general guide and should be used with another resource."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"It might be the first book you buy, but it shouldn'tbe the only book you acquire; I agree with those whofind it filled with &quot;gloom-and-doom&quot;. For instance,&quot;What To Expect&quot; tells you how to cheat on their&quot;Best-Odds Diet&quot; - you *can* eat sweets, but onlyif they're low fat and good for you! Also, yoursymptoms' timeline may not mimic the timelinein the text (or for that matter in anyone's text,)so following the &quot;What to Expect&quot;'s tenets religiouslycould cause you a great deal of anxiety if,say, you experience fatigue during your wholepregnancy instead of feeling a renewed senseof energy in the fourth or fifth month.Try Vicki Iovine's &quot;The Girlfriends' Guideto Pregnancy&quot; for the sense of &quot;everyone'sdifferent, but you'll most likely do okay&quot;that's missing in &quot;What to Expect&quot;."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"What to expect when your expecting is a must for every pregnant orthinking of getting pregnant woman should own. It was a book which I musthave looked in at least twice a day. It gives brief discriptions ofmost any question a woman can have.

I enjoy these also, mostly when my daughterdoesn't feel well."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"Though this book is given to pregnant women by many doctors andinsurance companies, it is not a comprehensive guide to pregnancyand childbirth. The format is easy to read, and gives you thebasics for what is happening each month. From talking to manypregnant women, I've heard that this book only begins to answertheir many questions, and I felt the same way. If you have atextbook pregnancy, and believe that doctors are gods,then this is the only book for you. Otherwise, read it yes, butmake sure you are reading other books too."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This is my first pregnancy and the repeated contradictions in this book left me more confused and with more questions then answers.

I reccomend this book to anyone who is pregnant. This book has been a bible to me throughout my first pregnancy and now my second. Each chapter is thorough and very well organized. I have read each chapter before I began that month and have found them to be both reassuring and informative. The book includes in it a preconception plan, information about choosing a doctor, childbirth alternatives, second pregnancies, twins, sex while you are pregnant, and coping with the common and not so common pregnancy symptoms. I especially found helpful the chapters about labor and delivery. Most of what it said did actually happen to me, although the book made some things sound worse than they are. Some parts can sound pretty scary, but you need to be prepared for the worst. There is also a chapter that covers what the fathers can expect! This chapter covers everything from mood swings to sympathy symptoms to bonding. My boyfriend also has read this entire book and tries to follow the tips and advice more than I do!Overall, i strongly reccomend this book to anyone who is planning to start a family. It is very helpful to have a guide to turn to whenever you have any kind of question at any time of the day!!!"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"Is it me? This book seems to be written at the 5th grade level. I would only recommend this to a 16 year old pregnant teenager. Wait, bad idea...she would likely read this propaganda, be so terrified of the beautiful natural experience she is about to go through that she would hate and fear pregnancy. I can't understand why this is the difinitive book to buy when you're pregnant. It is even printed poorly on pulp-ey looking paper with no color.

I stopped reading it very early on... talk about a dooms-day book! That book was filled with negative situations, instructed you to follow crazy diets (which makes you feel bad for NOT following them), and, again, I didn't think that a monthly update of what's going on was nearly often enough. It was good as a reference occasionally (when I needed to look something up), but didn't really have any information that I couldn't have gotten on a reputable medical website or by a quick call to my doctor.Like others have said, I TOTALLY do NOT understand why this book is known as the book that every pregnant woman should have! It will drive you crazy! Instead of continuing with this book, I bought \\"Your Pregnancy Week-By-Week\\" and LOVED it! In fact, I liked it so much, I'm reading it again with my second pregancy and have bought it as a gift for many expecting moms since discovering the book."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I have raised 54 children (foster parenting) and have several grandchildren and great nieces and nephews.

We went to the bookshop together and chose this book quickly as he was feeling a bit faint :) ... It had said 'over 10 million sold' so we figured it would be good. It was the only book I bought, and I'm sorry we chose it. I was having feelings of pressure in my abdomen and mild cramping, and when I checked the book all I got was blind reassurance that all was just fine. Furthermore, the symptoms for miscarriage or other complications were FAR too generalised to help most people out. I thought I was okay until I miscarried a few days later. According to the book, what happened fell closer into ectopic pregnancy, which it wasn't. The ER knew better and sent me home diagnosed as a spontaneous abortion in progress. This has been a very trying week and I suppose it would have been helpful to have had a slightly more enlightened, less patronising book at hand. Choose something, anything else."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This book was great!

Does it talk about natural births? No. However, most women don't have &quot;natural&quot; births, and if you are planning on having your baby this way, get a book tailored to your needs. Secondly, everyone is raving about fluffier books that don't &quot;scare&quot; women, but I've found those fluffy books to be full of misinformation and scarier than &quot;What to Expect&quot; is. The funny, light book &quot;Bun in the Oven&quot; just about convinced me that I should get rid of my indoor only cat because I could get taxoplasmis. Furthermore, all pregnancies DON'T go perfectly. If you're easily freaked out, then skip the chapter on high risk pregnancy. I will admit that the diet part is a little over the top but overall, I liked this book. I liked reading about questions other women had.

It creates much anxiety for the expectant mother and is not worth reading. It addresses common problems a mother may encounter during pregnancy but offers no simple solution. This is a medically biased book. It is more likely that a women will encounter the c-section knife after reading this book by being seduced by its many lures towards excessive trust in medical professionals. It gives absolutely no confidence in the mother to give birth the way mothers have done for thousands of years. Also the website is very demeaning. I visited the forums on the website and many of the women are conformist to the medical system and do not realize that doctors are hiding the truth about a women's ability to give birth naturally. The women in the forums who were advocates of What to Expect book and website were equally demeaning towards me and any mother who even considered natural home birth the old fashioned way.

A book I just bought and read that brought the data in What To Expect to life for me is called Pregnancy Stories: Real Women Share the Joys, Fears, Thrills and Anxieties of Pregnancy and The Girlfriend's Guide is another good companion.

According to this book, most issues/symptoms can be resolved through the &quot;Odds-On Diet&quot; and relaxing. Considering that the Odd-On Diet is very reductionistic and relaxing (while working full-time outside or inside of the home) is just not going to happen easily, I would suggest the authors provide some other advice. It appears that the Odds-On Diet is the cure for any pregnant woman --- which is extrememly inflexible and unrealistic.

Great book!"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"As part of the medical field, I find this book to be extremely informative in all aspects of pregnancy. However, I would like to see one very important piece of information added, listeria (listerosis). The book clearly covers toxoplasmosis and the means by which one can become infected. But, nowhere is there a listing of listeria. This food-borne bacteria is something that ALL pregnant women need to be aware of and watch for. I recently lost my triplets to this bacteria and I think this would be of the utmost importance to add to your book. I can honestly say that this is the number one book recommended by Doctors and pregnant women. I personally have read several pregnancy books and would still pick this book over the others. I will be looking for any revised issues that become avaliable.thank you"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"While I found this book very useful and very helpful, it didn't have information about the biggest problem I had during my pregnancy--severe morning sickness. I lost 20 pounds in the first six months because I was constantly nauseaous and had almost a total aversion to food. This book prides itself on being very comprehensive, but didn't cover this problem. The information about prenatal tests was helpful, though, and we used it to help us make some important decisions. I also felt the tone was good--not patronizing, demeaning, or too advanced. Overall, a good book, but there are some gaps."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"An overly-hyped book with lots of detail about problemns and complications of Pregnancy, which might help allay the fears of first-time mothers or hypochondriacs, but in general can provoke more worries than it soothes. The chapter for fathers is most appalling, giving tips on how men &quot;should&quot; approach their pregnant partners to tell them that they are disturbed by their weight gain, etc. Give us a break. The average ordinary woman has enough stress in our lives, pregnant or not, and we don't need a doomsday book or a book that prompts out partners to bring up issues that might be upsetting during this already emotional time.

But, the book answers questions that haven't been answered in other books, and I'm fortunate that my friends have a diverse collection to lend me. The authors are absolutely obsessive about food, and never do define the phrase &quot;natural goodness&quot;. In my experience, people who refer to &quot;natural goodness&quot; usually are not well informed about human nutrition. So I've dispensed with much of their dietary advice. There is no way I can adhere to that diet and yet I know I am eating healthily - just not by their definition!I"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I bought this book when I was expecting my first child (a daughter) and I read it regularly throughout the pregnancy. I felt so much more knowledgeable about pregnancy and more prepared for the actual birth of my child. When I was expecting my second child (a son) I thought I knew almost everything I needed to know about pregnancy, but of course I didn't, and I read the book again and learned so much more! I love how each step of the pregnancy is outlined month by month. The index is very comprehensive as well, so I could always look up whatever I wanted to know in a few seconds. The book is very easy to read and answered all my questions. I have also bought &quot;What to Expect the First Year&quot; and &quot;What to Expect the Toddler Years&quot; and I highly recommend all three books for all parents."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I was given this book at my first doctors appointment after I found out I was pregnant. I liked other books that I bought much better, and would not reccommend buying this one for yourself.

The diet they expect you to be on is a complete joke, and the book has kind of a preaching tone to it."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"If there were half stars available, i would give this book 3.5 stars instead of three. I liked this book, but i found it to be very short in description as to what happens each month.Since this is my first pregnancy, I was looking for a good book to reference for what i could expect each month and different ways to handle it. I found there to be more each month in a sort of &quot;Letter to the Editor&quot; fashion, than actual this is what to expect and this is how to deal with it. Which is more what i was looking for.But long lines of pregnant women in my life said this book would be a great starting place and it was, but it left me wishing for a bit more.I wouldn't say that i wouldn't recommend this book to someone in their first pregnancy, but i wouldn't use it as my only guide."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"Many been-there-done-that moms and some OBGYNs recommend this book to pregnant women. The reasons are not too difficult to comprehend.&quot;What to expect when you're expecting&quot; covers many common aspects of pregnancy, starting from pregnancy tests, diet, and choices available to month-by-month development, symptoms and delivery. Heidi Murkoff explains in the introduction of the book how most pregnancy related books tend to scare and explain the worst rather than reassure and explain. So, this book has been written to reassure and calm down parents-to-be. The author just about meets her goals. Some readers like to be &quot;informed&quot; and want to know everything that is happening or can happen to them. They will love this book. Others can easily get scared, upset, or distressed. They would be well advised to skip the section &quot;When something goes wrong&quot; which is towards the end of the book.The main attraction is the month-by-month question-answer format that explains what to expect, symptoms and concerns one may have during a particular month. The depth and breath of questions/answers change with each edition as the authors receive feedback from readers. Much of the information given here is available for free all over the Internet or from the doctor's office but this book consolidates in all this information at one place, which is quite helpful.That being said, the cute title of the book tends to convey the impression that this book will comprehensively cover all aspects of pregnancy, which is not true. It only addresses the most common questions and concerns. It would have been really nice to see some pictures as well, which are lacking. Sometimes the tone tends to get way too reassuring, which can be dangerous. E.g. in situations when you should follow your instinct and call the doctor but you become laid-back after reading the reassuring text. Also, sometimes the authors tend to make moms-to-be feel guilty about unintentional or once-in-a-while indulgences in food of their choice.The fact that this book is not written by a doctor does not take away anything from the helpful information it provides. But it also means that this book should be used as a supplement to rather than a replacement of your OBGYN's advice. This book should not be considered a bible and would be better read as a reference guide (with a grain of salt) instead of cover-to-cover. All in all this is a nice book that can be read by or recommended to the moms-to-be.Another book that is interesting and informative is &quot;The Girlfriend's Guide To Pregnancy&quot;."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I wanted a more hands-on, step-by-step guide to pregnancy. While the question/answer format was alright, it left me wondering about a multitude of other problems that might arise. I would have prefered a more guided reading."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"There are 6 Billion people on the earth right now. What percentage of their mothers followed the &quot;Best Odds Diet&quot;? This book has some OK information. However, if you are plaqued by morning sickness as I have been for 6 months, you can't follow any diet. While I do refer to this book, I roll my eyes at other parts. I would like to see one medical study that backs up the authors' claims that if you gain weight on healthy food you will have a big healthy baby, but if you gain weight on other food you will have a small baby. The book is just OK, and I wouldn't consider it an authoritative work, as there really isn't medical back up for the statements."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"As first time parents, we had a lot of questions when we found out we were pregnant...this was the first book we bought because it came highly recommended. This book provided some good information, but was divided up month by month, which I found disappointing and not very helpful. Plus, some of the advice, topics, etc I couldn't relate to, I felt that the book was written more for earlier generations than the current one. The Best Odds Diet is a JOKE...you spend more time planning every meal than you do anything else, it just wasn't possible for me to follow all the &quot;rules&quot; this book set for me. After seriously distressing me with the diet and it's scary &quot;what can go wrong&quot; topics, I decided to put this book up back on my shelf at the advice of my doctor and mom. Skip it."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"Although I feel there were many valid points in this book, I feel as though it scares many new expectant mothers. There were several times reading the book, that a symptom that is very normal, appeared horrific and I was forced to call my doctor to question what I was feeling. I realize the book is trying to help mothers understand what is going on in their bodies, but I feel as though the book should have made more clear distinctions about what is normal and what is excessive and worrisome. It can make you a paranoid pregnant woman."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"The reader could easily be panic and confused. Also, the same information can be easily find in any web page concerning pregnancy; nothing less nothing more."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I found this book to have some good information, but it was so negative that when I dared to read ahead, my husband came home and found me in tears. The best odds diet is the biggest joke I have ever read in my life (who wants to put wheat germ on everything they eat?) and it makes you feel horrible if you even think about eating anything sweet. It also needs to be updated badly. Imagine my suprise when I went into labor in my 25th week and ran to my what to expect bible only to read that the baby may survive after the 7th month, and I was only in my 6th. (baby is 3 years old and fine by the way) That was a very rude awakening and the beginning of my hatred of this so called &quot;wonderful book&quot;. Basically, it's a good book if you don't buy into the scare tactics of the authors. The follow-ups for the first year and the toddler years are better, but still have the best odds diet, which is almost more insane than the one in this book. All in all, find a different book as your basic source for information and use this one as a companion."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"....Or I would've been upset at wasting my money! There are MANY good reference books out there, but I didn't think this was one of them (and I bought a bunch of them to compare). I almost put down the book for good when I read page 81, in the &quot;Best Odds Diet&quot; chapter. This ridiculous, preachy chapter actually counseled me to stop and and ask myself before I take any bite of food, &quot;Is it good for the baby?&quot; If not, well, spit it out and eat some cauliflower. Ha! I was so darned sick the first three months of my pregnancy that I was thrilled to eat ANYTHING that tasted mildly pleasant. If my body said meat, mashed potatoes and gravy (which I rarely ate prior to pregnancy), then that's what it got. And guess what? Your body knows best (unless you're a hopeless junk food junkie). I had low iron, so I really craved meat. Later, I didn't want meat but craved veggies. In any case, the &quot;Best Odds Diet&quot; left me stone cold and tainted the rest of my view of this book. I think I'm pretty &quot;open-minded&quot; and intelligent, but I've got enough to think about in a first pregnancy without the added worry this book generates. If you get it, get some others so you will have a broader perspective."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"this book oversimplified our wondrous experience. It is also extremely conservative in its views, makes a future mother feel strange if she is not experiencing any of the topics discussed. Really not the best book out there - too informative on alarmist issues needlessly, and not informative enough about how the baby is growing and what that can cause the mother to feel."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This book, though recommended frequently, makes you feel guilty and unsure of everything you do.First, the nutrition guidelines are ridiculously rigid. The last straw for me was when they suggested that I bring my own wheat roll to business luncheons so I wouldn't eat the white ones.The other thing that bugs me is that they really insult my intelligence. Telling me that its ok to shave my legs! The phrase &quot;consult your practitioner&quot; must be in there about a thousand times.Also, knowing how common miscarriages are, I found it peculiar that they did not address m/cs in the first &quot;What you may be concerned about&quot; section.Everyone tells you to get this book, but I think it is highly overrated."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I live in Mexico and this is the first book I bought as soon as I found out I was pregnant. I like the book (as do many of my friends who have Spanish-language translations), but it is not what we would consider &quot;the bible&quot; of pregnancy. I have consulted it more than read it -- reading the chapters corresponding to the month of my pregnancy as well as the answers to specific questions as they come up. Unfortunately, there is some information missing and could give this book &quot;a lift&quot;. The only mention as to how your body is physically changing and how the baby is developing is in the little illustrations at the start of each &quot;monthly&quot; chapter and a few illustrations on how women carry differently. It would be nice to have a little more information and even some reference on the development of the baby, such as &quot;during week x the baby is developing its liver...&quot; Also, some conditions described are not exactlly accurate, such as! the description for abruption placenta, which discussed this condition towards the end of the pregnancy while I, and severaly women I know, have had this problem during the first and second trimesters, with treatment consisting of bed rest and progesterone and after about a month or two, they resume normal activity -- a far cry from the description offered in the book."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"If you haven't purchased this book yet, don't bother. If you have, toss it and look for something more accurate and empowering!The authors of WTE are in the medical field, and apparently of the &quot;Drs. are Gods&quot; mentality, which is obvious in their approach to the information they provide - they write as if all tests and interventions *must* happen during your pregnancy, and they are constantly looking for the &quot;problems&quot; that pregnancy causes. In their view, pregnancy is a disease to be treated as such, not a natural, normal occurance in the lifecycle of many women.Also, this and all of the other WTE books are so full of misinformation, subtle and glaringly obvious! While I read it with some interest and some disgust during my first pregnancy, I ignored it completely during my second, and threw it away after my third. (I refused to give this book away, and risk spreading more of their misinformation to unsuspecting mothers-to-be.)If you are looking for a book that will inform and empower you throughout your pregnancy, try &quot;The Pregnancy Book&quot; by William and Martha Sears. They also have other books to take you through the birth and care of your baby, with proper information and a &quot;you know yourself/your baby best&quot; attitude. A far cry from the drivel published in the WTE books!"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I found this book to be short on really useful information. The &quot;expectations&quot; for each month were nearly identical and the tone often depressing. After reading this book you will wonder why it is you wanted to be pregnant in the first place.If you want a thorough and helpful book on pregnancy, with discussions on possible complications without raising undue alarm, with answers to all of the 1,000 questions every pregnant woman has, then buy &quot;Your Pregnancy Week by Week.&quot;"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"While this book gives good information about, say, the sizeof the fetus and some possible symptoms of pregnancy(as well as what they might mean), it had a really narrow approach to pregnancy and some unlikely solutions to problems. For example, in the chapter on colds and flu during pregnancy, one recommended remedy was hot diluted orange juice. If you're not throwing up from morning sickness or the flu, hot diluted orange juice will definitely upset your stomach! I also disliked the &quot;Do it our way or no way&quot; attitude. Overall, I'd say this book created almost as much anxiety in me as it relieved."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"So tell me something good about being pregnant. You won't find one good thing about being pregnant in this book. Pregnant women who read this book are the ones you hear the horror stories from their spouses about how blubbery, paranoid, and demanding they were during pregnancy. There are SOOOO many better books to read than this one. Really it is the worst one out there.I got this book when I became pregant because EVERYONE has this book, it is the most popular pregnancy book out there. So I started reading it and EVERYONE who commented on my reading the book also said, \\"I hated that book, don't believe one word in it.\\" When I went in for my first appointment with my midwives they gave me another book and it was the exact opposite of this book and above and beyond better in all shapes and forms.

I know how I'm feeling...I don't need to know how other women are feeling."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This book was just given to me by a friend. It's my second pregnancy book and I was so excited to have a new one to read, I just ran home and started right away. Man was I disappointed. I feel judged by this book. It makes me more paranoid than anything and I'm pretty much bored out of my mind. This all from someone who usually loves to absorb anything pregnancy related, even before becoming pregnant. I've tried to give it more than one chance and was even told by my Doctor to stop reading it since I'm losing sleep over it. The only good thing about this book is the amount of information. So if you enjoy a dry, boring, judgemental read, then I recommend this."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"Everyone I know recommends this book ... probably because it has been around the longest and people didn't bother researching other books. There are MUCH better pregnancy books out there! Don't spend your money on this one unless you want to hear all the possible complications with pregnancy. Try &quot;Your Pregnancy Week By Week&quot; by Curtis instead! :)"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"So many people rave about this book, and I can't figure out why. I checked many pregnancy books out at the library before deciding which ones I wanted to purchase. I am REALLY glad I didn't just go out and buy this one.It is quite basic, and if you're ignorant about the basics of how your body works during pregnancy (nothing to be ashamed of) you may find this book informative. It is arranged in a month-by-month format. It has descriptions of your baby at each month as well as how you may look and feel. It also describes what to &quot;expect&quot; at each prenatal visit with your doctor/midwife, which is one of my complaints.I particularly disapprove of how this book sets up parents to accept whatever their caregiver (doctor or midwife) tells them, rather than to be informed consumers who exercise informed consent and informed dissent of obstetric interventions. If you read other books, especially with statistics on how high infant mortality is in the U.S., you'll realize that many labor and birth complications are iatrogenic--caused by the doctor &quot;doing something&quot; when s/he should've just waited for the mother's body to do its work.The tests and procedures available to pregnant women are described as routine and necessary, and there is practically no discussion about why you might refuse them.I did read the book in its entirety, and it was fun to look at drawings of what my baby may look like at various stages. I think their eating plan is wise and within reason (I believe MANY health problems in the U.S. are caused by poor eating habits). I'm surprised that so many women are unwilling to even attempt to improve their diet while pregnant. The authors do provide good rationale for a healthy diet and allow some wiggle room for treats and cravings.Overall, if you're looking for the type of birth your mother had and want birth to be something that happens to you rather than something you do, you might like this book. If you're looking for an alternative, check out &quot;The Birth Book&quot; by Sears, and books by Sheilia Kitzinger, Penny Simkin, and Susan McCutcheon."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This book is old and it's information is outdated.

Instead, it has kept me awake at night with anxiety attacks about gaining too much weight, the toxic fumes from the housecleaning I did before I knew I was pregnant, exercising too much, exercising too little, etc. etc. The preachy, condescending tone is unforgivable and rude -- just when you need a little hand-holding, this book tells you how evil you are if you do normal-person things like eat a little junk food (How laughable is the &quot;Have a piece of cake or some junk food once a month&quot; advice? I'll eat whatever doesn't make me gag, thank you very much.) How about a little support and reassurance during a scary time? Jeez. Nope, this book is going right back to the bookstore. I like the &quot;Girlfriend's Guide&quot; much better, but I want a more &quot;medical&quot; reference book to get me through the next few months. Any suggestions?"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"If you want to have anxiety about being pregnant and a complex about your intelligence, then this book is for you. I found the tone condescending and rude, and the last thing a pregnant woman needs is to be &quot;talked at&quot; like that! For example, the book warns that if you eat right and gain 25-30 pounds, then you should snap right back to your former shape, but if you &quot;overindulge&quot; you will gain too much weight and there's little hope of losing it! Well, throughout my life I've always eaten right and maintained a healthy weight and figure. During my pregnancy, I was no more hungry and did not eat any more than before, and certainly I was not &quot;overindulgent,&quot; but I still managed to gain 50 pounds! Sorry, but the only way I could have kept to the recommended 25-30 pounds would have meant depriving me and my baby of adequate nutrition (and I did not have preeclampsia, either). Having a complex about the weight gain would have been neither useful nor productive. While I'm NOT offended by the recommended range of weight gain, I was extremely offended by the assumption that anyone who gains more is OVERINDULGING! But this is only one example of the useless, anxiety-provoking hogwash that is so prevalent in this book. The question and answer format is also really annoying-- it assumes pregnant women are too stupid to ask intelligent questions, and the tone of the answers often chide (for example, answers typically begin with a &quot;personally-directed,&quot; smart-mouthed exclamation) instead of just providing a straight answer without the emotion. To top it off, in the &quot;going to the hospital&quot; checklist, the authors have the gall to recommend bringing their book! For one thing, due to its format, it wouldn't be easy to find the info you need quickly, especially while in labor! Secondly, the information is too elementary to be helpful anyway. No thank you. In place of this book, I recommend books by William and Martha Sears, Sheila Kitzinger, and Janet Balaskas. Any of those would give you much more information about how your body and pregnancy processes work, with a format that would also be easily accessible during labor and delivery. Good luck to Moms out there!"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This is a great book for a first time pregnancy.

Well size isn't everything, especially not in this case.It is important to keep a healthy diet during pregnancy, but the diet this book suggests is insane. No one could follow it. Half a bagel as a treat? Vegetarian sushi is only okay as long as you opt for low sodium soy sauce? If I had miscarried, and my only source of information was this book, I would have assumed my miscarrige was caused by some trivial dietary mistake, and never have forgiven myself.The diet isn't the only thing about this book that is ridiculous, for one, the book suggests that if you are in active labor you should pass the time by cooking casseroles for your mate. Suuure....I'll get right on that..maybe I should carry a mop into the kitchen with me so I can mop my amniotic fluid off the floor while I'm cooking."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I am amazed at all the bad reviews that are listed here. Yes, the \\"What to expect\\" series are very to the point and very detailed. They explain everything because anything really could happen. If you are worry prone and think that everything bad in pregnancy will happen to you, then do not buy this book.After I purchased this book with much anticipation I read through it and highlighted anything I knew would apply to me during my pregnancy. This helped a great deal and as I was pregnant I mostly read the highlighted parts. I didn't take too seriously the things that didn't apply. I loved this book becuase of the segments. It goes through step by step by month in detail as the what to expect and how to handle it. This is the case for the \\"First year\\" too. (I am excited to now buy the \\"Toddler years\\" now that my 10 month old is coming up on her first birthday.)I also researched a fair amount of books from friends recommendations and doctors. This is the very best I've found. It is easy to look something up in a hurry from the table of contents and very simply states whatI need to know at that time.FYI-Another recommendation that is fun to read after the baby is born is \\"The Diaper Diaries\\" by Cynthia L. Copeland. We all need humor during those first 6 months and Cynthia states it well."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This book plain makes your parinoid.

Now I wish I did more research. This book is very informative in a month by month of your pregnancy in a FAQ format. Although, I didn't really care for this format. It feels disorganized to me, and I don't really care for the text book approach. As a first time mother, I like to hear about other mothers and their experience. But you will not get that here. This book is informative rather than encouraging or supportive as the other books. I would also have enjoyed more pictures. My biggest problem with this book was the diet they suggested you follow. It was too detailed and complicated. Too difficult to follow, especially for someone who never thought twice to what she ate before she became pregnant. I found the pamphlet that the doctor gave to me much more useful."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I had mixed feelings when I originally saw the reviews on this site, however, I purchased the book anyways. This is my third pregnancy and I just wanted to learn a little more about all the options and numerous tests I have been taking, and learn anything that is new from the last pregnancy.This book took care of all that for me, and gave me things to watch out for... with the strong statement that if I do notice these symptoms, they could be nothing... better safe than sorry, and check them out. I was happy to see the features that described all the different labor techniques, emergencies, choices, and more. I didn't find this book frightening, as some of the other reviewers did. Perhaps because I've had other children. Nevertheless, I think it is an excellent book and reference book for the ever changing topic of pregnancy. What others need to understand is that while childbirth and pregnancy is a natural event, there are still some dangers involved and it's important to know about them, and know the symptoms, as well as know how to take care of yourself during your pregnancy. Don't let this book scare you, if you are not the kind of person that likes to know your risks, than don't read this book. If you are a person that likes to take control of your pregnancy, knowing the risks and rewards, and understanding every aspect of your pregnancy and body changes, than this book is perfect for you. It all comes down to how much information you really want. Also, this book is not all about the risks... there is much information about the joys and wonderful experiences of pregnancy, as well. Take this information into consideration and make your own choice. The mixture of these reviews varies tremendously, from one star ratings to five, and the reason is the level of knowledge some of these people want to know about. Pregnancy is a joyous moment, and if you cannot learn the risks and still be happy throughout your pregnancy, select a doctor that will take over your worrying, and tell you only what you need to know. Otherwise, I believe this book to be very thorough and comprehensive."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"Like other reviewers this book became my bible. I actually bought this book when I was first pregnant. Two miscarriages later and pregnant for the 3rd time this book was on hand at all times. I was constantly worried and fearful that I was going to miscarry for a third time. This book helped me ease my fears when I looked up something and found my symptom or worry was perfectly normal.The book covers everything from conception, symptoms of pregnancy, month by month of your pregnancy, labour, birth and then a section for \\"when something goes wrong\\" (only read if something does go wrong - you don't want to cause yourself unneccesary worry), and a section for new dads. Each month, rather than just a heading for a topic they have people's questions and they were answered with plenty of general information. I found that finding certain topics was really easy - the book was laid out well.My ob/gyn was of course my first point of contant for any fear or worry - but those times in the middle of the night when I just needed to get to sleep, this book was my warm milk!"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I am very pleased with this book, I found it to be very informative and helpful and very interesting to read. It helped me understand what was going on. I have recommended this book to other expectant mothers and they have told me the same thing that they found it to be very useful. It was my pregnancy bible I couldn't put it down,there was always a question and I always found the answer if the answer wasn't there I would write it down and ask my Doctor about it when I saw her the next visit. I found it to be more of a guide then an instructional manual. Every part of this book allowed me the choice of how I was going to care for myself during this pregnancy and what steps to take if something was not feeling right. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO ALL MOTHERS TO BE! Gave mine away recently now I need one again for the second one on it's way. I Loved the book, I hope you do too. :^)"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"As firsttimers, my wife and I found this book to be invaluable. Anything that happened throughout the pregency from start to finish we found in this book. In my opinion this is a MUST HAVE book. Personally as a first time dad, it gave me the big picture on what was happening to my wife from week to week. I cant say enough about this book."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I had read many pregnancy books before and I found WTEWYE to be the best as it deals with almost every aspect of pregnancy that I went through. I miscarried several times before and this book helped me to think positive and taught me to take better care of myself. I referred to it through out my pregnancy and also after delivery. It prepared me mentally and physically to go through labor pain and gave us (husband and wife) some insights on our baby's monthly physical development in the womb. I like the way the chapters are arranged; which are according to months and not topics. The dos and don'ts during pregnancy and the kinds of food to avoid while breastfeeding are the best parts of the book. I would definitely recommend this book to any parents-to-be."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This book gives you everything you need to know, and lots that you don't! And it's so bossy and opinionated. For a good laugh, I loved the parody of this book, &quot;Expect the Unexpected When You're Expecting!&quot; by Glick, et. al."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I don't understand why this book is so ubiquitous as a pregnancy guide; I found it alarmist, more likely to scare a newly pregnant woman than anything. Let's face it; a lot of guidelines for pregnancy self-care are common-sensical and already well known. I also bought \\"Your Pregnancy Week-by-Week and found a MUCH more pleasant and informative read. I'm ready to burn this book and will never recommend it to my friends."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"Being that the unnecessary worry thing is already covered by other reviews, I have just two comments on this book. 1. It is organized by month. Sounds like a good thing. However, since there is much that you need to know beforehand and they want the months to be roughly similar in length, they move a good deal of material later in the book. For instance, foods to avoid shows up in month 5 with the caveats that these foods should never be eaten during the pregnancy. Not so much a warning as a time bomb when you get to month 5. 2. There is a serious mischaracterization of miscarriage. The book oddly takes a comforting tone for once and tells the mother that they will \\"know\\" is something goes wrong. From friends and family, that is a baldfaced lie that tends to make ultrasounds more shocking. This book is a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and worry, signifying nothing. Put another way, no doctors are listed as authors or editors. Figure out from that what you expect from what to expect . . ."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"Everyone calls this the \\"bible of pregnancy books\\" and I almost agree. It's an extrememly thorough, very detailed description of what you might go through during your pregnancy. It covers basically every conceivable (pardon the pun) problem, event, symptom, etc. that might arise during a pregnancy.It covers a wide range of options that you have during your pregnancy and birth that a lot of women might not know are available to them. This book does help enable the expecting mother to really take control of what she wants from the pregnancy and birthing experience.I am pregnant with my second child and though I had an amazing experience the first time, I am really trying to prepare myself for what I want the 2nd time around. This book is helping me to do that.My only complaint with this book is that during the first couple of chapters on the first few months of pregnancy, the author feels the need to mention abortion every other paragraph. In my opinion (and I know others may not feel the same way), if I'm looking at possibly getting an abortion, I'm not going to buy a book on what to expect during a pregnancy.All in all, this book is a great addition to an expecting woman's library and it is extremely helpful. Although I would not recommend it as being the ONLY book to buy if you are expecting."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"After reading some of these reviews, I wasn't sure if this book was right for me, expecting my first child. Would it be too scary? Well, someone was kind enough to surprise me with this book as a gift, so I didn't have to make the decision to buy it. I was pleasantly surprised! Yes, there is a section called \\"Of Special Concern,\\" because let's face it, there are complications associated with pregnancy. But it's good to be apprised of these things. Overall, I found this book to be very practical and informative. And, believe it or not, comforting. I am 8 weeks along and will be referencing this book throughout my pregnancy and beyond, as there is a post-partum section also. I only wish the book was broken down by week instead of month.Don't let negative reviews keep you from at least taking a look at the book yourself."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"Anytime I had any problems during pregnancy I turned to this book. It was highly recommended by the OB, in fact if I asked something the nurses would say \\"Do you have What to Expect when Expecting?\\".This book is so wonderfully organized! Some of the questions seemed silly to me, but 'no questions are silly' right?!?Enjoy this book!"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I always wanted this book. Now on my fourth child I'm greatful for the info that I have found in this book. The info has been great and I found that I find out things I didn't know. A first time mom to be would find this book great or any mom to be."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"As a woman with an 8 week old., I can't tell you how much I referred to this book. It was so exciting to get to every new month of pregnancy and read it. I never allowed myself to go ahead of where I was out. So it was always a special treat when I reched a new month to read a new chapter! This book has so much information. I walked into all of my doctors appointments prepared. It's the one book to have on your bed stand!"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"What to Expect When You're Expecting gives a month by month description of fetal development as well as a description of the changes that are occurring in a pregnant woman's body. I had many questions with my first pregnancy. This book helped me sort through what was normal and what was not. It provided answers to every question that I had. It also took a lot of the mystery out of what labor and delivery would be like.I recommend this book for anyone who is expecting a first baby. I read it cover to cover when I was pregnant with my first child. With my second, I used it as a reference book to chart the progress of my developing baby and resolve some of the problems I had with nursing after he was born."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This book is very informative. It covers everything you need to know while pregnant. However, if you are one who constantly worries if you or your baby are o.k. This book is not for you. It tells you everything that could possibly go wrong with your pregnancy. I found Pregnancy Week By Week just as informative and not as scary."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"While probably containing valid and scientifically correct information, I doubt that even 5% of pregnant women are able to follow the suggestions in this book. This is most apparant in the insanely strict diet guidelines and alarmist presentation of what can go wrong. Also I mistrust any pregnancy publication that does not adequately prepare you for the pain of childbirth."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"When we got pregnant, we bought and read something like 15 books. This one was the best by far.I can think of at least three reasons this book has sold so many copies.1> It's professional. A lot of books try too hard to be funny or cute. WTE is not humorless, but it deals with subject matter in a refreshingly straightforward way. The advice and help given echoes what our doctors have said and, in fact, answered most of our questions before we even saw our Obstetritian (no, it's not a substitute). It is quite astounding how many pregnancy books are written by fashion magazine editors or talk show writers; they sound exactly like they were written for a fashion magazine or talk show.2> It's complete. Got a question about diet, medication, flu shots, cat ownership, false labor, vitamin supplements, cramps, ultrasound, breastfeeding or how to judge your OB/GYN? It's in here, along with tons of other stuff we didn't think about until we came across it here.Just about every pregnancy book and magazine uses the \\"What Nobody Will Tell You\\" tagline. Once you've read this book, there will be very few surprises left. There isn't a topic that isn't touched on and most are covered in depth. That's not to say this is the only book you need, but it goes a long, long way.3> It isn't judgemental. There are a ton of books out there that are weight obsessed, make assumptions about single parents, and/or skirt some issues that some consider controversal. This book assumes you can make up your own mind once you're presented with all the information. I'm thinking specifically about the decision to have amniocentesis our geneticist said it was \\"a good idea but not necessary\\" and OB/GYN said \\"there were risks but it is not a bad idea\\". This book wasn't a replacement for our doctors, but it gave us a lot of really useful information without taking a side.---Like I said, there are a ton of pregnancy books out there. Just about all of the ones we read were redundant when we held it up next to WTE. And it's pretty shocking how many pregnancy books we found to be completly WORTHLESS! I don't want to name names, and I've already written a couple of negative reviews, but I'm thinking particularly of the ones full of Erma Bombeck-esque anecdotes about La Maz classes, the \\"staying chic while you're pregnant\\" fashion mag type, the old-fashioned preachy church lady books, or--worst of all--the \\"nutrition\\" books that focused almost entirely on weight. Some of these books are written by people with no medical qualifications at all!My advice is to feel free to pick up one of those books if you're looking for some comic relief or if your specific pregnancy may need a supplement (I'm thinking specifically of things like fertility problems, or problem pregnancies; WTE gives a lot of good information on this stuff, but might not be enough).Either way, BUY THIS BOOK!! Even if you're not pregnant yet, you're missing out on an excellent reference if you don't.- - -As an aside, I was pretty shocked to read the reviews that complained about WTE containing a lot of information on rare pregnancy situations, saying that such information was \\"scary\\" and \\"unnecessary\\". WTE gives plenty of information on what is serious as opposed to what is a false alarm. Nobody PLANS on having a troubled pregnancy, aren't you better off knowing what's involved and how to detect and prevent such things?I suppose for some people ignorance is bliss, but I'm MUCH happier being prepared.What To Expect While You're Expecting isn't the only useful pregnancy book out there, but it is the best and it will be the standard for years to come."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"My sister bought this book for me when I told her I was pregnant. I didn't think much about it, but then I started having those normal pregnancy things that happen. You know the pains you didn't know where normal, the acid reflux, the gas.....The real attractive part of pregnancy. When I would feel these, I would turn to whatever month I was on and read. It lists all the things you should expect, the things to expect at your doctors visit and the progress of the baby. It also has a section on some of the things that can go wrong in pregnancy and early signs or ways to cope. For example, I was diagnosed with gestational diabetes and this book had a section on it. It helped me deal with the problem. This book goes all the way through to labor and birth. Also, each monthly chapter has a Q and A area of what is probably the most frequently asked questions. I found that 90% of the time it answered my concerns. I didn't sit down and read this like a book, but used it as a reference. I found it very helpful to have around."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I read SEVERAL pregnancy books and while this one wasn't one of the entertaining ones, it covered every possible problem or question I had. I did think it was a little &quot;strict&quot; in some areas, like the &quot;best odds&quot; pregnancy diet, but if you are brutally honest with yourself, you have to admit that it is what it is- the diet that gives your baby the &quot;best odds&quot; of being born healthy. It doesn't try to sugar coat issues to make everyone happy. (And it didn't stop me from enjoying fast food a couple times a week, or make me feel guilty about it!) I especially liked the month by month breakdown of what is happening with your baby and your body. Get this book for the facts, and then get the &quot;Girlfriends Guide to Pregnancy&quot; to make you laugh and feel justified for being normal."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"Guys - if someone told you to buy this in order to be a supportive husband, then, like me, you'll do it regardless of this review. Yes, it contains useful information about pregnancy, but if you are like me then picking it up will be more labor than delivery of your child. The authors' problem is trying to cover every conceivable ache and pain associated with pregnancy, and there are ALOT, and provide a technical explanation while dumbing it down so the average kindergartener would not get overwhelmed reading it. There are much better books on the market; save your cash."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I wasn't going to write this until I read all of the reviews calling this book scary. I didn't get that at all. I received the book as a gift and read it pretty quickly. It is organized by month and since all symptoms or problems don't happen at the same time for everyone, I find my self using the index and finding the information that way.The thing that dropped a star for me is the diet. I already quit smoking and cut down my caffeine. I am not following the diet.The only thing that is scary is the section for Serious Problems, etc. But it says on the first page of the section not to read it if you are not having problems."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I am in such strong disagreement with the reviewers who found this book &quot;bossy&quot; and to be coming from a man's judgemental perspective that I was compelled to write this review. I used this book each and every day during pregnancy - to answer a silly question about clumsiness as well as to learn more about complex issues, like what to expect from the birthing process. The book is always medically correct (my husband is a dr) but uses everyday language to explain things clearly and logically.The diet and exercise sections, which have come under special attack by our reviewers, are definately stricter than would be convienient. But, you know best your habits and what will work for your lifestyle. Like all important decisions, educate yourself about the options, and do what works best for you. However, given Americans' horrible diet and exercise habits, maybe we should all pay a little more heed to their advice both during pregnancy and after.Don't be scared off by the negative reviews as I was at first. I choose to buy another book based on these reviews, then was given this book as a gift. Thank goodness, since it is the best resource I have. This book has been a standard for decades for good reason - it's great."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I don't know why all the other mothers hate this book. I found it very informative and unbiased.Everytime I had a specific question, I looked it up in the index and then read the info.I did not follow the Best Odds Diet. But I don't have a problem with them offering it as a suggestion.I know women can think for themselves these days, however, sometimes I needed reassurance or questions answered through pregnancy. If you are looking for a book to follow by the letter- this is not for you. If you are looking for a book to reference to with your questions- this is it! Plus, I liked all the personalized charts in the back."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"While this is a good book to use as a point of reference, I would not suggest using it for anything else. It has a lot of worst case scenarios leaving a person who worries a lot to freak out a bit. I would only suggest this as a reference book."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"Like many others, I am surprised at how many bad reviews this book is getting. So many people are complaining about the diet. I haven't followed the &quot;best odds diet&quot; religiously, but it does give good advice on how to eat healthy and yes that may mean changing some of your eating habits. I have been eating relatively healthy for years and didn't find that the tips in this book limited me (though it may limit those who eat fast food frequently) and if I disagreed, I consulted several nutrition books and my doctor. Plus this book offers alternative recipes for some generally unhealthy favorites (french fries, non-alcoholic beverages, ect. .) This book gave straight-forward information and helped me to realize that a lot things that would have worried me otherwise were completely normal for pregnancy. There is no one book that can be a &quot;pregnancy Bible&quot; and you have to look to many different resources (parents, friends, and doctors). Every woman's pregnancy is different and this book will not cover everything, but I found it to be realistically helpful as I tracked my pregnancy. (It doesn't give extensive info on the baby's development. It focuses more on what is happening with the mother's body.) I would definitely buy it along with other pregnancy resources."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"My wife and I really liked this book, except for the Best Odds diet, which was insane. I liked this comment from the Best Odds Diet for Men, which was in Breathe! A Guy's Guide to Pregnancy:&quot;...The Best Odds Diet for women recommends twenty-eight servings of healthy protein and vitamin-rich food every day. 28 servings! Whoa! That's pretty much everything within reach. The take-home rule: when your wife's eating, keep your hands clear.&quot;"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"When I became pregnant with my first child, someone suggested I buy this book. Thank you to that nurse. When I got pregnant a second time, it was to this book I turned to for information. When I had complications, it was this book that helped me understand what was happening, why and some possible considerations.I walked into each Dr. appt. prepared with an idea of what tests he would do, what questions he would ask and what he would look for. More importantly, I knew what kinds of questions I needed to be asking.Having something that explained what was happening to my body and to my baby each month, took much of the mystery out of being pregnant. I particularly liked how the information is continually updated through revisions and editions.I will admit that the diet stuff is a bit much. However, I didn't think there was a lot of diet information in this book, mainly because there is the compainion book &quot;what to eat when you're expecting.&quot;I strongly suggest that if you are pregnant, you buy this book. This is one book I haven't loaned out or given away. I truly expect to be turning to it again sometime (soon I hope?!)"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I thought it was a very precise and informative book from what you were going to go through the first month and the natal development that went along with that month. Plus, the questions from each section was very helpful as well. The diet portion wasn't too helpful for me. Also, the note section was very helpful as well. To keep track of your pregnancy."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I thought this was a very good book. I read it all the time during my first pregnancy and also through my second pregnancy. They have a lot of information in it. Whatever you are going through in pregnancy it is in this book. I did not have a computer at that time during my pregnancies so I thought the book was quite good on answering my questions and easing my fears. I liked the month to month descriptions of what is happening to me and what is happening to my baby and the questions that I may be wondering at that time of the month. I suggest this book to all of my friends when they become pregnant and I suggest it to you to."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I got this book the first time I got pregnant. I miscarried. My second pregnancy was normal and healthy, despite my diabetes. No, I did not follow THEIR diet, but it is possible to not eat sugar -- thousands of diabeteics do it daily. I consulted WTEWYE during my third pregnancy, until I lost that baby at 19 weeks due to birth defects. 1% or 2% of people having major problems may sound small, but they DO DO DO happen. By my fourth pregnancy, I did not need the book so much, but I did consult it.Why do people have trouble disregarding the parts they don't want to use? I never followed the diet, I just skipped over those parts. I lived in a very rural area during my pregnancies, and this book provided good answers to many of my pregnancy questions. Yes, there are other resources, but don't drop this one completely."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"If you only buy one pregnancy book, this is the one MUST have. Laid out in a question/answer format, this pregnancy bible starts with &quot;Are you Pregnant?&quot; and ends with &quot;Six Weeks Postpartum.&quot;Every imaginable topic is covered, from how to handle spotting to what if you had a few alcoholic drinks before you knew you were pregnant. Each chapter starts with a diagram of what you may look like during that month (yes, your breasts will get that big!), what you may be feeling (exhaustion and nausea are not just in your head), and what you can expect at this months check-up (hearing your babies heartbeat for the first time will be the sweetest sound you've ever heard!).Once you purchase this book, you will not be able to go more than a few days at a time without picking it up for a quick peek. Keep it in the bathroom, where you will spend most of your time for the next nine months. By the time your nine months are up, you will have read this gem cover to cover and you'll be ready to start reading &quot;What to Expect the First Year.&quot;"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I read this book with my first baby. The only good thing I can say about this book is, that my birth after reading it made me open my eyes. I learned nothing about birth from this book, in fact it's lack of information set the stage for a tramatic and horrid birth because of my lack of understanding and knowledge of labor and birth.For my second pregnancy I read only books that informed me about birth such as Dr. Sears' books and others that had real information in them.Pass this book up and read ones that will help you have a happy and memorable pregnancy and birth."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"Although this book is somewhat informative, for the first four months of my pregnancy I felt like a failure! My husband hid this book from me because I constantly worried about miscarriage, diet, etc. I am a very healthy woman who has gained &quot;more than my share&quot;. I think the diet advice and weight restrictions are totally ridiculous and unrealistic and I would not recommend this patronizing excuse for a pregnancy guide to anyone who is having a baby. This book has sent me in tears more than once to my OB/GYN because as a normal, working, first-time expectant mother I simply cannot live up to these rigid guidelines. Only when I stopped reading &quot;What to expect...&quot; did I feel more relaxed and confident in my role as an expectant mother, and I stopped obsessing over my baby's well-being. My advice? Trash it and get Dr. Miriam Stoppard's &quot;Conception, Pregnancy, and Childbirth&quot;."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"Since my wife and I found out we were expecting, we've been avid readers of our copy of &quot;What to Expect When You're Expecting&quot;. True that an important part of the content is devoted to the fears and &quot;things that could go wrong&quot; but the fact is that when you don't have information it is fear about the unknown precisely. I find the way the book is presented, in a kind of Question and Answer way, to be very easy to follow. If you zoom out a bit more, you find a predictable structure to every chapter each of which corresponds to a month of the pregnancy, so you can't get lost here. If you want more of an issue, there's normally at least two answers dealt with. If you only have limited time to read something, it's put together in such a way that you can skim through it without missing out on a lot.All in all, it takes you by the hand as you learn more about the mother's body and the changes she's undergoing, the baby's growth and what to expect when, as well as what the fathers feel and fear during these forty beautiful weeks. Get it and join the &quot;secret&quot; club of the pregnant couples who already have it: at least I felt that way when I got it. Before you're pregnant this is one of those books you will never hear about. Once the word is out, EVERY single person who's already a parent will recommend it."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I read alot of the reviews about this book, and I'm glad I didn't listen to them. This is a great book! I read it every day. True, it has a lot of information that you may never need about complications, but I'm just curious, and not easily spooked, so I enjoyed learning. It also breaks down pregnancy into every stage which helps you prepare for what's next. So what if the author is a little biased towards health food? When you're pregnant, EVERYONE has an opinion, and feels they can just give it to you, so this is nothing different. I just ignored the opinions, and used the information that seemed helpful. A good resource!"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This book is a big disappointment. It reads like it was written by editors for a teen magazine. Its endless use of acronyms, abbreviations and euphemisms are terribly annoying. The information in the book is geared more towards women interested in a more modern approach to childbirth as opposed to those looking for a natural alternative. There are some bits of useful information, but most of it can be found on the author's website. Why buy the book when you can access the same information for free?"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"this book is excellent even for those of us who are still just thinking about having a baby its really informative and really helpful.

A \\"refreshing\\" reference on your third - if you still have time even to scrath your head."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I like the book, it's a good series for general rules or troubleshooting problems with raising a child. My only real complaint is that you can read one passage saying one thing and another two pages later saying the opposite. For me it's a general how you can run your life, not a \\"this is how to parent\\" type of book. Best part is trouble shooting issues with my newborn.I guess if my wife didn't think the book was the end all be all I'd be happier with it. It's not fun saying you read something and then being told the book said otherwise, and having to go back and forth to say \\"It's up to us to decide what to do, not the book\\" and cross referencing the differences to answer questions."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I don't see why so many people have a problem with this book. Yes, it talks about \\"worst case scenarios\\" and many things that may scare you, but that's such a small part it. And I would much rather be prepared for these things that caught off guard. It's a great month-by-month guide on what to expect when pregnant. It shows you how the baby is developing, lists possible symptoms and other changes in the woman's body, and discusses in depth the many questions we have about illness, caffeine, smoking, dying your hair and whatever else. It's fantastic! I read a little almost every day, and many parts over and over. I love knowing what to expect at each stage of my pregnancy...especially this being our first. A warning for men: this book is written for women! It has many concerns that you may not be so worried about, but we are! My husband loves this book, but it even annoys him at times. I suggest \\"The Expectant Father: Facts, Tips and Advice for Dads-to-Be,\\" by Armin A. Brott for the daddies. My husband loves it. I bought \\"What to Expect When You're Expecting\\" as suggested by a friend, and I would highly recommend it for any woman. I bought many pregnancy books, and this is pretty much the only one I still read. Keep in mind it's a GUIDE, not a definitive Bible for pregnancy. Every woman's pregnancy is different. But if you want all the possibilities in pregnancy, one month at a time, then this is your book."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"Excellent Book...Has what ever you need to know..Was a great help to me and my wife for our first baby"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I got this book even before i got the postive pregnancy test. My only complaint is that some of the questions women ask are so dumb, but i guess at some point someone will think of it and this book will answer them. Other problem is that some questions aren't always going to apply to your type of situation and the questions may startle you, i know some made me a little uncomfortable. Thats just me though. All around good book though. :)"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I'm firmly in the camp that ignorance is NOT bliss when it comes to anything, but even with that, yeah, this book could be a little alarming.Then I had a subchorionic hemotoma 8 weeks into pregnancy, and this was the only book that covered first trimester bleeding in any detail and accuracy. Trust me, once you've had a horrifying incident like that happen to you, you can't get enough information about it. (The good news, however, is hematomas -- at least in this case -- do not harm the baby or the pregnancy).So, I give the book thumbs up on keeping women OUT of the dark. Not as to scare you, really, but to make sure you're informed of the crazy things that are going on while your body is making a baby.The thumbs down (hence the 3 stars) is there very little in terms of pictures or charts or anything like that. You get this black and white image of what 'mom and baby' look like month by month and that's about it."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I received this book from my OB. It has some good information in it, but I think there are far better books out there. I read some of the reviews stating that this book answers every question you could possibly have, and I just find that to be so far from the truth. In fact, I think some of the question they do have aren't questions I would ever have, no anyone I have ever known to be pregnant would ever have. And I think some of the information in this book brings up more question that don't ever get answered. And it does have a short chapter for the Father's of the world, and I was not too impressed with that either. Amazingly, this is not the worst book I have ever read on the subject of pregnancy!

I wish I could give this book a Zero rating. The book starts off with a description of a handful of the more horrible conditions with which your baby could be born, and a note that there is nothing you can do to prevent any of them.

It's a really great book!"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I bought this book when one of my friends became pregnant and, after reading it, I told my husband there was no way I was ever going to be pregnant. The demands that this book puts upon a pregnant woman are unbearable, and the guilt that is not-so-subtly applied if you don't follow the rules in the book is immense. After reading many other books (that were happier, and much truer to life, like, believe it or not, &quot;Girlfriend's Guide to Pregnancy&quot;) and feeling better prepared for what it was like for &quot;real&quot; people, we did decide we were prepared to have a baby. While I was pregnant, I used the &quot;What to Expect&quot; book when I wanted to look up something specifically, but I refused to use it as any sort of a holistic guide and would really not recommend it at all. If you are looking for a much more empowering alternative, you should really consider &quot;The Complete Book of Pregnancy and Childbirth&quot; by Sheila Kitzinger."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I read this book cover to cover and constantly referred to it while I was pregnant and in the first couple weeks after my daughter was born. That said, I think you need to remember that the author also addresses what COULD happen worst case scenario issues. Whether or not it actually happens to you, you should still be informed about it. The problem with this book is that it can make any first time mom completely paranoid and neurotic if she doesn't take what the author says with a grain of salt. My husband actually refused to read this book after he read the first trimester because he was so freaked out about what 'could' go wrong. It is a good book, but don't assume everything bad is going to happen to you!"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This book is helpful, and is fairly thorough, but it is a bit out-of-date. I am frustrated by the fact that, as a patient who takes it upon herself to get informed, I have more up-to-date knowledge of certain subjects than this book that many people describe as the Pregnancy Bible. I've found the same problem with the next in the series, What to Expect the First Year. For example, I recently found out that my child is a boy, so I researched circumcision. According to What to Expect..., the AAP advises circumcision but maintains that it's probably ok not to. In fact, the AAP recently adopted a position that advises AGAINST circumcision.In all, this book is a good investment if you plan to read other pregnancy books (or if you get it on sale), but don't rely on it completely."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"Probably no other pregnancy book gives the reader more information. But there's probably no other pregnancy book with such a condescending attitude toward the parent. \\"What to Expect\\" assumes that no pregnant woman has anything better to do than serve as a baby factory, and the authors practically ignore fathers completely.If you want to have a healthy baby and you also want to get through pregnancy with your self-esteem intact, go to another pregnancy book for everyday matters and read \\"What to Expect\\" only when you need in-depth information."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"As a first time mother, I found this book very hard to read. There were first trimester symptoms at the back of the book and I felt that everything I was eating was wrong and will harm the baby. I prefer the Week by Week Pregnancy Book by MacDougal. It showed you where you are and what you are experiencing!"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"As all women are instructed to do, the momen I found out I was pregnant I invested in this book. After reading it and a few others, I just don't understand why it is considered such a valuable resource -- I understand that when it first came out, the concept was revolutionary, but since then much more informative, better laid-out books have been written -- most notably, Pregnancy for Dummies, which we find invaluable due to the brilliant indexing of information that allows you to find what you want when you need it, as opposed to forcing to you try and guess what trimester to skim under. I'd love to return the book, but made the mistake of writing in it. What a comparative waste of money!"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"When I first picked up this book, back in December, 2000, I was so upset by the content that I threw it across the room, vowing never to pick it up again. Since that time, however, my perspective has changed. Within every dark cloud there is a glimmer of light; similarly, within What To Epect When You Are Expecting there are useful pieces of information. The \\"Best-Odds\\" diet, for instance, is useful, with certain modifications, while the reference section towards the back is helpful.Be sure, however, to stay away from the section on all that can go wrong. What a way to scare a preganat woman!What To Expect When You're Expecting can be a useful refernce book...just be sure to use your common sense."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"Because this book was marketed as the pregnancy &quot;bible&quot; and because so many people buy and read this book, I bought it when I found out I was pregnant for the first time. Don't make the same mistake I did. This book was AWFUL! I did a great deal of research on several aspects of pregnancy and childrearing and found these authors' opinions on a variety of subjects outdated, unscientific, unhelpful and just SCARY! One of the authors leads a discussion group in manhattan which I attended, post-pregnancy, with my then 3-month-old. The author (I think it was Arlene, but I could be wrong) is about 80 years old! No kidding. That explains all of the outdated advice! (This is not to say that all advice given by knowledgable older women, moms and grandmas is necessarily bad ... it is not.) With so many modern treatises written by insightful professionals available on pregnancy &amp; childbirth, it is truly a travesty that so many women are compelled (based predominantly on good marketing) to buy this terrible book. I similarly despised the what to expect during the first year sequel by the same authors. These authors pretty much tell readers that if you give your child a pacifier (which my baby took temporarily) he will end up in prison or mentally retarded. And, while all educated moms and moms-to-be probably know classical music is good for, or at least appealing to, babies (older studies showing classical music stimulates brain activity have been recently called into question), the author had the nerve to tell one mom at our discussion group not to let her baby listen to any form of &quot;rock music&quot; which I imagine includes soft rock like Kenny G and Cowboy Junkies because, the author said, &quot;rock&quot; music is categorically &quot;too loud&quot; for babies! C&quot;MON! Do yourself a favor and buy a respected and authoritative treatise on pregnancy and another such treatise on child-rearing; AND, for comic relief and genuine empathy, also buy the girlfriends guide to pregnancy. I also enjoyed the girlfriends guide to the first year."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I can't help but feel as though this book is trapped in some kind of mysterious time warp, where modern obstetrical technology meets the social values of the 1950's.Some of the Best Odds recipes are pretty good, even if the whole diet is incredibly restrictive, and some of the information about hospital procedures is interesting (if overly weighted toward passive acceptance of whatever someone in a white coat thinks is best for you.)But the section on labor was a trip. Let me get this straight -- after labor starts, but before I go to the hospital, I'm supposed to pass the time by *preparing food for other people*?Yeah, right."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I'm a first time mom.

Definatly a must for first time moms."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"What To Expect When You Are A Lamb Being Led To Slaughter. Basically prepares you to have the most medical intervention available, without questioning anything. Allows you to be abused by doctor and hospital because 'that's what you can expect'. Has a lot of inaccuracies and partial information. Fine if you are a sheep, but if you are a thinking woman who wants to know ALL her options and have a satisfying birth experience, I recomment 'The Thinking Woman's Guide to Better Birth' by Henci Goer."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"My biggest objection to the book is focus on food. Even when you try to look up a complaint (such as diarrea, migraines, etc), they give a one sentence, not very helpful answer, then 3 sentences on how eating the best-odds diet could prevent this (Hint: it can't).They were so fixated on the food/diet aspect that after reading it, and referring to it, I am left with the feeling that a Snickers Bar is the moral equivilant of beer, a slice of Chocolate cake with frosting is a pack of cigarettes, and by eating a Big Mac, Large Fries and Coke, I might as well be shooting heroin.What's lacking in the month-by-month description good information as to what is developing during that period in the baby. What organs are happening? What are the KEY NUTRIENTS that are necessary for that time horizon?A much better book is the weekly calender that really talks about what's happening to you and the fetus, including real pictures, not pencil sketches."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"A more appropriate title for this book would be, What to Eat When You're Expecting If You Have an Eating Disorder.Weighing yourself everyday? Ordering broiled meat without sauce in restaurants? &quot;Cheating&quot; by eating a bagel with cream cheese? Sounds an awful lot like the last diet I went on. I brought this book into an appointment with my OB, who said, &quot;Yes, I looked at that book when I was pregnant. I remember thinking, I'm glad I'm a physician, or this would really freak me out.&quot;Expectant Moms: Please, please, do not buy this book. Don't read it. Eat like a healthy, reasonable, HUNGRY human being and follow your doctor's advice. Don't listen to advocates for &quot;a good looking pregnancy,&quot; or an author who boasts about gaining only twenty pounds during her pregnancy (five pounds less than the minimum recommendation).There's enough pressure in this culture to be thin during our ordinary lives. Let's not take it to the point of striving to be thin while we're pregnant. Shame, shame on Heidi Murkoff."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"Just want to cast my vote against this one because I'd love to help someone choose a better book. Don't know why this book is so popular; the whole tone of the book is alarmist and preachy. (Heaven forbid you eat something other than whole-grain) The Dr. Sears book is MUCH better for giving you the information you need to make your own choices and for treating you like an intelligent person!That said, I did like the &quot;what to expect&quot; organizer which is a collection of handy charts and calendars."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I agree with many of the other people who have reviewed this book. Although some of the information is helpful, the tone of the book is very preachy and condescending. I invariably become offended every time I read more than a few pages of this book."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I was initially attracted to this book by the great title and cover. It unfortunately was not accurate and had too many unrealistic suggestions. If you need a great selection of pregnancy/childcare books, I highly recommend all the books by William and Martha Sears. The books by Iovine are also a great addition to balance out the Sears books."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"My copy of WTEWYE (the second edition, not the new third edition) was handed down to me by a friend with a box of maternity clothes and a bunch of books on pregnancy and breastfeeding. She said, \\"I want the rest of the books back, but you can keep that one, or give it away, or recycle it -- I don't care.\\" After I read it myself, I understood why. I wanted to give this book 1 star for annoying me so much, but I have to admit, there's some useful stuff in there, so I'm compromising on 2 stars.First, the good stuff: It is really interesting to read about what's happening at different stages during your pregnancy. I'm sure a lot of people are comforted to read how common their uncomfortable or weird symptoms are. And, yes, it is a good idea to eat nutritious foods and take vitamins while you're pregnant.However ... I found the month-by-month format really annoying, (a) because pregnancy is measured in weeks, so I could never quite figure out what month I was in and (b) it gets sooooo repetitive. The question-and-answer format was also irritating, also for two reasons: first, the questions are so maddeningly specific that the odds are very few will apply to you; second, if the question is even halfway serious, the answer is always \\"ask your doctor\\". Well, you know what? If I wanted to ask my doctor every single time, I would just do that. The book is supposed to help you find some of the answers yourself.Then there's the \\"Best-Odds Diet\\" (which I call the \\"In What Universe Could I Stick To This? Diet\\"). I've heard other women complain that with their horrible morning sickness, the BOD's expectations are ridiculous. I'm here to tell you that even if, like me, you are lucky enough to have almost no morning sickness, they're still ridiculous. Despite having an enormous appetite, I simply could not eat that much food in one day. Still less could I force myself to forgo ice cream and consider a bagel once a week a \\"treat\\". I am by no means a junk food addict, and I voluntarily eat brown rice and beans and whole-wheat bread, but following the BOD was just beyond me, and I can't tell you how much I resented that smug little phrase, \\"Ask yourself: 'Is this the best bite I can take for my baby?'.\\" I gained 35 pounds; by 6 months postpartum I'd lost it all; and my daughter was born on time, healthy, and gorgeous. Just relax and eat sensibly.The section on why you should breastfeed is at best half-hearted, and it's \\"balanced\\" by a section on why you might not want to breastfeed. OK, I realize some people *can't* breastfeed -- but this isn't what the authors talk about. They're interested in people who don't *want* to, and they do nothing to dispell foolish myths like \\"my breasts will be saggy if I breastfeed.\\" Yeah, they will. They'll also be saggy if you don't, because you've already been pregnant for 9 months and they've doubled in size. Get over it.Finally, and most annoyingly, this book encourages you to refer all concerns, questions, and decisions to your OB. There are times when this is appropriate, but there are many more situations when you really should do your research and take responsibility -- for your own sake and your baby's. If you are naturally inclined to do that, this book is going to cheese you off. If you aren't, you will get no encouragement whatsoever to change your ways and think for yourself. For example, I did not appreciate being told that if my practitioner allowed it, I might be able to drink some water during labour, or that if my doctor said it was OK I could try labouring in a position of my choice. All prenatal testing is treated as mandatory, although in reality it isn't. If you have any interest in non-medicated birth or \\"extended\\" nursing, you'll need to look elsewhere for support.In my edition, a lot of the prenatal tests I was offered are simply not discussed; presumably this has been rectified in the new edition. In general, there was insufficient medical detail for me (except in the sections on all the horrible things that could go wrong), but then, I'm an information junkie.If you get this book as a gift, try it before you toss it -- it's not all bad. But don't waste your money buying it new."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This book may be worthwhile if you need to read up on pregancy in the question-answer format.It seems to be the most popular book amongst pregnant women I know, but I hated it, except for pointers on the post- partum period, which I did not see in nay other book. The book is preachy irritating and seems to talk down to the reader. There were some sections that I reread for laughs."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This book's information was really outdated. You can tell it was written long ago, before women really had much of a say in things. If you go by everything the book says, the next nine months will be miserable. You will basically shut up, listen to your doctor and accept his word as law. You will never eat what you crave, and you will never be an active participant in your own baby's birth. This is good for general information, but if you really want to make informed decisions, look elsewhere."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"Why is this book consodered to be the &quot;Bible&quot; for pregnancy??? As soon as I found out I was pregnant I went out and bought this book, only to find out that it has very little information that I actually need to know, and talks almost nothing about the baby. Yes, I want to feed myself (and therefore the baby) the best possible choices, but the horrible preachy overtones of this book allow for no slack. Am I really a horrible mother since I want regular ice cream once in a while instead of low-fat ice milk or yogart?The question and answer format is useless as well. Most of the questions that I did have were not in the book, and the few that were answered did not give complete answers, so I had to consult another pregnancy book or my doctor anyway. Too much changes with yourself and your baby in a month's time. Choose Your Pregnany Week by Week for a much better information source and leave this book to collect dust on the shelf!"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"My husband and I are in the process of trying to conceive our first baby. I have a couple of friends who just had their own first babies and one of them offered me all her pregnancy books \\"except 'What to Expect...'. I am not giving you that one.\\" I asked her why and she said reading it made her feel so nervous and guilty that she had an anxiety attack. I cajoled her into giving it to me just so I could flip through it. Thankfully I had been forewarned, so most of it I just found funny.The \\"Best Odds Diet\\" is a total joke. It is really too extreme to be believed. One of my friends asked her OB about this diet. She was panicked half to death when she read \\"What to Expect\\" after she got pregnant and got to the diet chapter, because she hadn't been following any of the recommendations. She said her OB looked at her over his glasses and said \\"Women have had healthy babies in concentration and refugee camps, in the middle of war zones, and in the darkest jungles of the world, and they've been doing it for centuries. You are way overthinking this whole thing. Go home and put that book in the trash, that's where it belongs.\\" After perusing it I agree with the OB's assessment. The horrible, horrible guilt the authors try to inflict on pregnant women is nearly criminal. \\"Is this the best bite you can give your baby?\\" Maybe not nutritionally, but there are many more studies out there linking maternal stress to pregnancy complications and later development problems than there are studies linking the consumption of a few Cheetos to catastrophic pregnancy failure. I think it's more important for expecting moms to be happy and relaxed than totally anxious and stressed out the entire time, and stress and anxiety is what this book encourages. I think as long as you are not eating low-nutritive junk foods all the time, manage to eat reasonably well, and don't use pregnancy as an excuse to literally \\"eat for two\\" you'll be fine having the occasional ice cream cone or slice of pizza.The other thing I objected to in the book was the constant referencing of \\"husband,\\" \\"father,\\" etc. I am a heterosexual married woman but I have women friends who are lesbian mothers, friends who are single mothers by choice, etc. Where is their voice in this book? Not every woman has or wants a man to be their partner in pregnancy. And the tips for keeping your husband happy sound like paragraphs pulled verbatim out of some 1950s homemaking manual. I think it's important to focus on your spouse and not just on your pregnancy while you're pregnant, but the whole tone of the book seems to be that you as a pregnant woman are better off sitting at home, cooking organic, precisely balanced meals and knitting socks, waiting for your mayyunnn to come home and give you a little pat on the rump (which you have to make sure doesn't get too big, GOD FORBID you gain too much weight while pregnant, you'll become a blight on society and physically unattractive to your husband, which we all know is the most important thing) and then leave you to finish dinner while he watches \\"the game\\" with his feet up. Sorry, I don't have that kind of marriage, and I don't actually know anyone who does.As far as the rest of the information, it's good, but there's better and more updated info out there on the web and in other books. I was amazed at the cavalier attitude towards c-sections. In many cases c-sections are done for the convenience of the doctor and/or hospital, NOT because it's best for the mother or baby. The book doesn't encourage women to take an active role in their prenatal care or make a comprehensive birth plan, or be vocal in any way about their treatment during pregnancy. The whole tone, once again, is \\"honey, you just git back in the kitchen and finish supper and don't worry your pritty little head about complicated stuff like this.\\"I think what should tip everybody off about the content of this book is the picture on the cover. Look at that girl. Does she look chic or modern? Does she look happy? Look at the hokey graphics. Look at the girl's dress. That throwback image of womanhood on the cover is exactly the message you get on the inside of the book too. Feh. Leave \\"What to Expect\\" to the insecure, timid, and clueless and find a better book about pregnancy to see you through your 40 weeks."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"But it's not anymore. Even though the book was revised during the 1990s, it's still very much a product of the 1980s, with dated information, passe attitudes about pregnancy, and a simplistic format that is reminiscent of the Dummies books! I won't talk about the preachy and condescending tone that the authors use, since virtually every other reviewer has already pointed that out that major flaw. What I will say, however, is that this book barely scratches the surface on a lot of important topics, like planning a pregnancy, what drugs are safe to take during pregnancy and which ones aren't, the debate about the use of caffeine during pregnancy, coping with a high risk pregnancy, dealing with the loss of a baby, and other issues that every pregnancy book owes its audience to tackle in an intelligent manner. It's time for the authors to either rewrite the book from scratch or to gracefully allow it to go out of print. Don't waste your money on this book. Pick up a book that will treat you like an intelligent, thinking woman by arming you with the facts you need to make the best possible choices for your baby. I highly recommend THE UNOFFICIAL GUIDE TO HAVING A BABY by John R. Sussman and Ann Douglas; THE PREGNANCY BOOK by William Sears et al; and--if you're expecting multiples--WHAT TO EXPECT WHEN YOU'RE EXPECTING TWINS, TRIPLETS, OR QUADS by Barbara Luke and Tamara Eberlein. Any one of these books will provide you with ten times the information you'll find in WHAT TO EXPECT."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"As a physician, I went into my first pregancy with a fair bit of \\"knowledge\\" - but nothing compares to \\"the real thing!\\" This book does have lots of information in it, and covers complications/ problems etc well. However, it could create a huge number of guilty/neurotic/paranoid moms to be with all of the restrictions on diet that it includes. \\"The pregnancy diet\\" sounds great, but how many servings of orange vs green vegetables do I really need to eat every day, let alone avoiding anything smoked/salted/processed... great if you are already a health nut and eat organic food, but for the rest of the planet, let's get a little more practical! The reality is that babies are the world's best parasites and will take what they need from their \\"host\\" - which is why malnourished heroin addicted moms can still give birth to 8lb babies!I say it is a good resource, but don't live by it alone or you will go mad!!!"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I actually received TWO copies of this book when I was pregnant. It is a testimony to how much I hated the book that I recycled both of them rather than loaning it to friends or family. Where to begin? First of all, the book makes it seem that if you eat even 2 strawberries more than the recommended serving amount you are, in essence, harming your child. The book is very judgmental towards a woman just wanting to eat a bowl of ice cream... and is completely unrealistic on how a woman can eat and behave during pregnancy.During my own pregnancy, I was hospitalized 3 times due to severe nausea and vomiting. It got to the point that my doctor said, \\"I don't care what you eat, as long as you eat and it stays down.\\" Needless to say, food became a huge issue in my pregnancy. Whenever I read this book, it made me feel so horrible and made me feel like I was doing something wrong and my unborn child was suffering because of it. I was working in a high-stress job and, sometimes, I would go home only to sleep until it was time to eat. I would eat something that I craved and then go back to sleep. This book would basically label me a loser in all respects with a really unhealthy pregnancy. Throughout my pregnancy I checked with my doctor to make sure everything was going okay and quoted this book several times. He told me to ignore the book and that everything was fine. Well, my son was born incredibly healthy and is now 4 and (if I do say so myself) very bright and cute.Bottom Line: this book does not help a pregnant woman in anyway - it just paints this picture of an ideal pregnancy that a normal woman cannot hope to achieve, unless she gives up her job and spends her whole pregnancy measuring nuts and berries."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This book is just fine and, while I wouldn't call it a waste of money, it is certainly lacking for two big reasons -- organization and the \\"paranoia\\" factor. Both of these have been mentioned in other reviews.ORGANIZATION: The book's chapters are organized by \\"months\\" (first through ninth, then post-delivery, etc.) While this might seem common-sense at first, it turns out that it's absolutely terrible if you're trying to find something in a reasonable amount of time. Diet, health, complications, biological changes -- they're all covered sporadically throughout the text, never appearing in one centralized place for reference.PARANOIA: I don't know what other word to use, but another reviewer used this word, so I'll stick with it. I was surprised to find the book SO FULL of problems, complications, aches, pains, symptoms, etc. The majority of this book is basically devoted to anything (and seemingly everything) that could possibly go wrong. The unfortunate flip-side to this is that it's relatively weak on actual \\"healthy\\" information.I would reccommend the \\"Mayo Clinic Guide to a Healthy Pregnancy\\", \\"The Mother of All Pregnancy Books\\", or \\"The Pregnancy Bible\\" for a more even-keeled approach to the subject."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"What to Expect has often been called the Bible of pregnancy books. When it was first released, it probably was. But, its somewhat preachy tone and emphasis on the many problems that can occur during pregnancy but rarely do, decreases its value to women who are having a normal, healthy pregnancy and just want to be reassured that what they are thinking, feeling and doing is normal and okay. What to Expect does answer just about any question a woman might ask and for this reason, it can be a valuable resource. There are many other good books that also provide a great deal of information without focusing on potential problems. The Pregnancy Book is an excellent resource book. The Girlfriends' Guide to Pregnancy is fun to read and is really like talking to your girlfriends about all the intimate details associated with pregnancy. We're Pregnant! provides a couple's viewpoint on the whole process of being pregnant, giving birth, and becoming a parent for the first time. Read them all and you will be more than prepared for anything that comes your way."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I have to assume that this book is immensely popular only because the title is cute and memorable. The book itself is one of the less-valuable pregnancy books I read.The structure of week-by-week and month-by-month \\"what to expect\\" information is actually very useful. It's the content that's a problem.The authors somehow manage to inspire paranoia while at the same time being over-reassuring. \\"It could be a horrific disease...but don't worry, that's rare. Your baby could die...but we're almost certain s/he won't. Things could go horribly, horribly wrong...but just check with your doctor the next time you're in.\\" Aagh!Their \\"best odds diet\\" also is outrageous -- anything that considers an occasional muffin with refined sugar and flour to be \\"cheating,\\" as in, \\"it's okay to cheat occasionally -- enjoy a yummy muffin once a month!\\" is pretty unreasonable in my view. If you're already a health food nazi it may work for you to a certain extent, but if you ate like they say you should, you'd eat all day and gain an extra 50 pounds. Why? Because the authors are so condescending to American women and so certain that they have to overstate things in order to convince readers to do *some* of what they suggest, they grossly inflate the amounts of the various good foods you're supposed to eat. Obnoxious, to say the least.If only I could find a book with the *structure* and *amount* of information in \\"What to Expect,\\" but with more valuable content and the sensibility of \\"The Girlfriends' Guide to Pregnancy,\\" I'd buy it for every expectant mother I know. As it stands, I can only recommend against wasting your time (and your sanity) on this book."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I hated this book, I felt it was very misleading. The title is appealing, but the book is filled with obscure potential issues, without letting you know just how statistically slight they are. It left me feeling very worried, and I wonder if it was just filler in her book. Pancreatic Cancer? Come on, is this really practical information for most expectant mothers? There are some wonderful books out there, this was not one of them."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"As a childbirth educator and doula, I must work hard not to sigh when a client quotes this book. Sadly, there is little in it to empower a woman, to give her the confidence she should have in her own body to carry and birthe a baby. Clients who have been heavily influenced by this book almost always end up with epidurals and various surgical interventions - it is what they expect will happen. They tend to listen submissively and obey whatever anyone in scrubs tells them. They are far less successful with breastfeeding.When I read the book the first time, I didn't think it was so bad. But after noting the pattern of women falling right into a cascade of intervention, I re-read it. Then I saw the implicit assumptions that having a baby is almost impossible to do without medical help. It makes you wonder how the human race managed to survive so long.Books on my recommended reading list for clients include any books by Barbera Harper, Ina May Gaskin, Penny Simkin, Suzanne Arms, Pam England, Michel Odent, Rahima Baldwin, Elizabeth Davis, and Henci Goer - there are lots of really good choices."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I received this book from my insurance company, to whom I have informed that this book is horrible. I was not 'afraid, or scared' when I was pregnant, as this book suggests all women are. I got thru the first chapter put the book down, went to the library and found much better books. I would strongly suggest finding better books, joining a mom's club and talking to other moms - you will get much better advice from them and your doctor."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I thought this book was horrible. I was so surprised that it is so popular. All it talks about it possible problems. You get to page 10 and your a stress ball.Not to mention, a lot of the information is WRONG.In summary, the book is very depressing, scares you, makes you think that you'll never get through your pregnancy and has inaccurate information."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I have spoken to a number of people regarding this book and everyone had been so frightened by this book that they all actually thought they had lost or were losing their baby and had insisted that their Dr.'s perform an ultrasound to make sure everything was OK!!There are plenty of other books out there."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This book is not so much a good read as it is a good reference. Along the way, you'll likely have a number of odd and unexpected physical symptoms. You can use this book to look them up. It is organized by month, and so also provides you with information about what to expect that month in terms of physical changes. This book saved me from worrying about normal (but unusual if you're not pregnant!) aches and pains and probably saved me about ten calls to the doctor."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"From my doctor to friends that just had a baby...to others on this site...I can't believe that people find this book remotely helpful and recommend it. All the information can be found elsewhere in a much more user-friendly format. I also agree with others that the tone it takes makes one feel inadequate and a failure. I don't think I've ever had such a viseral reaction to a book before...then again...I've never been pregnant before."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"From my doctor to friends that just had a baby...to others on this site...I can't believe that people find this book remotely helpful and recommend it.

Not only does it prepare future mothers for their physical changes, it prepares them mentally as well. We like knowing what to expect and that most pregnant women have the same experiences my wife is having. This is our first child so we aren't exactly sure what to expect, this book really helps prepare us for what's going to &quot;happen next&quot;. The book is easy to understand and has helpful pictures as well. I would recommend it to any pregnant woman, but especially if you are having your first child."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"We bought this book at a Toys \\"R\\" Us store in Texas and began reading it right away. Before I got pregnant, I thought it was wonderful, but now that I am it is not all that helpful. It was in an information package I got from my doctor / midwife . . . so I could have saved myslef about (dollar amount) if I would have waited. It does not get into the specific detail. Most of it is common sence. Basicly, I was curious about a lot of things, and it did not really answer my questions accurately. It may be a nice beginning book, but it left me wanting more information."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I bought this book because it seemed like one of the staples that you have to get as an expectant mother. I thought it was okay, but not great. On the plus side it is organized in a great way (as opposed to the Girlfriends book)and it does have a lot of information. On the minus side, it may have too much information. By that I mean that it has descriptions and definitions of a lot of scary things that you may never encounter but you might think you are experiencing those things after reading about them. Therefore, I only use this book when I need to look something up. I don't read what could or should happen to you every month because it makes me worry too much. Also, the nutrition section is a total waste. I haven't met one person who has been able to follow the diets that they suggest. They are way too strict about what you shouldn't eat. If I followed their advice I think I'd just be eating nuts and berries."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"When I became pregnant (it was a SURPRISE!) I was flat out freaked and un-prepared. My loving sister sent me this book because she enjoyed it so, and I'd heard that many other women loved it. I however, did not, at least not during my initial stages of pregnancy.This book does answer every question you could have and that is a good thing. But this book did not offer me what I needed more than text book answers... Emotional Support!!! Buy this book as a medical guide so you have something to refer to when your insensitive OB doesn't have time to answer your questions. For that it is good. Just don't expect this book to give you the assurance about your feelings and emotions that you so much require at this very sensitive time!"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I used this book mainly to keep up with monthly pregnancy updates. I liked the simple question and answer format.I did not agree with their philosophical views on childbirth or their emphasis on alleopathic medicine (versus natural remedies).I also thought the best-odds diet was unrealistic, and I am fairly health conscious!!You can buy this as a reference, but don't rely on it as your sole source of information."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I am afraid the best thing about this book was the title. I actually bought this book, and wish I had read some of the reviews first. The people who call this a &quot;bible&quot; really should consider an alternate &quot;religion&quot;. This is an unbelievably patronizing, misinformed, and alarmist book about a wonderful time in a woman's life. After I read the first couple of chapters, I had to repeat to myself &quot;Pregnancy is not a disease&quot; over and over for weeks! And what moron thought of those diet guidelines? What do the authors do for a living that makes them suggest bringing a flask of wheat germ to business luncheons! Get a reality check! The book is so focused on every conceivable crisis that it actually had me worried that I did not have morning sickness instead of enjoying my luck!Don't bother with this. There are better uses for both your time and your money!"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This book turned the first part of my wife's pregnancy into a nightmare of worry. You can't imagine how negative the tone of this book is.I bought William Sears Pregnancy Book. Sears' book is more informative, more even toned, and successfully set my wife at ease. Buy this book instead."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"If you are over 35, and already own this book, I suggest that you leave it under your sofa until after your baby is born.This book highlights every possible thing that can go wrong with a pregnancy (as if you're not worried already), and makes you feel like a failure if you can't keep up with the suggested diet and excercise regimen.There are many books which offer a more positive, and more readable version of the pregnancy experience."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"The book definitely has an alarmist tone. The strict diet was depressing, and the part that bugged me the most was the section on &quot;Protecting Yourself Against Malpractice&quot;. This is a quote from the page.. &quot;doctor's are no longer allowing themselves to be sitting ducks while patients take malpractice pot shots at them.&quot; Now I don't know about you, but I'm not going to the doctor hoping to get a malpractice suit, my main concern is my baby. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone. It's scary, annoying, and unrealistic."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I'm not pregnant (yet), but I've been researching and reading for several months. This and =The Girlfriend's Guide to Pregnancy= were the worst books I read. I found the tone condescending, smarmy, and just plain insulting. I also could not eat half the food they insist you eat if I were carrying the McCaughey Septuplets - and whoever dubbed the diet the &quot;Best Chance&quot; diet ignores the fact that millions of women eat a lot less, in different proportions, and have perfectly healthy babies. WHO decided that this was the &quot;Best Chance&quot;? And if it's so great, how oh how has the human race managed to get this far without its superior wisdom?The best books if you don't want to be addressed as an idiot are still Our Bodies, Our Selves and Sheila Kitzinger's Complete Book of Pregnancy and Childbirth. At least the Boston Women's Health Book Collective and Sheila Kitzinger assume that their readers haven't tossed their brains out the window."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This book will put your mind to ease on the many changes you go through during pregnancy but beware the pregnancy police is present. The tone and content is condecending and will most likely make you feel very inadequate as a mother to be. There are lots of books out there that will tell you about your pregnant body and your baby that are better than this one."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This book is limited in scope and in some of its advice it is misinformed. If you want to be a good patient it may be a good book for you. Otherwise, don't bother buying it or toss it out a window if you have it. I was glad I did not waste my money since it was given to me. My advice, try the Sears' books, Sheila Kritzinger's books, or others along those lines."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This book is one of about 10 that I bought or inherited during my pregnancy. This book is EVERYWHERE, I mean right next to the cheap paperbacks in Wal-Mart EVERYWHERE. Basically the book goes over a pregnancy month-by-month, which is useless because it is much more informative to measure one's pregnancy in weeks. The books is organized into corny \\"Q & A\\" format, with many of the questions being overly specific or non-applicable to all pregnancies. There is not much scientific fact or research in this book, but rather reads as if your grandma's book group is telling you about pregnancy. If you are looking for a book that has credible medical fact and informative information, buy \\"The Mayo Clinic Guide to a Healthy Pregnancy\\". That book is by far the best, is the most credible and is with the times. Plus, The Mayo Clinic is an incredibly well respected establishment."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"Despite the reviews saying that there were better books out there, my husband and I decided to go ahead and order this one as it was recommended by a friend.After a few uses, I began to reference this book as the \\"scary\\" book. We decided that the information the book contained was not worth the anxiety it produced and shoved it to the back of a closet...never to be seen or heard from again. We used the Mayo Clinic's Guide to a Healthy Pregnancy for the remainder of the pregnancy and it was fabulous.We received the \\"What to Expect the First Year\\" as a shower gift. While it's not the same scary book as \\"Expecting,\\" I can't say I appreciate its holier-than-thou attitude toward many subjects."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I am going through my first pregnancy and purchased this book. I haven't been so concerned about the militant regime the author would like you to follow as I am with the lack of organization of the book. Why doesn't the author create a chapter addressing questions about pregnancy in the back of the text instead of interspersing them throughout? It is very difficult to reference them later."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I'm in my late 30s, pregnant with my first child, and like many reviewers, have had this book pushed on me by several people, and received it as a gift. I hate it. The question-answer format is really frustrating because the organization makes little sense, and my own questions often have a somewhat different flavor from those posed in the book, so that the answers don't really address my concerns. I feel like the book talks down to me. My biggest complaint: Pregnancy is a time of ambivalence as well as excitement, and this book downplays and dismisses the incredibly mixed feelings I'm experiencing. I've felt guilty about these feelings and this book made them worse. Come to find out, from talking to others, that I'm normal and most women have ambivalence! That's too important a piece to leave out. Having said all the negative, I have learned some useful things from this book and will incorporate the information into the way I get throught my pregnancy"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I found &quot;What to expect when expecting&quot; to be pretenious, condecendind, and extremely negative. Yeah its true that this book may be loaded with a lots of needed information...and it may have its place in the world of pregnancy, but this is not the kind of book that a first time mom to be should be reading. This book will take a young woman, who is alread afraid, and instill more fear in her. It will talk down to her, and then make her feel insecure about the whole experience. I will not recommend this book at all. &quot;Babytales: A Pregnancy companion&quot;, by M.S.Woodson and &quot;The Girlfriends Guide to...&quot;, by Vicki Iovine - are much better choices."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"Don't let this book scare you to death with it's ban on white bread. It also pimps its &quot;Best Odds Diet&quot; to death. Chunky moms, who are otherwise healthy - buy it for the detailed answers and questions - but ignore all the &quot;eat only whole grain stuff&quot;. Unrealistic and sometimes not what you're craving."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I have to say, that although this book is a good reference for the many random questions that women have throughout pregnancy, I found it to be demeaning in tone. Having suffered from severe morning sickness, vomiting all day for 5 weeks straight (and feeling generally horrible for 4 weeks after that), that I was extremely offended not only at the shortness of the section dealing with this common and miserable condition but also at the suggestion that its all in my head! I felt like throwing the book across the room when I looked to it for comfort and support and all it offered me was a paragraph about how women with morning sickness tend to be succeptible to the power of suggestion. Excuse me??????"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This is a horrible book. It has caused 3 meltdowns until I finnaly got wise and closed it permanently. I have fourth edition. If there were an option I would give it negative stars. The first chapter is entitled \\"Are you Pregnant?\\" subcategory, \\"What you may be concerned about.\\" Personally the first thing I did when I found out, was rejoice. Not worry. Reading that chapter only put silly ideas (that have absolutely nothing to do with my pregancy) in my head to worry about. The part about toxoplasmosis is the worst, I came out of it positive that because I have 2 affectionate INDOOR cats, I was going to kill my fetus and endanger my health. I suggest that only the severely masochistic read this. I do not understand how this came to be the commonest pregnancy book. I am apalled."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"A friend gave this book to my wife. She started reading it and I got busy with work. I came back a little while later to find her in tears. When I asked what was wrong, she replied \\"I'm just so scared\\" and then proceeded to quote all the things this book said could go wrong with her pregnancy.If you really care about someone, their happiness, and hope they have a low-stress pregnancy then do NOT get them this book."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"\\"What to Expect When You're Expecting\\" has a lot of contradictions in advice, which turned myself and my husband off. The \\"worst case scenarios\\" got to be really old as well. To be honest, I haven't opened this book since week 4 and we're at week 16.The book my husband and I preferred was \\"Pregnancy- Week by Week.\\" We have gotten into the habit of snuggling together, as my husband reads about what changes are occurring for this particular week."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"According the the WTE series you can expect \\"little or no pain\\" during your recovery from a C-section. Are they SERIOUS? C-sections are major abdominal surgery, recovery is painful and most moms will need to take somewhat strong pain relievers for a week or two to even hold their beautiful newborn for any length of time. Ther is nothing wrong with admitting you are in pain, especially if you were surprised by an emergency c-section, and taking care of yourself during recovery. If mom is more relaxed and comfortable and following her doctor's orders, the baby can only benefit."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"All I can say about this book is that it is Negative! It describes all the &quot;horrible&quot; things about pregnancy. It doesn't tell you about all the wonderful things. It also doesn't explain all of a women's options! For example, midwives, doulas, home births, etc. I tossed this book soon after I got it. I recommend you do the same."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"Don't bother getting this book unless you enjoy scare tactics, paranoia, and unresonable expectations regarding weight gain and diet that are out dated at best. The tone suggests that women are slightly stupid, and the diet is one of the worst things I have ever read.Kitzenger, Sears, and a number of other authors have much better books that provide wonderful information, accurate, much more woman positive, and doesn't treat pregnancy like a horrible disease or disaster waiting to happen."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I bought this book because I thought it was a standard thing for all newly pregnant people. I have used it as a resource here and there, but for the most part, it wasn't that helpful."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I found What to Expect vague, general, poorly organized, and an overall disappointment. When I found out I was pregnant this was the first book I purchased and it is now the last book I would recommend. Just as another reviewer mentioned, each chapter opens with a ridiculous laundry list of everything I was to expect each month, including how I would feel! I specifically recall in the early chapters being told to expect to feel fat and depressed because I couldn't fit into my regular clothes but wouldn't be big enough for maternity wear. Unbelievable! I would recommend Your Pregnancy Week by Week or The Sears pregnancy book or pretty much anything other than What to Expect!"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I am a 38-year old \\"career woman\\" pregnant for the first time. Some things I appreciate about this book: Pretty good overview of the month to month changes in my body. The Food Selection Groups were handy and allowed me to make some simple, positive substitions in my diet. Just about every conceivable symptom or emotion is discussed in at least a cursory way.What I don't like: Very little attention is paid to the special challenges of \\"advanced maternal age.\\" For example, they talk a little about amniocentesis and the potential for facing the difficult decision of whether to terminate a pregnancy based on the results. But they DON'T mention how short the timeframe can be to make and act on such a decision in many states (2 weeks, where I live!). There's almost no mention of fibroids, which will be a factor during pregnancy for something like 1/3 of older women. And, the constant urging to call your doctor about every little twinge is ridiculous. (Don't these people have HMO's?) There are \\"worries\\" expressed in the Q&A; format that never would have occurred to me, and like many other reviewers, I thought they made the whole tone of the book much too negative. Maybe younger women worry more about this stuff, but I've been around long enough to stand up for myself and make my own decisions in life.Overall though, this book has been a decent part of my education."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"As soon as I found out I was pregnant (I am 27 weeks now) I went right out and bought this book because I heard how FABULOUS it was. Sure, it was fun for the first few months, flipping through it, seeing how the baby was growing, and being able to relate to different issues that came with what ever month I was in.The chapter on the pregnancy diet was OKAY. I liked the list of foods they had which contained the certain nutrients pregnant women need since before I was pregnant I didn't know what I was eating half the time!In the chapter on the 6th month, the authors have seemed to have gotten a little lazy. This is the month where some of us preggos are just starting (if we haven't already) to adjust to our lives carrying a basketball-like belly all the time. Almost the whole chapter covered childbirth classes and why they are good. While that info is all well and good, I would have much rather preferred more tips on how to sooth an achey back and tips on how to sleep when your little one is kicking the dickens out of you!In the chapter on the eighth month, they already go into signs of labor, false labor, etc despite the fact they have a big, long chapter on labor and delivery all by itself. Especially in the eighth month, I think we would just prefer information as to physical changes we go through every day. If anyone wants information on symptoms of false labor then simply flip over to that chapter!I personally prefer to know how my baby is growing and developing week by week. If you want to know what your baby is doing in the weeks between doctors' visits, go to babycenter.com and sign up. According to your due date, you will receive an email every week telling you how your baby is developing."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"All doom and gloom. Takes all the fun out of being pregnant and keeps you up at night worrying about the what-ifs. Perhaps it's handy to have around as an additional reference for particular situations (I looked at it when I was Group B Strep positive, for example), if you can get your hands on a hand-me-down copy. Buy the Dr. Sears book instead!"},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I bought this book with my first pregnancy because &quot;it&quot; was supposed to be the best pregnancy book out there. I was extremely upset with the book once I started reading through it. If I hadn't ever heard anything about it I probably wouldn't have been so disappointed. I used this book for a fraction of my first pregnancy and only once on my second. I was looking for a book that told me about my baby. I wanted to know exactly what my baby was doing during that week. This book is all about your body and the symptoms you are feeling. It has nothing to do with the baby. I ended up using this book in conjuction with &quot;Your pregnancy week by week&quot;. Neither books cover everything. If you are wanting to see what your baby looks like at a certain week in your pregnancy or find out how it's developing then this book is not for you. However, my friend loved this book. She wanted to know about her symptoms and how long certain things would last or what to look for so this book was for her. The question of whether this book is for you depends on what you are looking for in a pregnancy book. Also even if you are just looking for a book about your symptoms you may find that the information from you doctor or off the internet will be more useful. This book has a lot of information regarding your symptoms but it doesn't cover everything."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I had far from a perfect pregnancy and I still felt that this book did not live up to the hype. Much of the useful information in it could be found in the info packet my dr's gave me. It actually contained information and sugestions that went specifically against what my dr's told me. Many of the topics covered in this book are both frightening and dated. I would recomend staying away form this one and getting Your Pregnancy Week by Week and a technical reference and The Girlfriend's Guide and a practical one. This book is actually the only one I did not save to loan to friends. Instead I tell them not to buy it."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"This book seems like it's from the '50s -- diet advice that you could only follow if you didn't work outside the home and lived next door to the store and had a maid, fear-mongering, and just basically wrong information. I would recommend that you go to the library and check several books out on pregnancy, and select the one that fits your lifestyle the best. Try &quot;The Girlfriend's Guide&quot; and &quot;The Pregnancy Book&quot; for starters. There are a ton of better books out there."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"When I was pregnant I asked my OB to recommend a book, and he said &quot;anything BUT What to Expect ...&quot;. In my opinion, there was some good info, but the tone of the book overall was way too self-righteous, especially regarding the off-the-planet diet info. Get the Mayo Clinic's excellent book for medical info (also has part of the book devoted to the baby's first year), and Vicki Iovine's &quot;Girlfriend's Guide&quot; for laughs. You wouldn't want the What to Expect authors as girlfriends - they will sprinkle wheat germ all over you while reprimanding you for eating that extra scoop of chocolate ice cream."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"You might as well ask your mother in law for advice, because the ladies who wrote this book are sure that they know it all too- and that you just might be too stupid to understand it.

The reason I say this is because they seem to be focused on what could go wrong. This is not a touchy feely book about the beauty of parenthood, this is a clinical description of what could happen. Most people I know that read this book were terrified. It talks about absolutely everything that could go wrong. As though I need help worrying about our child to be. I appreciate the information, but I dont want to have nightmares about it! The author states that these things are often unlikely, however the book focuses on terrible, terrible things that could happen. You will walk away from this book like a new medical student, it will seem like everyone around you has the disorder that you just read about. Needless to say this can be frightening!I admit that the information is acurate, but it is misleading in that it puts the focus on what could go wrong and not what could go right or even what you could do about it. If you dont get frightened easily you might be able to handle this book, if you are in the least bit nervous about your child then you probably dont want to use this resource.Bottom line, this book scared me more then any Stephen King novel..."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"It is no wonder that every midwife or doula I have come in contact with warned me away from this book. During my first pregnancy, this book was the LEAST helpful to me, by far. I found it to be both extremist and alarmist in its guidelines and recommendations. The suggested diet is ridiculous (a bael made from refined flour is considered a treat? Please!), and the concerns about environmental and day-to-day &quot;hazards&quot; made me feel like I should either hibernate during my pregnancy or live in a plastic bubble. Most upsetting to me was the actual childbirth information, or lack thereof. I was planning a natural birth and wanted to be as informed and prepared as possible. This book let me down. Not only was the section on labor and childbirth extremely vague, it was also dubious in tone regarding natural childbirth, which unnerved and frightened me. The two resources that made me feel the most informed, prepared, and empowered were &quot;With You and Your Baby All the Way,&quot; by Jerri Colonero, and &quot;Pregnancy, Childbirth and the Newborn,&quot; by Penny Simkin, et al. They were both practical, highly informative, and realistic. If you are truly interested in having the best pregnancy and childbirth experience you can, get these two books and give &quot;What to Expect&quot; a skip."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"Some friends of ours gave us this book as a gift during our first pregnancy. I found this book to very thorough and full of medical information. It may be a little bit too complex if you have very little medical knowledge, yet I wouldn't let this discourage you from reading it. It does do a good job in explaining medical tests, procedures, symptoms, etc.The book covers the whole nine months of pregnancy, as well as labor and delivery, postpartum, diet, and more. There is a section in the back of the book for your own personal pregnancy notes.The book covers a lot of information about the unpleasant pregnancy subjects as well, such as miscarriage, sickness, possible complications, etc. Reading these sections can be quite scary, especially if it is your first pregnancy, but can also be very informative. I experienced some bleeding during my first trimester and was very scared. After reading a section in the book that covered this exact thing, I was reassured that what I was experiencing (and that I was having no other pertinent symptoms) was normal. Had I not read that section and became more informed, I would have been a lot more anxious and apprehensive. Sometimes we have to become educated about the &quot;bad&quot; stuff as well.I have used this book on many occasions and I feel it is a great resource pregnancy book. You won't find any colored pictures, only a few black and white drawings.I would recommend this book for first time mothers and fathers.

Too bad, because there are much better &quot;pregnancy-survival&quot; books out there.I found that very little of what this book said actually applied to me. It is written from a very paranoid standpoint, and it seems to focus on everything that can go wrong during a pregnancy. I found that it made me more depressed and fearful, so I quit reading it during my fifth month.A much better book is &quot;Natural Pregnancy&quot; by Aviva Jill Romm. I also really like &quot;The Birth Book&quot; by William and Martha Sears, so I would bet that their &quot;The Pregnancy Book: A Month-By-Month Guide&quot; would be better than the &quot;Expecting&quot; book."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"I'm sorry I wasted my money on this book.

My midwife told me she always tries to catch her patients before they buy this book and warn them NOT to (she goes so far as to call it misogynistic) but unfortunately she didn't get me in time.

I believe in eating a balanced diet, but can't imagine finding the time and energy to follow the recommended diet. And a piece of cake once a month as a treat? Let's get real, even pre-pregnancy diet allows for more realism than that.Other than diet, the information is okay, but the Q&amp;A don't always appear during the right secion as different people experience different symptoms at different times.I much prefer the &quot;Unofficial Guide to Having a Baby.&quot; It's friendlier, easier to use and far less preachy.

Although it contains good information, there are plenty of other books that do as well. I find the tone of the book a bit condescending. Reading this book, you'd think having a few potato chips would mean you're baby will be obese and you will have stretch marks and varicose veins, yet if you eat perfectly, everything will go perfectly. I exercies regularly and eat healthfully, yet I still find the tone offensive. I felt this book would leave most mothers paranoid about every little thing. Also, I wasn't that happy with the layout and how info is organized. I am much, much happier with the Mayo Clinic guide.

It seems as if it is a sure bet that most first time mothers will. I read this book cover to cover in addition to several other pregnancy books and by far found this to be the least helpful. I found the book to be alarmist and filled with worst case scenerios...more of a what to expect if you are expecting the worst. It was not a well balanced book and did not provide enough information about self-care during pregnancy. I also found the diet information dated and heavy handed and unrealistic.There are much better books out there. Unless your goal is to terrify and make the reader paranoid, if you are a 1st timer, spouse of a 1st timer or thinking about getting a good resource for one, I suggest the following instead:THE PREGNANCY BOOK by Dr. Sears and Martha Sears. It is a much better resource, more complete, more information about self care, preparing for birth, better organized layout, more medically accurate, more focused on what happens over the course of average pregancies while still giving the information of what to look out for without frightening the reader."},{"Title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition","review":"If you are looking for a very easy and quick to read book this is the one for you.

There is some basic information on medical conditions that may arise during pregnancy and basic breastfeeding information for the immediate postpartum period.This is a good book to read for an overview of pregnancy, labor, birth and the early postpartum period. I would recommend that you also read other more in-depth books such as: The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth written by Henci Goer, The Pregnancy Book, by Dr William Sears and his wife Martha Sears, RN, and Spiritual Midwifery by Ina May Gaskin, RN, Midwife."},{"Title":"Galatians (The NIV Application Commentary)","review":"I'm a pastor and own this commentary along with many, many other commentaries on Galatians. I bought this commentary so that I would have great application starter ideas for my sermons. I have to say that I'm probably not going to use it much more than I have to date. The main reason is that although I find Scot's reasoning to be sound, the ideas he explores (at least what I have read so far) do not really fit the text under review. So as I read his stuff, I keep thinking: Good point...that doesn't flow from this passage well, so I cannot use it at all here.Take the passage I preached through last Sunday, Galatians 2:1-10,ESV Galatians 2:1 Then after fourteen years I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking Titus along with me. 2 I went up because of a revelation and set before them (though privately before those who seemed influential) the gospel that I proclaim among the Gentiles, in order to make sure I was not running or had not run in vain. 3 But even Titus, who was with me, was not forced to be circumcised, though he was a Greek. 4 Yet because of false brothers secretly brought in--who slipped in to spy out our freedom that we have in Christ Jesus, so that they might bring us into slavery-- 5 to them we did not yield in submission even for a moment, so that a)the truth of the gospel might be preserved for you. 6 And from those who seemed to be influential (what they were makes no difference to me; God shows no partiality)--those, I say, who seemed influential added nothing to me. 7 On the contrary, when they saw that I had been entrusted with the gospel to the uncircumcised, just as Peter had been entrusted with the gospel to the circumcised 8 (for he who worked through Peter for his apostolic ministry to the circumcised worked also through me for mine to the Gentiles), 9 and when James and Cephas and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived the grace that was given to me, they gave the right hand of fellowship to Barnabas and me, that we should go to the Gentiles and they to the circumcised. 10 Only, they asked us to remember the poor, the very thing I was eager to do.as an example. This is part of Paul's autobiography where he took Barnabas and Titus to meet privately with James, Cephas and John in Jerusalem. Their affirmation of his gospel is pivotal on the acceptance of Gentile churches. The issue is central for the gospel & evangelism. Instead of drawing applications that mirror central issues, or focusing on the culminating point (ministering to the poor), McKnight meanders through a discussion that ponders social nuances like which kind of music is best and how do we as believers navigate those sorts of issues. He spends a lot of time on things that in my view should not be applications from the passage at hand. He starts in about Southern Baptist music, vs contemporary worship and other things that have absolutely nothing to do with the passage OR the central issues in the passage applied to anything I could see.The result is that what I've read so far is pretty useless for pastoral studies. To be honest, there are many great works on Galatians on the market, and after looking at this volume, I don't believe it should be on a buy list for someone who has limited funds to work with as a pastor/bible student/teacher. I'm sure there are some really good sections in this volume, but I gave up on it before I could get that far. He lost me when he developed the kind of application I took the time to chronicle so far.For better applcation ideas on Galatians I recommend Stott's commentary. His exegesis should be checked by Jervis & Fung & Bruce who all seem to be more careful and balanced in their treatment of controversial items.Stott has apparently embraced Annihilationism of some sort, and his exegesis often wanders from the lexicons (I have not figured out why this is so, but he does it in every commentary I have studied-see my review on Stott's commentary on Ephesians for more on that), yet I think Stott is more helpful than McKnight. And I favor Fung's NICNT on Galatians far more than even Stott-see my reviews on those commentaries for more.In the above application I reviewed for McKnight, all four: Stott, Fung, Jervis & Bruce all had helpful things that I was able to draw application from for a sermon. McKnight didn't. I wish I could give a better review for this book. I love commentaries. Twas disappointed with this one. Sorry. Use your money on Fung first, then Bruce, Jervis, Stott, Smiley.The NIVAC series has some volumes which I have found to be excellent: See Isaiah by Oswalt as an example. I believe the editors of the NIVAC series ought to plan a replacement volume for the Galatians volume reviewed here. I'm sorry to have to report this, but that is how I honestly see it."},{"Title":"Galatians (The NIV Application Commentary)","review":"I have read passages from Galatians many times in Bible studies, but never really studied the book in detail as a whole until now.

Excellent commentary and application, including many, many cross references to other writings with themes introduced in Galatians. Outstanding."},{"Title":"Galatians (The NIV Application Commentary)","review":"I had read Galatians before, but never learned so much as when I read it with this book. Scot goes into great, yet very relevant, detail about 1st century Judaism and how the conflict with this was a major issue for the largely-Gentile church at Galatia. It is not immediately obvious how conflict with Judaism 2000 years ago can apply today, but Scot draws out clear lessons about how we can learn by moving contents and looking for &quot;socially equivalent&quot; issues in the church today. Excellent book."},{"Title":"Galatians (The NIV Application Commentary)","review":"The book was what I needed for class. Great for getting more in depth about the culture and its meaning on the book of Galatians and what it means for us today in our culture.

This 1959 collection contains selections from the works of philosophers such as Croce, Ortega y Gasset, Collingwood, Toynbee, Dewey, Nagel, Burckhardt, Popper, etc. Meyerhoff wrote an Introduction, and includes a very useful introductory section to each excerpt, as well.He notes in the Introduction, \\"we do not find anywhere in the ancient world a philosophy of history---either in the speculative sense... or in the analytic sense.\\" (Pg. 1) He adds, \\"Historicism opens a new chapter in the study of history... The basic thesis of historicism is quite simple: the subject matter of history is human life in its totality and multiplicity. It is the historian's aim to portray the bewildering, unsystematic variety of historical forms... in the process of continuous growth and transformation.\\" (Pg. 10)An essay by Charles Beard states, \\"The philosopher, possessing little or no acquaintance with history, sometimes pretends to expound the inner secret of history, but the historian turns upon him and expounds the secret of the philosopher... by placing him in relation to the movement of ideas and interests in which he stands or floats, by giving to his scheme of thought its appropriate relativity.\\" (Pg. 140) He later adds, \\"only three broad conceptions of all history as actuality are possible. History is chaos and every attempt to interpret it otherwise is an illusion. History moves around in a kind of cycle. History moves in a line, straight or spiral, and in some direction. The historian may seek to escape these issues... or he may face them boldly, aware of the intellectual and moral perils inherent in any decision---in his act of faith.\\" (Pg. 151)John Dewey's selection argues, \\"All historical construction is necessarily selective. This principle ... it is of importance because its acknowledgement compels attention to the fact that everything in the writing of history depends upon the principle used to control selection.\\" (Pg. 167)W.H. Walsh's essay says, \\"I suggest that the main factors which actually make for disagreement among historians may be grouped under the following four heads. First, personal likes and dislikes... Secondly, prejudices or... assumptions he makes... Thirdly, conflicting theories of historical interpretation... Fourthly, basically different moral beliefs, conceptions of the nature of man...\\" (Pg. 216)Though more than 50 years old, this collection is still of considerable value to anyone studying the philosophy of history."},{"Title":"The Psychology of Creativity and Discovery: Scientists and Their Work","review":"This book is a rare and excellent description of on charachers needed and processes used by worldclass scientists making great discovereis.

If you like thisone you LOVE Captive in the dark, a two book series. READ READ READ Judgement."},{"Title":"Judgment","review":"Judgment was a really strange and different read for me.The system in Judgment was somewhat more difficult to understand. First off, the slaves were all women, and all came into the system non-consensually. The book was told by female Mischief, an American woman kidnapped from an airport by human traffickers.The society is set-up as a hierarchy in a \\"school\\" (if you will) of 200 female slaves, and the guards and \\"headmasters\\" who oversee them, and an \\"overlord\\" who runs the full operation (the quoted terms are my own, not necessarily as written in the book, btw).The women are subjected to tortuous stuff and poor living conditions to break their wills and force them to participate in this society, and eventually they behave so they can move up to the next level of slavery, which has different duties and different privileges, with the ultimate goal of being sold to a kind master or of becoming a personal slave and pampered companion to a \\"Headmaster\\" or the \\"overlord.\\" Our protagonist, the unusually flame-haired Mischief, skips the rank nonsense and basically moves from 'newbie' to 'overlord's beloved pet' in a short period of time, but that's pretty typical of this kind of story, so I'm not knocking it.The real fascination with this story is that Mischief accompanies her Master to the US and gets separated from him, freaks out, and gets picked up by the police.She no longer is emotionally capable of feeding or dressing herself, and has no comprehension of the real world.The narrative flips between the now-Mischief in the hands of the police, and the then-Mischief when she was a newly captured slave.The level of her Stockholm Syndrome is extreme and shocking. That's pretty much all I'm going to say about that.Judgment is what I would call \\"erotic fantasy\\" - nothing you'd ever want to live, but interesting if you like reading about alter-society systemic sexual slavery, rough sex, torturous beatings, and a brainwashed protagonist with Stockholm Syndrom. It has all this, and good writing, to boot.There's a lot of time spent on Mischief's capture and the first few weeks in the system, before she settles into her role, then it's a lightening move into the present, and the transition was a little too quick for me. I would have like to have been privvy to more of the conflict that made her dear to her Master, and maybe even a little glimpse into a sex scene that she actually enjoys..."},{"Title":"Judgment","review":"I purchased this book around 1:30 a.m. for some next day reading. \\"Just a quick chapter,\\" I told myself. I finished Judgment just after dawn."},{"Title":"Judgment","review":"This is another case of an excellent book for a particular genre not getting deserving attention (at least as far as reviews go...for all I know it's a best seller). I feel compelled to at least write a short review because the story has not left my head even though I finished it a few days ago. Judgment is about domination and submission with a fairly violent spanking bent. Don't get it 'twisted' though, we're not talking about sweet over-the-knee erotic spankings. The action is somewhat extreme but without permanent injury. There's a bondage emphasis as well.Judgment is a non-consensual capture story about the dominant Mountain Lord and the young woman/captive he takes a particular interest in... who he names Mischief. The Mountain Lord, Daymon Tane, is a slaver and Mischief is originally abducted with other women. The setting is then the mountain fortress where Tane and his cohorts train submissives for sale. I'm not interested in multiple captive stories unless it is personal and important between a particular couple, which is how things develop here. It is definitely a story about Tane and Mischief and, even though I know it's wrong, I like them together. The secondary characters (mostly the other dominants/masters) and the world building make the story very interesting as well and help to move the action along. And there's also the aspect of Mischief, after becoming the perfect submissive object, interacting with the outside world.Two other things to say. If you liked stories like Kitty Thomas'Comfort Food, Stephanie Snow'sDemon's Captiveor Remittance Girl'sGaijin(all of which I recommend), you will definitely like this. Also, it turns out this book existed in another incarnation...asJudgement(notice the now absent E).

This was offset in a clever way, and truly one of the more interesting aspects of the book, by showing how others not in the scene (the police force) react to the training and ingraining of Mischief after she has been a part of Judgement for 10 years. The last few chapters, in which Mischief becomes the personal slave to the Master of Masters at Judgement, are most gripping, and days later I still am trying to get them out of my mind.

The main thing I detested is that you never get into the minds of the captors- they're all portrayed as hardened sadists with no compassion. There's a lot of punishment and not much insight in to the characters personalities (or lack there of) or motivations. Comfort Food gave me a lot to think about...this one went out of my mind immediately, thankfully."},{"Title":"Judgment","review":"Rating: 4.5 starsThis book was a dark read and it is not anything like FSOG--it's about Master/slave and about a Dom/sub.

Callie first given the name Red because of her hair and later renamed Mischief by her Master was kidnapped and brought to Judgment. When Mischief arrives at the compound she fights her captives and pays the price. Her defiance earns her attention from Tane-the head Master-on her first night at Judgment. Her defiance continues as does his fascination with her.Her defiance continues and that is what earns her the name Mischief. She is eventually broken when she tries to escape and lands in the arms of Tane. He sentences her to a caning and waiting she does something that earns her a total of 30 strikes of the cane.While we are learning about how Mischief was captured and tortured into complete submission the author also dives into the physiological state of Mischief. There are other interesting aspects to this story. There is a whole hierarchy of slaves-the top being Personals.When presented with a real chance of escape I was shocked at her response-which really just goes to show you how beaten down and broken she really became. Overall, there are some twists and turns in this story and there is ALOT of violence and some steamy scenes. I found myself talking to my iPad because I was baffled, appalled, or just totally shocked by some scenes.Thanks for reading my review!!"},{"Title":"Judgment","review":"This book comes from a genre that I feel doesn't get enough attention; dark erotica. In this case, there is a HUGE emphasis on the word \\"dark\\". This is a kindnapping, non-consensual, pleasure slave-training story. It is intense, and is bound to make a lot of people very uncomfortable. I knew what I was about to read from the start (came from a very good book review from a well-known blogger), so I had my game face on. I was ready to to be shocked.Yeah, I was shocked. **insert googly eyes here**This is dark, scary, slighly (only slightly) erotic. In certain places, it had me questioning my own judgement and suffering a little bit from Stockholm Syndrome myself. I couldn't believe I actually wanted what I wanted to happen, ya know?Judgement tells the story of Callie McGuire, who we will know as \\"Mischief\\". She is kidnapped as a young adult on a vacation. She is kidnapped and sold for the purpose of being a pleasure slave. It is told from her POV, in both past and present tenses. Seems she has been 'found' and in a police station where they want to know \\"What the heck has happened to YOU??\\". She has been with her Master for 10 years by the time she is found. She will tell her story and reflect on what has happened to her. You will love and dislike her at the same time. You're left wondering why she is thinking the way she is thinking.If I didn't know better, I would have thought I was reading a true story. What happens, how it happens...seems so real-life, that it's hard keep remembering that it's a work of fiction. Though, I know human trafficking is a real problem to this day, so I think that's why it felt so real.Why only 3-STARS? Well, for a few reasons. First, I found a lot of spelling/grammar/format errors. After too many of them, I found it a bit irritating. Secondly, I was disappointed with the ending. Though, that is my personal opinion...but it really changed the way I felt about the book. I wanted something SO MUCH more. I desperately wanted that HEA for Mischief. I also felt a lot of stones were left unturned. I should mention that I read \\"Captive in the Dark\\" and \\"Seduced in the Dark\\" by CJ Roberts and absolutely mind-blowingly LOVED that series. It stands in my top 5 to this day. If you enjoyed that series, then Judgement will certainly interest you...but it will probably fall short of what you're looking for. If there is a second book, I will not hesitate to read it. I feel like I NEED more from this book - like there is still more of Mischief's story to be told. Maybe even Tane (Master) too. I do recommend this as a read, but only if you think you can handle the mind-bending craziness of it all. It's VERY DARK and VERY intense."},{"Title":"Judgment","review":"This book jumps right in and grabs you from the first page and I just about read it in one sitting. It is a gripping story about sex slavery, focusing on Callie, aka Mischief, a young girl kidnapped while vacationg in Europe. The tale is told by her, first in her current situation where she is being held by the police who are trying to figure out who she is and what is wrong with her; and secondly about her time in the facility called Judgment.I do not normally enjoy flashbacks in my books, but they are present throughout this one, and I found them to be short and extremely important to the rest of the story. Mischief has undergone extreme conditioning, over the span of ten + years, which explains her behavior with the detectives. The rest of the book is spent describing her experiences at Judgment, which consisted of many colorfully described beatings with just about every implement available by just about every Master in the place (and there are quite a few).There is some sex here and there, and even a quick f/f scene, but it isn't focused on or described nearly as much as the overall behavior modification and the techniques the Masters employ to produce \\"finished products\\" for sale. The girls move up through several rankings, the \\"luckier\\" ones become Personals (personal slaves to the Masters).I loved this story (something maybe wrong with that, I don't know), but I just couldn't put it down until I knew how things turned out one way or the other. I can't wait to read the next one."},{"Title":"Judgment","review":"First, let me say that I do NOT enjoy the BDSM genre. It is a subject that is off-putting to me. I do not waste my time reading this type of thing.However, this story sucked me right in from sentence one and before I knew it, I found I could not put the thing down. I began reading only a preview based on high recommendations in the forums. I thought the story would be some kind of sleaze-porn without a plot. Boy was I ever wrong!The characters were well developed and so life-like I completely forgot where I was. It has been a very long time since I was lost in a tale, but I truly felt as if I were right there as events unfolded. The plot was so well thought out, I couldn't help but read on in horrified fascination til I reached the very end.Ms. Hall Takes you on a dark journey of horrific degradation through the eyes of a feisty young girl who is abducted, humiliated, violated, tortured, and stripped of her very essence against her will for the sadistic pleasure of a Slaver.Though the subject matter is quite controversial, I highly recommend this story. It is one that stays with you long after you put the book down."},{"Title":"Judgment","review":"I was reluctant thinking just 'spankings', boring, vanilla! Not so. Lots of bondage and discipline. Includes piercing and some other fun fetishes. A good long read too. There is a sequel, maybe not quite the same but still entertaining. I hope there is more to come about this mountain fortress training camp for subs."},{"Title":"Absolute Truths","review":"Everyone looking for depth, entertainment and a real spirituality boost should read this book. Everyone looking for an intellectual challenge should read this book. I just have to say it - everyone should read this book! Absolute Truths is actually the sixth book in a series, but like the other five stands fine on its own. It deals with the Church of England and in particular a few specific members of the church, in the 1960's. It deals with what is going on in society, what is going on with &quot;regular&quot; people and what is going on inside the Church of England and with its members. It focuses on one particular Bishop, Charles Ashworth, and shows him faults and all as a regular human being as he deals with the ups and downs in his personal, professional and spiritual life. There are terrific discussions of religious, spiritual, artistic and socio-economic ideals. This book will stretch your mind into thinking things you never thought would enter your grey matter. It's highly recommended by most of the people I know that have read it. And it's also recommended that you read the other books in this series. This book will change your life."},{"Title":"Absolute Truths","review":"Although this is the last book in the Starbridge series it is actually set in time before its immediate prequel, Mystical Paths. Howatch obviously had good reasons for doing this; no other book could have rounded up the series so perfectly, and certainly it was a delight to return to Chares Ashworh as narrator, who began the whole series. This time Charles is at the evening of his life. He has been the Bishop of Salisbury for some years.. Some of those nearest and dearest to him have passed away and he has to come to terms not only with the sense of loss, doubt and lack of direction, but also with his wayward Dean, Neville Ayesgarth, who still insists on going off on a tangent in affairs of the Cathedral. As in Scandalous Risks, scandal seems only around the corner and Charles has to develop very strong spiritual muscles in order to bring matters to an outcome worthy of a Christian.I must not forget to mention that in this novel Starbridge Cathedral itself - in the other books merely a background stat - becomes a major character, and a star player during the Grande Finale The climax of this book is not only deeply moving, it is also absolutely perfect. As is the entire series."},{"Title":"Absolute Truths","review":"When we started out in Book #1, the narrator, Charles Ashworth, was still fairly young. In this novel, he is again the narrator but he is elderly and the bishop of Starbridge. Being this age, he can wind up everyone's story. There is his whole generation of people and their families in the Anglican Church plus his childrens' generation of people. Of all the books, I'd say this one you better read as #6 and not out of order. There are simply too many stories which are wrapped up here that won't have the same impact on you if you haven't read books 1-5. This novel has its share of worldly problems with: gay priests (2), the ghost of Jardine appearing in the cathederal, an exorcism of the cathedral, a possible embezzlement by Dean Aysgarth from cathedral funds, a suicide, death of a spouse and finding another spouse. It also has combined therapeutic-spiritual sessions again with Jon Darrow as spiritual director for both Ashworth and Aysgarth. Once I started any of the 6 books, I couldn't stop reading till the end and this one was no exception."},{"Title":"Absolute Truths","review":"This and every one of Susan Howatch's novels are well worth the time put into them. They're literate, challenging and dare to explore questions of faith, love, family and loyalty. And while her &quot;potboiler&quot; novels are excellent, DON'T be put off by the 6-volume Church of England series. The characters are engaging and the questions and answers they discover during the traumatic events of their lives and the eventual renewal of their souls took me to philosophical places I'd never been before and forced me to often consider the same issues the characters themselves grappled with. That's what's wrong with people today - they're intellectually lazy and don't want to deal with issues of faith, belief, and the renewing powers of love. However, Ms. Howatch does so with a style and flair and gift with the written word that I can only sit back, read and envy and admire. More! More!"},{"Title":"Absolute Truths","review":"Knowing that those likely to read this review may well already share my love for the series as a whole, I shall begin by saying that Susan's gift for characterisation, with a great honesty and much room for grace to do its work, is always superb, and here at a new peak. My general approach to her main figures in the series is to see Jonathan Darrow as someone I'd love to hear preach but might be nervous to meet (even if he tends to compress 40 years worth of direction into a week's retreat) - Neville Aysgarth as someone I'd like to shake by the shoulders - Nicholas Darrow as one I'd closet with a library of the first fifteen centuries of Christian thought before he'd be allowed out - and Charles Ashworth as the ultimate Christian intellectual with whom I'd love to share weekly four-hour lunches with the best claret on the table. In this volume, Charles is once again the key character, and the reader finds, as he himself gradually learns, that the old glittering image is still much alive and as troublesome as ever.Watching this character struggle with bereavement and grief of all varieties, and finally face the long-hidden &quot;demons&quot; which lurked in shadows to affect his relationship with his children and with his old nemesis Aysgarth, is incredibly moving and insightful. Dramatic though the plot becomes, it is a marvellous work wherein a seasoned bishop comes to new self-knowledge, humility, compassion ... and, while I'll not give the ending away, ultimately a specific setting of happiness which some readers will have thought he should have snatched 30 years before."},{"Title":"Absolute Truths","review":"You will love this book. If you like books based in England you'll love it even more, but just in general it will move you. It is funny, spiritual, serious, light, tragic . . . it's everything you need in a good read. I agree with the other reviewers, it does stand extremely well on it's own, but it is part of a set. If you can, read the previous five books, but it is not required to understand and be affected by what goes on in Absolute Truths. I have told many people about this book and everyone who has read it loved it. Susan Howatch is a modern-day miracle worker genius. She is inspiring, intelligent and compassionate in her portrayals and in her message to the reader. Read this book and let it change your life - it has already changed mine."},{"Title":"Absolute Truths","review":"I simply cannot think of another author who so deftly weaves an entertaining plot line with a strong moral tone. The resultis wondrous. This is a story of a man who must grapple with modern challenges tothe faith he has upheld all his life. Written with grace and elegance, thisnovel accurately captures the essence of human nature. As heroes of fictionare perenially discovering, the world and its inhabitants cannot be neatlydivided into catagories of black and white. And although this theme has beenexplored since the beginning of literature, no author in recent memory has beenable to do so with such an able grasp of language, pathos, and humor. This bookilluminates answers to the eternal questions of existence, God, and thecapacity of the human heart."},{"Title":"Absolute Truths","review":"I listened to what I wanted from a work called \\"Absolute Truths\\"-I who am desperately conservative in Christianity and most things. After Charles Ashworth's triumph in \\"Glittering Images,\\" and his overall positive portrayal in the books between that and this, I didn't want to find out that the truth I thought he had found, and that Howatch suggested he had found, was a lie, another of the tragic misconceptions that Howatch regularly and regretfully demolishes in her characters (\\"Anti-Sex Ashworth\\" toppled by doubt and lust stronger than his convictions-what a depressing concept).It wasn't. But in the interim between \\"Glittering Images\\" and \\"Absolute Truths,\\" Ashworth's grip on the truth had shifted until he had become a false man holding a true thing, or, to put it another way, Ashworth had grown as much as he could during \\"Glittering Images,\\" but he still had far to grow, and \\"Absolute Truths\\" pushed him farther.Thus Howatch, as in the rest of this Starbridge series, follows a plot sequence of strength debilitating into weakness, then supernaturally resolved into strength (or truth to lies to truth, or any number of other ways may describe this spiritual falling and rising pattern). We cannot however assume that the characters will live happily ever after, that their lives are \\"solved,\\" or even that the weakness resolved in the novel will never return in later years. Howatch's cruces do not involve perfect or perfectible people, but perfect moments of grace that make the rest of lives better or in some way bearable. In a sort of backhanded optimism, Ashworth writes in the midst of his revelations, \\"Dimly I realised that this state of companionable hell could be classified as a form of survival.\\" At the end of \\"Absolute Truths,\\" Howatch permits Ashworth an idyllically happy old age and a platform for reminiscence, a sort of sop to him and to her for six dramatically painful novels in the series, but we must not forget that after \\"Glittering Images\\" Ashworth needed \\"Absolute Truths\\" to correct him further. After receiving revelation that revolutionised his life, he needed more revelation. As such, these novels are some of the most true-to-life of any fiction I've read portraying the Christian way of living. They give hope, not for all things to turn out alright, but for all things to \\"intermingle,\\" as Ashworth insists, for good-and for there to be moments, rising above the doubt and pain, in which we may see God and absolute truths as clearly as our eyes can function. We may live a long time, decades, in the strength vouchsafed by these moments. Then we may need another, as Ashworth did."},{"Title":"Absolute Truths","review":"Interesting last novel in the Starbridge series by Susan Howatch. Would recommend it to anyone but particuarly to those who have read the previous five novels in series. Helps if you are an Anglican,Episcopalian or Roman Catholic. Starbridge series is both emotional and theological. Starbridge series is set in mid-twentieth century in southern England when theology was going thru some changes and allowing some more High Church thinking into general circulation, but with many battles on the subject. The series had mostly to do with Anglican clergy attempting to work out some theological/emotional conflicts.Linda Sheean"},{"Title":"Absolute Truths","review":"1965. Charles Ashworth is now Bishop of Starbridge with a cosy well structured life. Then his wife dies suddenly, his bad relationship with the Dean of Starbridge Cathederal takes a turn for the worse, one of his Curates gets beaten up and pornographic material is found at his home, his sons problems get worse. In all this Ashworth realises that his belief in absolute truths, laudable though they are, must never come at the expense of compassion and the humility that a clergyman, particually a Bishop, needs. I strongly recommend it."},{"Title":"Absolute Truths","review":"I am prompted to write this in reading the review from the previous reader who started a woman's prayer group as a result. I too have read this book more than once, just finished a few days ago and am still deeply moved. Susan Howatch is a wonder! Thank you dear author for these transporting/transforming works."},{"Title":"Absolute Truths","review":"This final books in the series doesn't lose any of the power of the first book when the character of Charles Ashworth is introduced. I have read all of the series. The most striking thing about this final book is the growth of Charles' wife from a somewhat unlikeable character into one I can truly understand and admire. Here is a woman who has made serious errors in her life. Yet, she overcomes and in her last years, on her own, discovers the power of prayer. She also, opens up to other women and is less alone than in her youth. I loved this book."},{"Title":"Absolute Truths","review":"I, too, have been fortunate to have read all six books in this series. Each one a masterpiece. And the final chapter is Susan's crowning achievement. This is no syrupy faith in &quot;faith&quot;. This is the real thing- faith in God. But it is not a religious book; it's a secular novel whose characters are real people- warts and all. I wonder if other readers are reminded of Margaret, Taylor and Rosamunde? What do they all have in common; they are sensitive, consummate, WOMEN authors. The best. Keep writing, sisters, and help keep us all from going over the brink!"},{"Title":"Absolute Truths","review":"i submit this review to offer some balance to the other (& so far all glowing) reviews. i rely heavily on reviews to guide my choice of books and want to spend my money on books that other readers rate highly. i was not aware that the book is part of a series and had not read any other books by this author. the book does stand alone. i am an atheist and read widely from a variety of different-minded sources to inform myself and for balance. this was my first foray into 'christian fiction'.i did not enjoy the book at all and it was a signifcant effort to finish it. in my opinion you'd have to have a pretty serious belief in very traditional conservative christianity to survive this book. the message i took away from it is that - certainly in the 1960s - the people of the church establishment were as sanctimonious, hypocritical and self-centred as i remember were the vicar and staff of the local church i was exposed to as a child. if one accepts a genuine belief in the premise of an omniscient and omnipotent god and that these people represent that entity in our society, then the actions and attitudes of the characters are incomprehensible to me. the lack of self-control, misogyny and the casual attitude to the damage and suffering the characters cause to others, to say nothing of the infinitely flexible moral and ethical standards of individuals for a wide range of issues (including fraud, honesty, accountability, homosexuality and sexual and emotional fidelity) would be comical if they were not so infuriating. the characters' inward-looking and self-referenced self-pity and concern about 'exposure' did nothing for me other than to reinforce my astonishment at the idea that people working in any religious hierarchy are at all capable of providing a moral compass for others. to say i did not warm to the characters would be an understatement - i found them universally unattractive.i do not presume to criticise the author's knowledge of the subject matter nor her skills as a writer. but this was not a good experience for me and i would most definitely not recommend it as of general interest."},{"Title":"Absolute Truths","review":"I too have read all of Susan Howatch's novels about the Church of England, including a seventh, The Wonder Worker, an unexpected and wonderful gift from the author to her fans. But it is Absolute Truths to which I keep returning at least once a year. What a beautifully and deeply moving story--of a character, Charles Ashworth, who wasn't my favorite throughout the other five novels. I always have a great cry when I read this novel and this time I've been moved to do something more--to begin a ladies prayer group. Thank you from the bottom of my heart, Susan Howatch. Yes, you can read this book simply for entertainment or distraction. But it will reach deep into your soul anyway!"},{"Title":"Absolute Truths","review":"Another of Susan Howatch's books and as always I very much enjoyed it. ...

The book covers a lot of ground, since anything can be a 'component'. The discussion is split into front end, middle tier and back end components. So the scope is big. This book assumes you know .Net, and have played with VS.Net, so don't expect an introductory level text. I think the author does a great job of picking out the most important parts of the .Net framework and demonstrating their practical use in short but useful examples.I have been disappointed at numerous books that spend ages covering the same ground like introduction to .Net and using windows or web controls, leaving meatier issues untouched. In contrast, Faison treads quickly, and clearly, through major topics in .Net such as (not in order): using windows &amp; web controls, user windows &amp; web controls, Crystal reports, database access &amp; data grids, session management in ASP, security, web services, and so on. Many other areas of the framework are covered in passing; for example a handy section on using the web browser control in .Net.The discussion of UML in the beginning is a bit fast, particularly the terse presentation of numerous design patterns, but the author's use of UML sequence diagrams through the book is excellent.My main criticism is that the author tries a bit hard at humor with the quotes before each chapter. Otherwise, it's a great book."},{"Title":"Component-Based Development with Visual C# (Professional Mindware)","review":"I absolutely enjoyed reading the book.

Not that you need to really. It works well as a stand alone book.I found it to be a very slow starting book. It was hard to get into but I finally found it a little engaging about the middle of the book. The characters were less than engaging to me. It was hard to tell certain ones apart. The only ones that were really all that fleshed out were Ike, Libby, Angus, and Maddie. Arguably the main characters but the others could really have used some work.Nothing really surprised me as I read. Things that were implied happened very quickly afterward. Things that were built up, such as the circus coming to town or Abigail's baby being born, were rushed and finished with within a couple of paragraphs. Even things such as Opal and Sophrina running off to the circus was rushed and resolved within a page or two.In all I don't regret reading it and I will keep it on my bookshelf, but in all honestly I doubt I'd reread it.

I used this book and associated software (which you must download) in a graduate Aviation Route Planning class, and this book takes every opportunity to disappoint.Understand that this is a simulation guide and you must use the simulation as part of a registered class. As for faults, there are many. The most glaring error is the almost total absence of information related to selections you must make from the very beginning. There is essentially no discussion of pros and cons of various options presented, therefore if any of the information is not completely understood prior to beginning the class (which obviously defeats the purpose of the class) errors can be made which can prove disastrous for the remainder of the simulation. Only my long history in the industry assisted me in making reasonable choices in the numerous gray areas.If you insist on taking a class that uses this simulation, buy a comprehensive airline management text and read it prior to starting the class (perhaps the books by Douganis would be most helpful). Don't even think about buying this for personal use; you will get nothing from it.As an aside, the software is extremely buggy (for myself and many others in my class), so be prepared to enter all decisions multiple times, have data disappear, never be able to find your information, etc.All in all this is without peer in the truly horrible textbook category. If you can take an equivalent course based on case studies, or for that matter ANY other text, by all means do so. I was obviously very disappointed by this book (and software): it sounded like a good idea at the time, and I genuinely thought it could prove of value to my knowledge of the materiel; instead all I got was indigestion."},{"Title":"Airline: A Strategic Management Simulation (4th Edition)","review":"The book is missing some pages, as warned.

Although the context is the airline industry, most, if not all, of the generic decisions one must make in business are contained. For example, decisions must be made in the areas of price, promotion, training and dividends.I use this simulation in some of my upper level business classes. Since it is a strategic simulation, you need some prior knowledge of the different functional areas to make wise decisions. If you do not possess this prior knowledge, then you need the willingness to do some research in your areas of weakness.Many of my students find this to be one of the highlights of the class. Some, however, do struggle with it. If one keeps an attitude of learning as the ultimate goal, and stays motivated towards that goal, then this simulation can be a positive learning experience. The simulation can and will probably require serious thought and effort."},{"Title":"Complete plays","review":"This is a generally good and easily available, inexpensive edition of Marlowe's plays. My only reservation about it is Steane's edition of Dr. Faustus. He makes the worst of both major texts, taking the general outline from the 1616 text but throwing in a lot of corrupt scraps from the 1604 edition for the clown scenes. I would advise anyone who wants to read Dr. Faustus to look elsewhere. I'm convinced that the 1604 version is on the whole a corrupt and truncated version of the play, but if you prefer it you might look into the Folger Library edition. If on the other hand you would rather read the play more or less as I think Marlowe wrote it, try the Signet edition edited by Sylvan Barnet.The other plays present no major textual problems (except for The Massacre at Paris, which is pretty hopeless) and this is a fine place to meet them."},{"Title":"Complete plays","review":"I also wrote the April 15 review. It should be noted that I was reviewing the Steane edition, while the November reviewer was evidently reviewing the Burnett edition - since both editions have the same titles, Amazon includes the review for one in the other, and vice versa. What I said April 15 applies to Steane, not Burnett.As to theonlytruegeo's disagreement. The B-text additions were almost certainly written in 1602, according to an entry in Henslowe's diary. Marlowe died in 1593; and the play was probably written about 1588, though some disagree. It's quite a stretch to say that Marlowe had ideas about what to include in the play, but they were not incorporated in his lifetime, or for 9 years after his death.The 1616 version may be a little tidier, but it is also almost universally judged inferior. The additions to it (some 1000 lines) are practically all slapstick and special effects. By 1616 Marlowe's play had degenerated from a &quot;tragicall history&quot; into harum scarum.But as to Burnett's edition, which I am reviewing here. It includes all of Marlowe's plays, including the 2 versions of Doctor Faustus. What I don't like is Burnett's editing. He is one of those scholars intuned to faddish critical theory. Notably, instead of considering Marlowe's works as plays, as literature, he sees them merely as &quot;texts,&quot; thinly veiled autobiography, something to be dismantled, and so you can expect to get a warped interpretation from him. His quotes of Marlowe are usually taken out of context to prove some point, and his commentary is full of pompous language: &quot;In its atomization of all forms of culturally conditioned distinction lies a key to the play's destabilising importance.&quot; How meaningless! He's trying to say that Marlowe picks apart cultural roles and beliefs, but what is the &quot;destabilising importance&quot;? George Orwell wrote an essay about meaningless language; if you write like that, Orwell might set you straight.Burnett is too divorced from the literary values of Marlowe. In one place he praises an essay collection about Marlowe for being &quot;Theoretically informed.&quot; No comment on whether their essays are particularly good, or insightful -- they're just &quot;theoretically informed.&quot; And in another place: &quot;[Marlowe's]plays are sufficently diffuse in subject matter and wide-ranging in orientation to attract readers of contrasting persuasions, from the critic interested in language and performance to the 'New Historicist' drawn to the representation of subversive types and dissident ideologies.&quot; Revealingly, he seems to be unable to see how people might be interested in Marlowe even if they don't have a particular theoretical ax to grind. Burnett seems to have forgetten that people read Marlowe because he is a great poet and playwright; he is an artist; his works are great literature. Yet he can only imagine that people would be interested in Marlowe for the opportunity to tinker on his plays with some pet critical Theory. By all means read Marlowe, but if you can, find another edition."},{"Title":"Complete plays","review":"...this edition contains both the 1604 and 1616 editions of Dr. Faustus. In all honestly, though, I don't entirely buy the notion that the former should automatically take precedence over the latter. It's entirely possible that the additions made to it were in fact Marlowe's own ideas that were merely added by others. And in any case, I would have to say that, as a whole, the 1616 version is more coherent, with a lot of the threads left hanging in the 1604 cleared up. More is done with the clowns, and the character on whom Faustus inflicts horns goes from an anonymous &quot;knight&quot; to an actual character. The 1604 does have some things to be said for it (the bit about Christ's blood streaming in the firmament has been inexcusably edited out of the 1616, f'rinstance, and there's a brief scene at the end with the scholars that seems superfluous), but as a whole I'd go with it rather than the 1604. If I was going to put on a production of the play, I'd combine the two as I saw fit. Okay then."},{"Title":"Complete plays","review":"The Complete Plays includes all of Marlowe's plays (well, obviously.)

Judgement of the characters is (for the most part) left to the reader.

Very reasonably priced, and it's all there. The plays sweep you along (I always envision darkening Puccini-like chords in the background) images and crackling dialogue abounds. My problem is: 1) I have never seen the plays produced. This is *such* a handicap. I actually yawned through Shakepeare's &quot;Tempest&quot; until I saw a fine production. Now it is hands-down my favorite play and 2)I have to get in the swing of reading Elizabethan English for every reading. Therefore, I do not recommend reading in short snippets if you are also dialect challenged.Do keep in mind Marlowe (as Shakespeare) was trying to make a living, not write for the ages. He's trying to entice you to buy a ticket and be charmed. He succeeds admirably. There is something for everyone: action, derring do, comedy, and sharp insights.Marlowe is your mysterious, wild, sometimes trecherous friend; brilliant, but can you trust him? Probably not. If he was a vintage southern American, he might say &quot;I didn't take you to raise.&quot; Would he lie to you? mislead you? Of course. But in everything I have read of Marlowe's I hear his voice; he is *there.* With Shakespeare, I do not have that certainty.Recommend reading &quot;The Reckoning&quot; by Charles Nicholl for an excellent biography on Marlowe. It reads like an excellent mystery, which he was."},{"Title":"Complete plays","review":"You may wonder when reading these reviews to which exact edition they relate and what the contents are.The Penguin Christopher Marlowe complete plays contains:Dido, Queen of CarthageTamburlaine the Great, Part OneTamburlaine the Great, Part 2.The Jew of MaltaDoctor FaustusEdward 2The Massacre at ParisThis is all the known Marlowe plays.At the back of the book are notes on each play explaining meanings of various lines, in lieu of page by page annotations, an 11 page word glossary, and a 14 page list of mythological, historical and geographical names. At the front of the book you will find a 35 page introduction, and several pages of recommended further reading.The Dr Faustus text apparently is from 1604 version aka the 'A' Text. The 1616 or 'B' text is not included. From my research the B text was substantially altered from the A text adding about 600 lines. If you want to get all the Marlowe including the poems for a modest price, I recommend you get theComplete Works of Christopher Marlowe (Illustrated)edition on Kindle which includes both versions. If you don't have Kindle you can download the app from Amazon. This also includes an apocryphal play Lust's Dominion attributed by some experts to Marlowe.As an alterantive to Penguin, I recommend you considerDoctor Faustus and Other Plays (Oxford World's Classics) (Parts I and II). This has both versions of Faust but does not include Dido. I don't own this exact version but but I do own the two version of Faust by the same editor Bevington, whose scholarship on this subject is amazing.If this edition included both Faust texts, I would have given it five stars.Scholars say that Marlowe influenced Shakespeare. Certainly from my own readership of both Marlowe and Shakespeare there is a conscious intention of the writer of Shakespeare to link those plays to Marlowe. For example, a recent book I read lists over 100 parallel sayings between Hamlet and various Marlowe works.Today reading the Arden edition of Hamlet, the scene in Act 2 where Hamlet asks the visiting player to give a speech, he quotes 70 lines from a scene in Dido. Faustus is a scholar from Wittenberg. Hamlet, the Danish prince discusses returning to University in Wittenberg. Perhaps he would stay T Dr Faust's house.Although, some attempt to pigeonhole Marlowe, as only a great tragedian, or say that he is bombastic based on Tamburlaine, sometimes he leverages tragedy to the point of absurdity, and Edward the 2nd, for example is a remarkably sensitive play, and the opening scene of Dido is quite humorous, and Jew of Malta, is best understood as a machiavellian tragedy with farcical elements. Even with Faustus, Mephistopheles is not an obvious villain, but a reluctant fallen angel.\\"Bid On Kai me on farewell Faust 1.1.12;\\" means Bid being and nonbeing farewell.Marlowe is an absolutely outstanding playwright and poet. His use of blank (unrhymed) verse was imitated by everyone including Shakespeare.If you're like me, when you read Marlowe, you never know when you're going to be hit by an amazing line. I find inspiration in his work every day.I think you will love it and I hope this was helpful."},{"Title":"Complete plays","review":"I just had a brief comment. I don't consider myself an expert on Elizabethan era literature, but I've read a fair amount of Shakespeare and a number of the other authors of the period, and I have to say I was quite impressed with Marlowe. He certainly deserves to be better appreciated than he is. One of the lines from Edward II has stuck with me. I think I have it more or less correct, which was: \\"...and as for the multitude, they are like sparks--caught up in the embers of their poverty.\\" You have to like an author who can write like that, but unfortunately he's been so overshadowed by the great Will that he doesn't get as much attention as he should. Anyway, by way of doing what I can, however, modest, to increase Marlowe's popularity, I'd like to say he's a damn good playwright, and that I have no qualms about throwing my own not inconsiderable bulk behind his reputation."},{"Title":"Complete plays","review":"Silly to ask if one likes classics, en even more elizabethan books, your tests should be more to the point.

But Marlowe in many ways is loads more fun than Shakespeare, although the darkness of his vision is ultimately tiresome.If you like fustian, if you like the sound of the rant, Marlowe is your boy:&quot;Was this the face that launch'd a thousand ships /And burnt the topless towers of Ilium?&quot;&quot;We'll lead you to the stately tent of war/To hear the Scythian Tamburlaine/Threatening the world with high astounding terms&quot;Marlowe is probably deliberately caricatured in Shakespeare's Henry V as Ancient Pistol, the &quot;braggart soldier&quot;:&quot;A foutra for the world, and worldlings base/I speak of Africa and golden joys.&quot;Marlowe's development was tragically cut short, possibly by political scheming, or possibly by what we'd now call alcoholism. Even less than Wolfang Aamadeus Mozart (who popped off the astonishing Magic Flute opera after a series of works of a genius that did not break outside the frame of the *galante* musical style) had the chance to be Beethoven, Marlowe never had a real chance to grow into the artist that Shakespeare became. We just don't know, after hundreds of years, whether this was the Earl of Essex's fault or that of the good old booze.To see the opposing forces between the spirit of Shakespeare and that of Marlowe, it is necessary to read the long series of three early plays of Shakespeare, Henry VI, parts 1 to 3 (these have new titles in the new Oxford Shakespeare.)Shakespeare and Marlowe collaborated in these plays and it seems to me (as a nonspecialist) that Shakespeare's influenced waxes in the higher numbered plays of the Henry VI series...despite the fact that Wells and Taylor, the editors of the New Oxford Shakespeare, cast doubts on a simple-minded chronological sequence of authorship.As a general reader I can well imagine Marlowe and Shakespeare BOTH coming up with &quot;hung be the heavens with black&quot;, the first speech in Henry VI part one, working in a tavern. And my theory is that the profound ambiguity of the character of King Henry VI, who in a superficial reading is a mad weakling but on a deeper reading (in particular, that of Harold Goddard in 1954) is an almost Taoist king who sees the folly of the Wars of the Roses, can be traced to a collision between Marlowe's pessimistic proto-Nietzchean view of the world, and Shakespeare's kinder and gentler humanism.I prefer Shakespeare's kinder and gentler humanism because it is ultimately, like the Tao, stronger than pessimism. And a reading of Marlowe is relevant to today's issue of gay rights, for it shows that homoeroticism is not a matter of fauns prancing about in Arcady, innocent of the wickedness of the world of the breeders. It shows that homoeroticism has a deeply violent strain.For example, Marlowe's play Edward II (about a mediaeval English king who was deposed because of his &quot;favorites&quot;, possibly mediaeval code for &quot;it won't do to have a homosexual king&quot;) makes no hero of Edward II. Edward II is just as much a tyrant as his father was and his son Edward III &quot;Longshanks&quot; became, and this is made plain in the play's treatment of his relationship with Isabella. The entire play, one of the worst in Marlowe's short corpus, is one in which a bunch of nasty people hasten to their doom without benefit of character development.Read Marlowe, therefore, as a more modern man than Shakespeare. There are few enough Will Shakespeares on the streets of modern cities: those that are, are snapped up quickly by the more discriminating sorts of ladies. But the streets and taverns are crowded, today, with the spiritual descendents of Kit Marlowe, Edward II and Faust: young men in despair as a consequence of living in a closed world rather than the green and open world of Shakespeare (a world where forgiveness is possible.)One spirit of the Renaissance was power over nature, but a darker spirit was power over men by men (this was identified by C. S. Lewis.) As a direct consequence, many educated and sophisticated young fellows today live in a world foreclosed of laughter and surprise...a world that their sisters can access, with the result that over the past 20 years, men's overall situation has been in decline.By not being able to grow past a certain point as does Lear and the always astonishing Hamlet, in Marlowe's own words, &quot;cut is the branch that might have grown full straight.&quot; Read superficially, Dr Faustus is a simple morality tale: don't sell yer silly soul to the devil. This misses the self-reflexive character of the end in which the character realizes his own inability to grow beyond a certain point. Self-knowledge is not enough.And note, that contrary to today's excitements about &quot;identity politics&quot;, the same sort of personality can be found in gay bars and breeder bars. &quot;Identity politics&quot; has managed to obscure in the public mind the fact that quite apart from whether one is gay or straight, the old questions remain. It is of course evil to judge gay people like Dr Laura, and the most pernicious aspect of Dr Laura is the fact that if you're fool enough to believe her, being gay means you're damned, and you might as well party on. Marlowe does reveal the inescapability of the question and implies the existence of the green world simply by painting himself into a corner."},{"Title":"At Ease: Navy Men of World War II","review":"The world WAS different then.

Now seven years after Mr. Bachner's initial discovery, we have this stunning collection of over 150 beautifully composed, exposed and printed photographs by no less than the publisher of fine art books, Harry N. Abrams, Inc.Although there are a few photos of sailors working, for the most part these men are truly \\"at ease\\" as they sun themselves, exercise, swim, read, play games, write letters, horse around or just relax. Had Walt Whitman been alive during this era, he would have written paens to these men and their \\"love of comrades.\\" There is a wonderful innocence about these photographs of men among friends. And we can all be glad that because of the order of President Truman a little later, that no photographer would ever again shoot black sailors in segregated sleeping quarters. (There are a few photographs here of black sailors relaxing together and only one shot of a black sailor and white sailor together.)Surely this book will be on everyone's short list of best photography books of 2004. It's destined to become a classic."},{"Title":"At Ease: Navy Men of World War II","review":"As an historical reenactor, and daughter of a WWII Navy veteran, I am constantly on the outlook for books and information on the lesser known ideas and culture surrounding WWII. This book was a real eye opener! While the author is open about his sexuality and the pictures were no doubt hand picked with a certain agenda, they show a world of innocence that was unconcerned with homophobic ideas of how a man should or should not act. Being together for long periods of time in uncertain circumstances, deep friendships definitely form. Your buddy could be the one to save your life during an attack, or you might loose him in a split second from a torpedo. As a woman, I can imagine the close friendships that would form today under similar circumstances among women, and I imagine men during that time were not held back by all the macho ideas of today. A beautiful book with striking photography, this stands as an important contribution to understanding our father's and grandfather's lives during WWII."},{"Title":"At Ease: Navy Men of World War II","review":"I loved spending time with this book, not just because it was terrific eye candy, but because it unearthed a vision of life during World War II that hasn't really been seen in this kind of photographic detail. Evan Bachner did a terrific job compiling this book and his six years of work on it was well spent."},{"Title":"At Ease: Navy Men of World War II","review":"The photos in this wonderful book are vastly different from those that we normally see from the WW2 era. But that's exactly what is so compelling about them. All at once they're touching, erotic, and sexy. A must-have book for any photography collector."},{"Title":"At Ease: Navy Men of World War II","review":"It's great to see so many men lying around, playing together, touching each other without guilt, and in general being best friends. The photos are high quality with great composition. I wish there were more opportunities for men to be so At Ease with each other."},{"Title":"At Ease: Navy Men of World War II","review":"This is an excellent book and well worth the money. Each photo is a look back to a simpler time. I was a Photographer when I served in the Navy. The military has changed so much since these photos were taken. They would not pass muster in the military today. There is far too much of an atmosphere of political correctness."},{"Title":"Epidemics and Pandemics: Their Impacts on Human History","review":"College-level collections strong in health references will find a powerful, lasting volume in EPIDEMICS AND PANDEMICS: THEIR IMPACTS ON HUMAN HISTORY: it takes an era-by-era historical approach to plagues from 430B.C.E. to modern times, covering events around the world from Japan and Medieval Europe to Iceland and the U.S., adds chapters on contemporary concerns, and reviews events, medical responses, unresolved historical issues, and further references for more research. Add black and white vintage illustrations and you have a powerful yet easily accessed health history reference."},{"Title":"Epidemics and Pandemics: Their Impacts on Human History","review":"This survey of every epidemic and pandemic known to mankind since the dawn of written records is an epic unto itself. Starting with the Athens epidemic in 430 BC, the author takes us on a step-by-step voyage through everything from the endemic malaria of ancient Rome to modern \\"mad cow\\" disease. The chapters are divided into seven subsections: When and Where (basic facts), Significance, Background, How it Was Understood at the Time, Responses, Unresolved Historical Issues, and Suggestions for Additional Reading. Given how exciting mass exterminations of human beings are, this book should have made for some great reading.Unfortunately, the author of this book bit off more than he could chew. Each brief chapter is a whirlwind tour of a disease shoved into a historical description that is too general to be enlightening. Moreover, because Hays is a historian rather than a medical researcher, the truly fascinating details of the diseases themselves are lacking. To make matters worse, Hays writes in a high school textbook style that is completely devoid of meaningful interpretation, theoretical framework, or even a sense of genuine interest. As a consequence, Epidemics and Pandemics literally put me to sleep. (And I thought nobody could make the Black Death seem dull.)Most good books written about epidemics are written by epidemiologists, but, believe it or not, some of the best books on this topic are fiction. The Doomsday Book, by Connie Willis, is science fiction, but it is the best description of the Black Death I have ever read. If you want to really understand the impact of an epidemic, read historical fiction."},{"Title":"The Oxford Book of Nature Writing","review":"While the samples included in the book are excellent and represent the best of nature writing, the format of the book is less than stellar. The essays are presented in large chapters one after another with no introduction and no context. The title and author of the essay is only given at the END of the essay, which is needless to say rather annoying. In addition to this, unlike other oxford books of .... this volume does not give background information about authors, their times, why they wrote, etc.... which I find to be one of the most valuable aspect of an anthology.In short, it is good, but not great. I wouldn't recommend it unless you don't care about context and only want random nature writings."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"Flannery O'Connor is one of great American writers of the 20th century, a Southern Gothic stylist of the first order. She won the National Book Award for this posthumous 1972 collection, 'The Complete Stories'.O'Connor sets her stories in the rural South and populates them with flawed, grotesque, and twisted characters - this is not the imagined noble, glorious, and chivalric South, but rather the real South of the poor and middling whites of the 1950's(race is mostly in the background). She catches the nuances of human behavior. Her stories have powerful, unexpected and disturbing endings.Pick up a story and read just one paragraph and you will be hooked.\\"Asbury's train stopped so that he would get off exactly where his mother was standing waiting to meet him. Her thin spectacled face below him was bright with a wide smile that disappeared as she caught sight of him bracing himself behind the conductor. The smile vanished so suddenly, the shocked look that replaced it was so complete, that he realized for the first time that he must look as ill as he was...\\"Absolutely the highest recommendation."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"If you love O'Connor, you should own this, and if you have never read O'Connor, buy this book and begin ASAP! O'Connor's stories expose the complexities and frailties of being human, and you'll be struck by their profundity, a profundity that I find sorely missing in modern short stories (I've been reading the fiction issue of &quot;The New Yorker&quot;). But perhaps what I love most about O'Connor is her sense of humor. One of her most anthologized stories, &quot;A Good Man is Hard to Find,&quot; is as funny as it is dark (I'm thinking of the scene when &quot;a horrible thought&quot; occurs to the grandmother in the car). O'Connor is simply one of the best short story writers of the 20th century."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"A dear friend suggested a few Flan stories to me, and I guess I got hooked. With this volume consumed, I can now say I have read all of the published short stories of this fantastic writer.O' Connor's work is fantastic in the way my dictionary describes the word. &quot;Conceived by unrestrained fancy.&quot; These stories are nearly always shocking, actually very shocking. They are powerful character driven things, and rather than describe them as &quot;horror&quot; stories as I see some reviewers do, I would moreso call them &quot;grotesques.&quot;They involve characters that are not so much &quot;horrible&quot; or &quot;horrorful&quot; as much as they are simply ludicrous, or incongruously composed or disposed. Caught up in all manner of inner bigotries, hypocrisy, fanaticism of one sort or another (most often religious). O'Connor characters often turn out to be homicidal, suicidal, brutal, obsessed, the opposite of what they appear to be, and always, if nothing else... shocking!I am no connoisseur of the short story genre but all I know is that these stories without fail, intrigued me. Opened a door to further contemplation, and went a bit beyond what they said.For sheer brilliance of sentence structure, visualization, suspense, I think it would be fair to say that there are few writers that have ever written as clearly as Flannery O' Connor.When I am reading literature, characters better dang well talk good, and talk like people, not like characters. The dialogue in this collection is one of its strongest points. Impeccable down-south vernacular.As for verisimilitude, well that is another mentionable thing here. If they are anything, these stories are bizarre, and yet they retain that quality of appearing to be true. Appearing to be possible. But the last thing that they are (hear me now, if hearing nothing else), these are NOT happily-ever-after stories.Hell no.They are most often direct flights into the realm of the reprehensible and least optimistic aspects (propensities) of human nature.For those who care, my own favorite story was probably The Lame Shall Enter First.T.y.L.i.I."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"I cannot believe that I'm the first to review this, but then again, perhaps O'Connor's work is so ubiquitously acknowledged and praised that no review is actually necessary. For those who aren't familiar with her, you would do well to acquaint yourself with &quot;the greatest short-story writer since the (second world) war.&quot; Although her settings are somewhat limited (for the most part, the stories are placed in the rural American South), she manipulates atmosphere to embody a wide array of tensions and meanings. Her grossly exaggerated characterizations generally represent the grotesquerie of self-important, prideful, and perhaps most importantly to O'Connor, Godless people who seem to walk the Earth in greater numbers in the modern age. Even for readers who aren't particularly religious--as I myself am not--the stories fascinate with their merciless wisdom and impact. Subtlety is not an issue for O'Connor. Read these pieces one at a time, allowing the ensui! ng shock to settle into some sort of self-incriminating revelation. Then proceed to the next painful, cleansing lesson."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"While O'Connor definitely has a specific way of telling a story, her tales have been largely ignored. This may be due to the subject matter that fills her niche relative to the time period she was writing in. Even if you don't choose to read the entirety of her work, you should do yourself a favor and take the time to get to know this author. \\"A Good Man is Hard to Find\\" and \\"Revelations\\" are perhaps some of the best literature I have read in quite some time."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"Reading Flannery is like reading the Bible, a horror story and a literary masterpiece all at once. She might not have liked the word masterpiece bc the word sounds academic or pretentious, but there is no one like her."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"don't make the mistake of purchasing this book. I cannot believe this edition of Flannery O'Connor's works was allowed to be sold and I'm even more surprised that Amazon is selling it. It has no table of contents, no page numbers (I don't think I've ever seen a book without page numbers), no real separation of any kind between stories, and looks like a Word document that has been hurriedly typed and bound in order for someone to make a fast buck. The typographical errors distract from O'Connor's marvelous work. I've never seen a book so poorly typed. Exclamation points are used in place of upper-case \\"i\\" or lower-case \\"l\\" dozens of times and it's not unusual to find contractions typed, for example, as \\"don*t\\". The titles of the stories aren't typed with the correct capitalization...I could go on and on. The only reason I gave one star to this edition of O'Connor's work - which I'm sure would appall her - is because I couldn't give it anything lower. DO purchase Flannery O'Connor's work. DO NOT waste your money on this edition."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"When I first picked up The Complete Stories I thought it would just be another book, but after I read the first page, I knew Flannery O'Connor was a magnificent writer. My favorite book was A Tree Grows in Brooklyn by Betty Smith, but now it is the Complete Stories. It takes me back to the 1940's and I just couldn't put it down. I love writing fictional stories on my free time and Flannery O'Connor has inspired me, especially in her story \\"The Crop.\\" I recomend this book to anyone who likes a book they can call extraordinary."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"Flannery O'Connor's The Complete Stories puts the reader in possession of a superb collection of all her short stories, including those published posthumously. Each story looks at humanity in grit and detail. With a passion for the absurd, O'Connor explores the condition of the South, sparing no character's flaw and yet making the reader sympathize and care for the people she creates. Like Faulkner, O'Connor seems to feel a sadness and passion for the South and its often crazy citizens. While many read \\"Good Country People\\" or \\"The Life You Save May Be Your Own\\" in high school, there are other stories less well-known that reward attention. \\"The River\\" and \\"Revelation\\" are two personal favorites. In \\"The River\\" looks at child neglect, baptism and death simultaneously. \\"Revelation,\\" which was her last finished published work before she died ends on a hopeful note-the protagonist actually seems to have learned and changed at the end of the story- a rare thing in her work.O'Connor has been a particularly influential writer among American authors, and her theories about short stories are regularly taught in the classroom. She was a great advocate for allowing the story to be the meaning, and not candy-coating for a moral. However, her concerns are woven into the fabric of each story, and the flaws in ourselves are revealed through her characters. While O'Connor is known the best for her short stories, she also wrote two novels and some literary criticism, which are not included in this volume, but are also well worth reading."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"This collection of short stories from Flannery O'Connor is full of unique characters: staunch old women, depressed aging men, disillusioned \\"artists,\\" and young people already mired in moral ineptitude. There are no heroes or heroines here, these people seem just barely able to navigate their own life, and unable to handle any sort of major change. One underlying theme is the old South's reaction to a new social order in which former slaves and \\"white trash\\" threaten established tradition. Another theme is the manipulation of or misunderstanding of Christ's work of redemption. Instead of knowing the truth and the truth setting them free, these characters take part of the truth, skew it, then let it reak havoc in their lives.Besides being engaging reading, these stories caused me to consider my own prejudices and moral ugliness. The chronological arrangement of the stories added to the book's overall enjoyment. It was great to see her progression as an author from the characters sketched in the stories she completed for her master's degree, to the fully fleshed out humans found in the stories she wrote in the years before her death. The first and last stories, in particular, highlight this maturation. The stories are the same, essentially. They both describe the demise of an old man made to spend his dying days with his daughter in New York instead of on his own in his beloved south. The characters in the last story are instantly recognizable as the characters from the first, but it's as though we've moved from seeing pictures of these people to meeting them in person. It makes for interesting reading."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"So . . . how am I going to summarize over 30 short stories in one volume that run the gamut (what is a gamut anyway) of highly disturbing to deeply inspiring to truly annoying? Since Flannery O'Connor is in that \\"classic\\" category and I am not a literary critic, here is my advice to fellow \\"regular guy (or girl)\\" readers:You can't make it through this volume without taking breaks away from this book. I plowed through half of it and that was too much. I had to go to Colorado and drive back home to New Jersey with my family to get it out of my head. So I would suggest alternating these stories with lighter fare, or trips to Colorado if you can.The second half was easier for me . . . I think maybe because Flannery doesn't seem to kill off all of her characters in the second half . . .The single story \\"Revelation\\" was worth all of the time I spent on this book. My second favorite was . . . oops . . . Amazon won't let me print the title . . .I got this book out of my interest in Southern history and culture. What I got from it was incredibly deep, affecting, surreal yet crudely realistic portrayals of people in all of their hypocritical, self deceptive, self destructive, self righteous, vulgar, and funny ways. I didn't know people could write like this . . . or this well."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"I love Flannery O'Connor. I first came across her writing by chance and after my first reading I was enthralled by her witty observations and her ability to cut to the chase and eliminate pleasantries and polite discourse. Francis conjures up a familiar world of sidelined characters whose meek corner of the universe becomes the centrifugal force that catapults her characters into the realm of universals. At first I believed her writing to be humorous yet sardonic ; now I believe her literary genius is mysteriously mundane and it challenges my cynicism of everything I thought I knew about human nature. This book has it all - no stone has been left unturned in her moral universe of southern lifestyles , attitudes and priorities."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"I have recently read O'Connor's 2 novels and a bio, so was anxious to read her short stories. She was on a wavelength all her own and after reading her bio I am amazed at the breadth of her knowledge.These stories are freaky and deep and often have very similar messages. I am so glad to have found her although it is so many years after her death.I totally agree with reviewers who say that she was brilliant and one of literary's biggest losses."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"Flannery O'Connor is a master of prose. Whether it be her lauded short stories or her novels, her prose strike a blow like a fist. The plots are violent and engaging, the characters often grotesque---all of which make her writing frightening and uncomfortable, but none the less literary. As we know, she died at the height of her powers, but her reputation and prose live on and have engrained her in the literary world as a giant."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"Flannery O'Connor's world is dark, bizarre and grotesque, yet comically ironic all rolled into one. I remember taking a Southern writers course in college and first learning of her short stories, and then recently going back up and picking them up again. I was hooked. Unusual characters and situations are at the forefront in her stories; however, there is more to her stories than just their shock value or entertainment. With such deeply symbolic links to spirituality and messages of faith, there really is more there than appears. They have a simplistic form, but are thought-provoking, unique, and often have endings that leave a lasting impression.Similar to many writers of the past, O'Connor was misunderstood. Many take her stories to be \\"horror\\" in origin, but this would be a misinterpretation. Her stories have a Southern flavor to them, but they are of a cynical and darker mood, and seem to expose the negative side of humanity in various forms. She often takes the \\"road less travelled\\" and approaches a moral or theme in a backwards sort of way. So, it is not uncommon to encounter hypocrites, sinners, liars, cheats, and other degenerates. In other ways, her stories aren't always as linear as one would think, as they often need to be interpreted in a symbolic sense rather than at face value.This is the most complete collection of her stories, and it spans from the beginnings of her writing career and follows it all the way to the last story before she died, \\"Judgment Day.\\" Part of this collection is the basis for her first novel, Wise Blood. If you have read the novel, you will know many of the characters and chapters within these stories.There are so many stories that I loved, but probably my favorite is \\"The Life You Save May Be Your Own.\\" The story involves a drifter, Mr. Shiftlet, who comes upon a woman and her daughter. Mr. Shiftlet has sort of a salesman pitch about who he is and what the world is, but he has an ulterior motive--he wants the woman's car. The ironic point of the story is that the two main characters, while they speak about the rottenness of existence, are apparently blind to the fact that they are part of this badness. The ending--the scene with the hitchhiker and his message--is pure genius.Other notable stories: \\"A Good Man is Hard to Find\\" is a darkly comic story features a grandmother and her family meeting up with a notorious criminal running loose, the Misfit. \\"The Displaced Person\\" illustrates the negative sides to discriminating against outsiders. \\"Good Country People\\" demonstrates an ironic twist to the title, as a woman meets a man who is anything but \\"good country people.\\" \\"A Late Encounter with The Enemy\\" has an old timer, who believes he fought in an epic war, encountering fate at his granddaughter's graduation.If you are a fan of Southern writers or the Southern Gothic, this is a great place to start. A fantastic and comprehensive collection and, for the price, it is a steal."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"When you discover something special it tends to stick with you for a long time. This is what happened when I first read Flannery O'Connor. In college I was first acquainted with O'Connor and her short story \\"Good Country People\\". My professor provided a brief bio of her life from her battle with lupus to her comic drawings in her early career. The story instantly connected with me. It was grotesque, funny, tragic, and it haunted me after I read it. The ambiguity is something I at first hated, but eventually as I read more of O'Connor's work learned to grow fond of. After I read that first story I picked up this book that had all of her collected short stories. I originally read it from beginning to end, and I was in awe of how her stories grew with her artistry. Some of my favorite stories include \\"A Good Man is Hard to Find\\", 'The Displaced Person\\", \\"Good Country People\\", \\"The Turkey\\", \\"Revelation\\", and \\"The River\\". These stories work on so many different levels. You can read them for intellectual stimulation, or just as a good story before you go to bed. O''Connor has since become one of my favorite American writers and I have gone on to read everything she has written. If your a fan of grotesque stories, southern America, or just great literature then you will definitely love these stories. There is a reason O'Connor is regarded as one of the best short story writers. Crack the cover and find out, you'll be glad you did!"},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"Someone wrote, I read it in 12th grade and didn't \`get it', but was blown away. I think that was her point. Catholic existentialism, as I see it. There is a similarity to Walker Percy, although she is in a different league. When I finish a short story, I laugh- what was that about? Yet at the same time, I think I know..."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"Unfortunately, I purchased many copies of various collections of O'Connor shorts before stumbling upon this complete collection. It is true that there is value in reading a collection of stories in their original compilation format-writers often tell larger stories through a series of short stories. But once you read a O'Connor story, you'll want to read them all, so I advise purchasing this complete set.O'Connor stories are full of the most original and interesting characters and plots you'll experience in fiction. No recycled garbage here. A grandpa and six year old grandaughter fighting over identity, a son fighting with his mother over her charity to a stranger, father and son going to town. O'Connor was heavily influenced by her faith and her writing often explores themes of gaining and loosing religion. But the best O'Connor stories involve complex family relationships like \\"The View of the Woods\\". O'Connor was insightful and understood the tension created by the \\"can't live with 'em, can't live without 'em\\" mentality that often exists in family groups. Excellent reading."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"This is the most comprehensive collection of Flannery O'Connor stories that you're going to find anywhere, and you just can't beat the price.Flannery O'Connor is a literary giant. If your interests include American literature, Southern literature, women's studies, or any combination thereof, this book is a must-have for your collection."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"I'm very happy with my purchase! The book came wrapped and brand new. It seems to hold so many stories and yet it isn't extremely heavy!"},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"Thomas Merton said of O'Connor that when he thought of her, he did not think of her in terms of her peers in contemporary fiction (i.e., Hemingway, Faulkner, Steinbeck) but rather, he thought of Sophocles or Aeschylus.This compendium more than validates Merton's assessment -- after the American Empire passes, O'Connor's achievement will remain as its literary zenith. It's doubly strange, too, both for the form in which she specialized, and the content of the works. Americans (always poor judges of their own culture's worth) normally speak in terms of \\"The Great American Novel\\" --\\"The Naked and the Dead,\\" \\"Ravelstein,\\" \\"Moby Dick,\\" \\"The Great Gatsby,\\" even newcomers like \\"The Bonfire of the Vanities, \\", \\"The Corrections\\" and \\"Infinite Jest\\" are mentioned as contenders for the title. And the content of most candidates for anything \\"great\\" or \\"American\\" must always involve wealth, splendor, orgiastic sex or consumption of some kind. O'Connor's characters, for all their supposed grotesquerie, are far less exaggerated or caricatured than any others in American fiction.Furthermore, unlike the other authors mentioned above -- particularly unlike Tom Wolfe -- she was never in search of the \\"thousand-footed beast,\\" that all-consuming rig veda of a novel. And yet, in her own, simple, steady way, she outpaces the Mailers and Franzens and their febrile journalism. O'Connor is the consummate artist craftsman, who sees her art for what it truly is -- \\"reason in making\\" -- who finds reason in the created world, and informs her creations with a parallel, answering reason. Her mental eye is unwavering, like the beam of a lighthouse -- it is always pointed at truth.For that reason, O'Connor will probably never have the same popularity in this land of artifice and subterfuge that those others listed above will enjoy. History, nonetheless, will give her the laurels."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"I suppose Flannery O'Connor has her own genre, and the reader gets it aplenty in The Complete Short Stories of Flannery O'Connor (550 pages of it). Even if you do not share her version of Thomistic philosophy, or care too much for the unique American southern fixation with exaggerated characterization, there is much to enjoy here. Some stories, like the heavily anthologized A Good Man is Hard to Find, is heavy handed and obvious. It is the less known stories where the punch is packed, like Enoch and the Gorilla and The Displaced Person. O'Connor has an uncanny way of making the obvious and banal evil; she takes the Catholic fixation on the fall of humanity and its need of redemption seriously, and in this collection the state of this state is unusual, exotic, page turning."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"Flannery O'Connor is, in my humble opinion, the greatest. This book is my favorite single work that encompasses the breadth of what short story writing is all about. &quot;A Good Man is hard to Find&quot; is both chilling and laugh out loud funny. Greenleaf is a great example of irony. &quot;A View of the Woods&quot; is a much overlooked story. Flannery O'Connor viewed a world that included religious zealots without any real faith, frustrated liberals who couldn't make the world malleable into their world view, so-called intellectuals, big-mouth simpletons, and violent outcasts. She had a great ear for southern dialogue. I know, being a southerner, this is the way it really is."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"O'Connor's work is the South-- through a glass darkly. I remember in a literature class being read a letter where O'Connor wrote of some klansmen who spent the night in her hometown giving out baskets for the poor, dressed up in their white gowns riding in convertibles decorated with Christmas lights-- she then added &quot;I don't make this stuff up.&quot;Having grown up in the south and actually seen folks walking down the highway with a big wooden cross on their backs, I am always amazed by the fact that though O'Connor paints a story that is funny, she isn't laughing AT anyone, rather, she is showing more how we all can be ridiculous, especially without self-awareness. Moments of grace, of dark awareness, of sudden self-knowledge (and sometimes that's not what we think it ought to be). O'Connor is a genius of Southern Gothic, and of American writing. These short stories should be devoured, then re-read over and over again."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"Unlike some of the other reviewers, I am not a literary scholar nor have I ever studied Flannery O'Connor's works. As a high-schooler about to enter college, I have always struggled to identify the symbolism or realize the message of many literary works. Nonetheless, I was absolutely floored by this book, and it may be my favorite of all time. I did not pick up on the stories' less obvious meanings, but I found that the stories' plots are compelling enough and their language intense enough to be enjoyed on those merits alone. Although some of O'Connor's earliest short stories are sub-par (according to the Intro, O'Connor herself hated them), I loved the rest of her stories, especially \\"A Good Man is Hard to Find\\" and \\"Revelation.\\" I highly recommend this book to anybody who may be interested in it, especially if that person enjoys \\"darker\\" (i.e. realistic) stories or stories with Southern characters (although, as other people have said before, O'Connor was writing about the world, not just the South)."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"I purchased this book for an advanced English course this semester. I had never heard of Flannery O'Connor. Now that I've read a few of her stories, I can't wait to sit down and read the rest of them--they're hilarious! O'Connor had a gift for creating vivid, idiosyncratic characters. Her stories are set in the South (of the USA) and have a religious theme; she shows how the characters get \\"mugged by grace\\" (those are her words). If you've never heard of Flannery O'Connor, or if you already love her, you are in for an enjoyable read."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"The thing that really impresses me about O'Connor how she evokes the slow, tired humidness of the south without ever really giving long descriptions of settings. It's all here, religious guilt, the burden of the past, the failures of reconstruction, a cast of singular degenerates, all of it wrapped up in a creeping sense of doom and futility. I lived in a small town in North Carolina for two years, and I was surprised at how well these stories evoke the general physical sensations of being in the the south, which I think is empirically different (at least from the mid-west). At times the themes can be a bit repetitive, but the characters are usually so compelling that it doesn't bother you"},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"I hadn't read any Flannery O'Connor before I picked up this book.

Individual stories that stood out were A Good Man is Hard to Find, A Late Encounter with the Enemy, The Life You Save May Be Your Own, Good Country People, A View of the Woods and The Lame Shall Enter First. But all of the stories deserve a second and third read."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"This does contain every last one of O'Connor's short stories. The book itself is very nice for a paperback, too: smooth cover, sturdy binding, and clean-cut text. Other editions of these short stories are often printed with too much front material (prefaces, forewords, timelines), but this one lets the stories speak for themselves with only one 12-page introduction. This book is great for one's permanent collection."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"You can read Flannery over and over again and always come away with something new and never, ever get bored. Much like listening to Beethoven, Mozart, or the Beatles, O'Connor never, ever gets old or wearing. My god, what a gift she had. Other reviewers have summarized the stories, so I won't. Suffice it to say, this collection should be on all people's bookshelves that love literature."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"I love Flannery O'Connor and this is a great collection of stories, the second one I've bought as I turned the first one into a gift."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"O'Connor is amazing. I'm reading this for a class, but I can't put it down. It is a really great book!"},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"She is a fabulous writer.I have read most of the book and it is more than 700 pages long. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"...and I love it! O'Connor reminds me of a Southern Shirley Jackson. Never read her before but I am now a fan."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"O'Connor's brief career has not stopped me from returning to her work during my years as a reader and instructor. American Gothic grapples with race, gender and class, which makes Flannery O'Connor a great read."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"This is an Excellent collection of stories by one of America's great writers.Many stories can be read in less than an hour."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"It's fun to pick up this book and read the short stories. Good book to travel with. She's us a unique writer."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"It takes a while to warm up to her style. But once you do (if you do...) she's a beautiful and powerful writer.I was struggling to read the first few stories, and was about to give her up, but after a while I changed my mind completly. I've read about 15 stories (starting with her latest and going back), but now I am impatient to read all of them.A small issue may be the occasional deep Southern dialect. It's simple though - if you don't understand, just read it aloud. Another is that some sentences don't quite make sense. Then try to look at her prose as a kind of poetry - it helps.And of course the worst is that her stories are deeply disturbing. Most of her characters are extremely unlikable, and they usually meet a bitter end. You won't like it, but I'm sure she didn't either, and that's exactly why she was writing about it, a stinging satire of her times and culture."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"Flannery O'Connor managed to merge the terms &#34;artist&#34; and &#34;writer&#34; in her perfecting of the short story. Not only are these some of the most inspiring and, at times, heart-wrenching pieces of writing I've ever read, but they are also the easiest to read. I find myself losing track of time when I read her stories, before and after reading: each story takes about 40 minutes to read, and a few days to process. It's just so beautiful."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"Flannery O'Connor's stories are mesmerizing. I'd read (and marveled over) plenty of her stories in anthologies over the years but never bought an entire collection until recently. This super compendium was absolutely worth it. One reviewer mentioned that it could be repetitive but come on, you can't expect total uniqueness over an entire writing career. Of course certain things reoccur and themes show up again! A great book."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"Miss O'Connor had the distinction of being (like Scarlett O'Hara) an Irish Catholic from Georgia. In her short life (she passed away from a rare cancer in her thirties) Flannery O'Connor produced an amazingly full output of novels, short stories and poetry. This collection of her major short prose is southern Gothic at its finest. From Pentecostal preachers half-drowning converts while baptizing them in the river, to old ladies paranoid about meeting murderous bank robbers on the road during a cross country vacation-and then actually meeting some-these stories are unforgettable and brilliant, and can't help but make anyone wish Flannery O'Connor were still alive, a youthful and imaginative seventy-something, today."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"A good low-cost collection of O'Connor's works, perfect bound and paper not too flimsy (could be heavier). Rather small format. Definitely worh the few dollars I paid for it online, saving the search at used book sales, etc."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"This book was tough reading for the most part--O'Connor's material can be disturbing and I often found myself feeling impatient with her repeated use of similar character types (widows who run dairies, dysfunctional thirtysomething-age daughters who are treated as children, angry artistic young men). However as I went through story after story (31 in all) I became more and more impressed with the structure of these pieces and how the development of the character and the plot are woven so seamlessly they appear to be one and the same.The story \\"A View of the Woods\\" describes a country store called Tilman's whose owner has posted a series of signs along the highway alerting drivers to the store as an upcoming destination: \\"...Tilman's was only five miles away, only four, only three, only two, only one; 'Watch out for Tilman's, Around this bend!' and finally, 'Here it is Friends, TILMAN'S!' in dazzling red letters.\\" O'Connor moves the reader through her stories in a similar fashion. The work has an energy that drives the stories. The characters are moved clearly, determinedly, to a destination that is often horrifying, but the reader isn't necessarily shocked by it. Why? Because in developing her characters O'Connor has planted signposts all along the way, much like the signs to Tilman's, that hint at how each character's flaws is leading to their destruction. In this way the stories also take on the feeling of a Greek tragedy: these characters have within them the seeds of their own doom and though they claim to resist what they don't want, their personalities draw them to their fates just the same. By making her characters' flaws the basis for action, O'Connor is able to create intriguing, engaging plot points born naturally of the people populating her stories."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"Of the 31 stories included in this short story compilation, only seven have not been included in her other three books, including five stories that were revised and included in her novels. It is easy to see why the five of the seven stories in this anthology were not included in previous books; they are indeed lesser works. But, it is worth picking up this book for one of the two previously unpublished stories: \\"The Partridge Festival.\\" A note to those who may be squeamish about this topic: There is considerably more racist material in this book than in her other works."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"Flannery O'Connor is truly one of the greatest American writers and this novel is evidence piece #1. Stand out stories include \\"Revelation\\" and \\"Good Country People.\\" These are two of my favorite short stories of all time. O'Connor is a brilliant satirical author and I highly recommend her to anyone who is a fan of Southern Gothic literature. If you like Eudora Welty or Carson McCullers, don't miss out on O'Connor."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"I almost didn't buy this product because a few reviews wrote how terrible this particular publication was, but the price was so low that I didn't care enough. This collection is perfectly fine, however. Although another review wrote that the pages were thin and the titles poorly marked, neither is true; the paper is normal, and the titles are marked clearly in both the table of contents and the beginnings of the stories. The stories are organized chronologically, but the index carefully notes the original publication for each story, so you know which story goes with which original collection (or which story was not included in one of her two published collections). This information all seems obvious as you'd expect basic quality from every book purchased online, but a few reviewers mentioned that this collection seemed self-published. I disagree; it is completely typical and not at all amateurish.O'Connor's work is extraordinary, as other reviewers have already detailed, and anyone interested in this (very inexpensive) edition should not worry about the quality of the book, whatever you've read on other reviews. It is a perfectly normal physical publication of a completely abnormal and wonderful writer."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"Flannery O'Conner is an absolutely wild and bizarre and scarry story teller. I never heard of her, until a friend gave me a copy of the book to read, and I was captivated.She has some really scary stuff in there, and she's got a great sense of social structure and society.Her timing of the book is incredible, and she knows how to build great suspence in her stories.Some might be offended the way how she descibes blacks in her book, but she gives a very realistic charming picture of Southern lives.A must read book. You will love it."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"I haven't read this entire collection of O'Connor's short stories, but I did complete \\"A Good Man is Hard to Find\\" (among others). This is one of the best stories that I've had the good fortune to read, and I look forward to pursuing Ms. O'Connor's works in full. Wonderful writing style and deep personal insight."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"I got into Flannery O'Connor when I was at the moody Goth (without the black wardrobe) age of 13. We had her for a reading assignment in school: A Good Man is Hard to Find unnerved me. I could relate to all of the Southern hypocrisy due to the heavy southern count in my family and all my time spent in \\"The Belt\\". The queen of the \\"Banality of Evil\\", Ms. O'Connor anoints characters that are at peace with their darkness to prey particularly on those whom are comfortable living a lie.Ms. O'Connor exposes those whom want to hide behind their title, money, beliefs, etc. like someone shining a flashlight on a rat hiding in a sewer corner, and exterminating it. Her works came to mean to me the grotesque creature that the masquerade turns a person into, the creature that then must ultimately expose its true self in some unsettling way. San Francisco (aka \`psycho') in the 80's and \`90's and probably now, definitely brings Flannery O'Connor to mind. A beautiful and vertical natural landscape of sea, animals, sheer cliffs. The Euphoria of hot surfer boys in wet suits, with their sunshine smiles surf boards and an extended thumb asking for a ride down the coast to Santa Cruz (reminding of The Doors' Riders on the Storm, except they're better bait as \`killers on the road'; almost making you stomp on the brakes of the beat up '71 Beetle that you borrowed from your friend. Instead, you just return the smile as you putter past. But the peace, love and hippie, innovative hardcore music, political anarchy persona that the world heard about was ultimately just another freak show, fueled by drugs and people publically debasing themselves in retaliation against the lack of acceptance they suffered in their place of origin.I think of Flannery O'Connor whenever I meet someone and they put their facade between themselves and someone else; and when someone debases themselves by putting someone else's facade of celebrity, title, money, or whatever above their own self-worth. I know the ugly truth will eventually manifest itself, and it'll become a freak show spectacle for all to see (You Tube, reality TV, plastic surgery, etc.)The antidote to becoming an O'Connor casualty is to just accept and be your honest self, with all the human blemishes that make you beautiful. Putting make-up on a pimple only makes it fester until it ruptures into an ugly mess.I think Flannery O'Connor took things too far in her characters actions; and her works, in general: but that's what makes her Flannery O' Connor. But most of the bad deeds done by characters in her book were in private. I think that we are in an overt age of Flannery O' Connor now, destructive public acts in politics, in art, in media, in the world; and things are going way too far."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"O'Connor's is not well known among the general public, but reveredby those who know her work. Tragically, she died at 39, who knowswhat she might have done with another 20 or 30 years. This bookcontains all of her work except for her one novel. At a great price,too.Earl Schmitter,Concord CA"},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"\\"Grace changes us, and change is painful.\\"O'Connor, a delicate Southern Catholic who lived a third of her life ravaged by lupus, was certainly acquainted with pain. Her stories reveal this much. Many readers and reviewers may wonder if she doesn't take a bit of artistic license with her definition of \\"grace,\\" though. Considering her religious ideologies (which aren't hard to figure out, even after reading just one of these deliciously dark little tales), her unsubtle brutality isn't so unexpected. Look God directly in the face, the Bible says, and it completely and utterly destroys you.It's safe to say that even if her characters don't always get an unobstructed view of their Creator, they all at least catch a glimpse. O'Connor is not shy about her beliefs, and in fact, her unswerving social sensibilities are part of what make her writing so delectable. Read closely, because every single detail is important and potent. And just like the Bible she adheres to so fervently, the endings to her stories are forecasted unapologetically by every word that comes before them.This in no way ruins the power of those conclusions. Read a hundred interviews with a hundred writers, and I guarantee you that many of them will mention, as inspiration, \\"A Good Man Is Hard To Find.\\" Sit down for twenty minutes with the hilarious and heart-breaking \\"River,\\" and ask yourself if your foreknowledge didn't rob the final lines of their shuddering ferocity. Visit \\"A Displaced Person,\\" meet \\"Enoch and the Gorilla,\\" stay for awhile with \\"Greenleaf,\\" and take a good long look at \\"A View of the Woods.\\" You may find yourself wondering if there is any compassion and hope in O'Connor's world, but you'll never doubt that it is full of meaning, full of necessity, and full of heavenly fire.There's a legitimate beef some may have with this collection. \\"O'Connor has written an amazing story,\\" one of my friends once said. \\"I just don't know why she chose to write it thirty-one times.\\" It's fair to say that O'Connor doesn't stray much from her predictably gruesome formula. But while her themes never change much (purification through fire, self-knowledge gained via self-destruction, and the immolations brought on by racism and doubt), her telling of them is so fine and so stark, the details themselves are what really showcase her writing's true brilliance and beauty.This collection is arranged in chronological order, and it is part of the treat to see her ideas age as she does. Her final story, the aptly titled \\"Judgement Day\\" is a revision of her first story, \\"The Geranium.\\" The differences between the two show most openly where O'Connor hides the hope and faith and love that many feel is missing from all the works between. O'Connor, like the God in which she believed, seems too ready to expose her characters to an amazing amount of pain and degredation. But if you look close enough, if you read every sentence carefully, you'll see that she makes necessary every sacrifice, every drop of blood, every harsh, scalding ray of sun. In an era now where authors tend to shock for shock's sake, O'Connor stands out as a timeless reminder that as senseless and vicious as life's stories may sometimes seem, there is still the chance that behind it all lies a deeper, knowable truth. That truth may come at some great costs, but, O'Connor seems to say, it is better to buy with your flesh something lasting and real, than to sell your soul for even a whole world of lies."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"I studied Flannery O'Connor in college and wrote a thesis on her works. Her stories were mesmerizing and riveting, and I have re-read them many times since. She was firmly rooted in the Southern grotesque, but she was able to transcend the stark terrain of the South and present remarkable studies of human foibles and the self searching for meaning and redemption.O'Connor had the uncanny gift to describe people, surroundings and life with astonishingly spare prose. Her genius was that she could reveal the mystery and manners in us all. Of particular note are \\"Revelation\\" and \\"A Good Man is Hard to Find.\\" You must read this collection, and I promise that her stories will speak to you for years to come."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"I read this collection during college, in my senior literature seminar. I find O'Connor's stories to be the best, most brutally honest, thought-provoking and attitude-altering work out there. One piece deserving of mention are the classic &quot;A Good Man is Hard to Find&quot;, the last line of which reasonates long after the reader closes the book. O'Connor craftily delivers messages about racism, elitism and other problems of the deep South in her stories, and beautifully maintains the Southern Gothic texture in each one. I can't recommend this book any more enthusiastically!"},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"I was lucky enough during one semester in college to be forced to read several works by Flannery O'Connor. After hearing her stories, I fell in love with her, so I read this collection. This is probably the most amazing collection of short stories I have ever read. O'Connor presents Southern people at their best and worst. Adding a hint of religion, O'Connor conveys the idea of salvation and how life affects those who do and do not have this. My favorite stories include: \\"A Good Man Is Hard To Find,\\" a shocking story about a criminal and an unusual family; \\"Revelation,\\" a humorous work about people who view themselves as superior to others; \\"The Life You Save May Be Your Own,\\" another hilarious and shocking piece describing how a woman decides to seduce a Christian man; and \\"Good Country People,\\" a story describing how people fulfill their wants and desires at others cost. These stories are easy to read and fairly short! Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"The first half of the 20th century. Ask yourself about the short stories. Everybody wrote them. Ask yourself abut the best: Eudora Welty, Fredric Brown, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Carson McCullers, Dorothy Parker, Ernest Hemingway. And there is one name that is simply the best, against any competitors, against any subject matter, against any sex: Flannery O'Connor. I only hope that she knows that 35 years after her death her &quot;The Complete Stories&quot; is still is a best selling compilation and one of the most recommended books I have ever seen. They try to tie her to the south. They try to label her a woman's writer. They haven't read her. Flannery O'Connor is the best 20th century short story writer. Period. AND, she also wins the prize for best final lines in her stories. Didn't know there was a prize for best final lines? I have invented it.&quot;Then she recognized the feeling again, a little roll. It was if it were not her stomach. It was if it were out nowhere in nothing, out nowhere, resting and waiting, with plenty of time.&quot;&quot;The sherrif's brain worked instantly like a calculating machine. As he scrutinized the scene, further insights were flashed to him. He was accustomed to enter upon scenes that were not as bad as he had hoped to find them, but this one met his expectations.&quot;&quot;Mr. Paradise's head appeared from time to time on the surface of the water. Finally, far downstream, the old man rose like some ancient water monster and stood empty-handed, staring with his dull eyes as far down the river as he could see.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"I cannot praise Flannery O'Connor enough. Though I have read a couple of her novels, I find her most effective in her short stories. This collection of short stories by Flannery O'Connor is one of my favorite books. She is unquestionably one of the best American authors of the twentieth century.Each story gives insight to another of humanity's secrets. O'Connor investigates the very nature of humans and paints a disturbing picture. Her stories look at what makes us tick, what haunts us, and how we give meaning to our lives. Each account gives another glimpse into O'Connor's mind. Some stories, particularly &quot;A Good Man is Hard to Find&quot; make me shiver to even think about.A highly recommended book that contains memorable stories and a beautiful writing style."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"Fans of O. Henry and other short story writers would do well to read the collected stories of Flannery O'Connor. Though the stories are as rural as O. Henry's are urban, the sense of irony and tragedy remains the same, as does the sense of comedy. O'Connor was, beyond a shadow of a doubt, a superbly gifted technical writer.However, what takes O'Connor beyond the works of O. Henry is the theology behind so many of her stories. Raised in the deep South with several religious influences throughout her years, O'Connor struggled relentlessly with questions of faith, mercy, grace, forgiveness, and justification, especially in connection to social and racial prejudice. Readers will be hammered time and time again with O'Connor's understanding of what it means to be a sinner and what it means to stand under grace, and it is not for the faint of heart.Among the many stories worth mentioning are &quot;A Good Man Is Hard To Find&quot;, &quot;The River&quot;, &quot;The Artificial Nigger&quot;, and &quot;Revelation.&quot; These four stories by themselves would be worth the price of this collection - the rest simply add to the value. Any collection of 20th century fiction is incomplete without something from O'Connor, whose life was tragically cut short just as her work began to be truly appreciated."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"Thirty-one stories and 550 pages rest within this collection. Each story has its own merit, but I would like to take a moment to describe the ones that have best remained powerfully glued to my mind.Revelation - This tale deals with a smug, pious church-goer (of which many of O'Connor's find similarity). The woman is happy she is not black or white-trash, and thinks herself a candidate for the front of heaven's lines. Of course, O'Connor has a tasty ending for her in the story's last pages.The Lame Shall Enter First - A story about loving when it's too late. The last words of this tale still haunt me.The River - A young boy wishes to find the kingdom of God but finds tragedy instead. I think O'Connor was attacking how some things are best not taught to children because they will not be able to comprehend them.The Peeler - A pre-teen searches for cleansing after his first experience with lust.Wildcat - an old black man's greatest fear ominously grows closer and closer to him with each new night.The Enduring Chill - the Holy Ghost, depicted as a purifying terror, descends madly upon a reluctant intellect as he waits for death.A View of the Woods - an old man is not above the things he hates as he turns on the one thing in the world he swears to protect: his ten year-old granddaughter.A Late Encounter With the Enemy - a Civil War veteran finds that his moment in the sun is actual nothing more than his first day among the devils.Good Country People - considered a classic by most, this tale deals with the ironies of a devious mind and those who fail to recognize it.The Comforts of Home - a female nymphomaniac is taken off the street by a kind-hearted old woman. The old woman's son, however, refuses to accept the new house guest and sets a plan in motion that will destroy everything he holds dear.O'Connor's stories are often filled with fringe-lunatics in the raw pursuit of grace as they battle pious church-mice, the racism of the day, and their own feeble place in the world. She exposes the harsh prejudice of those who claim an outward perfection, and often times the righteous and smug are given over to the very things they claim to be above. O'Connor takes on a literary trip that features corruptive minds, freakish hermaphrodites, hopeless nymphomaniacs lurching for any form of grace, and wild-eyed country folk who doubt both faith as well as admire it from afar.She spares us nothing and when it's all said and done, what we have witnessed are the rawest forms of grace being sprinkled on those who most would never imagine worthy, while those who seem to have it all together are thrust into their own personal hells. If you are interested in grace for the rugged, vexed, slob and slut, her tales are for you. Enter with an open mind and you will unearth something more intriguing than you can imagine."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"Do yourself a favor, treat yourself. If you've never read The Complete Stories of Flannery O'Connor, read it now. If you have, read it again this summer. Winner of the 1971 National Book Award, these are mighty strange stories of broken people in a fallen world: hermaphrodites who proclaim themselves visible, inscrutable sign of God; physically maimed men and women, tormented by spirits and passions they can't fathom; landowners, poor whites and blacks colluding in nameless, unspeakable guilt.O'Connor's work, at its best, made manifest and palpable abstractions such as sin and redemption. Her work shouts of a world of spirit that is larger than all our categories and schema, encountered in experience but never contained or mastered. Only through difficult and painful revelation can the Kingdom be realized. Writing about the South in the middle of the twentieth century, her work is suffused with the divisions and nuances of race and class. She was a master of the short story form, as well. You get the solid setup, the telling character detail, the punch at the end of the story. Especially good are \\"Parker's Back,\\" \\"The Displaced Person,\\" \\"The Life You Save May Be Your Own,\\" \\"A Temple of the Holy Ghost,\\" \\"Good Country People,\\" \\"The Comforts of Home,\\" \\"The Lame Shall Enter First,\\" and the classic \\"A Good Man is Hard to Find.\\" This is a wonderful anthology of work from a powerful writer. Again, do yourself a favor."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"Many white writers have tried (and continue) to capture the black experience, the oppression of the blacks in the South, but none come close to Flannery O'Connor. I did not have any idea about Flannery O'Connor's race when I started reading her some years ago and after a few books, I still did not know. Her writing is not subjected to any race or country of origin. It is on such a subconscious human level - just change the names and physical descriptions of the characters and you have a story that will take you inside the minds and bodies of the oppressed and the elite from every/any culture and before you know it, you will see yourself in a different light. Shakti Gawain and Deepak Chopra try to teach lessons that Flannery O'Connor presents to us - take from her books what you can, read them again and take more. Maupassant's short stories were unsurpassable, atleast I never thought anyone could come close to making strong statements in such few words, but I had yet to introduce myself to Flannery O'Connor. If you haven't read 'Everything that rises must converge' and 'A good man is hard to find' you are missing out on self growth and the tie that binds you to other humans."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"Todd Sentell is a Georgia native and author of the social satire, Toonamint of ChampionsDear Flannery,Forty-three years after you died too young, a Georgia historical marker was stuck in the ground across the highway from the end of Andalusia's driveway. On a boiling hot Friday morning in July, in the shadow of the Badcock & More furniture store sign, just before the dedication ceremony started, a suntanned fellow in a red pick-up truck drove past and honked his horn. For an instant, I thought Parker was back.The mayor of Milledgeville spoke about you in his Milledgeville accent. And then, a priest with an Irish name in a huge white robe from your old church, Sacred Heart, got up in front of everybody and moved his hands around and read some things from out of that book that's not exactly the Bible. He said some things that a few of your fellow Catholics repeated with him and then the priest flicked the historical marker, while it was still covered with an official Georgia historical marker blue cover, with holy water. He flicked his wood water wand six times. I counted. The first time he flicked it at the cover you could see the cover quiver but it never did again. If there was a moment you would have loved the most, other than that redneck in the pick up truck blasting the earnestness out of the hot air, it was that holy water business. I'm not Catholic, but these were some moments I deeply understood anyway, especially since we were across the street from where you made literary history because of those hard, perpendicular intersections you designed in your stories and two novels ... the perfectly timed crashing together of personalities and religion in all its strange forms ... and its haunting aftermath. We were having some near crashing together of religion and personalities right there ... right by a loud highway in a modern time as we quietly stood in the grass that belonged to your marker and a discount furniture store.After that priest blessed your marker, the fellow who's in charge of the Georgia Historical Society got up there and said he was pretty sure that was the first time in the history of Georgia historical marker dedication ceremonies that one's been flicked with holy water. Everybody laughed and nodded at each other. God ... did I think of you right then. I'm sure I wasn't the only one who got the literary and personal importance ... to you ... of that moment. I saw you smiling down at this one, too: after everyone stopped laughing I wanted to shout out, like Hazel Motes would at discovering a blasphemer ... that the feller who's in charge of the Georgia Historical Society is wearin' a tie covered with the logo ... of the state of South Caroliner!After the roadside ceremony, we were invited to come across Highway 441--very carefully--for a reception in the main house. Your house and yard were populated with people speaking in only Southern accents and they were talking about how they knew you and when. Or how and when they knew your mother. On your front porch an old woman grabbed my arm and asked me if I was in church Sunday ... that she saw me. I said I wasn't ... I live one hundred miles from here ... but if my evil twin was there then good for him. The lady, tottering on feeble pegs, told me her name but I didn't get it because she spoke in an accent so rich her words came out like syrup. She said she had moved onto the farm when she was fifteen and that you and her were opposites. She said she lived in that building over there. She pointed at it with a crooked finger ... at the old shed where Andalusia's caretakers keep an old donkey named Flossie. I wondered if she was drunk. Who cares. We were all drunk on you. Standing in your bedroom doorway gawking at your crutches, your bed, and your writing table. I'm sure you think that's repulsive--a bunch of people crowded at your door like that. But I'm a respectful hick. I gawk with misty eyes but I don't point.I'm not going to go on about the condition of the house and the buildings around the property. Just to say they'll be back in better shape soon. There's a man in charge and a foundation has even been developed and the man in charge works hard to preserve you ... your place. Still.Heading back home up Highway 441 in my truck, I passed a couple of Georgia roadside markers of another kind--those homemade crucifixes people stick into the ground near where a family member was killed in a car or truck or motorcycle accident. You never know. When you see one, and you see a lot of them in the South, all you know is that death happened right there and somebody wants you to by-God know it.But it's never at that intersection you write about. You always see those crosses on some long, straight stretch of highway or country road. I think of you as I travel my long stretch of road and across fields of living fire, sometimes in a straight line and sometimes real crooked ... as your voice strikes up in my mind ... your voice climbing upward, on key, into a starry field ... and those who love you so much come to that moment of your grace on that road sooner rather than later if we're paying attention and we thank you for it ... battalions of freaks and lunatics shouting and clapping and leaping like frogs and those who have always had a little of everything and the God-given wit to use it right ... your devoted readers, wrapped in barbed wire ... we honk our truck horns in your honor and shout hallelujah.Todd Sentell is a Georgia native and author of the social satire, Toonamint of Champions"},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"This collection of short stories is one of the best around.

Although some readers may find her creations a bit odd, the genius inherent in her work is always evident."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"Flannery O'Connor is one of the best short story writers of the 20th Century. Every story in this collection is a gem and you'll want to read them again and again."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"You don't have to be Southern to enjoy these short stories , although it certainly helps to understand the peculiarities of the Southern way of thinking - which has sadly all but died out in today's homogenized society - so richly on display in this collection. And perhaps the very best thing about this book is that the stories indeed ARE so short. Perfect for those strapped for time or short on attention. Every time I pick this book up ( and I have read some of these shorts dozens of times each, especially the hilarious \\"Revelation\\" and the grotesquely fascinating \\"A Good Man Is Hard To Find\\" ) it's like going up into my Grandmother's attic and finding something new to discover. These stories are filled with laugh-out-loud moments, great one-liners and unforgetable characters. Certainly what would be called \\"Black Humour\\", but without being high-brow or pretentious. Essential American literature, and VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"Flannery O'Connor is the best short story writer I have ever encountered. Some of her best stories include &quot;Everything That Rises Must Converge&quot; (which might be the best short story ever written), &quot;Revelation,&quot; &quot;A Good Man is Hard to Find,&quot; &quot;The Enduring Chill,&quot; and &quot;The Artificial Nigger.&quot; Some of the stories in this collection are not as good, of course, but they're all well worth reading. This is a book that everyone should have in their collection."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"Read these stories--all of them--at once if you can. The previous reviewer seems to have them all figured out, and maybe he or she is right in a narrow and inaccurate kind of way. The question to answer for yourself is what these stories are *also* about--and that is where much of the fun starts in reading O'Connor."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"One does not read Flannery O' Connor for feel good endings. The characters feel incredibly real, in that their innate psychology is so easy to realte to. Whether it be the old man who lives vicariously through his granddaughter and tries to shape her to be just like him to the proud intellectual who gets outmaneuvered by a crooked Bible salesman, it's disturbing in the fact that you've felt some of the same feelings as some of the despicable people that populate her short stories.The prose is incredible, and vividly shows that South in a time of rampant racism as well as transition to a more technological age. If there was one complaint, it would probably be that almost all of her stories have a tragic ending, and becomes a little predictable after a while. I consider myself pretty jaded, but a lot of the time it was cynicism for cynicism's sake, even if the underlying message spoke something all too true."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"Genius! These stories remind me how much we can learn from people very different from ourselves. A Southern American white woman, O'Conner offers invaluable gems on American culture, racism and classism. When I read newer stories by our best young writers (people like Sherman Alexie), I am reminded of her. She writes the truth. It is often funny, sad and ugly at the same time-but it is the truth, and it is beautiful to witness. She is a true master of the short story."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"Flannery O'Connor is an amazing writer. Please, buy her work and read it. But do NOT buy this book.Whoever compiled this has a love for Flannery that I can appreciate, but the book itself is horrible. It's full of typographical errors; it doesn't get the name of one her novels right half the time (it's Wise Blood, not \\"The Wise Blood\\"); it seems self-published, judging by the back cover blurb and the fact it's published through CreateSpace. I'm not sure it's even legal. I would be shocked to find out it is.I never bother writing negative reviews, but I found this book highly distressful."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"I personally like her novel Wise Blood better than the stories, and would suggest that the casual reader check out 3 by Flannery O'Connor which contains the novel and several short stories. It is a bit cheaper and will let you know what you're getting yourself into. But by all means purchase this book also, which contains my favorite story, &quot;Good Country People.&quot;Perhaps she did recycle her material, but so did Faulkner, Hemingway, Fitzgerald, and Joyce. I guess they're all just anthologized because they're dead too."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"The other is Neil Gaiman's Fragile Things. I know this may seem odd to have O'Connor, the genius of revealing the inner workings of the human, beside Gaiman, but if you read Gaiman the connections are there. I'm all about getting readers from different disciplines and genres to connect with other fields. O'Connor's work, as most know, is as perceptive as it gets. Reading her work is a pure revelation, an ongoing epihpany as to what makes humans human (especially the southern religious human). Read, re-read and enjoy."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"Unless I am missing something, this cover is very unlike anything Flannery O'Connor writes about - this cover does not fit her style. I love the stories though . . ."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"I can't tell you how many times I have read reviews of books that referred to A Good Man is Hard to Find, so when I read that Flanner O'Connor's short stories are considered at the top of critics' lists of the best of American writing I began looking for a collection. So far I have not been disappointed in the collection but I haven't finished it."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"Flannery O'Connor is a fantastic writer but her short stories can be hard to understand if you don't know certain details about her life and philosphy. To this end, the introduction presents a biography that helps us to understand this intense woman, yet gives us no clues to help us decipher her complexe artistic sense. We are left to discover her as we can."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"I've read Everything that Rises Must Converge and A Good Man is Hard to Find. Both were excellent, but I thought those were her only two story collections. Is there anything else in this book besides those collections. Could someone e-mail me the answer. Thanks"},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"Flannery O'Connor is as great an American writer who ever lived. Read these stories."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"It is important to know that Flannery was a faithful Catholic and also a conservative. She was widely read and thought deeply about her faith. Some important influences include Weaver(Ideas have Consequences ) and Jacque Maritain. Her stories spring from her faith and from the reality of being a catholic living in a bible thumping red necked south. Read Habit of Being. She is truly one of the greatest Catholic writers this country has ever produced. Margaret Schmidt"},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"This has got to be one of the funniest things I have ever read in my life! Iqhope, did you not know that Virginia is a Southern state?"},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"I read this book on and off for more than a month. It is well written and Ms. O'Conner is a talented writer. But is this book a classic? I say no. Some of the stories I felt were to short, others to long, and some made absolutely no sense. some ended without any real ending, leaving me dissatisfied and in some cases, frustrated. Her writing kind of reminds me of Stephen King's short stories with all the details but, without the creepyness. Her stories seem to border on horror? without ever actually getting there.In fact her book is kind of creepy in other aspects.She has this strange fascination with relationships between small children and old people. The one I think of off hand is, the one were the grandfather takes his granddaughter off into the woods to spank her, and she ends up killing him. Maybe it is that the stories were written so long ago, but there is a strange, almost sexual vibe to some of these stories, that maybe no one in the 1950's would sense, but I found somewhat disturbing. Also, any one who is upset by the use of the 'N' word, beware. Ms. O'Conner uses it repeatedly in almost every single story in this book.Maybe I am being to tough on this book, but I just don't feel it deserves 'classic' status. I was left disappointed to often."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"At the risk of violating the First Commandment, I bow down before the art of this woman, an art which has launched a veritable industry of English grad-student theme papers. O'Connor was a practicing Catholic in a stretch of the Bible Belt where there were few of her faith. No less a commentator than Thomas Merton compared her to Dostoyevsky. The comparison is just: both authors were unapologetic Christians who used shock, sensation, and violence to get their message across. O'Connor's stories are grotesquely Southern Gothic, but with a subtle, non-proselytizing theological bent. I first read \\"A Good Man is Hard to Find\\" in the 12th grade, and in spite of the fact that I didn't \\"get it,\\" it blew me away. The way the humor segues into absolute horror is remarkable, especially when you consider this story was written in the 50s, well before mass murders and serial killers became fodder for the mass media. \\"Good Country People\\" is a satire of sex, religion, and nihilism in which an armchair anarchist is victimized by a good ol' boy pervert who is a manifestation of what anarchism really means. (The situation is similar to that between Ivan Karamazov and his half-brother Smerdyakov). \\"Everything That Rises Must Converge\\" features the conflict between a faded Southern belle right out of Tennessee Williams and her guilt-ridden, resentful adult son. \\"Parker's Back,\\" a nice pun for a title, is about a fellow who adorns his back with the tattoo of a religious icon. \\"The Displaced Person,\\" a tale of post-WWII refugees in rural Georgia, is the only story of O'Connor's in which some of the characters are Catholic, but as immigrants they are total outsiders in the world she depicts. These are all sophisticated stories that can be read over and over again. Many of them are violent, some irrationally so. Many of them depict vile and despicable characters. Many of them have a mad streak of black humor. Only one or two of them misfire and come across as preachy, didactic, or over-the-top satirical. O'Connor writes about the redemptive workings of grace in the lives of the most wretched of us - in other words, in the lives of all of us. Read this book from cover to cover; it will have the same effect on you as reading a profound novel."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"This book contains everything an aspiring writer needs to know. Forget books ABOUT fiction writing. Buy this book; read it; then read it again; then write. There is no better road to the world of fiction than the one which winds through O'Connor country."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"Unless one has had the privilege of reading Flannery O'Connor, then one might be considered illiterate when it comes to great American literature. She is one of the best, if not the best, writers of short stories ever, not only because of her mastery of language, mood, description, and character, but because her stories provoke the reader to think about life's deepest and most vital and complex issues in a fresh way.O'Connor ushers the reader into places the reader sometimes fears to tread, and often carries with her a sense of spiritual awareness that is both troubling and comforting. Yet, always lurking behind the weightiness of subject matter is her sly sense of humor, which can provoke laughter at the oddest and most unexpected moments.With O'Connor, you journey down red dirt roads under mossy oaks past tilting old homes rotting in their decaying glory...a landscape filled with colorful and oddball characters being navigated by seekers and dreamers and schemers and thinkers and fools and frightened lonely souls.It's all about the South and all about American gothic and all about post-depression blues. It's about a young nation coming out of adolescence and into adulthood. It's about bitter old folk still fighting the Civil War in their heads and hopeful young folk looking ahead to a sunnier future.Writing a review on O'Connor is intimidating. One reaches for the quiet majesty of language that she so easily mastered. I give up...just do yourself a favor and pick up this wonderful collection of her stories."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"Alice Walker said it best in her brief essay &quot;South without Myths,&quot; O'Connor's characters have &quot;nothing of the scent of magnolia about them (the tree wasn't probably even planted).&quot; When I began to read her stories, I was terrified because I found yet ANOTHER relative in each one! (I found myself in the son in &quot;Everything that rises must converge.&quot;) No one--NOT EVEN FAULKNER (God help me!)--hits me where I live so consistently! For ANYONE who seeks a narrative starting point from which to attempt to understand that weird mess called &quot;the South&quot; can do no better than to read O'Connor."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"I enjoyed every one of the stories in this volume -- and together, they create a nearly perfect whole -- but my favorite had to be \\"A Late Encounter with the Enemy.\\" The story, to my mind, captured everything I think about when I ponder the \\"Old\\" and \\"New\\" South. O'Connor writes the story at a dizzying pace and yet gets to the heart of real emotion. All of the works in this book are excellent and will keep a reader engaged throughout."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"This is one of my favorite short story collections. If I ever decide to sell any of my books this will be the one I keep. The Complete Stories of Flannery O'Connor is Southern Gothic at its finest. Each of these stories are grotesque and funny at the same time. Some are darker than others which keeps a good balance because those that are darker are truly disturbing (even while you are snickering at the circumstances). The characters are all quirky and bizarre and the violence is shocking. The freaks and criminals abound and many of these stories contain a great deal of horror in their outcomes. The stories that gave me chills were The Lame Shall Enter First, Circle in the Fire, Greenleaf, and A View of the Woods. Give yourself a treat as well as the creeps. Read this book and enjoy each of these creepy and unsettling stories and laugh and shudder at each and every one of them."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"A great many people are familiar with Flannery O'Connor, and she is universally regarded as one of the best American short story writers. Her novel Wise Blood was made into a cult classic film by John Huston. Reading her inspired Bruce Springsteen's best album, Nebraska. One could go on and on. I would add that she ought to be a hero of the civil rights movement (read any story to find out why). Instead she was unceremoniously kicked off the Catholic recommended reading list for the language used by some of her characters. But being forbidden might make her more attractive for some readers.The Complete Stories combines two previous collections, A Good Man is Hard to Find and the posthumously published Everything That Rises Must Converge. Nothing against the first set, but the stories in Everything are among my favorite. All her stories are about so-called fundamentalists in her home of Georgia or the deep south. The title of the volume is an ironic inversion of a phrase by Teilhard de Chardin (who meant it optimistically). There is only one story in which she plays her hand, and could thus be considered a Catholic story, \\"Parker's Back\\". As the recent book, Flannery O'Connor and the Christ-Haunted South points out, she doesn't mean to mock her characters,but to immortalize them."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"I never get tired of reading O'Connor. Vivid, wry, tragic and shocking, these stories are keenly observed revelations of human foibles and spiritual failure. O'Connor, a devout Christian, was especially good at evoking simultaneous cruelty and comedy, e.g.,when the Misfit in \\"A Good Man is Hard to Find,\\" looks at the dead body of the manipulative grandmother and says, \\"She would have been a good woman if there had been someone to shoot her every day of her life.\\" In the hands of a lesser writer, O'Connor's sort of violence might have come across as heavy-handed and contrived, rather than thought-provoking. Too bad she had to leave us so soon!"},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"This is my favorite book of short stories. I am amazed at how the author can blend such a diverse mixture of feelings into a story. Each story is humorous and heartbreaking. O'Connor has a knack for examining the thoughts in her characters' minds, and although they seem to be a little over the top, the characters are grounded in reality. I enjoy the fact that you can read this book for the pleasure of the crazy stories, or you may read it to delve into an examination of the religious themes uncovered. I would start with Flannery O'Connor by reading this book and then move on to reading Wise Blood or The Violent Bear It Away. It will be somewhat hard to understand those novels if you are not familiar with her short stories first. I think you will find this book fascinating."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"I have never before spent all that much time with O'Conner's work. I was pretty damn impressed.Her observations on race were spot on--not dated in the least. Compared perhaps to certain writers who write of an experience that is only (most often) echoed today. There seems to be a certain timelessness to O'Conner's perception. Similar in ways to Twain, and perhaps to a lesser extent, Faulkner. I wonder if her Catholicism has anything to do with it, and the fact that she was a woman--these markers giving her an insight and subtlety of understanding that Protestant white men wouldn't necessarily have.It was interesting that both O'Conner and Richard Yates do not shy away from multiple points of view in a short story. Many if not most of the Yates stories shift POV. I have always inclined toward shifting POV, but was warned (scolded) away from it in my first writing workshops. I tend to like the way O'Conner handles shifts, it is more seamless than Yates. In O'Conner's work it is almost imperceptible (I am thinking particularly of \\"The Artificial Nigger\\" and the shifts between the grandfather and the boy). Yates tends to use paragraph breaks and will give entire sections of a story to a particular character's POV. O'Conner moves from perspective to perspective through brief paragraphs, shifting within the narrative line of the story without pause.And I have a soft spot for the gothic. I appreciate O'Conner's use of the physically maimed and the mentally disabled. I like her use of religion. Some of her stories read almost as twisted parables--sort of a Biblical Twilight Zone or Old Testament Alfred Hitchcock.But for my own work, I paid especially close attention to the intimacy O'Conner creates between her characters. I am thinking at the moment of \\"Good Country People.\\" She does such a brilliant job of showing the tension, desire, misinterpretation and intimacy between Joy/Hulga and the Bible salesman. O'Conner holds Joy/Hulga's anger and ugliness and even her intellectual aggression in contrast to the unexpected vulnerability she shows the Bible salesman. It does indeed bring life and complexity to her character. And then of course when the Bible salesman reveals his motivation and his true desire, something really remarkable happens--it is as though in these moments I can see the story take a breath.\\"Good Country People\\" is such a good story--there are so many elements of craft, elements that I am working on in my own writing. O'Conner does a spectacular job not only with complexity of character, but also with complexity of circumstance. She creates a situation in which a seemingly immobile Joy/Hulga is poised on the precipice of change. The reader feels as though she really could--or might not--fall in love with the Bible salesman. There are moments of living possibility when anything (or nothing) can happen.There are many remarkable stories in this collection that demonstrate similar mastery of craft--The Barber, The Life You Save May Be Your Own, Greenleaf, Everything That Rises Must Converge, A Good Man is Hard to Find...And along with these excellent stories, there are others that do not quite shine, stories that read as slice-of-life vignettes, interesting and pleasant enough to read, but not quite living: Wildcat, The Crop, Turkey, A View of the Wood, Revelation.I would like to read O'Conner's novels. And I am sure I will reread her short stories. And should I ever have the chance, I would love the opportunity to introduce her work to students."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"Flannery O'Connor is such an amazing writer. Her stories create such a feeling in you even though they're only between 10-40 pages long. I read Everything That Rises Must Converge, and I just had to read the rest of her stories. And really, they're so amazing. There's an element of the macabre to them. You get this deep chilling certainty as you read that something bad is going to happen in the end, which it usually does. And they're kind of scary that way, but it just shows how talented O'Connor was. America lost a great writer when she died in 1964 at the age of thirty-nine from lupus. You got to give the South credit; they've turned out some great writers. Now I've got to have this volume for my own collection.I've got to give A Good Hard Look credit for motivating me to read O'Connor. I'd obviously heard of her before, but never actually read her. I guess I thought it would be boring or something. I couldn't have been more wrong. Her stories are gripping, and her words are beautiful. O'Connor is definitely now among My Top Ten (by the way, the order in the list is kind of arbitrary really. I switch the order around every few weeks or so according to my whims.) Really, I cannot stress how much I recommend her. Wonderful, wonderful writer, and wonderful, wonderful stories.All of my reviews can be read at my blog (novareviews.blogspot.com)."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"Miss O'Conner died way too soon. Her work is the embodiment of her times, so delicious in her wonderful mix of earthy and realistic characters. If you enjoy oddball, yet real ... there is no one to compare her to. She was unto herself. I recommend all of her work."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"Her stories always bring some level of discomfort, particularly when you grew up around some of the archetypes. Like a Single Malt Scotch after the blended stuff, she brings that well-refined dark humor with Southern characters she no doubt plucked out of life in rural Georgia. She is the definitive Queen of the American Short Story. The Yankees will try to minimalize her by placing that \\"Southern Gothic\\" label on her. Don't buy into it."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"O'Connor captures something essential about Southern spirituality, something which cannot be summarized, something with roots in antebellum, but which flourishes still today long after she wrote. She once wrote that the South may not be Christ-centered, but it is certainly Christ-haunted. If you wish to comprehend the Christ-haunted South, there is no better place to begin than these stories."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"Although the book isn't made in the most sturdy fashion, it does have most all of Flannery O'Connor's short stories. She's one of America's finest short story writers, by far. A great story write in general, really. However, her short stories are were she shined brightest. All fans of the southern gothic style MUST have this book in their collection. The stories are smart, captivating, imaginative and fun. The price is so low that you really can't go wrong here."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"I had not read this author and have enjoyed her short stories. I was surprised at her insight and sly humor. She has a sense of justice that cuts through the southern \\"charm.\\" She tells in many subtle ways the lesson that pride leads to a downfall. Flannery also captures the dialect and settings that define the culture of her time."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"There's a famous saw (that some attribute to the English evangelist David Watson) to the effect that, \\"The Holy Spirit is a gentleman.\\" One will not get that impression from Flannery O'Connor. Thomas Merton allegedly said she didn't belong in the same class as Faulkner and other great American writers, but that she was up there with Sophocles. I think he probably had it right. I am convinced that anyone who classifies her as merely Twentieth Century, or Southern, or American, or Catholic, or woman, does not fully appreciate her, though it no doubt helps to be (or try to understand) all of these as well as what Jesus might have thought when He heard, \\"all the people,\\" say, &quot;His blood shall be on us and on our children!&quot;"},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"Flannery O'connor's writing is a realistic nightmare of what could go wrong in trusting strangers. Her own vulnerability through her isolating illness gives her a projective voice of unexpected violence. Her writing is often shocking, with modernesque twists, brilliant imagery that puts the reader in the short story. Her love of plotting the grotesque, freakish Jeffrey Dahmer meets girl-next door, makes her work revolutionary for her time and unforgettable."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"No matter how often I read one of Ms. O'Connor's works I'm reminding that while some things in the south have changed, many others have remained the same. While written decades ago, these stories could have very well taken place in what we now call the New South. All that is needed is the token transplant from the North to add an additional dynamic.For Southern Gothic, no one can beat Flanner O'Connor and the way she weaves the human fabric into the soils of society. This collection is worth a read at least once a year."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"I afixed Joyce Carol Oates' acrid response to a NYTimes review of O'Conner's work in the front of the collection that I newly purchased. Oates upholds the idea that any artist worth his salt is indeed seen as being \\"peculiar.\\" I'm pleased to own a collection of this \\"peculiar\\" author's best work."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"Since I couldn't afford to go back to school to get my Masters, I thought it might be wise to obtain the required reading list and read myself through an alternate education. One on the list was Flannery O'Connor.After reading through this book, I had an epiphany as to why so many writers win the big prizes such as the Pulitzer for fiction--you take average or stupider than average people, throw a common sense question or decision (to be made) in the mix, and watch the characters make the wrong decision and come out at the end either wiser, still stupid, or scratching their heads not knowing what the hell hit them.In many of Flannery O'Connor's stories, this is essentially the plot. Many, if not all, of the characters are from the South, call African-American's the 'N' word without apology or hesitation, defines the era in which the story was written, and certainly perpetuates the myth folks from the South are illiterate, stupid, and don't have the common sense God gave a gnat.A critic praised her (quote) 'stories that burn bright, and strike deep.' Flannery O'Connor wrote stories where stupid people make stupid mistakes and I was pretty disappointed in the whole set of stories overall. While her story-telling abilities are a little higher than average, I don't agree that her plots or story lines are as valuable as the kudos give her from other literary critiques.If you are interesting in 'entertainment' type reading, this book is definitely not for you. If you are interested in The South as it used to be, from a native Southerner's point of view, and some interesting stories (overall) with deep literary and moral undertones that you have to re-read more than once to grasp, then this type of book will definitely appeal to your academic standards.While her stories may have been 'important' half a century ago by reflecting the sad, uneducated, and prejudiced thinking of the people of the South, I believe that the world has made broad strides in their thinking, education, and literacy and has moved beyond her stories and her way of thinking."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"I highly suggest that if you wish to enjoy this woman's stories you follow the advice of an earlier review. Read them one at a time. If you don't you'll figure out the same thing I did, it's really basically one story about a woman who screws up everything for her family over and over again with the names changed.Whether it's the dead daughter in &quot;The Artificial Nigger,&quot; the too astute grandmother in &quot;A Good Man&quot; or the embarrassingly incompetent farm women, or the despicable mothers and their even more flat and dreary college educated children, Flannery can't seem to do anything other than recycle herself and the people that annoyed her into the same drek over and over. (Yes, I realize that was a run on sentence).Just remember, the writer being dead doesn't mean their work is great."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"A group of seniors from our church were planning a visit to the author's childhood home.

Based on extensive field interviews in the US and Japan, the authors show that no company could have developed the technologies required alone. Instead, a collaborative community of practice of suppliers, manufacturers, scientists, and users had to coalesce, and did, in Japan.

This book is about Albert and his come up through Bedstuy and so forth. It also gives you an inside look at some of BK'S playground legends circa 1970's and some of their tragic downfalls.

He stays true to the sport and never strays too far from it (or its many characters). With great books, readers say they never want to see the characters potrayed in the movie because it will never live up to the image/character they've envisioned. In \\"Heaven Is A Playground\\", I never want to see Fly Williams or Albert King play ball because I'd rather keep the court wizardry, provided by Telander, permanently embedded in my brain."},{"Title":"Heaven Is a Playground","review":"One of the best books I've ever read! I spent some time in Brooklyn playing 'ball in the early 80's and must admit that this book was my guideline. Believe me, this is how inner-city basketball was in the 70's - 80's timeframe and R. Telander is to be highly commended for getting it right. I've probably read this 40 times since it came out and can still not put it down.

The first hardcover book I purchased for paperback reprint was Rick Telander's &quot;Heaven Is a Playground.&quot; I was taken by Rick's story-telling abilities, his eloquence and his love for the ghetto kids who saw basketball as their only ticket out. This was something more than a sports book. This was a book about an inner city world I knew little about, a world that Rick had experienced first hand. It was also a book I had to publish at Ace/Tempo. I am proud that I did, and I am happy to see that the book has been brought back into print after all these years. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Heaven Is a Playground","review":"I first read this book about 15 years ago and it has charredan everlasting memory as though I lived through Rick Telander.I return to Rick's uncomfortable first walk through Bed-Styin 1974 to his eventual sense of being in this place."},{"Title":"Heaven Is a Playground","review":"I've read a few really good books on basketball -- David Wolf's &quot;Foul,&quot; and John Feinstein's &quot;A Season on the Brink&quot; immediately come to mind -- but Rick Telander's &quot;Heaven Is a Playground&quot; is the best, for my money. This book captures not only the spirit of the game, but also vividly recreates a time (the mid-70s) and a place (Brooklyn).Telander was in his 20s in 1974 when he went to Brooklyn to spend a summer, in part because he was in search of the elusive playground legend James &quot;Fly&quot; Williams, who figures prominently in the book. During the course of the three months he was there, however, he met, played with, interviewed and befriended a host of regulars at the courts in Foster Park in the Flatbush section of the borough. They were African-American boys and men for whom basketball was far more than recreation. For many of them, the game was a way of life and even more importantly a form of self-expression.Besides Williams, Telander also met Albert King, then an astonishingly gifted 14-year-old, who was to go on to a successful NBA career. Telander brings to life the court skills of King and others, but he humanizes them, and this is where the great strength of the book lies. For example, King agonized over his talent, which brought him attention and adulation that embarrassed him and sometimes made him angry and withdrawn. Williams' incredible pure talent was married to an unpredictable and sometimes violent temperament that ultimately shortened his career.Despite an obvious empathy for his subjects -- he wound up coaching a group of teenage park regulars, with mixed on-the-court success -- Telander does not romanticize them. Flatbush, Bedford-Stuyvesant and Brownsville, where the action of the book primarily takes place, were poverty-stricken, crime-ridden places. Many of the people Telander spent extensive time with were scarred by their environment, and he does not try to hide that. Though the book is refreshingly free of a sense of &quot;white guilt,&quot; Telander does agonize at one point over a boy he left off his team who succumbed to drug use and was later killed.At times funny, often poignant, and filled with a love for its subject, &quot;Heaven Is a Playground&quot; remains an engrossing, and still timely, read nearly 30 years after its publication."},{"Title":"Heaven Is a Playground","review":"I read this book around '93, just after having read the \\"white version\\" in both Larry Bird's biography and autobiography. What was interesting was these two very similar yet distinct experiences and how they related to my own experience, growing up it what would seem like a very safe and socially adjusted rural town.Heaven is a Playground was a departure for me in to a world where basketball had the utmost symbolic and cultural meaning - where legends were born and died and everybody else was willing to take the gamble. Was basketball more a sacrifice of a better future (missing school) or a one shot escape from certain poverty? Telander would probably argue the latter. What I found interesting was that only a few of the characters in the story actually had the potential for professional basketball, yet all the other young men seemed (unconsciously) willing to sacrifice their own futures for those players. Not so much blinded by their dreams they were living them."},{"Title":"Heaven Is a Playground","review":"Certainly some other reviewers have me beat in the department of basketball-related literature, but I count \\"Heaven Is A Playground\\" amongst the many social science books that I have read. And indeed, it matches up quite well with the best reads of the past few decades. On the surface, the book seems to be about inner-city basketball, but within the pages, it is a complete dissection of the (one segment) inner city African-American man.The amazing book \\"Tally's Corner\\" managed the same feat in its analysis of street corner men. Both have achieved great feats with their respective works. For basketball fans like myself, \\"Heaven Is A Playground\\" not only reads as great/sad/true/mystifying social commentary, but also as plain sports entertainment. Rick Telander, as a sports writer, was really able to hit home with the writing, really giving readers a feel of the 1970s game - which has many similarities and differences to the game of today.Another great aspect of the book is that it reads as if you there. Telander makes only the necessary analysis in the pages about what went on, and basically leaves the facts as they are. The book could have easily become a textbook lesson on sociological concepts, a lofty preaching on the ills of inner city life, or a rambling 200+ page play-by-play. Fortunately, the easy going style of writing is great journalism. Telander's style fit me well.Thanks Rick for a great read."},{"Title":"Heaven Is a Playground","review":"I have read this book once a year since I first picked it up 14 years ago as a 16 year old playground junkie. It is a primer for learning the rhythms of America's premiere urban sport, basketball. It is also about Telander's love for the game. I always remember the manifesto on a sticker in Rodney Parker's Flatbush apartment - &quot;Basketball - it's a way of life&quot; One of the great thrills of my life was having the opportunity to interview Rick as an undergrad at DePaul University in Chicago for the student newspaper. He was encouraging to a young, aspiring writer to undertake such a project like this while still young if that's what I wanted to do. A couple of years later, I found myself living in Newark, NJ. While there in 1994, I went on a Saturday afternoon to Foster Park and hooped all day long. I remember being so happy going home on the subway, thinking, &quot;I did it! I played in the spot that has given me such happiness over the years.&quot; To anyone who wants to visit Foster Park to go play, I say do it! You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Heaven Is a Playground","review":"With this book Rick Telander has captured the sociology of inner-city basketball. These kids do not see basketball as merely a sport but as a means to an end. It is a ticket to a better way of life that can become an obsession for some (such as Clavin Franks). In this book Telander points out all that is good about basketball and some of the bad. This book should be read by all basketball fans, especially those who dream of playing in the NBA. If you liked this book you should also check out the movie &quot;Soul in the Hole.&quot; It is a movie about Brooklyn playground legend Edward &quot;Booger&quot; Smith."},{"Title":"Heaven Is a Playground","review":"This is the best book on basketball I've ever read. First read it when I was a kid in the late '70's, and it still rings as true today. Just about the best sportswriting ever."},{"Title":"Heaven Is a Playground","review":"Rick Telander is visiting Brooklyn to write a magazine article and locate all star legend Fly Williams. He plans to stay in Brooklyn for a few days, but ends up staying a whole summer. Brooklyn is a hard core place to play basketball, expecially street ball in the poverty stricken, crime filled parks of Brooklyn. Seventy percent of the boys are African American and are there because basketball is their life and that's what they're depending on to get them somewhere in life. Telander lets the kids speak for themselves in this book. It's full of real life situations and tends to be a little vulgar.I love basketball so that's one reason this book was appealing to me, but it also grabbed my attention with the detail. The detail in all their conversations is remarkable.A reader of this book would have to be open minded about all subjects or like basketball. This book is very intense, the players tend to get a little veral at times, but it's still a great book. I recommend this book for ages 15 and up. This is a phenomenal book, and must be read by all those lovers of basketball."},{"Title":"Heaven Is a Playground","review":"Rick Telander is an incredibly gifted writer - with Sports Illustrated (senior writer) last I knew, and one of the &quot;guys&quot; on TV on the Chicago WGN &quot;Sports Writers&quot; show. This is the show portrayed in Saturday Night Live of the guys that sit around drinking beer smoking cigars and talking about Mike Ditka and Da Bulls. Anyway, this book was Rick's big break as a writer. He captures the heart of basketball for teenage boys. The focus of course is the inner city black kids. I have two teenaged boys (white, small town Midwest USA) who have read it and saw themselves in it, too. Transcends race/region/city-vs-country boy.Captures above all what it is to be young, hopeful, and scared. Not a sports book, but a book about young men facing life who love sports."},{"Title":"Heaven Is a Playground","review":"If you are a hoops junkie of any kind, read this book. It tells all about the playground game. The players whose dreams were a reality, and those whose dreams were shattered. It tells the lifestyle of young, upstart ballplayers in the ghetto and what they needed to overcome to make it in the big time. Two main people it focuses on are Albert King and Fly Williams. It tells you the coaching point of view on a ghetto team- the Subway Stars.

On first glance, it appears to be a traditional \\"coffee table book\\", which usually functions as a passive sign within the reader's ambient of d&eacute;cor, delight and good taste. This book is anything but...Balk has subverted this conventional structure and demands that the reader takes a serious step outside. His current work/data asks us to presume a leap of faith in exploring uncharted aesthetic territory and actively engage in a multifarious visual narrative. One can scan the surface of this tome, but that would be a waste. This is not an easy exercise in image consumption; we must dig deeper. The demands will not go unrewarded.The trip that Dennis immerses us into is both hyper-rational and a spaced-out visionary quest. Attempting to make visible relationships between such disparate elements as art, science and daily life, Balk has graphically charted the behaviors, forms and transformations of his 3-d sub-atomic particle models (they are spectacular fictions) and slyly intimates that similar forms and behavior exist and/or contradict human life and the physical world. Traversing seamlessly between pictorial images of the ancient Giza plateau, scientific models of his virtual creations, daily life and popular culture on the back streets of Cairo as well as interspersed texts and snapshots of Balk's daily sci-fi reality, the reader is led to wonder whether the connections Balk describes are purely fictional or whether ancient and contemporary cultural codes are indeed intimate with the mysteries of contemporary science.Balk is a \\"big picture\\" man. A bulky question implied by his method of science fiction/cultural critique seems to be whether all of this \\"information\\" was codified by the \\"big bang\\" millions of years ago? And, are we just endlessly playing back the echoes of the cultural dawn?If Syd Mead, one of Balk's idols, has consistently provided us with mind-blowing illustrations as a \\"visual futurist\\" and P. K. Dick, another Balk anti-hero, has given us the sprawling narratives of the \\"future past\\", Dennis presents us with a much more intricate and highly nuanced picture of the stranger than sci-fi \\"future present\\"."},{"Title":"Add Red Hat Linux to Your Windows Desktop in a Weekend (With CD-ROM) (In a Weekend (Premier Press))","review":"This was surpising painless on my Windows 98 machine.

When he decides that toothpaste costs too much, he starts his own toothpaste making business with local kids. From his meager beginnings with re-used baby food jars up to a fully professional operation with stockholders and a tube-filling machine, he rakes in the cash and confounds the leaders of the pharmaceutical industry with his methods.MY TAKE:This book (purchased at a garage sale) became one of the books I re-read repeatedly throughout my youth. Besides being a great story about how a kid with imagination and ingenuity can outsmart even grownups (which I loved as a kid), it also teaches you to avoid sexism and racism without being \\"preachy\\" about it.Growing up in a very rural area (there was literally only one black family in our high school), the fact that the book's genius is black was a positive idea for me to take in. Not only that, but Rufus Mayflower refuses to treat his best friend differently because she's white...or even a girl. (She's Kate McInstrey if I recall the name right..I'm writing from work and don't have my copy immediately handy).The book also subtly teaches you a little about marketing, product costs and even \\"price wars\\". I probably learned more business ideas from this book than many classes at school.As final proof of the lasting value of the book, I submit that I am now 34 years old, with my first child just born, and I intend to introduce the book to him when he's old enough.

Of all the books I have read throughout my life, this is number one on my list!"},{"Title":"The Toothpaste Millionaire","review":"The Toothpaste Millionaire by Jean Merrill was one of the best books I ever read. After the first page I knew this was going to be a great book. I liked the character Rufus. He did not care that Kate was white and he was black. He did not like to waste anything. He was very creative, and figured out a really cool way for a kid to make a million dollars. The plot was interesting and exciting, and the ending was unpredictable. I would recommend this book to people who enjoy being creative, or who want to make a lot of money. If this book has a sequel, I am going to read it. I'm also going to check out other books by this author."},{"Title":"The Toothpaste Millionaire","review":"As I read The Toothpaste Millionaire to my children, all of were utterly dilighted in this book. Humorous and fast-moving, this book is a pleaser for all. My 8 year old thought the book was \\"really good. My favorite book ever!\\" and my eldest even listened in on the action! We were all impressed by this colorfully written story and it was a joy to read. I think everyone should read this impressive story!"},{"Title":"The Toothpaste Millionaire","review":"My daughter brought home this book, and I picked it up and read it myself. It was a very enjoyable story that integrated lessons about realistic applications of math and economics into a fictional tale. The author also worked very hard to avoid stereotyping the children and adults in the story. I would recommend it to everyone."},{"Title":"The Toothpaste Millionaire","review":"This is the best book ever , I could'nt stop reading it .I even asked the librarian if I could buy it . Wow this bookis awsome . Read it!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"The Toothpaste Millionaire","review":"I read this book when I was in 4th grade and I love it still. It is a book that shows that sterotypes are not important. It's a wonderful book for children and I read it to all my babysitting charges. It teachs friendship with no boundries."},{"Title":"The Toothpaste Millionaire","review":"I picked up the book, The Toothpaste Millionaire, and couldn't put it down. This book is pure genius. It's fast moving. But beware, it ends in suspense. I wish there was a sequel!"},{"Title":"The Toothpaste Millionaire","review":"I did not find the book as fascinating as all the foregoing reviewers (and I have read hundreds of juvenile books of this reading level), but I can imagine grade 3-6 students rating it more highly--and that is what counts. It can even be a read-aloud for the teacher of grades 3 or 4. I would place it in my classroom library, but it is not a book I could enthusiastically introduce.The suspense was mild, the climax almost predictable. Nevertheless, the author has an attractive, casual style; the vocabulary is simple; and the story flows easily. But it does have that Bank Street Reader feel, which is what it used to be--like some basal/reading text for grades 3-5.One attractive aspect of the book is that it does not ignore race or ethnicity, and integrates them in a positive, refreshing manner.The \\"Reader's Guide\\" (test questions) at the end of the book turned me off; it made me feel uncomfortable--I hope teachers won't use it. I think a children's book should be enjoyed for sheer pleasure.The Creative Teacher: Activities for Language Arts (Grades 4 through 8 and Up)"},{"Title":"The Toothpaste Millionaire","review":"This has been a banner month for books at our house. We have read so many good ones. This one might be the very best.\\"The Toothpaste Millionaire\\" is written by Jean Merrill, who also wrote the \\"Pushcart War.\\" It has a boy hero and a girl sidekick, features a lot of math, and has a plot that revolves around turning your ideas into inventions and making money. Excellent.Supportive math teacher - he is a great character.Set in Cleveland, OH. This is a keeper."},{"Title":"The Toothpaste Millionaire","review":"I read this (in hardcover) as an 11-year-old in the seemingly-forbidden halls of the local secondary school's library. This is THE book to charge a kid's minds with visions of entrepreneurship.There's an eyebrow-raising where-is-this-coming-from bomb plot diversion, which disappears as soon as it arrives. This, I think, is the book's only low point. It could easily have been cut out of the book, and nobody would have noticed.Excellent book. This book always comes to mind whenever I have to remember how many dozens are in a gross."},{"Title":"The Toothpaste Millionaire","review":"This book is one of my all-time favorite books. The friendship between Rufus and Kate is really cool, and Rufus is a very well-drawn and interesting character. The wittiness of it all is great.Rufus is a smart, friendly, thoughtful, and kind boy who is quite frequently rejecting the crazy prices of products such as makeup or...toothpaste. What starts out as a simple kitchen experiment with some baking soda and flavorings(they found out that cumin and curry are NOT exceptable toothpaste flavorings) turned into a booming business with workers, a factory, REAL toothpaste tubes (baby food jars won't work forever!) and even shares of stock and other such confusing business. Rufus' toothpaste, dubbed not Sparkle, not Shine, but \\"Toothpaste,\\" begins to outsell other fancy leading businesses and the whole thing turns into one crazy competition. And by the time Rufus is in 8th grade and a millionaire, it's time to go visit his grandmother. Does he hop on a jet plane? Does he hire a limousine? No, he packs his things in a sack, slings it over his shoulder, and hops on his bike.This hilarious, fun, engrossing book is a great read for kids (and adults!) of all ages. I'd recommend it to everyone!"},{"Title":"The Toothpaste Millionaire","review":"The Toothpaste Millionaire was written in 1972 and for some reason I missed this one growing up. The story covers some wonderful concepts on entrepreneurship, auction buying, media/commercials, stocks, getting loans from the bank, and more. It also gently talks about racism and sexism as well.Rufus (a 12 yr old black boy) and Kate (a 12 yr old white girl) who went to the same school in Cleveland, Ohio. Rufus comes up with an idea to make toothpaste for[..] and sell it for[...], with a [...] profit. After Rufus and Kate figure out all the math involved in the size of toothpaste, how many people live in the United States (because he is going to sell to them all) and a trip to the auction house, they get to the bank to secure a loan for their business. My Favorite quote:\\"The trouble with adults is they never believe kids can do things even when they have good ideas.\\"For an 89 page book, there is a lot of good information packed into this one. You won't put it down... and neither will your kids. A very inspiration storyDawn C.http://www.frugalforlife.com"},{"Title":"The Toothpaste Millionaire","review":"My child was assigned this book which i guess was the best way to sell it in 2010. With all the choices in children's fiction available, why oh why in 2010 would anyone make them read this kind of free-market propaganda? Well, it hits the mark on the 'good-for-you' category: complete with math problems and pithy expressions of 'color-blind' and masculine-feminine friendships... subtle.Not a whole lot of summer pleasure here. I kinda wish Black Beauty would gallop in with a copy of Treasure Island ...."},{"Title":"The Toothpaste Millionaire","review":"We really enjoyed this book. We read it out loud and I was repeatedly reminded that we needed to \\"read the book tonight!\\" I especially liked that Rufus sews saddlebags. I enjoy any opportunity to show that tasks can be completed by either males or females. The issue of ethnicity was also nicely addressed, something I wasn't expecting, and a pleasant surprise.However, my original interest in the book was to read something enjoyable that taught a little bit of finances. The book did this very well for the first half or maybe even three quarters of the story. After that, there was definitely a turning point where I felt the information was rushed and I could tell even my 9 year old noticed because of the types of questions he was asking.So, my recommendation is parents be prepared to discuss price competition, stock certificates and income tax requirements. One should plan on reading a little slower towards the end of the story. Despite the speedy pace of the end chapters, this is still one of the best stories I've read to spur a child's interest in entrepreneurship."},{"Title":"The Toothpaste Millionaire","review":"As others have covered the plot synopsis, I will not repeat it.I am 40 years old, and read this book as a child. I had completely forgotten about it, but all of a sudden the fond recollection of it popped into my head recently. As my own chldren are now 11, 9 and 7 years old I thought it would be worth checking out again.All of my children loved it. My 11 year old read it on his own in about two days, and then my 9 year old and I took turns reading it aloud.While all the reviewers have mentioned the positive message about race relations, another positive message to me was the idea that even children can really accomplish something besides just sitting in school all day. Most of the adventure books we read involve wizards or fairies or talking animals, and while these are tons of fun they never give kids the sense that these stories relate directly to the lives they are leading.While the idea of kids opening up a factory and driving big companies out of business is of course a bit unrealistic, the fact is that kids really can go into \\"business\\" in smaller ways. My daughter (the 7 year old) is already organizing a yard sale of her baby stuff for when the weather warms up.I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Toothpaste Millionaire","review":"I think this book is fun and sensible.

He decides to make his own toothpaste and how he gets started and becomes a millionaire."},{"Title":"The Toothpaste Millionaire","review":"it was fun and then I got a little confused at the end but I had to re read to figure out what really happened"},{"Title":"The Toothpaste Millionaire","review":"I have taught personal finance classes to kids for several years. One of my favorite books is \\"The Toothpaste Millionaire\\" by Jean Merrill. It covers so much information and makes it so understandable for kids! It is the story of two kids in 6th grade. One of them gets this idea to make toothpaste because it is too expensive. He takes his idea and runs with it.One of the reasons I love this book is that it has kids getting ideas and doing something with them. Rufus, the \\"Toothpaste Millionaire\\", has these ideas and he starts his own business. He deals with the cost, profit and overhead of running his business. He also gets to a point where he wants to expand and he has to finance his business. When he gets so busy he can't do it himself, he gets his friends to help him and he gives them \\"stock\\" in his company. His friend Kate, the narrator, has her own ideas and helps Rufus grow his company with advertising and expansion.I've had kids in my class as young as 8 read this book easily but as old as 13 read it with rave reviews. It has some pictures so the younger ones like it but it covers such an interesting topic it holds the older kid as well. I love this book so much I have purchased a total of 6 of these books. I've loaned them out so much I can only find 2!"},{"Title":"The Toothpaste Millionaire","review":"If you're in search of a light, humorous read (with a little academic value thrown in) for that upcoming fishing trip with the kids, look no further than The Toothpaste Millionaire. Rufus, a sixth-grader with an unusually keen entrepreneurial bent, and his matter-of-fact friend Kate (from whose perspective this story unfolds) team up to invent a new, better, and cheaper toothpaste. The creation process begins with an average kitchen and empty baby food jars. Rufus and Kate must not only develop this revolutionary product, they also have to calculate how much it costs to make, and what kind of a profit they'll enjoy depending on the price tag they assign it. (And that's where the academics come in. This novel aptly demonstrates the practicality of arithmetic in everyday life-perfect for the math-haters of the family!) Not only that, but this team of two will have to contrive clever and economical ways of advertising their creation if they're ever going to make money. Rufus is the ultimate frugal genius kid, full of new ideas and uninhibited by initial failures. You'll laugh along with Kate at his notions, but in the end you just might be surprised how far one kid and homemade toothpaste can go.Recommended read-aloud age: all agesRecommended read-alone age: 8 & upIf you'd like to read more of my reviews, visit my book review website: larsenreviews.org"},{"Title":"The Toothpaste Millionaire","review":"My son enjoyed this book immensely!

I was able to use these in my 5th grade classroom. I've been teaching for 10 years and this book gave me a whole new view on teaching social studies. This book will be useful for beginning teachers as well as for veteran teachers.

It's well worth the money. There are more activities, poems, fingerplays, and stories in this book than you can count. They aren't too dumbed down. There is a ton of humor thrown in too. My kids are going to find some of these songs so funny. The back of the book even includes patterns you can copy to go along with the activities. There are a few printable games, and many game ideas and directions. There are recipes included in the book. It can be used for pre-k- first grade, but is geared towards preK- K age kids. Another nice feature of the book is a word list to go with each letter of the alpahbet. Also, I have a hard time finding fresh ideas.

Love these books, so I bought them for my own personal collection as well as library's."},{"Title":"Slave Girl","review":"I really enjoyed Slave Girl by Claire Thompson and in the end, the love story these characters found came through for me.I was a little unsure when I started Slave Girl. The blurb concerned me about the severity of the BDSM that would be found within the pages of the book and about whether the BDSM would come from a loving standpoint or be merely gratuitous and hardcore. And, some of the scenes are fairly hardcore in that they are meant to portray the violence possible with this lifestyle when one places their trust into those they should not. That being said there were many extremely erotic and lovingly masterful scenes in this book between our main characters and, true to form for Ms. Thompson, these scenes were exceptionally hot.Slave Girl starts out as a story of absolute infidelity by Jill; however, the journey of both Barry and Jill to acceptance and understanding of each other is quite enjoyable. As far as characters go there isn't a whole lot to like about Jill and quite honestly I think that was the intent of the author. I'm sure some would say there wasn't much to like about either Jill or Barry, but, with that, I would disagree. While Barry would never make the list of my all time favorite heroes, he might make the list of the best turn-around in a character from beginning to end of book. I enjoyed watching the immensely dramatic changes that Barry was subjected to throughout Slave Girl. I was impressed that an author could take a character such as Barry and believably transform him in such a short time frame. Ms. Thompson did just that. Did he make mistakes? Sure, but Barry learned from them and tried to fix what had occurred and that's a character that a reader can enjoy. Even though you may not love him or his choices, you can understand and appreciate his journey.Ms. Thompson is one of the best storytellers I have come across in the art of telling the story of a journey. Her characters always seem to rise from some point in their lives to a higher plane of understanding and acceptance of themselves and those around them. This is not to say that her characters start out from low points; it is more an indication of the vital growth potential in us all. While we may not be interested in following the path the characters took in this book, we can all see how the path they were on, worked for them. We can appreciate the journey these characters took to get to their happily ever after was precisely what they needed. Ms. Thompson has an unquestionable ability to bring characters to life for the reader and this book is no exception.Slave Girl is one of Ms. Thompson's older books and I can see her shift and growth in writing, although, I have to say, this is still an exceptionally well-written book. The characterization and descriptions of scenes are vibrant. The reader is drawn into each and every scene as if they are watching it on the television in full color with surround sound. You feel what Barry and Jill go through in this book and you keep turning pages to find out what will happen next. The plot lines are well thought out, flow well and are believable from the first to the last.Readers should be forewarned that there are extreme scenes in this book; however, they played well to the plot line, were credibly carried out and didn't feel gratuitous in nature. I think any reader who enjoys the BDSM genre would enjoy Barry and Jill's journey through this lifestyle. It was ultimately a journey of hope and love.Rated 4 Delightful Divas by Jen[...]"},{"Title":"Slave Girl","review":"4 short stories, all reasonably well written but none really come to life for me. All technically accurate (as far as I can tell), describing far more realistically the BDSM lifestyle than half the Elora's Cave books do. It just didn't sing to me, I didn't really get involved with the characters or care for them. They seemed a bit place markers. Unlike the intense Joey Hill books, these didn't capture my imagination.These are early stories by Claire Thompson and I would read more of hers, because at the very least her sentences made sense and there was a sense of groundedness or realism in her BDSM depictions, but there wasn't much romance."},{"Title":"Slave Girl","review":"I enjoy this author, however I do wish she would extend the length of her writings!!

But why an Irish name? For some reason, this musical language and the magical legends of Ireland have become very popular in the Anglo-Saxon world and further afield. The introduction discusses trends in the giving of names and mentions the most popular current Irish names. The chapter Little Dark One provides a cursory history of the settling of Ireland by the Celts and then lists and explains suitable names for dark haired people, such as Darcy, Douglas and Duane. In the chapter The Fairest Of Them All there's mention of the Tuatha De Danaan and a discussion of names like Barry, Finbar, Kelly, etc. Red haired people are treated in the next chapters, where some of the more common names are Rory and Rowan, whilst the next chapter deals with names deriving from the root words for light or brightness; these include Aidan and Keegan. A Celtic Menagerie provides names that are connected with animal names or qualities: here you will find Colm, Conan, Conor, Oscar and Ronan. In the chapter titled The Green Isle, names derived from plants are given, including Darren and Tyrone. Warrior names in the next chapter include Casey, Fergal and Kane. Wednesday's Child provides names for less worthy traits, like Doran, Etain and Kennedy. Banshee names include Bevin, Cliona and Una, while names invented by authors include Fiona, Gulliver, Imogen and Vanessa. The next chapter discusses and lists the retranslation back into Irish, of popular Anglophonic names and also provides a list of Irish names with their English translations. The A - Z index lists all the names and their meanings/histories alphabetically and is followed by a calendar of saints' feast days. This interesting read and valuable reference work concludes with a thorough index."},{"Title":"O'Baby: The Irish Baby Name Book","review":"This is a literary and unusual name-book - well worth a look if you want to give your child, dog or goldfish an Irish name, but a fascinating read even for the non-parent because of the history of these beautiful names and the interesting way in which the author has grouped them. There are names for redheads, blondes and brunettes, names for warriors and gentlefolk, artistic names, and many others. This is a small gem and a triumph of research.

I did expect it to be bigger, as in a physically larger book, but for it's size it is chock-a-block with names.The book is divided up into sections so that you can find a name based on Irish animals, myths, saints, legends, etc and dark, light or red hair. Then there is a complete name listing from A to Z, a list that translates Irish names to English and another that does English to Irish.What I especially liked was that the author gave you the Irish name, often an alternative spelling (ie. older or more tradish Irish), how to pronounce the name, whether it is for a boy or girl and Anglicanized alternative spelling(s). Each name has a short story about where it came from, what is it's meaning and any other names it is related to.This is a great reference guide and enjoyable to simply read, too."},{"Title":"O'Baby: The Irish Baby Name Book","review":"Only mildly accurate, the clumsy mix of true Gaelic forms along with Anglicizations leaves me a bit put off. This might make it useful to many, but it is not at all formal in structure. There are also some names with variations given that are just ridiculously old. Noone uses the root 'dub' in place of 'dubh.' Some truly ancient names are included, but their selections are random. It appears to be mostly gloss from a few limited sources."},{"Title":"O'Baby: The Irish Baby Name Book","review":"We found this book very helpful, as it does not only provide a good number of names but also gives information about pronunciation and background. Well - actually, to be quite honest - we used it to find an appropiate name for our puppy, an Irish Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier."},{"Title":"O'Baby: The Irish Baby Name Book","review":"I am Irish and get very annoyed at the names people mistakenly take to be Irish, including many in this book! Just from reading some of the names suggested, you will NEVER find an Irish person called Shannon, Erin, Darcy, Duane, Keegan, Kennedy etc. I could go on...The Shannon is Ireland's principal river and Erin is the Gaelic for Ireland (though it's actually spelt &Eacute;ireann) and the others are either invented or they are surnames, NEVER given as first names in Ireland. If you came to Ireland with a name like Delaney or Magee, you would be ridiculed.One important thing to note is that in the Irish (Gaelic) alphabet, there is no J.K,Q,V,W,X,Y or Z so any names with these letters are usually not properly Irish or sometimes they are an English translation. This book also seems to encourage the irritating habit Amercians have of lumping Scottish and Irish names in with each other - they are NOT the same thing!!!There are many beautiful Irish names (particularly pleasing are the ones that non-Irish people find difficult to pronounce) but this book does not appear to be the place to find them! If you want to call your child an Irish name or if you like a name and want to know if it's Irish, ask an Irish person - a real Irish person living In Ireland I mean!"},{"Title":"O'Baby: The Irish Baby Name Book","review":"My husband's from Ireland, so we got this book thinking it would help to make our baby name decision easier. Half the names are made up, or last names used as first names (which no one does in Ireland). A lot of the pronunciations were wrong, as well as a lot of the meanings of the names. I haven't tried any of the other Irish baby name books out there, but if you're looking for an Irish name, I'd just use Google and check out a couple websites."},{"Title":"O'Baby: The Irish Baby Name Book","review":"Or just want to be, this is an excellent way for you to find names that will fit those new arrivals.

For instance i have a black ccat called Brandubh and a brown cat called Donagh, which means \\"brown warrior\\", because he is always fighting with Brandubh. There was also one old tabby who pretty much used to run the show so I called him Crimthann mac Fidaig after the old High King of Ireland, but then he was ousted by a nasty bobtail who i called Niall No&iacute;g&iacute;allach, who is Niall of the Nine Hostages, and on his birthday i like to bring him into the garden where I placed an ornamental stone i bought from Homebase which i call the Stone of Destiny like at Tara!

Reading beginning-to-end, every line of every poem is the very best way to encounter her, and this edition the best way to undertake the adventure.

Having plummeted into the sea of her verse and become dripping wet, I invite you to do likewise. Life is filled with little surprises, and one of the greatest for me has been Emily Dickinson's couplets, short little two-line poems. Here's one that I nominate for winner in the category \\"best short love poem in English:\\" \\"Least rivers - docile to some sea.// My Caspian - thee.\\" (206)My advice is don't be overly swayed by focusing on the poems you and the world already know well: e.g. \\"Because I could not stop for death\\" and others.

There's an earlier definitive Johnson collection, but I went with the Franklin collection because it's the latest and widely praised by scholars.All the poems are here, with the \\"spasmodic gait,\\" irregular syntax, personal spellings, cranky capitalizations and passionate punctuation that distressed the poet's stodgy literary mentor T. W. Higginson and caused Dickinson's earliest editors to get out their red pencils.Franklin has banished all the misguided corrections and tidying up perpetrated by the original editors and restored the true voice of the poet in all its eccentricity and power.The typesetting of the poems is clear, unpretentious and very readable.I found this authoritative collection a perfect complement to the scholarly biography of Emily Dickinson by Richard Sewall."},{"Title":"The Poems of Emily Dickinson: Centenary Edition","review":"This is it!!

I've spent hours at a time flipping through it and reading random poems. They're organized chronologically, and their numbers are off to the side in the margin so as to be unobtrusive. Since Dickinson's original punctuation, spelling, and formatting are preserved, it feels like you're really reading something close to what she intended the poems to be. Detailed textual citations (the particular choices that Franklin decided on when compiling this edition, since Dickinson had multiple versions of some poems) as well as a distribution by year and a first-line index are all at the back.This is definitely the only way I will read Dickinson's poems ever again.

Can we make this an event please?"},{"Title":"The Poems of Emily Dickinson: Centenary Edition","review":"Now there are two readers' editions of Emily Dickinson's poems that are usable for close readings and scholarship. By usable, I mean that the texts--note the word \\"texts\\"--are close to what Emily Dickinson wanted them to be. The earlier Thomas H. Johnson text has been an acceptable and competent version since it was published in 1955. Johnson's readers' edition-the one without all the scholarly apparatus-contains 1775 poems. (In the same year Belknap Press of Harvard University Press issued his three-volume variorum of all the known poems.) This is cool. This new version of Emily Dickinson poems was edited by R.W. Franklin, and the readers' edition was published in 1999. It contains 1789 poems-unfortunately with a different numbering than Johnson--based, we are told, on probable date of composition. Franklin also edited a fresh variorum edition also published by Belknap Press of Harvard. I am boring you with all of this detail to tell you that although the Johnson texts are good texts if you are serious about Dickinson--meaning if you actually care about what she wrote on the page--the Franklin will give accurate texts and is the new authority. F.W. Franklin has been working since the '60's on details where Johnson perhaps lacked information and insight. He knows whereof he speaks, and he has done his utmost to reassemble Ms. Dickinson's original manuscripts in their proper order. Previous versions of the poems--those before Johnson and Franklin--regularized rhyme and otherwise abrogated the accuracy of the poems. They were cleaned up according to late 19th century standards, and the texts--despite editorial comments to the contrary--are corrupt. That means that they are inaccurate. In conclusion, if you want Emily Dickinson with accuracy--despite the rapturous testimony of some reviewers of other presentations of the poems--go for the Johnson or Franklin texts. Franklin is most current and should be impeccable. Other texts, including some that are in supposedly respectable American literature anthologies, may be suspect. (One of the most respectable uses texts that derive from late 19th century texts that were declared corrupt some 40 years ago.)"},{"Title":"The Poems of Emily Dickinson: Centenary Edition","review":"Emily Dickinson finally has an edition of her poems that she fully deserves. As many readers know, many of her poems were left with variations in words and phrases. Sometimes, whole poems exist in completely different versions -- but the problem is that a &quot;final&quot; form for some poems is not as easy as it might seem since Dickinson herself left many variations on words and phrases without favouring a particular one! One could say that &quot;final&quot; versions for many of her poems simply do not exist. The Johnson edition (the old &quot;definitive&quot; edition) of the complete poems makes choices for the reader -- choices which, unfortunately, are not always the best. This new edition presents the poetry with all the variations intact, so that the reader could choose for him/herself a particular reading when Dickinson herself did not leave a final preference. This new edition is a *must* for anyone who loves Dickinson's poetry (such as myself) -- and it emphasizes just how rich and imaginative Dickinson's use of language really is. Dump your Johnson edition for recycling, folks. This is the definitive edition, worth every penny (and then some) of its rather high price."},{"Title":"The Poems of Emily Dickinson: Centenary Edition","review":"If you know Dickinson's compositional method -- with almost no publication in her lifetime, often with many versions of one poem, and with poetic significance altered by the paper and exact handwriting -- you will recognize that any printed edition of her work cannot be perfect. Still, Franklin has worked with care, intelligence, scholarship, and order on finding the best renditions of her poems, and these are those. If you learn to love her, you may want the hardback! Her \\"little\\" lyrics are a joy forever, and you may wear out your copy."},{"Title":"The Poems of Emily Dickinson: Centenary Edition","review":"READERS SHOULD NOTE that this is a review of the following THOMAS H. JOHNSON edition, and not of the R. W. Franklin 3-volume Variorum or other editions under which it has been mistakenly placed by Amazon (I have therefore added some comments about the Franklin at the end):Thomas H. Johnson, Editor. THE POEMS OF EMILY DICKINSON, INCLUDING VARIANT READINGS CRITICALLY COMPARED WITH ALL KNOWN MANUSCRIPTS. 3 vols. Cambridge, Mass., and London, England: The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, nd. [A single-volume reprint of the original 1955 3-vol. edition]. ISBN 0-674-67601-7 HBK.Prior to the appearance of Johnson's great variorum edition of Emily Dickinson in 1955, an edition which was the first to offer readers accurate texts of her complete poems, it was not possible to arrive at a just estimation of her tremendous achievement, an achievement that places her at the forefront of the ranks of the world's greatest poets. Because of the highly idiosyncratic nature of her poems, all earlier editors had felt obliged, to some extent or other, and in order to make them more acceptable to the public, to normalize them by adding titles, smoothing her rhymes, changing words, regularizing punctuation, and relineating them; some editors even went so far as to remove entire stanzas. It becomes a tribute to the power of her poems that, despite this savage treament they somehow survived, and there are many readers, even today, who have grown to love these mutilated versions without ever realizing just how far removed they are from her originals.Although Johnson himself wasn't entirely free of the slash-and-burn approach to ED's texts - since he apparently felt that readers weren't yet ready for the peculiar lineation that we find in Emily Dickinson's own handwritten versions of the poems - he should nevertheless be credited with having brought the worst of it to an end, and for having given us texts that are closer to the originals than ever before. He is also to be credited with having established an approximate chronological order for the 1775 poems in his edition, and for having provided us with a convenient way of referring to these untitled poems by giving each of them a number, the well-known 'Johnson numbers' which are still standard today. Each numbered poem has been transcribed exactly as it is found in the manuscripts, though with his editorial choice of variant and with lineation normalized. Below each poem comes a list of variants, information about the poem's manuscript source/s, and its publication history. The poems are preceded by 70 pages of Introductory material, which include 20 pages of very interesting photographic facsimiles in illustration of ED's varied writing styles, and the book is rounded out with an Appendix, a Subject Index, and an Index of First Lines.The single-volume version is an undated reprint of the original 1955 3-volume edition, and is a substantial book of over 1300 pages weighing in at a hefty 4lbs plus. Given the fantastic price of the book, I was amazed to discover that, although bound in full cloth, instead of the pages being sewn in signatures it has been given a glued spine which is nowhere near strong enough to hold the weight of all these pages. Although I'm pretty careful with books, the brand-new copy I examined split at the spine the first time I opened it. Anyone who is interested in the Johnson variorum would be well advised to search for a copy of the much better produced earlier and stitched 3-volume version. Although the present book deserves more than 5 stars for its content, it deserves far less for its poor physical makeup.As a contribution to scholarship, Johnson's variorum was a magnificent achievement for its time, and helped greatly in establishing Emily Dickinson's reputation. But much has come to light since 1955, and R. W. Franklin's richer 1998 variorum (which unlike the Johnson provides details of the original lineation) may now be said to have superseded it. Details of the Franklin variorum are as follows:R. W. Franklin, Editor. THE POEMS OF EMILY DICKINSON : VARIORUM EDITION. 3 vols. Cambridge, Mass., and London, England: The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, 1998. ISBN 0-674-67622X HBK.R. W. FRANKLIN'S 3-volume Variorum differs from Thomas H. Johnson's earlier 1955 Variorum in essential ways, but most significantly in that it has added 14 poems to the total corpus, thereby bringing the total from Johnson's 1,775 to 1,789 poems. This, and the re-dating of certain poems whose dates could never be established with certainty, has led to a re-numbering of the poems which, although a Franklin-to-Johnson number conversion table is included, is very inconvenient since most writing about Emily Dickinson remains keyed to Johnson's earlier numbering.Franklin's scholarly apparatus is extremely technical, and his approach throughout is thoroughly scientific, with one significant exception: all poems have been normalized (i.e., ED's own lineation has been ignored). As a substitute for the original shapes of the poems, footnotes indicating \\"Division\\" (line-breaks) have been given. Consequently, reconstructing the original shape of the poems in one's mind can be rather tiresome since it requires constant recourse to the Division notes.Despite these two weaknesses, however, the Franklin, with its accurate texts and full scholarly apparatus which gives provenance, notes indicating line-breaks, variants, publishing history, etc., is an impressive achievement and as as essential reference work it will undoubtedly find many important uses. The three volumes are beautifully produced, bound in half cloth, stitched for durability, well-printed on excellent paper, and a joy to handle."},{"Title":"The Poems of Emily Dickinson: Centenary Edition","review":"The readers' edition of The Poems of Emily Dickinson provides a condensed and affordable alternative to the three-volume variorum edition, also published by Belknap. It contains the same number of poems, but omits the alternate versions and contextual notes Franklin includes in the variorum. I prefer this edition of Dickinson's poetry to the 1955 edition edited by Thomas Johnson because it includes several poems the earlier one didn't, and because Franklin seems to have a better handle on transcribing Emily Dickinson's sometimes confusing handwriting than Johnson did. This collection is a good acquisition for anyone planning to study Dickinson, or anyone who wants to read her poems in their original, non-Victorianized form. Her original spelling and punctuation lend even more character to her already intriguing poems, so reading them this way is an experience I would definitely recommend."},{"Title":"The Poems of Emily Dickinson: Centenary Edition","review":"This is an excellent book for anyone who LOVES Emily Dickinson. Although it does not contain all the different versions of her poems, it is comprehensively edited to have the version of each known poem that is believed to be Dickinson's most complete and revised. This edition also seem to have the most complete collection of poems--1,789-- compared to the other &quot;complete poems&quot;. However, if you are looking for an edition for studious reasons, this edition does have different numbering for the poems than the ones usually used (the editor claims them to be in the most accurate chronological order possible).The binding of this book is VERY nice and has its own ribbon for marking pages. Definitely a nice book."},{"Title":"The Poems of Emily Dickinson: Centenary Edition","review":"Amazon is doing a bait-and-switch on the Kindle edition of this.

But then I saw that the ed. is only the old Todd-Higginson, which is free elsewhere. I would pay, say, 10 bucks for the Franklin, but it's apparently not available for Kindle. Shame. Neither is the slightly less authoritative Johnson ed. from the '50s. It's sad that, by and large, the Dickinson most people read and have read--in books, websites, and now e-readers--is bad versions of her poetry. Emily liked the dashes above all, and Higginson, among others, arrogantly \\"corrected\\" Emily's poetry for her, since she was not a \\"professional poet.\\" Well, no one needs (or needed) to \\"correct\\" Dickinson's poems for her. They are very great, almost all 1800 of them. They are little gems, filled with wonder, elliptical diction, symbols that work in multiple ways, doubts, love for nature, love for love, and a great working knowledge of the ideas (and pop culture) of her day.

The reader who was disappointed and gave this book &quot;1 star&quot; must have missed the point and the purpose of this book. The books is about Spirit Releasement and it contains an abundance of real-life stories, which make it for an enjoyable and easy reading.The author doesn't state that all problems in anyone's life are related to spirit releasement, however she does tactfully and routinelly check for the possibility of any mental and energetic influences from external sources. It simply makes it easier when assisting the client to deal with issue that actually relate to the client.It is not the purpose of spirit releasement techniques to place all the blame and responsibility on outer sources. After all, it is the individual's own thoughts and emotions that open the person to any external influences. And even when spirit releasement does indeed provide speedy relief from some perplexing problems, unless the individual invests some conscious effort in maintaining healthy state of mind, emotions and body, he may very well open himself to more unhealthy influences.The thing that I particularly like about spirit releasement books as opposite to exorcism books is that the therapist doesn't just remove the unhealthy influence, but makes sure to help it to understand and exprience that there is a better way to live and that it is in its best interests.I like Irene Hickman's metaphor (from her book &quot;Remote Depossession&quot;) that compares the exorcism method to taking nails out of one's tire and then tossing them out on the road, so they can pierce someone else's tires, or even one's own should the individual drive along the same road at a later time; whereas she compares spirit releasement method to actually disposing of the nails so that they don't cause damage to anyone later on.I have particularly appreciated the compassionate approach in this book of providing a brief therapy even to disembodied spirits before directing them into the light.The book lists and provides examples of extremely wide range of external influences - the greatest number of external influences being by lost and confused human beings who have not successfully made a transition to the spirit world.The influences are not always by those we'd consider &quot;dead&quot;, but also by mental influences from other living human beings. Again, I find it important to add that nothing and noone can influence the person, unless the person has first created some kind of an opening to be influenced. Most of us take daily care that our bodies and clothes are clean - not many take care that their thoughts and emotions are clean, too."},{"Title":"Freeing the Captives: The Emerging Therapy of Treating Spirit Attachment","review":"Sometimes a spirit, or soul, gets confused when its earthly body dies. It either doesn't see the light that awaits it, or fails to turn to the light. And sometimes these confused spirits attach themselves to new living bodies, interfering with the soul that already inhabits that body. In Freeing the Captives: The Emerging Therapy of Treating Spirit Attachment, hypnotherapist Louise Ireland-Frey, M.D. details how and why these &quot;obsessing entities&quot; must be released.A pioneer in &quot;spirit releasement therapy,&quot; Dr. Ireland-Frey practiced medicine until 1979. At age 67, she then began a new career as a hypnotherapist. Since then she has studied with others doing releasement and helped hundreds of clients.Dr. Ireland-Frey believes there are two parts to releasement: the living person must first have the obsessing entity freed from it; and then the freed entity must be shown the way to light, so that it finds its proper place and doesn't attach itself to others.Releasement is also known as &quot;dispossession&quot; by other practitioners.Persons who have attached spirits may experience personality changes, become inexplicably depressed, or find themselves doing things they normally wouldn't do. Dr. Ireland-Frey has included dozens of case studies that illustrate how attached spirits affect people, and how she, and other practitioners, have released them.&quot;The earthbound souls of deceased human beings are by far the most commonly found kind of obsessing or oppressing entity,&quot; according to Dr. Ireland-Frey. There are, however, various other kinds of entitles, such as past-life personalities, negative thought-forms, elementals, and &quot;dark beings of a demonic nature.&quot; The obsessing entities can occupy physical locations, such as homes, as well as living bodies. For those readers interested in helping others with releasement, the final chapter offers basic instructions and cautions. Dr. Ireland-Frey says &quot;the need is great; many souls are wandering or hiding, some in bewilderment, some in fear of hell, some in fear of continuing terrors of war, abuse, or betrayal.&quot; She urges readers to &quot;reach out to these souls and rescue or release some of these needy ones.&quot; Practitioners must take care, however, to first protect themselves from possession.Freeing the Captives sheds new light on the age-old problem of possession and offers hope and encouragement to those whom invading entities have attached themselves, as well as providing guidance to those wishing to help free the living person and the obsessing entity."},{"Title":"Freeing the Captives: The Emerging Therapy of Treating Spirit Attachment","review":"I am in the healing field and found this book most helpful. During the time I was reading the book, four people came to me who had entity possessions. I followed the format in the stories, and was able to help these people release the thoughtforms and entities. There are more things influencing our lives then what we see with the naked eye. I feel this is a growing field and more information is needed."},{"Title":"Freeing the Captives: The Emerging Therapy of Treating Spirit Attachment","review":"Dr. Ireland-Frey has written and eye-opening, informative, and enlightening book about an important area of spiritual work. She gives a wide variety of situations and many instructive anecdotes. That being said, this is not a how-to manual. If you are interested in knowing about spirit attachment, this is an excellent starting place. If however, you wish to learn HOW to do spirit releasement, I suggest William Baldwin's \\"Spirit Releasement: A Technique Manual\\". This is the gold standard handbook for actually doing spirit releasement, but certainly is not \\"light\\" reading."},{"Title":"Freeing the Captives: The Emerging Therapy of Treating Spirit Attachment","review":"I really enjoyed Dr. Louise's gentle approach to releasing entities.

It seemed to address a specific problem I was researching from a novel point of view. However, my dissapointment upon obtaining it and reading it was extreme. Even after redefining possession in this rather politically correct view of 'spirit attachment', the author fails to offer more than bone or two toward the how's and why's. Fully 85 percent of the book are recountings of seemingly effortless 'healings'. Dr. Ireland-Frey lays the probable cause of everything from mood swings to cancer to Multiple Personality Disorder to some level of 'spirit obsession'. If you are looking for a book to aid you in seeking to understand why certain things might occur, this is not your book. If, however, you want a book full of happy endings, and not a hair mussed in achieving them, indeed &quot;Freeing the Captives&quot; might be exactly what you are looking for."},{"Title":"Freeing the Captives: The Emerging Therapy of Treating Spirit Attachment","review":"The author does a splendid job of describing various forms of \\"attachment\\" with accompanying case histories. It is a most thought provoking book, and I would recommend that everyone read it. It does provide an alternative explanation to many of the unexplainable behaviours, illnesses, and unusual situations that often plague humanity. It also removes the \\"fear\\" that many have regarding death and the afterlife....how easy it is to just simply 'go to the light'."},{"Title":"Freeing the Captives: The Emerging Therapy of Treating Spirit Attachment","review":"I want to Thank Louise Ireland-Frey, M.D. For writing this book. It gave me so many answers to my own experience with spirit releasement. Her reviews and discussion with spirits show me that it is good to listen to those who are looking for help. She opened a door to an energy that so many people are afraid to discuss or talk about. When I wrote my memoir I had so many questions while looking for answers.

Story is rather pointless and I can't quite understand Salman's character having to leave the wife behind in Australia without any proper visas( silly),yet she's not allowed to follow him to Singapore either for some unknown reason other than being an inconvenience and what followed next was rather hazy as by then I've totally switched off! Salman seemed disinterested and detached from the role of a blow-hot/blow-cold husband to Karina Kapoors' vapid acting as an abandoned wife. Sohail was irritating and his acting was wetter than Jacques Cousteau's wetsuit in a poor attempt to inject some inane comedy into the movie. Songs weren't too bad with 2 rather good ones and the only reprieve from total boredom of this story was an item number, courtesy of Priety Zinta. Give this one a wide berth unless you intent to go comatose halfway through the movie!"},{"Title":"Main Aur Mrs Khanna","review":"I like Salman kahn and Kareena Kapoor. Great Chemisty.

High yield subjects consistently tested from a clinical slant like Pathopysiology and Microbiology are the best books of this series. Pharmacology and Anataomy are the least useful books of this series. However, it may still be worth it to buy the set since buying only the &quot;useful&quot; books adds up to almost as much. I recommend skimming through the table of contents in advance and deciding which diseases need to be reviewed, then randomly going to the appropriate pages to test oneself. Otherwise one could waste time on very simple/obvious diseases (reading the vignettes is more time consuming than reading a review book). I found it very helpful for the rare, obscure, or confusing diseases (especially in Biochemistry). This series is especially useful for the pre-clinical student but has limited use for the IMG who is already well versed in clinical presentations. I liked the way the &quot;buzzwords&quot; of each vignette were highlighted. While it meant that it was not representative of the exam (where one must differentiate between extraneous and pertinent information), it did help me recognize the most characteristic signs and symptoms of a particular disease entity. Each page is broken down to CC, HPI, PE, Labs, Imaging, Gross and Micro Path, Treatment, and Discussion. Overall, a good investment."},{"Title":"Underground Clinical Vignettes for Step 1 (9 Book Set)","review":"I've been using these books and they've helped me learn the clinical pictures of how diseases present--an ideal set of books to study for the USMLE Step 1.

The result is an artistic presentation that captured and enthralled me."},{"Title":"Espanol en espanol","review":"This book is excellent in some respects, but lacking in others. The basic pedagogical method of using only Spanish with essentially no translation is not totally effective when used without a teacher. I am already proficent in another language, having been trained in one of the most famous systems in the world, and in my opinion certain explanations have to be delivered in the native tongue of the speaker in order to expedite progress. So that's my real criticism: more English was needed. However, the stories and grammatical lessons are excellent and there is a real sense of excitement as you read articles on genuinely interesting topics and find that you're understanding the Spanish! I do recommend this book, but suggest also that you check out &quot;Repaso&quot; (available on Amazon) and also &quot;Spanish Now&quot; (also available here)."},{"Title":"Espanol en espanol","review":"What I like the MOST about this book is that it is only in Spanish. I've been teaching for 13 years, and I've noticed that when people struggle to find the meaning they retain better what has been learned. I've used other texts like Churros y Chocolate, Dos Mundos, Horizontes, D&iacute;melo T&uacute;... and nothing compares to the way Espa&ntilde;ol en Espa&ntilde;ol is written. Grammar points are nicely explained with lots of examples, and the author made sure his book was not only interesting, but fun. There isn't a single class in which people don't laugh about the examples or excercises that are given in those pages. So, let them struggle with the &quot;only-Spanish&quot; approach, and you'll see the progress that inevitably comes with it."},{"Title":"Espanol en espanol","review":"I used this textbook to learn Spanish. It is an excellent book and is very comprehensive. While this textbook will not make you fluent what it does provide is an excellent foundation to build upon. I also agree that it is helpful to use a textbook in conjunction with a teacher as is the case with most text books. I did keep this book and referred to it often years later to reinforce the fundamentals. It is written in a way that made learning fun. I am now fluent and literate in Spanish and owe a great deal of my success to the fundamentals I learned in this textbook. In addition to this textbook I also purchased an English/Spanish dictionary and a Spanish dictionary. I kept these two books on the coffee table and watched Spanish television and listened to Spanish/Latin music. This method worked very well for me."},{"Title":"Nevada","review":"This book was also purchased for my wife's reading enjoyment and to add to her Zane Gray book collection. She enjoyed reading Zane Gray western novels."},{"Title":"Nevada","review":"When Jim Lacy rides away for his partner, Ben Ide, he is at a loss as what to do. He had settled his debt to his friend in the book \\"Forlorn River\\" and despite having fallen in love with Ben' sister, Hettie, he knows the RIGHT thing to do was to ride away; for he was not worthy of Hettie's love. \\"Nevada\\" has always been considered one of Zane Grey's best loved and known works--much more so than \\"Forlorn River\\". And I really don't understand why that is the case. Unless the reason is: More people can recognize more of themselves with character of Jim Lacey than they can with Ben Ide. But for whatever reason this book has always been rated higher on the scale of Zane Grey's books. Nevada has left Ben and returned to Nevada where he known as Jim Lacy, and after a series of adventures and two passing years he overhears a conversation between his boss and a judge about his old friend, who is now in Arizona. Their suspicions about Ben cause Nevada to offer his services, as range detective, his only condition, if he lives through this ordeal, his name will be cleared. They agree. During these years, Hettie Ide has longed for Nevada, not undersanding why he had run away; for she loved Nevada, and love was all that mattered to her. Nevada IS one of Zane Grey's best books, I even rate it as high as its sequel, but I do like the first novel better, and I suggest you had better read \\"Forlorn River\\" first to make the story fully understandable."},{"Title":"Nevada","review":"I ordered this book to add to my set of red/white Zane Grey books.

Typical Grey action & romance with the 'moral' always in the background."},{"Title":"Going Home","review":"It is fifty years since Doris Lessing published Going Home, an account of her return to Rhodesia, the country where she grew up. By then in her thirties, she had already achieved the status of restricted person because of her political allegiances and her declared opposition to illiberal white rule. These days Zimbabwe makes the news because of internal strife and oppression. It is worth remembering, however, that fifty years ago the very structures of Southern Rhodesian society were built upon oppression, an oppression based purely on race.Fifty years on Doris Lessing's Going Home an historical record of this noxious system, a record that is more effective, indeed more powerful because of its reflective and observational, rather than analytical style. Doris Lessing, a one-time card-carrying Communist, laid a large slice of the blame for the perpetuation of discrimination firmly at the door of the white working class. Though not all white workers were rich - indeed she records that many were abjectly poor - what they had and sought to preserve was an elevated status relative to the black population. She describes white artisans as white first and artisans second. Though trade unions actively sought equal pay for equal work, they never campaigned for any kind of parity for black workers. On the contrary, they demanded the maintenance of racially differentiated pay rates. How's that for the spirit of socialist internationalism and brotherhood! (I accept there is a misplaced word there...). In fact Doris Lessing records that it was the relatively liberal capitalist enterprises that demanded more black labour, their motive of course arising from cost savings, not philanthropy. So trade unions spent much of their time making sure that companies hired their quota of higher paid, white labour.Even in the 1950s, she remarks on the likelihood that many Africans were already better educated than their white counterparts. White youth shunned education as unnecessary, while Africans saw it as a possible salvation. She notes that the people who treated the African population the worst were recent immigrants from Europe, particularly those from Britain, who tended to be less educated themselves and drawn from the ranks of the politically reactionary. Such people, apparently, were equally critical of immigrants from southern Europe, and expected Spaniards and Greeks to work for African wages, not the white wages that they themselves demanded.The situation in Rhodesia, clearly, had to change. Not only was such crass discrimination unsustainable, it was also comic, as are all racially posited class systems. While the South Africans over the border created honorary whites of the Japanese they increasingly had to do business with, the Rhodesians went through their own equally idiotic contortions. An example of such nonsense is quoted by Doris Lessing when she remarks that there was a privileged group of Africans who were granted the right not to carry passes with them at all times, as long as they carried a pass to record their exemption.But it is also worth remembering that Doris Lessing, herself, was a banned person, unable to travel to certain places and very much under the watchful eyes of the authorities. In Going Home she observes a society that had to collapse under the weight of its unsustainable contradictions. The fact that this took more than twenty years after the book was written was nothing less than a crime, and probably contributed to the subsequent and equally lamentable reaction.Doris Lessing records seeing a British film towards the end of her travels. She describes it as a \\"cosy little drama of provincial snobberies and homespun moralities played out in front of African farmers in their big cars\\". Fifty years on, Britain is probably cosy and provincial, and the snobberies are still rife. But now it is not Rhodesia where these reactionaries look down on people of other races overpay and under-educated themselves. It is not in Africa where corporations would dearly love to employ cheaper labour, imported if need be. Rhodesia's white privilege of the 1950s was obviously absurd. But there are some parallels with economic and class relations in the Britain of today and, like all good books, Doris Lessing's Going Home may even add prescience to its qualities."},{"Title":"Going Home","review":"Lessing documents the nature of the political and cultural milieu of Southern Rhodesia in the mid-fifties. In many ways this is an excellent historical investigation in journalistic prose.My concern is with the book's underlying assumption that that those who left Britain to occupy the colony either became less moral, or were already less moral, than those who stayed behind. Lessing tends to represent those who remained back in Britain as denizens of proper and correct behavior. Life in Africa is thus seen to exert a corrupting influence on otherwise wholesome and correctly mannered British people:\\"Why was it that when white people came out from Britain, first they were indignant about the colour bar and the treatment of the Africans, and then they very fast became as rude and cruel as the old Rhodesians?\\" (p162)I feel the book has the quality of being a bit dated for its moralizing perspective.\\"Africa belongs to the Africans\\" and Europe belongs to the Europeans is the underlying premise of the book -- and although it is unspoken, it comes across in many different ways, such as in the formulation quoted above.What needs to be examined, in order to give a sense of context to the book, is whether attitudes remain automatically \\"civilized\\" so long as they do not go abroad.Also, are black Africans not similarly subject to \\"corruption\\" by virtue of living in Africa -- or is this corrupting effect of the continent only effective on the whites who have gone there?Lessing's book attempt to teach a moral lesson about colonialism, but leaves these fundamental philosophical questions unanswered."},{"Title":"KJV Prophecy Marked Reference Study Bible","review":"I am extremely satisfied with my recent purchase of this Bible.The references to different aspects of Scripture are easily accessed. My particular interest of Scriptures relating to Israel, it's people and it's land and Biblical prophecies relative to Israel are there at your fingertips.My only criticism is in relation to the \`political correctness' of Mr. Jeffery's own writings in enclosed articles supporting areas of Scripture where he uses the term \`Palestine' out of it's correct geographical and historical context.Palestine being the regional name given to Israel and adjacent areas after the suppression of the second Jewish revolt by the Roman Emperor, Hadrian, in AD135. The original name being \`Syria Palaestina' which eventually became anglicised into \`Palestine' and which was subsequently replaced by Israel upon it's rebirth in 1948.Mr. Jeffery uses the term \`Palestine' incorrectly in some old maps and also in one area relating to Old Testament prophets who were around long before the term \`Palestine' ever existed.If you can live with this, or amend it even, this will be an excellent Bible to possess. In all other ways it is to be highly recommended.

If you have ZERO experience, then I recommend starting with on of the &quot;...for Dummies&quot; books first, as the terminology in this book may be hard to grasp at first. But if you're moving over from C++, Java, or VB, this is a great place to start. In fact, this book contains much more needed for just beginning, and by the end of the read you should be able to write a full-fledged Windows app with little problems.The downsides of the book are few, but important to note. First off, the author doesn't spend enough time visually describing how OOP (object oriented programming) works. Before you know it, you'll be diving into classes, methods, delegates, and events before fully understanding basic concepts. Chapters 9-12 are by far the most difficult in the book to follow. Most everything else is cake. Also, because the book is just loaded with information, it may be hard for a beginner to differentiate from a beginners topic and a more advanced topic that you may never use.Overall the book is a great read and I recommend it for anyone who wants to jump into C#. I easily finished it within less than a month with a pretty sound basic knowledge of what C# is about. After reading this, I recommend buying Professional C# (Second Edition) from WROX along with The C# Reference book they also put out.

Hustler magazine doesn't show this level of detail. The authors explore every nook &amp; crevice of a subject and there are plenty of code snippets to illustrate each new concept.This could be a good companion book. But not a first book.

I must say I read and checked the book from cover to cover - it is very well written and extremely accurate. The book is mainly aimed at programmers who use Visual C# to develop Windows Applications so it covers in detail the techniques of programming with Windows Forms, user controls, common dialogs and so on.Being a beginning book, it spends a lot of time coverig the basic concepts about C# and .NET programming (in fact, it starts with them). However, unlike with the other beginners books (I've seen most of them at the work place), it goes well beyond the basics and presents most features you'll likely need when developing Windows applications: deploying your application, accessing databases using ADO.NET, working with files, playing with GDI+ and much more. At the end it even has two chapters on ASP.NET and Web Services which are good to be read just to make an idea what are these all about, even if you're not currently doing any web programming.I highly recommend this book to programmers willing to read the chapters in sequential order, because most of them build upon the theory taught in the preceding ones.

Each chapter explains principles, leads you through hands-on examples, recaps where the principles are implemented in the examples and then tests your comprehension with exercises at the end.C# is not a casual topic and this book is not a casual read. You gain great insight when you work the code examples and answer the exercises provided. Between my workday and playtime, it took me three months to complete this book, cover to cover. I am confidant with the basics, such as ADO.NET, ASP.NET or XML handling, to investigate more advanced, specialized C# books now.Finally, a change of publishers did cause the answers to the chapter review exercises to disappear from the web for a good while.

His two histories here are in more modern English, but are as Shakespeare might have written them were he after his own time.What I like most about this fellow is that he isn't so impressed with himself that he can't laugh with us at him and his times.He has no respect for Judges in either High Tor or Winterset.High Tor is a play for our times, for all timesabout the rape of the environment and the men who are as thieves, and foster it.

It's a much better value."},{"Title":"THE LAST DAYS OF DISCO WITH COCKTAILS AT PETROSSIAN AFTERWARDS","review":"When everyone rejected adapting the popular film, &quot;The Last Days of Disco into a novel, Castle Rock Entertainment reluctantly turned to &quot;dancing adman&quot; Jimmy Steinway. Being a closet novelist whose works have always ended in the round file, Jimmy hustles to agree before management changes it's mind.Jimmy describes the real activities of the &quot;circle&quot; from the perspective of a younger Jimmy when an outsider tries to penetrate the group through romancing one of them. Readers visit THE discotheque through Jimmy's eyes as he introduces the regulars that seem to reside inside the strobe lights. The in-crowd contains regulars like in your face Charlotte Pingree, depressed and depressing assistant district attorney Josh Neff, &quot;Don Quixote&quot; Dan Powers, and romantic focus Alice Kinnon.Narrated by a middle aged Jimmy Steinway looking back and laughing at a younger Jimmy, the novel uses irony to satirize the movie. As in the movie, sexual strain grips the in-crowd freezing their best moves on and off the dance floor. THE LAST DAYS OF DISCO WITH COCKTAILS AT PETROSSIAN AFTERWARDS is as much fun as its screen predecessor due to Mr. Steinway's ability to amusingly look back at his actions and that of the rest of the in-crowd that makes the players, in retrospect, seem like nons.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"THE LAST DAYS OF DISCO WITH COCKTAILS AT PETROSSIAN AFTERWARDS","review":"Well written and amusing. A clever reworking of the movie. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"THE LAST DAYS OF DISCO WITH COCKTAILS AT PETROSSIAN AFTERWARDS","review":"Without the music (which is described throughout), this book is rather lame. A novelization of the movie, written as though someone asked Jimmmy Steinway (the ad guy who kept trying to get his clients into \\"The Club\\") to write it years after he wrote the movie script. You're left wondering: did this really happen or not? Why did Stillman feel the need to write this book?Although it does explain certain character's motivations, which weren't really clear in the movie, it kind of goes overboard with a little too much insight, even for a novel. In my opinion, it wasn't realistic, and the characters were even more superficial than the movie. In the movie, you know nobody acts that way in real life, but it's a movie! And since when is the IRS a client of an advertising agency? Why would the Charlotte and Alice both be only TWENTY years old in the September following their graduation from college? No mention of skipping grades, starting first grade at age four, or both of them going to college during the summer, in which case, they'd still both be twenty-one. This isn't the 1930's where kids start first grade at age five, there is no sophomore year in high school, so everyone graduated high school at age sixteen. Just a glaring inconsistency which bothered me.The movie is much more entertaining."},{"Title":"THE LAST DAYS OF DISCO WITH COCKTAILS AT PETROSSIAN AFTERWARDS","review":"When I saw this book on Amazon's site as coming soon...I ordered it blindly. I had no idea what I would be getting (this was august) and it took me several months to get to it. Any new Stillman project is like music to my ears (pardon the horrific pun). He takes 4 years between movies and this was something new(ish).Stillman's movies have been compared to Woody Allen many times, notably by Roger Ebert. While it is unlikely you will find a bigger Woody Allen fan than yours truely, I think the comparison is off the mark. Perhaps they both deal with similar comedy of manners and city life, but Stillman is not Allen. That is a good thing. Stillman, clearly influenced by many sources, is an original voice.The other reviewers have done an outstanding job of explaining this extraordinary novel. We all say, &quot;the book was better than movie&quot; but when has a book been written after the film, by the screenwriter and turned into a novel that smoothly references the film? Got me. The book WAS better than the movie, but that is besides the point.I watched the film (for the 3rd time) shortly before the I read the book. While I found the actor's images in my mind, it also made the references to the movie much easier to recall. They work best as companion pieces. I loved getting to know Jimmy, a really good guy. The book was moving and made me nostalgic for the early '80s when I was 6 or 7 and my own growing up years. Stillman touched a nerve. Even if you don't enjoy Stillman, you might enjoy the book.By now, Stillman's signature style is well known. Ingenious dialogue,confused, but good young people. The film triliogy (Metropolitan remains the masterpiece) is now done, but what a way to end. I loved this book so much. This is not a very clear or literary review, but something about this book struck me very deeply. Not since Nick Hornby has a writer struck me like this. I find myself thinking it over often and looking forward (as I often do with his films) to reading it again.I particularly enjoyed hearing what had become the characters in the &quot;cocktails at the Petrossian&quot; and &quot;epilogue&quot; sections. Fascinating revelations and lessons. I wonder, what happened to Charlotte? That we never know. No matter.Poignant, hilarious, and fascinating. Read it. You will be changed."},{"Title":"THE LAST DAYS OF DISCO WITH COCKTAILS AT PETROSSIAN AFTERWARDS","review":"An unusual novelization of a film after its theatrical release, that also happens to be written by its director/writer. By telling the story of the movie from the point of view of one of its characters -- who knows about the movie, its script, and various other background materials -- The Last Days of Disco, with Cocktails at Petrossian Afterwards actually improves upon what was an excellent, enjoyable film to begin with. But don't be concerned that this is some trite post-modern, deconstructionist gobbledygook, because Stillman is just as talented a novelist as he is a filmmaker, and he allows the wonderful, affecting story about a group of young people finding their way in the world hold center stage. Set against his marvelous descriptions of New York City at night, and its early 1980s club scene, along with the great dialogue Stillman's films are known for, Stillman's novelization of his own film succeeds greatly on its own."},{"Title":"THE LAST DAYS OF DISCO WITH COCKTAILS AT PETROSSIAN AFTERWARDS","review":"Ever had a hankerin' for Hemingway? Or found yourself fixin' for some Fitzgerald? Sure, you could go back and reread *The Sun Also Rises* for the fifth time. Or *The Great Gatsby* for the seventh or eighth. But why bother when you want something new, something fresh, something that captures that same decadent ennui while referencing Chic's &quot;Good Times&quot; and Evelyne &quot;Champagne&quot; King's &quot;I Don't Know If It's Alright&quot;? Now, I'm not saying Whit Stillman's debut novel(ization) deserves automatic entry into the canon of Western literature. However, as a refreshing tonic of socio-sexual commentary, I assure you it can't be beat.Here's what I like most about this novel: The narrative concept. Yeah, I saw the movie and liked it. (If you saw the movie and hated it, move on.) But the movie confused me at times, because -- quite frankly -- most of the male characters looked so similar that I kept confusing them. But, but, but...in the book, Stillman ingeniously casts fictional character Jimmy Steinway as the first-person, omniscient narrator -- with full knowledge of the movie, its script and various other background materials that the film's producers supposedly and graciously granted him. (Not to mention about twenty years of hindsight.) So Steinway can not only tell his side of the story, poor sod, but also elucidate many other goings on, including events to which he himself was not privied.Long story short, this is indeed a retelling of the film that reveals all the strengths and weaknesses of the original story. The strengths being, first, great (great, great) dialogue. I found myself *thinking* like Stillman's dialogue for hours after I put down the book. Second, the novel (and film) present a very dignified and righteous defense of disco culture. Who knew? I grew up hating disco, believing it fake, stupid and empty like any red-blooded rock 'n roller. How enlightening to learn that disco, like any genre, had its artistes and its scam artists. And, y'know, it's true -- who really dances anymore? Nowadays, you're either thrown to the floor in a mosh pit or trampled to death by hundreds of ecstasy-whacked ravers trying to get the DJ's autograph.The weaknesses? Well, as in the movie, you really must focus at times to keep the male characters in order. (The ladies aren't so difficult, their characters are clearly drawn and, uh, rounder.) And in the novel as well as the film, the lawyerly character Josh's sudden emergence as the story's driving force took me off guard. He seemed to emerge out of nowhere as this very important sympathetic character well after I'd already settled on Des McGrath and Jimmy as the major players. And, perhaps fittingly, Josh disappears in the very end -- leaving us with Des and Jimmy. Also, the lack of resolution among the characters leaves one a tad aching but, maybe that's a strength in disguise.To sum up, I guess I'm saying the characterizations were a little shallow. But that's a minor criticism when set against the great verbal repartee and succinct, delightful descriptions of early-80s New York nightlife. Wilt Stillman has done what few writer/directors dare -- dig deeper into one of his movies, not via a sequel, but in the pages of a novel. That's a brave, brave deed, and one well worth an interested reader's time."},{"Title":"THE LAST DAYS OF DISCO WITH COCKTAILS AT PETROSSIAN AFTERWARDS","review":"For those of you who've seen the film, this story is told in the first person by Jimmy Steinway (MacKenzie Astin's character in the movie), as his character is hired by Castle Rock to tell the story of the events told in the movie. It goes beyond the film somewhat and takes us up to the characters lives today. Typical Stillman. If you like Whit Stillman's films, this book is one you can carry with you at all times. Some of the scenes from the Club don't translate very well to the book, but that's actually a plus, because the film is NOT about disco or the club per se. (Hence the bad reviews from people who mistakenly thought just because the film took place at a club, that it was a ripoff of &quot;54&quot;.) Those themes are methaphorical and the book helps bring everything into perspective. I probably wouldn't want to read the book without seeing the film first. And if you see the film, you also need to see &quot;Metropolitan&quot; and &quot;Barcelona,&quot; for it to all make sense."},{"Title":"THE LAST DAYS OF DISCO WITH COCKTAILS AT PETROSSIAN AFTERWARDS","review":"Let me start off by saying that I have always been a fan of Whit Stillman's films (and am sad that there are only 3) so when I saw that he had written this novel I couldn't wait to get my hands on it. I ordered it through interlibrary loan and started reading it only a few days after watching the film, The Last Days of Disco, for the third time.At first I thought the book was going to be exactly like the movie (some scenes and lines are exactly the same, as if Stillman was transcribing the script) but then there are paragraphs of insightfulness from Jimmy and also added scenes or dialogue that is not in the movie.I love the way Jimmy makes all sorts of commentary on society as well as specific people. For me, this book gave more depth into the movie and characters I already loved and was well worth reading through some things that I already knew really well from the movie.Another thing that is fun about the book is that at the end (&quot;cocktails at pretrossian afterward&quot;) all the charcters meet up again--17 years after the original story took place--after the movie screening! I think it really works well that the book is so self-aware about the fact that it was a movie first. It makes it all that more real feeling.The only thing I would say against this book is that, well, I can see why Whit turned to film. I really think his way of writing works better in that media. And, although, it's a great book, there are times when the writing or dialogue just seems better suited for film (although, I suppose in film you would miss out on some of the more personal thoughts and commentary that I loved so much in the book). So I guess it's a give and take sort of thing, but as an example, sometimes Stillman seems to repeat certain words which, in a book, doesn't really work that well for me. But in diologue has an interesting effect on screne. But, as the books says at the very beginning, books and films have different strengths and weakenesses, so I guess that sort of thing happens.Anyway...I would recomend this to any Stillman fans out there (and anyone else interested in a witty and insightful novel). And watch all of Stillman's movies, too!!"},{"Title":"THE LAST DAYS OF DISCO WITH COCKTAILS AT PETROSSIAN AFTERWARDS","review":"Whit Stillman, one of the most talented independent film makers working today has another side: he is also a great novelist. He has manged to turn the story of his last film into a novel that is just as witty and perceptive. The interplay of his characters is riveting, his view of New York City at night enchanting and his use of language inspiring. Who else could combine a love story straight out of Jane Austin with a description of popular music that might have come from Rolling Stone? This is the perfect book to curl up with on a rainy summer weekend."},{"Title":"THE LAST DAYS OF DISCO WITH COCKTAILS AT PETROSSIAN AFTERWARDS","review":"The term &quot;novelization&quot; conjures images of garishly stylized &quot;Star Wars&quot; covers enclosing a few hundred pages of cringeworthy writing. However, Whit Stillman's &quot;novelization&quot; of the last days of disco is really nothing of the sort -- it is a once a witty story and an original medidation on context, perception and medium. Stillman explores the distortion and selectivity that is inherent in any act of storytelling. And he displays such mastery of characterization that one finds it hard to imagine that a single author produced a movie so unkind to &quot;dancing adman&quot; Jimmy Steinway and, in the novel, a very sympathetic Jimmy Steinway-as-narrator that are entirely true to each other.This is not to suggest that Stillman has written a hermetic and self-referential meditation on writing -- writing-on-writing being some of the dullest dust around. Stillman has a knack for a sort of anthropology of New York waspdom (which reminds me, a bit oddly perhaps, of George Trow), which he has put to good use in his movies. Yet it really comes to full flower in the novel form, where he can avail himself of a subtlety unsuited to film."},{"Title":"THE LAST DAYS OF DISCO WITH COCKTAILS AT PETROSSIAN AFTERWARDS","review":"I have never seen any of Mr.Whitman's films but probably will do so after reading this book. I am impressed with the characters, especially the women, are written and how they end up. Most of all, it is the way the author refers to the film throughout the book as the events transpire that kept my interest. It is a nice technique and demonstrates the power of Hollywood to let the narrator/author reflect on the story from other points of view. Would this book have been written if it were not for the film? The incorporation of the film into the story almost makes me wish that the film had never been made. Everyone would have declared the book a masterpiece."},{"Title":"THE LAST DAYS OF DISCO WITH COCKTAILS AT PETROSSIAN AFTERWARDS","review":"I love Whit Stillman. I miss Whit Stillman. We haven't heard a cinematic peep from this fine director, among the best of the 90's, since he moved to Paris. Apparently the City of Light, or at least its ridiculous rents, inspired Whit to write and here we have the results.Briefly, the literary conceit is that Jimmy the Dancing Ad Man from the film is drafted to do a novelization of the movie. Omnipresent in the film, he is largely a background character, but becomes the point-of-view for the book. The novel rarely ventures too far from the movie, which I thought was the lesser of his three films to date.Some complaints:- I was rather hoping that the &quot;with Cocktails at Petrossian Afterwards&quot; hinted at an expansion of the scope beyond the movie. Although providing us with additional character development, lacking in the film due to the large ensemble cast, the scope of the novel is the scope of the film.- The entire book is written in the speaking-style of Jimmy the Ad Man. This is extremely funny for the first third, but wears thin. You're investing far more time with Jimmy than the two hour duration of the film and you may tire of the digressions and so forth.It's still a fine book and I'd recommend to anyone who liked the movie. Just don't watch the film and read the book back to back, or even close together, otherwise you won't get much out of it. It's still very funny and I'd be interested in reading more by Whit should Paris (or the landlord) get him in the mood again.

Moreover, he could take that hatred and apply it to white people generally.Hatred is one theme that come through loud and clear.This is a man who's become rich in America, met with world leaders, changed American foreign policy.

Superficially, this book falls into the genre of &quot;an angry black looks at America&quot;. If I had I browsed this book in a bookstore I probably would not have been interested in it. However, while Mr. Robinson is certainly both angry and black, this autobiography is much more than a complaint about 20th century America. It is an emotionally powerful story of an individual who changed both America and the world.Randall Robinson's experiences clearly demonstrate that America has yet to recover from the abhorrent behavior patterns engendered by decades of slavery and discrimination. Ironically, the original draft of the Declaration of Independence contained a strident denunciation of slavery as violating the most sacred rights of life and liberty. That clarion call for the equality of all men, black and white, was deleted from the Declaration in the interest of political expediency. When America turned its back on equal rights for all people, the effects of slavery proceeded to devastate the ethical sinews of the nation, directly degrading blacks and indirectly debasing the consciences of many whites. The blatant examples of racism that Randall Robinson experienced in settings ranging from Alabama back roads to the halls of Harvard Law School are startling to a middle class white such as myself. It would be easy for Randall Robinson to justify rebelling against a system which allows the stereotypes and prejudices of slavery to infect its social structures.Randall Robinson chose a different path; he chose to do what is morally right rather than what portends short term political expediency. Randall Robinson decided to change America's wholly unjust and racist foreign policy towards African and Carribean countries. The impact that he and his compatriots had on US foreign policy towards both South Africa and Haiti is stunning. They didn't just nudge the lumbering ship of state on a small course change. They stopped the US in its tracks and caused it to support democracy rather than totalitarian dictatorship. Why is it that in the country of the Declaration of Independence, private citizens have to stand up and tell our government to advocate democracy over totalitarian rule in other countries? Both the occupation of the South African embassy and Randall Robinson's hunger strike over Haitian policy are compelling narratives. These two stories alone make the book worth reading.The book also documents the warm family relationships Randall Robinson enjoyed. Growing up in materially impoverished conditions was never an excuse to underachieve. Randall Robinson makes it quite clear that strong family values are needed and nurtured by all races. The insight he provides into the daily life in many African countries stands in stark juxtaposition to the common stereotypes of dumb, lazy blacks. That Alexander Haig could &quot;beat tom-toms&quot; during White House cabinet sessions on Africa is appalling for its ignorance. Many African countries are slowly and assiduously building democratic societies, more than can be said for Mr Haig's atavistic contributions.Overall I'd recommend this book as fascinating reading. Randall Robinson is a shining example of the power of an individual to change America and the world."},{"Title":"Defending the spirit: A Black life in America","review":"This is an angry book by an angry man. It makes me angry to read it. Not because it is an angry man's angry book, but because it is the sad description of the continued failures of US foreign policy towards African and Caribbean countries and of the stalled process of truly equal opportunities of blacks and whites in the US.Maybe it is this &quot;machinery&quot; of white-dominated politics that I - being a (white) foreigner in the US - had never heard of Randall Robinson before. The story of his life is impressive and full of open and sublimal encounters of racism in everyday's life. His analysis of the influence of minorities on policy making sounds like a resignation, but describes probably the situation rather well.I encourage the Amazon customers to dig into this book. However, I did not grant a full five-star rating because I had hoped that I could find a perspective how to improve the situation of blacks and whites (and all other minorities) living together in this melting pot USA.

With 7 books of his work published, this book is a taste of the style for which Klaus Gerhart is renowned. A bit of Ritts, a dash of Gorman, tons of beautiful naked men and a whole lotta class."},{"Title":"Euros 13 (No.13)","review":"There are so many good-looking young men and couples in this 13th Euros Edition, it's amazing. Kraus Gerhart knows how to pose his men and make it very pleasing to the eye. A very talented photographer who already has four books in print, and who produces yearly calendars as well as many magazine spreads. He knows how to bring out the warmth and sensuality in his images. This is one of my favorite of the Euros Series and I truly enjoyed it. I loved the cover shot. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Practical ethics,","review":"This books shows how to think about ethics conceptually in about 3 pages. Using this framework, the remainder of the text describes many topics(food, clothes, the family, the poor, etc.) that are ethical issues even today and applies the framework to them.This is my first ethics books and I cant tell you how much easier it has just made it to explain ethics to my family. Even if you don't agree with the authors outcome on subjects you can easily use the framework to outline your own family values for your given situation.This would be a great text for home schooling parents desiring a simplified overview of what ethics are and how to make ethical decisions in life. Plus its free on kindle!"},{"Title":"Practical ethics,","review":"This item is what it was represented to be, and I am most appreciative of the fact that I received what I paid for."},{"Title":"Practical ethics,","review":"I really really really really like this book. I hope these are enough words to qualify as a review because I only read some of the book."},{"Title":"Communications Systems and Networks","review":"Horak's third edition updates an ambitious and comprehensive treatise of the subject. If you need an encyclopedic reference work on telecommunications and networking, then this book's for you. Very detailed. I like the historical perspective: does a good job of explaining the transition from analog, circuit-switched networking to today's increasingly digital, packet-based, convergent applications. I also like the &quot;plain-English&quot; style, personal anecdotes and revelations from the author's lengthy telecom career. The organization/morphology is OK; certainly competent given the rapid changes occuring in this industry. It is extremely well indexed and referenced, however, so zeroing-in on specific topics is not difficult. Deserves a spot on any student or professional bookshelf."},{"Title":"Communications Systems and Networks","review":"A wonderful and essential book for all telecom engineers. It is a great work that should have scored my 5 but for the paper quality."},{"Title":"Communications Systems and Networks","review":"Communications Systems and Networks by Ray Horak is and excellent resource for anyone in the communication industry, whether experienced or not.I advise every new person in my group to purchase it and keep it close at hand.It has been helpful on many occasions when I needed to help an upper level manager understand a technical issue."},{"Title":"Communications Systems and Networks","review":"I found Mr. Horak's recent edition of Communications Systems and Networks to be a great addition to my technical library. It is well written and comprehensive. It has become one of my basic reference books when training new employees because it exposes technical issues in a complete, common sense manner. In my consulting business, I'm often confronted with the need not only to find the answers, but then to help clients to understand why we make certain recommendations. In this third edition, he brings the areas of telecommunications, media, transmission, networks, hardware and software up to date."},{"Title":"Communications Systems and Networks","review":"I find Communication Systems and Networks (3rd Edition) extremely useful as a reference tool. With the &quot;language&quot; of networking constantly expanding/contracting etc., Ray Horak has done an excellent job in keeping the discussion confined to &quot;plainspeak&quot; and for the &quot;non-tech&quot; in the &quot;tech space&quot; that is very refreshing. It all about applications and the technology as the great enabler.This is a must for every reference library."},{"Title":"Communications Systems and Networks","review":"Communications Systems and Networks keeps getting better with each new edition. The book provides extraordinarily clear and concise explanations of every major topic in Voice &amp; Data communications.The author, Ray Horak, is also the editor of Newton's Telecom Dictionary and his experience editing that test shows up throughout Communications Systems and Networks. I give copies of Newton's Telecom Dictionary to every student who attends my TrainingCity.com Voice &amp; Data classes.I strongly recommend this text to anyone involved in IT. It is an excellent starting point for people new to the field, and experienced professionals who need to stay current on the latest trends and developments."},{"Title":"Communications Systems and Networks","review":"This is a good book, I also found Broadband Networking, ISBN 007219510X, to be very good and more current."},{"Title":"Communications Systems and Networks","review":"Ray Horak has gone beyond what any other author of this kind of text has done before. It is comprehensive, detailed and flows logically. It is a good read, AND a good reference. If I could take only one book with me in the field it would be this one. Recently, a freind of mine with software development experience was promoted to a position that oversees network ops. I recommend this book to her and no other. It is by far my favorite. Whether you are simply curious, or in the field, or any where in between, this is your book. Hopefully, Ray will read this and someday do a third edition as well."},{"Title":"Communications Systems and Networks","review":"Even if I have not yet finished reading it, I think it is really a very useful support to people working in contexts involving telco services. It presents a complete, enough up-to-date, easy, and quick-to-read overview about integration of voice, data and other network facilities. Overall, the author avoids the temptation to dig deeply into protocols (you can easily find tons of papers about) and prefers to clarify and strengthen the structure the different subjects are placed in. Each one is showed in the right time and is given the right room. Oh, I read that this book is very popular among management consultants. But it does not matter, I like it all the same. A succesful effort in unifying a so fragmented field as telecoms services should be unconditionally appreciated."},{"Title":"Communications Systems and Networks","review":"For someone wanting to get a feel for the breadth of technologies used in telecommunications today, this is a super book. My only quibble is that here and there details are introduced but not explained well enough to really understand. But the references in each chapter to more in-depth materials provide the solution to that problem.What I did appreciate very much was how up-to-date this book is, and how it did make a very good stab at explaining an awful lot of stuff. I suddenly found myself understanding much more about lots of things that I had heard about but didn't quite 'get' - from cable types to ATM switching.As another reviewer said - I think I now know enough to be dangerous - but I also know where to go to learn more in depth on a whole lot of topics."},{"Title":"Communications Systems and Networks","review":"An excellent book which takes the reader step by step into the details of communication technologies, gradually tracing their evolution. A must for professionals as well as the novice."},{"Title":"Communications Systems and Networks","review":"Communications Systems and Networks is a unique guide through a wide spectrum of complex technology. Horak's strength is his ability to clearly present the information in a way that is easily applied in terms of meaningful and cost-effective applications. If you are new to telecommunications or data communications or if you have years of experience, you will find Communications Systems and Networks a necessary addition to your library."},{"Title":"Communications Systems and Networks","review":"This book is excellent reading for most every skill level in telecommunications. If you are starting out, it will help you with a basic telecommunications foundation. The book is easy to read and written in a way you can actually understand it. Even if you are more advanced in your understanding of the subject matter, you will certainly still learn something from it, besides it is an indespensable reference."},{"Title":"Communications Systems and Networks","review":"This is one of the best references I have ever seen for background information on a wide range of network technologies. Every term you could hope for is found somewhere in the book, along with a consise and informative description. There is no fluff in this book--every page is compacted with valuable information. I recommend it for anybody who has had at least some small amount of experience with networking and would like a general reference book for nearly every network technology you will ever need to research."},{"Title":"Communications Systems and Networks","review":"After reading several terrific reviews of Communications Systems &amp; Networks, I purchase a copy, which I read from cover to cover. The reviewers were absolutely correct--without a doubt, it is the best book of its sort. Horak covers the full range of communications systems and network technologies--from voice to data to video--in a thoroughly understandable fashion. Compared with other books--all of which cover narrower ranges of subject matter, and in all too technical a fashion, and at twice the price--this book is a bargain!"},{"Title":"Communications Systems and Networks","review":"This text is not all bad, but the numerous typos and factual errors earn it a low mark. For example the author states that IPv4 does not support multicast (it does), that the format's 32 bits &quot;will serve addressing needs into the next century&quot; (p. 379). The Internet chapter is very bad.The writing style itself is often unclear, and one gets the strong impression that several chapters were rushed without adequate proofreading. A typical sentence: &quot;In the highly-competitive Frame Relay market, mesh networking that can be accomplished at costs which can be as little as 50% of the cost of a comparable FT-1 network.&quot; (p. 292).I could go on and on, but you should get the idea. If a future edition fixes the numerous problems, then this book may become a decent intro. In the mean time, look elsewhere, possibly to one of the standard texts like Stalling's &quot;Data &amp; Computer Communications&quot; or Bates' &quot;Voice and Data Communications Handbook&quot;."},{"Title":"Communications Systems and Networks","review":"Excellence!Mr. Horak has created a centeralized &quot;information foundation&quot; for all aspects of the communications envirnomnet into one book. This well written, easy to understand wealth of information has proven to be an invaluable tool for both communications rookies and veterans.Looking forward to a possible third edition."},{"Title":"Communications Systems and Networks","review":"What do electonic commerce, tele-medecine, PCS phones, and the Internet have in common? Aside from being words and phrases that don't appear in most older dictionaries, they are all part of the exploding information technology industry. The Department of Commerce recently announced that this industry alone is responsible for a doubling of the growth rate of the U.S. economy. In fact information technology accounts for more than 8% of the economy, and employs more than 7 million workers. The next generation Internet recently announced by Vice President Gore, and the ongoing struggle by major long distance providers to break into the local telephone market, are just two examples of the huge economic and societal impacts this industry has on everyday life.Complex and fascinating, the technology behind the on-going information revolution can be overwhelming at first glance (and at second and third glances as well). Standard reference guides are of little use to the novice in this field, as by necessity these guides presuppose a broad knowledge base encompassing electrical engineering, network engineering, and computer science. What is needed is a single source which walks the engineering generalist through the basic science, and then applies that science to specific technological applications. Fortunately (from the point of view of this particular novice) this need was recognized and addressed by Ray Horak and Mark Miller in &quot;Communications Systems and Networks: Voice, Data, &amp; Broadcast Technologies&quot;Horak and Miller do a superb job of defining the applicable scientific principles - starting with a discussion of analog vs digital - and then integrating those principles into a straightforward, highly readable description of both current and emerging technologies. Taking the reader from an overview of the voice communications system all the way to a discussion of emerging broadband technologies and applications, the authors seemlessly build on material previously presented. The final chapters, focusing on the convergence of technologies and applications, provide both a summation of earlier material and a road map of where we go from here given virtually unlimited bandwidth, universal access, and significant deregulation.This book is not just for the student or other newcomer to the field. It is a valuable resource for even the experienced engineer, and provides a great review of the basic technologies we deal with daily. The Department of Commerce estimates that an additional 1.3 million information technology positions will be created in the next few years. All 1.3 million of the folks who fill these positions need to get a copy of this book. They (and the authors and their publisher) will be glad they did."},{"Title":"Communications Systems and Networks","review":"There are many telecom books around that try cover as much as topics as possible, this one is no different.Main advantage of Ray Horak's book is it simplicity, it is very easy to read and understand and organization of the overall text is also quite good. Book also covers fairly large portion of today's telecom world, although, due to the sheer size of the subject, it is lacking in details.I'd recommend this book for junior (very junior) students or for new-commers in the field.On the other hand, european engineers should try to avoid this book due its US-centrism. Author mostly ignores European systems or provides very shallow and short reference.To finalize, good book, but don't ecpect it to make you an expert in the field."},{"Title":"Communications Systems and Networks","review":"Although this book has a ton of great information, personally, I found it hard to follow. It was confusing and the length of the chapters were a little overwhelming. I had this book for a class and ended up using the internet rather than the book to do my work. I have taken a very basic networking class in the past and the book was laid out MUCH better and was much easier to understand. I wouldn't suggest this to someone who knows little to nothing about networking unless they want to invest a lot of time reading and re-reading to fully understand."},{"Title":"Communications Systems and Networks","review":"This book is not for beginners. If you are looking for a really good beginner's book for non-techies, Annabel Dodd's 'The Essential Guide to Telecommunications' would be a good start for you. This book assumes a fair bit of knowledge on the part of the reader and is loaded with a lot of technical language, but if you are even a little comfortable with the telecom language, there's a great deal to be learned from this book.Two things I really like about this book. First, the material is very up-to-date. In one chapter, Horak explains various 'flavors' of DSL very well--differences in how they are provisioned. He also spends a lot of time covering LAN and data networks, which is great considering most telecom traffic will eventually be data (not voice). Second, the diagrams showing how the networking equipment work and connect with each other is very helpful, especially for a guy like me with a non-engineering background.I usually don't use the term 'gripping' to describe a technical book, but Horak's book is just that because I get hungry to learn more about how the whole telecommunications-network-thing works. Perfect to use in defense against those engineers who have looked down on the liberal arts grads for our ignorance of technology!"},{"Title":"Communications Systems and Networks","review":"As a switch software developer for many years, I have developed a deep understanding of small corners of switch features, but lacked a good overall knowledge of network architecture. Thank you, Ray, for providing me with the system overview essential for the systems engineering job that I have recently assumed. This is a comprehensive overview of modern communications networks (with interesting brief histories - a nice touch for good readability) aimed at a person with some telecom experience, but like me, with an incomplete background. This book has very nicely filled in knowledge gaps with a great overview of the technologies involved in today's networks. Some of this was familiar, and the rest I knew only in vague generalities. I have been recommending it to others in the field as a good reference. My only complaint is that it is large and cumbersome, so does not travel well. A CD-ROM version would be a very nice handy reference while on my frequent road trips. And he takes his solicitation for input, as stated in the foreword, very seriously.I think the level of detail is just right, as it gives me enough background to follow technical discussions and ask intelligent questions."},{"Title":"Communications Systems and Networks","review":"When Ray sent me a copy of the new Second edition of &quot;Communications Systems &amp; Networks&quot; I was expecting a good update of the 1996 first edition. Instead Ray has produced an almost entirely new text, and he's done a simply OUTSTANDING job.Ray is the editor of Newton's Telecom Dictionary, and this book makes an excellent companion text to that great classic. Those of you who read my reviews know that I give free copies of that text to every student who attends my TrainingCity.com classes. If you bought Newton's Telecom Dictionary, buy this book, you won't ever regret it.Ray uses his experience editing &quot;Newton's&quot; throughout &quot;Communications Systems and Networks.&quot; Every term is explained clearly and concisely. Reading through this book I was continually amazed at how well Ray can explain complex concepts, and get ALL the relevant information into so few paragraphs.In conclusion, I believe this is an instant classic, and a must have for any Voice &amp; Data library."},{"Title":"Communications Systems and Networks","review":"Let me start off by saying that I am not a network/telephony person. I have no background in it and I have very little work experience in that arena. Thus, I was looking for a book that would teach me the fundamentals of how telecom networks are structured in a clear and simple manner, but also deal with advanced topics. I was disappointed in this book because the author assumed a great deal of prior knowledge. The text was littered with acronyms and terminology from the very beginning, making it hard to follow. Also, the progression of the chapters did not make much sense to me. A person with a baseline familiarity of telecoms may have an easier time with the text. Also, I found the writing style difficult to follow. The text was very dry and the paragraphs seemed to jump around a lot; there was not a clear flow of ideas. If you're a total beginner, I wouldn't recommend this book. If you're familiar with telephony and want a deeper understanding, this might be a good choice."},{"Title":"Communications Systems and Networks","review":"Here is a primer on the whole spectrum of telecommunications with a special emphasis on networks. Even without knowing much of the details about these fields, most of us realize that the proliferation of broadband networks has brought about new opportunities for convergence in communications. This compendium of communications technologies and trends is an indispensable resource for those in the business of implementing this popular vision.Well organized and comprehensible, even to those of us who are still running to catch the train, the chapters are organized to be read in sequence, each chapter building upon those preceding. The author brings a helpful historical perspective into his coverage of each subject a well as a consultant's-eye view of the latest (c. 2000) industry developments. The reward of plowing through this tome is that the reader gains an essential foundation enabling her to comprehend current discussions of communications systems.If you are looking for a communications systems reference to understand the occasional cryptic technical term, you may want to try Mr. Horack's other book, &quot;Newton's Telecom Dictionary&quot;. On the other hand, if you have time to read and need a more thorough understanding of terms and their entire context, you would do well with &quot;Communications Systems and Networks&quot;."},{"Title":"Communications Systems and Networks","review":"A must read for all existing and aspiring Networking/Telecommunications professionals!

Dickens is so superior to any formula based authors of today."},{"Title":"The story of a Confederate boy in the Civil War","review":"This book is by my GGGrandfather. It is a story by a gentleman in his later years, recalling how as a young man he signed up to fight for the fledgeling Confederacy. It tells of his eagerness to &quot;do the right thing&quot; without any great in-depth political reasoning. Here's a 17 year old young man that see's what he believes is his duty and how he go's about it. The story of how a unit was formed locally, how the officers and NCO's were elected, not appointed, is fascinating. The descriptions of the battles are excellent. The method the author uses to switch from the personal to the &quot;distant observer&quot; is quite good.Overall the book is an excellent treatise on a &quot;common&quot; soldier in the Confederate army. The only complaint I've heard from anyone, including my grandmother (the author's granddaughter) is that David is a bit longwinded from time to time...The book is excellent and easily the most fun to read of the books he wrote!"},{"Title":"The story of a Confederate boy in the Civil War","review":"If your interests are historical, specifically in the area of America's deadliest conflict..the War between the States, then this is a must read.Written in 1912 and rewritten in the 1970's this book gives a rare, non-sensationalized view of the war. Particularly poignant is the closing chapter in which the author relates the feelings of the combantants, about each other. A octogenarian friend loaned me the book. I liked so well I went to Amazon and purchased a copy."},{"Title":"What Is a Family?","review":"This is an inspiring and wonderful book. Edith Schaeffer makes the reader love and appreciate the importance of family. It is a unique perspective. Each chapter decribes the family in a different way. For example, there is a chapter called, &quot;A museum of memories,&quot; which explains the importance of making happy memories for your children and some ideas on how to do it. Another chapter is called, &quot;A perpetual relay of truth.&quot; The chapter, &quot;A shelter in a time of storm,&quot; makes one feel honored to be caring for a sick or needy family member. She has other chapters defining the family in other ways, including a place of education, an economic unit, etc. On the days I had time to read even just a bit of this book, I went about my tasks as a wife and mother joyfully and with contentment."},{"Title":"What Is a Family?","review":"Everyone who cares about having a wonderful family life should read this book. It is packed with great ideas to enhance every moment of each other's lives - even when someone is sick. Mrs. Shaeffer is very open in describing their family and how they made things special but not to the point of making their life seem perfect. One of her best chapters is about creating a &quot;Museum of Memories&quot; by choosing to create positive memories instead of just plowing through one more day. I highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"What Is a Family?","review":"This book is excellent! The author uses incredible imagery to exemplify her points.

Almost all treat their subject as intelligent, but lazy, at best, feckless and disloyal at worst. Belloc takes the unique view that Charles had a strong and well developed set of principles that were reasonably adapted to a free and just society, but which were irreconcilable with the nouveau riche elements of his economy. This treatment was quite reasonable and fairly convincing, but most of all made good reading. As with much of Belloc's work, there is a strong institutional Roman Catholic orientation. Belloc does downplay the licentiousness of the Restoration Court in general and its monarch in particular, but those details can be readily found elsewhere."},{"Title":"Charles II;: The last rally,","review":"Hilaire Belloc penned this biography of Charles II very late in his life--1939, only a handful of years before the stoke that incapacitated him. Belloc was still flourishing as a writer thought his work is more an extended essay on the course of history, as seen through the life of Charles II, instead of as a proper biography.Belloc does not bother to hide his biases-he is a Catholic, a foe of the Whig historians and a partisan of the Stuarts. Not surprisingly, he treats the king's younger brother (who would become James II and was already the subject of a Belloc biography) well and he even has kind words for the likes of Cromwell and Milton. Belloc often condemns but also tries to rationalize the rather....sordid personal life of Charles which does seem a bit out of place for the Catholic writer and those parts rank as some of the weaker aspects of the book. This is a minor flaw and can be overlooked with no problem.Be warned--Belloc is a writer and not a would be tenured bureaucrat looking to move up from adjunct to assistant to associate. While this means there are no footnotes, on the positive side Belloc actually writes to instruct, to entertain and to be read--not to impress a dissertation committee and bore legions of indentured servants...er, grad students...in the future.There is an excellent introduction by Dr. John McCarthy. Belloc keeps arguing in the book that this is a sequel to his take on Louis XIV and it would be nice if IHS printed that work (as well as the aforementioned one on James II). Some of the editing seems a little off with strange errors (\\"bat\\" instead of \\"but\\" for example). Readers--especially those agreeing with Belloc--will enjoy the work but it is very useful and, best of all, accessible."},{"Title":"Charles II;: The last rally,","review":"Hilaire Belloc is truly without peer as a historian. His works are beautiful and riveting. One has the feeling in reading Belloc of having a long and deep conversation with an old and extremely wise friend. The mood of the discourse is intoxicating, and we don't want the interlude to end. But end it does, the good news being we can always find more of this prolific and insightful author to peruse.In Charles II, Belloc tells the story of the restoration of the Stuart monarchy after the Cromwellian \\"Commonwealth\\". We heartily recommend reading Belloc's \\"Cromwell\\" first and then this excellent work. Simply by reading the last chapter of each respective work, the reader will grasp firmly one of the great truths that Belloc imparts, what it is to die in an unrepentent state, that of Cromwell, and what it is to leave this Earth, being reconciled in the Eucharist, as Charles II finally was. The story of the good English Priest who both introduced Charles to the Catholic faith, once saved his life, and finally gave his last rites, is far more powerful than any dramatic fiction I have ever read. His brother James, later to be James II of England, perfectly sums up this scene in saying,\\"The man who saved your life has come to save your soul.\\"This is wonderful. Read it. And be richly blessed."},{"Title":"ICE AGE EXPLORER (Time Machine)","review":"First, the author is the great Dougal Dixon. Second it is about the ice age and prehistoric man, which are both subjects I enjoy. Third, the plot happens to be interesting - your character has to find out what a certain one-horned animal found in cave paintings were - was it really a unicorn?I took a point away only because of the idea that Neanderthals were cannibals! I happen to think that, even in 1985 when the book was published, that idea was already being dismissed."},{"Title":"For a Night of Love (Hesperus Classics)","review":"Emile Zola is primarily known for his novels. Only one English language collection of Zola's short stories has been available prior to the publication of FOR A NIGHT OF LOVE. Ths is a set of 16 stories published by Oxford University Press under the title The Attack On The Mill And Other Stories.This current collection brings together three stories that the editors claim have never before been published in English. All three have a romantic theme.The first, For A Night Of Love, tells the story of a shy young postal worker who falls in love with his beautiful, rich, and haughty neighbor. She ignores him until one night when she needs his help. The story tells how far he will go for a night of love.The second tale is of a young man, Nantas, who comes to Paris to make his fortune and falls in love with his landlord's daughter. She needs a favor from him, but disdains his love. He goes to extraordinary lengths to win her love, but will he succeed?These two stories of male desire are followed by Fasting, a story in which Zola takes one of his pokes at the Catholic clergy. It portrays a rich woman's sexual daydreams as she sits in church listening to a sermon on fasting given by a gourmet priest .All three stories are excellent at portraying 19th Century France and the people of this time. It is our good fortune that these three are now available in the English language. The Foreward gives some insight into Zola's writings and the Introduction some background on the stories. A good collection of stories from one of France's greatest writiers."},{"Title":"For a Night of Love (Hesperus Classics)","review":"This translation is not new; it's a copy of an early 20th century translation that is archaic and not a translation at all so much as a transliteration. Just \\"Look Inside\\" at the first page of text: the awkward syntax and poor grammar that only a crude translation could render. Zola was the ultimate stylist and if you think this poor version is what he intended, you don't know French lit very well. This publisher is not what it purports to be."},{"Title":"Manet (The New Grosset Art Library, 12)","review":"Edouard Manet (not to be confused with Monet!), needless to say, is a major French artist. This little volume, authored by Sandra Orienti, provides a fine introduction to this artist. The book begins with a discussion of his life (he was born in 1832 in Paris) to his death in 1883, as he was still working on a painting. Then, a discussion of his works. A comment by Degas after Manet's funeral says much (Page 7): \\"He was greater than we ever thought.\\"Manet rejected convention, and this created problems for him, especially earlier in his career, although he faced challenges throughout his entire life. Some would simply not accept his artistic products. He moved away from the conventional artistic form of the time and developed an alternative form. Again, the author notes (Page 7): \\"His so-called realism is an obvious trap, appearing as it does to re-incarnate Courbet and his circle; in fact, this realism springs from his free interpretation of visible objects and his desire to transcend the outward appearance of the object in order to possess it completely. . . .\\" Even though he rebelled against norms and did not conquer the art world, he did have powerful allies, including his friend Charles Baudelaire. And while he was supportive of impressionists, he was not himself an impressionist (although one can see some elements of impressionism in his later works here and there).In the late 1870s, a disease that affected his extremities made painting much more difficult, and he moved to other media (pencil and pastels) that could accommodate his declining physical powers.Toward the end of his life, he did display some bitterness toward the lack of recognition of the art world for his work. While he did have his supporters (as already noted), he certainly did not conquer the art world. Indeed, he had disappointing shows in the United States, where his work also did not receive great approbation.The final couple pages of text provide information about art critics' views of Manet.But one of the neatest features of this book is the color reproductions of some of his key works, from works appearing in 1858-1859 to late works completed in 1882-1883. It is especially interesting to follow the evolution of his style from early to late. I am hardly an expert in art, but I find it most enlightening to trace the trajectory of his career through his paintings."},{"Title":"The scapegoat","review":"This is a gripping novel that depicts the solitary life of a young boy visiting his Uncle's farm. Gradually the events conspire to bring the reader to a rapture of demonic desire culminating in a tragic ending. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The scapegoat","review":"This book is dumb. I hated it. Please do not read it unless you enjoy falling asleep in the middle of the day. I'd rather watch 20 episodes of &quot;Charles in Charge&quot; in a row than read even so much as the cover again."},{"Title":"The Art of Uncontrolled Flight: A Novel","review":"The cover of Kim Ponders's debut novel shows a little girl, arms outstretched, chasing a model airplane that flies just outside her grasp. The image is strong but not particularly original; indeed, it seems almost obvious and perhaps a bit clich&eacute;d --- a girl chases a dream, the memories of her mother and the truths her father hides from her, all symbolized by the gliding, soaring, elusive object. It's a lovely image, but its sweet and simple symbolism does not do justice to the complexity of Ponders's themes and the stark unsentimentality of her prose.THE ART OF UNCONTROLLED FLIGHT is Annie's story. It begins when she is six years old, watching her mother emotionally disintegrate as they wait for her father's intermittent and brief returns from his service in the Air Force. And while cameo appearances by Annie's father only strengthen her adoration for him, they drive her mother slowly mad, to the point where she can no longer survive the perpetual state of emotional and physical limbo he has left her in. After her mother's death, Annie and her father bounce from town to town, woman to woman, family to family, and Annie's young adulthood is marked by perpetual movement. Her father may have left the Air Force but he remained always on the verge of takeoff.Annie's character is marked by a core determination and a sense of resolve. Her steely nature and adoration of her father lead her to pursue a career as a fighter pilot where she matter-of-factly suppresses any remnants of femininity in order to succeed.It is in the descriptions of Annie's military training, her relationships with her fellow pilots and the one event that almost destroys her that the novel itself really takes off. Annie's reflections on war and fear, on courage and sexuality, are distinctive and refreshing; her steely courage and unsentimentality mark her as an atypical brand of female narrator.Despite the novel's pretense to be a work of fiction, a quick scan of Ponders's bio reveals her own aviary and military history; we as readers can only imagine that much of Annie's vividness, the way she leaps off the page, is a testament both to the author's skill and to her very personal connection to Annie's military and emotional struggles. But the narrative appeals of the book are also due to Ponders's technical skill as a writer. The novel is short and spare, but never feels incomplete; despite her brisk and unsentimental narrative tone, Annie is a fully-drawn and compelling character. Through her penetrating, un-shirking gaze, we see both familiar themes of family and sexuality, guilt and past, as well as the unfamiliar themes of the early-'90s Middle Eastern conflict and the role of women in the Air Force. Finally, the novel itself is tightly woven, marked by moments of startling lyricism and lovely thematic symmetry.THE ART OF UNCONTROLLED FLIGHT begins and ends with an act of flight --- one unexpected and desperate, the other planned and prepared; one driven by anger, the other by love; both marked by the strange incongruous freedom of soaring into the unknown.--- Reviewed by Jennifer Krieger"},{"Title":"The Art of Uncontrolled Flight: A Novel","review":"On the surface, The Art of Uncontrolled Flight by Kim Ponders is the story of Annie, who grows up in a military family and goes on to pilot a fighter jet during the Gulf War. The power of this book, though, is in the underlying stories that Ponders weaves into the book. The relationships Annie has with the men in her life -- her father, her husband, and her fellow Air Force officers as well as the relationships she has with women - her mother and her father's girlfriends - make this story. The focus Ponders places on Annie's thoughts and feelings adds emotional depth to the story.The book is divided into three sections. The first section begins with Annie as a child and moves back and forth between her childhood and the present. The transitions from childhood to adulthood are smooth and realistic - an event in the present brings back a memory from the past. This first section lays the groundwork for understanding the choices Annie makes as an adult.The second section takes place during Annie's deployment during the Gulf War. Central to this section of the book is Annie's relationship with a fellow pilot, Jago. Annie's childhood experiences and relationships provide the reader with an understanding of the choices she makes during this period in her life. The final section is about Annie's life after the Gulf War.The Art of Uncontrolled Flight is an exciting, memorable read! I didn't want to put this book down. Ponders deftly moves between Annie's emotions and the events that shaped her and the choices she makes. I felt like I knew and understood Annie by the end of this book. The story is gripping and the ending is perfect."},{"Title":"The Art of Uncontrolled Flight: A Novel","review":"The details of military life are shared in a unique way, from a primarily female perspective, mixing snippets of death and devastation with love and passion. Ponders' writing is rich and textured. It demands a stong mind to read and makes no excuses. It was great to have a book ask for something back from the reader."},{"Title":"The Art of Uncontrolled Flight: A Novel","review":"Annie Shaw has always wanted to emulate her father. A pilot in the Vietnam War and an Air force Veteran, he was a formidable personality, controlling Annie's life from a young age, often cold and emotionally distant, but always full of love and respect for his daughter. As a little girl, Annie decides that there's nothing she'd rather do than become a pilot, just like the man she so admires; she seems born to fly and would much rather eavesdrop on war stories than pass hors d\`oeuvres at her parents\` cocktail parties.Annie's father is also a bit of a philanderer, \\"her mother cried often for him to come home, and when he was home, she screamed at him to leave,\\" his occasional infidelities perhaps responsible for her mother's untimely death. When a terrible house fire takes her life, Annie and her father become transients, living with a succession of his mistresses and wives, following her father into the houses of women he takes up with until he gets bored and then abandons them.Annie freely admits that she listens for her father, \\"I was my father either way.\\" All she wanted was to join with him even in spirit, and she still believed at a point in her life, by working hard enough to crack the code of shapes and numbers in his path, that she would. Of course, Annie achieves her childhood dream, and becomes an aviator in her own right, partly because she seeks her father's approval, but also because she has an ineffable urge to feel distance between herself and the rest of the world thirty thousand feet below.After Annie becomes a pilot, she volunteers for any new place - Izmir, Dhahran, the Azores. She'd always be gone, gone before Dexter, her husband could stop and ask her or even ask why. She thinks she's going to catch her father, but she ends up forming a friendship with Jago, a fellow pilot. Jago is convinced they are living history; he's young and tantalized by glory, but her ill-fated romance with him threatens to bring Annie's personal and professional lives to a collision point.When Iraq invades Kuwait, Annie finds that she is deployed to Saudi Arabia, waiting for the Gulf War to begin. A tough, and independent woman, Annie holds her own inside the elite, male-dominated alliance of flying. Some of her fellow pilots want her to succeed, and some want her to fail, \\"but everybody looks at her as a woman first.\\" Her life at the flying Academy was not so different from anywhere else, except that the expectations there were constant and clear.While her father thought she would fail, Annie becomes weirdly enchanted with schedules, and with details, seeing how they could be used to an advantage, demonstrating competence, and filling the vacancies left by an ambivalent heart. When a critical error places her crew at risk, Annie learns that flying in wartime carries a shadow far greater than the mystique it held for her when she was a child.Annie believes that the love of flying was like any other love affair, with its raw beginning, \\"when the feel of an airplane's controls is enough to keep the pilot awake at night, when he learns the planes strengths and weaknesses and he begins to love them.\\" This tale of uncontrolled flight is contextually rich, constantly jumping backwards and forwards in time, layered with the weight and scope of a life of a young and independent woman who is determined to make the most of her world.Drawing on her experiences as a female combat pilot, author Kim Ponders, paints an exquisite portrait of the tough, disciplined world of military flight. Essentially a story about the lives of women, love, loss and one's place in the world, like the aircraft that she pilot's, Annie lifts into fluid air, moving towards the promise of some vague destination, always wanting something beyond her grasp. It is only through her affair with Jago, that Annie discovers a sort of \\"symphony of flight,\\" in which the mind movies two steps ahead of the hands, in concert with another pilot.

It is a clean portrait of a young woman who is taught by her parents early in life the fine art of emotional escape and who's chosen her own way out into the air of a combat zone. Ponders writing is clean and touching. She captures flight from the pilot seat in all its details and emotions. She also hints at how war might make us become bolder, truer versions of ourselves. This was a beautifully written and thankfully unsentimental debut novel. I recommend it to all who love great writing."},{"Title":"The Art of Uncontrolled Flight: A Novel","review":"This was a disappointment. It got off a to a pleasant start with the first chapter being told in first person as heroine looks back at some of her childhood, but the second chapter suddenly switches to third person. From that point on it was downhill. It switches time zones from paragraph to paragraph at moments. On one page she is married and about to deploy in 1990 and then suddenly a page later she is back to 1970 and her mother is crying over her cheating father and then yet a page later she is in late 80s with a bunch of Kennedy look alikes. The novel continues in this back and forth manner and grew too confusing for me. I spent too much time trying figure out what year and situation it was and who are these people again and the story was lost to me. I have to say tho, it was way too much about her mother and emotions and marriage and too little about the Air Force and flying. Perhaps more flying, less crying, and a better time sequence would work.A book to take a good look at isThe Four Corners of the Sky: A Novel.. similar cover I know, but different story."},{"Title":"The Art of Uncontrolled Flight: A Novel","review":"Years later, a man named Malone, decided to write a book about a girl named Annie.

This brief, but fun book gives a nice insight into the development of the H2, and outlines (for the first time I've ever read), the brilliant deal that brought GM and Humvee together to create and market the lastest designer wheels.The GM/AM General (AM is the firm that produced the original Humvee) deal, which combined the branding and economic power of GM with the uniqueness and techincal genius of the Humvee team allowed both parties to get exactly what they wanted, and brought the H2 to the general public far quicker than either one on their own could have. The development and launching of the H2 should be required reading for both engineering and marketing students.The story falls a bit as it tries to categorize the H2 driver into one of two classes, and makes a few too many generalizations as to market appeal.There are some great photos, and some interesting development stories about future Hummer/GM vehicles (2 more are scheduled to hit the market by 2010)"},{"Title":"Hummer H2 (ColorTech)","review":"My husband seems to be obsessed with any hummer book, think he knows ever part in them, it's been well read."},{"Title":"Hummer H2 (ColorTech)","review":"ok i would like to start out with complimenting the author and illustrators of this book they did a outstanding job. thank you for doing such a great job"},{"Title":"The light of Asia: Or, The great renunciation (Mahabhinishkramana) ; being the life and teaching of Gautama, prince of India and founder of Buddhism (as told in verse by an Indian Buddhist)","review":"I find it so sad that so few people have read or reviewed this masterpiece.

The lines of Arnold's poem overflow with luminescent imagery, painting a vivid portrait of ancient India.Edwin Arnold arrived in India in 1856, in a period when very little was known about the spiritual traditions of the East, let alone the teachings of the Buddha. It is clear that Arnold fell in love with the majestic culture of India, a love which led him to learn Pali and Sanskrit. The Light of Asia was written, in his own words, \\"in the brief intervals of days without leisure.\\"The Light of Asia truly stands alone. Arnold has let the story of the Buddha fill his heart, and his re-telling has its own particular charms and beauty. His portrait of the Buddha is one of perfect love, perfect compassion, and perfect wisdom--his Buddha is a world-redeemer. Even the stoical rocks are moved by his birth.The Light of Asia invites us into Arnold's romance with a world still veiled in mystery. More than that, it invites us into the spirit of the Prince Gautama. Take the moment of Siddhartha's departure from his wife and child--for many, this moment could seem selfish or callous. In Arnold's rendition, it is a moment of infinite compassion, a moment where even perfect filial love and domestic bliss cannot conceal the truth of suffering. Arnold's Prince does not turn away from the highest worldly contentment in search of some yet-greater divine pleasure, but out of sympathy for the whole of humanity. If even love falls prey to death, we must seek out some greater gift for those we love. We must seek the deathless.But if this were all Arnold's poem captured, we would still be left dangling. The Buddha's enlightenment is described by Arnold as rapture. As the Buddha awakens, the whole world rejoices. The trees begin to dance, the birds go into a frenzy, and across India men and women can feel it: something has happened. The unfulfilled has been fulfilled, the seeker has found the sought, the world has been infused by the beyond.The Light of Asia is also relevant from a historical perspective. It captures something rare: an early treatment of Eastern philosophy by a Western scholar which is not merely respectful and well-learned, but a genuine soul communion. This reveals a high degree of courage, a courage which globalization demands of all of us.The dance between East and West continues, and every day the lines become a bit more blurred. As we come into closer contact with new cultures and traditions, may we find inspiration in the enchantment and respect which Arnold felt so deeply for India. May we all find wisdom wherever it appears. May wisdom be the balm for the world's wounds, and the fire to kindle the hearts of all peace-seekers."},{"Title":"The light of Asia: Or, The great renunciation (Mahabhinishkramana) ; being the life and teaching of Gautama, prince of India and founder of Buddhism (as told in verse by an Indian Buddhist)","review":"WHO THWARTS IT LOSES, AND WHO SERVES IT GAINS.THE HIDDEN GOOD IT PAYS WITH BLISS,THE HIDDEN ILL WITH PAINS.SIR EDWIN ARNOLD, \\"LIGHT OF ASIA\\""},{"Title":"The light of Asia: Or, The great renunciation (Mahabhinishkramana) ; being the life and teaching of Gautama, prince of India and founder of Buddhism (as told in verse by an Indian Buddhist)","review":"It was a fair printing of this book but the free version on the internet was much easier to read and comprehend at UrbanDharma.org."},{"Title":"New Tales of the Vampires: includes Pandora and Vittorio the Vampire","review":"Anne Rice started off with the tales of Louis and Lestat, but eventually branched out to include the \\"New Tales of the Vampires,\\" stories about minor vampires who have their own stories to tell. Sadly, while \\"Pandora\\" is a decent vampire tale, \\"Vittorio\\" is an unfortunate stumble.\\"Pandora\\" is given a journal to tell her story in -- and it's a wild tale. Reluctantly telling her story to new vampire David Talbot (a \\"chronicler\\" of vampire tales), Pandora describes her early life: a pampered Roman girl, who fled the destruction of her family. In Antioch she is saved by the ancient vampire Marius, who turns her into a vampire.\\"Vittorio\\" is a heretofore unknown vampire: a beautiful, wealthy teenager living in Renaissance Italy, the middle of art and beauty in the 15th century. But when Vittorio's family is murdered by vampires, he alone is spared to become one of the undead, and the lover of beautiful vamp (in more than one sense) Ursula. But he tears away from her, and finds that vampires are not the only ones who can create horrors...Anne Rice's more recent works suffer in comparison to her early Vampire Chronicles, and the \\"New Tales of the Vampires\\" fall victim to that. Taken alone, they're not half bad. \\"Pandora\\" is undoubtedly the stronger tale, with its more intelligent storyline and lesser focus on angst and religion (religion in books can be a good thing, but Rice smothers \\"Vittorio\\" in it). And at the end of the day, the books feel... like filler, something to hold over the fans.Her writing is unquestionably beautiful -- Rice's prose is as rich and deep as fine velvet. And \\"Pandora\\" moves along at a slow but steady clip, well-written and apparently well-thought out; the only problem is that Rice could have expanded the book into a sprawling horror/historical drama... and didn't. \\"Vittorio\\" makes up for its lack of plot by being almost absurdly overwrought at times.Anne Rice's books tend to focus more on men than on women, which makes Pandora all the more appealing -- she's strong, witty and intelligent. That also makes Vittorio all the more wimpy. Old characters like Marius pop up in \\"Pandora,\\" making welcome appearances. But \\"Vittorio\\" has... nobody we already know.

I was initially excited to learn that Lee has written over 80 novels and counting, but a couple years and numerous Lee novels later, I've found she's written easily half as much dross as real works of genius.I picked up The Wars of Vis duology hoping it would be the latter, hyped up to read a good, thick royal intrigue ancient world fantasy. I'm beginning to think Tanith Lee can't write a decent ancient world fantasy, because I'm about 130 pages in and the story feels real flat to me. I don't know what it is. Is it the writing? No, can't be, Tanith Lee is capable of some powerful imagery. Is it the subject matter? No, I love mythology and fantasies set in ancient times.Is it the fact that the women are (as per usual in ancient world fantasies) not strong enough to think forthemselves? Yes, there is that (the notable exception being the evil queen Val Mala, though there's not much depth beneath her cruelty.) Val Mala was quite frankly more interesting than our first heroine Ashne'e, who as usual for Tanith-Lee-at-her-worst did nothing but act like a mentally challenged puppet of thosewho pushed her about.Is it the fact that none of the characters show any real personality? Yes...YES! That's definitely it. A lotof lush description, a lot of people, a lot of intrigue, and I don't know who I'm rooting for. The bad guysare vile and the heroes even worse. There's a lot of royal corruption but no emotion to balance it out.Narrated in such a stiff distant impersonal way that I don't really care about anyone. Not to mention themain character (a sword-and-sworcery-with-a-royal-past-destined-to-become-a-hero male) is typical of the genre too. And don't get me started on the violence against women that seems to happen in every chapter without any authorial didactic purpose or repercussion--and our hero has a hand in some of the rape too...In short, then, it's an unholy cross between Flat Earth and Conan the Barbarian. Don't laugh, it's not at allfunny when you're reading the thing. (Well, kind of.) I really had no idea what I was getting into. The Storm Lord was written very early in Tanith Lee's career (70's) when this kind of pulp fiction Sword and Sorcery fantasy was a heady genre all its own. I tend to scoff at fantasy authors who write a genre without at least trying to add anything new to it. Conan theBarbarian? Fine. Make FUN of the convention or...something. Instead we get glorification of the stereotypical unrealistic muscle man, and hey why not, let him have his women too, that's all they're good for anyway, right?I never knew why a lot of magazines' cliche lists have something alone the lines of: \\"Wedon't want to see stories where there's a muscle-and-sword hero who is forced, by natural or supernaturalcircumstances, to rape a woman, even though he really didn't want to, REALLY.\\" Now I do. Please don'ttell me people READ this stuff as standard fantasy fare in the 70's? And that there are reviewers on Amazonwho say it's written in the good old style of fantasy back when fantasies were just diverting stories with no real psychology or intellect behind them. Umm...substance? Maybe college ruined me.Author Robin McKinley writes on her webpage that she wrote her strong-heroine fantasies because she was sick of reading the standard fare in the genre where there were no strong females; I assumed she was talking about Lord of the Rings and the like. I didn't know why she always has this rant in her blog posts (and sometimes in her actual books by way of a joke) about the typical muscle-bound sword-wielding Hercules who carries off the woman whether she wants to or not.I repeat: Now I do.Okay okay...why am I telling you all this? Maybe to spare you so you don't waste your time on trash that reallyisn't entertaining. The book is now out of print and reviews are few and far between. Read the positive ones by all means, read the negative ones, and decide whether you want to expend the time and money tracking this fossil down. Be forewarned, it adds nothing new either to the Sword and Sorcery Pulp Fiction subgenre or to the fantasy genre as a whole, and it is not written in an engaging style that makes you care for the characters."},{"Title":"The 8 and 81: A history of Remington's pioneer autoloading rifles","review":"This book is a must have for the Model 8/81 enthusiast. It's written in an easy to read format and chocked full of details describing every variation of the Model 8 and 81. If you are a collector, novice or otherwise, then this book is an essential tool to help you decode and identify when your Model 8 was made and what variation it is. These are great old rifles with a significant, but little known, role in American firearms history. Designed by the great John Browning it was ahead of it's time. The book gives an overview of the history as well as a historical timeline of the changes that occurred to the rifle through the years. Fantastic book, you can't go wrong."},{"Title":"Spinoza, Liberalism, and the Question of Jewish Identity","review":"So many different threads of Enlightenment thought seem to pass through the writings of Baruch Spinoza, it is perhaps surprising that so few thinkers have given full place to his work in the founding of the modern world. In this volume Steven B. Smith seeks to repair this omission to some extent.Smith is primarily concerned with Spinoza as a founder or architect of the modern liberal polity, but with an ingenious twist: part of this concern is _also_ with what Spinoza had to say on the related question of \\"Jewish identity.\\" The underlying question here is: is it possible to be a Jew, indeed for there to _be_ Judaism, in the context of a liberal social order?I shall not try to summarize Smith's discussion of Spinoza on this important question; suffice it to say that we are treated to enlightening presentations of Spinoza's theology and his \\"secularization\\" of the meaning of Judaism and of the Jewish people, all of it depending on a clear and close reading of the neglected _Theologico-Political Treatise_. For its exposition of Spinoza's thought alone, this volume will be a helpful addition to the library of any student of Spinoza.However, Smith also deals directly with the question I mentioned two paragraphs back, which makes his work highly pertinent on other grounds as well. His answer [p. 205] is that liberalism is indeed \\"the last best hope for Judaism\\" -- the \\"worst solution except for all the alternatives\\" -- but that Judaism and liberalism may not be fully compatible anyway. \\"To the extent that the liberal Enlightenment urges the abolition of [belief in] a particular providence [as reflecting the spiritual core of Judaism and the fundamental Jewish experience at Sinai], it will always be at odds with Judaism.\\"Note Smith's careful phrasing on this point. His closing remark immediately raises the question: _does_ liberalism require the \\"abolition\\" of belief in a \\"particular providence\\"? I do not think it does, and I think Spinoza was mistaken to argue otherwise.But I arrived at this view in part through reflection on Smith's nuanced presentation in this volume. I can only urge other readers interested in these questions to do likewise."},{"Title":"Spinoza, Liberalism, and the Question of Jewish Identity","review":"Overall, Professor Smith wrote a well thought out and well written work. I give him 4 **** rather than 5 to distinguish myself from the other reviewer, and to register a protest against a mild bias, which i found only at the very beginning and end of the book.Smith gives a great summary of Spinoza's Theologico-Political Treatise. He confirms what i have thought/suspected for years, that Spinoza is pretty much at the source of the liberal destruction of Western culture, though of course it is impossible to put all the blame on any one person in such matters.I am especially grateful for how Smith delineates several times the totalitarian potential of Spinoza's political thinking. That is, as he slams religious hierarchies of all sorts (due in part no doubt to how he was ejected from the Amsterdam synagogue, and how Jews were persecuted in Spain), he goes to the opposite extreme and embraces too fondly civil government. I think Edmund Burke and Toqueville showed how society is best if there are mediating institutions between the individual and the national government. I think the French and Russian revolutions are the perfect examplars of what happens when you eliminate [guillotine or shoot] the middlemen.Signs of Smith's bias; as I said, very few. As the first reviewer pointed out, on the very last page, Smith declares the \\"liberal solution\\" [basically, assimilation for Jews] \\"to be the worst solution except for all the alternatives.\\" But are they really Jews if they completely empty out the transcendent meaning of Judaism, except for the admirable social justice political content? I don't think Abraham, Isaac, Jacob or Moses would agree, but what did they know?On pp 1-2, Smith refers to the following. \\"Rise of religious fundamentalism...\\" Already, sets those folks up as bogeymen. \\"...relgious issue seemed to belong to a dark, atavistic past.\\" \\"Seemed\\" to whom? Perhaps to an agnostic/secularist, but not to an objective scholar. \\"...our faith in modernity...\\" Who is \\"our?\\" Does everyone who hangs out with Smith qualify as \\"everyone?\\" Some of us do not have 'faith' in modernity, but do acknowledge that it is the ruling ideology in Western Europe and parts of USA. Finally, Smith summarizes the PTT as \\"should religion rule politics, or should politics rule religion?\\"Why does it have to be either/or? Why can't it be both/and, as it was harmoniously in USA until approximately 1947?Again, excellent book, well worth your time investment."},{"Title":"A Fresh Look at American English: A Weird and Wonderful Language","review":"DELIGHTFUL THROUGHOUTHave your participles been dangling lately in unsightly fashion?

That's not the way the title was intended to be taken, of course, but nevertheless...I first came across Alison McGhee's writing in the form of her acclaimed novel SHADOW BABY - it impressed me so much that I sought out RAINLIGHT, which in no way let me down. When I heard about the release of this, her third novel, I couldn't wait to get my hands on a copy. With this work, anyone thinking that McGhee was a one- or two-hit wonder should be convinced that she's very much for real - and one of the best writers around today.Like her previous two works, this story is set in the Adirondacks - rural upstate New York, small-town America, complete with its fair share of mildly eccentric characters. The eccentricity of McGhee's creations never gets in the way of the story, as it might in the hands of some writers - her people never become caricatures. She is such a gifted writer that the humorous side of them blends effortlessly with the more serious issues that they face - and, as a result, the inhabitants of her fiction are always completely believable, as real as they could possibly be. They feel joy, they experience uncertainty, and they wrestle with the obstacles life throws their way. In this story, as in her other novels, there are no really \`bad' characters - everyone is simply who they are, pure and not-so-simple, and McGhee's portrayal of them in this way accomplishes two things: it allows the reader to more closely identify with the characters, and it keeps the reader from being distracted by a too-easily-seen good-versus-evil set-to. McGhee respects her characters, her story - and her readers - too much to stoop to such techniques, and the result is a treasure of a book.The \`culprit' in this novel is Grief - how to bear it, how to understand it, how to process it, how to lighten its load. The main bearer of grief in this story is one William T. Jones - described by many (and on the jacket flap) as \`the happiest man in upstate New York, a self-proclaimed king of the world who laughed loudly and often'. William T. is blessed with a son whom he loves more than anything, a devoted wife, and his best friend Burl, a quiet, reserved man who knows more about those around him - and in a deeper way - than anyone suspects. William T.'s son is William J. - and this is only confusing for a little while - and is blessed with the gift of music, which he manifests by constructing wind chimes, and by his love of listening to his father's friend Burl (who has perfect pitch) sing in his beautiful Welsh tenor voice.William T.'s world is indeed perfect - until William J. is suddenly and inexplicably stricken with Cogan's syndrome, causing a rapid deterioration of his hearing, to the point of deafness. William J. - and his father and mother - are desperate to understand his condition, and each, in their individual way, devastated by the unfairness of it. William J.'s deafness is followed closely by his death - and it is this greater loss that sets the wheels of William T.'s grief and struggle in motion. He detaches himself so completely from his former life that his wife leaves him as well, compounding his sorrow and confusion.William T. is not alone, however. He has his faithful feline companion, \`Genghis Khan, king of the cats'; his \`flock' (a motley crew of feathered foundling holed up in a barn on his property that stands as if by sheer will alone, on the verge of imminent collapse); and, mainly, his friends. Burl, chief among these, is tortured to understand what William T. is feeling, and aching to help him. William J.'s widow, Sophie (William T. muses repeatedly over the question of whether she is still his daughter-in-law), and Crystal (waitress in a local diner) both love the grieving man in their own way, and are eager to help him as well. This \`conspiracy' of friends is at first invisible to William T. in his sorrow - but as things begin to fall apart for him, and things begin to happen that he can't explain, he begins to realize that he is, indeed, blessed and loved by those around him.The journey William T. Jones takes to this revelation is a moving one - and revealing it here is no spoiler, it's hinted at on the jacket flap. The beauty of this book lies in McGhee's narrative and character development skills. Her method of revealing William T.'s thought processes - the book is told in third person, but centers around him, naturally - is utilized with such delicacy and naturalness that I felt privy to his actual thoughts. Additionally, the voices of the individual characters are so perfect that I accepted them right away as intensely real.In the hands of some writers, returning to the same small hamlet and bringing back several of the same characters from previous books would be hackneyed and clumsy - in McGhee's hands, it's absolutely perfect, and merely adds perspective to the other books. She introduces previously seen characters gently and unhurriedly - it's a definite asset, never a distraction - and does so in such a way that it's not necessary to have read the other two novels in order to appreciate this one. That being said, I can't imagine anyone reading this wonderful book and not wanting to explore the earlier works. If you haven't done so already, you're in for a treat."},{"Title":"Was It Beautiful? : A Novel","review":"I love a book like this. The words move like colored water through the pages. The story unfolds gracefully and the descriptions are gorgeous. The story is simple but the character's emotions are not. The author allows you to enter into this world and for one moment to live in a place where someone you love has died- and the world stops."},{"Title":"Was It Beautiful? : A Novel","review":"I've been a fan of McGhee's soulful writing since I picked up her book Shadow Baby from my local library. In that book, I fell in love with Clara winter, and now I've fallen in love with William T. Jones. McGhee creates a world that my mind never leaves upon finishing her books. It stays with me--a feeling, an image, sometimes a sadness. This is a worth follow-up to Shadow Baby, and I will eagerly await another book from this very talented writer."},{"Title":"Was It Beautiful? : A Novel","review":"This is the third novel from Alison McGhee. Her first two novels (&#65533;Rainlight&#65533;, &#65533;Shadow Baby&#65533;) were quite exceptional and quickly made McGhee one of my favorite authors. &#65533;Was It Beautiful?&#65533; fully deserves to be mentioned with McGhee&#65533;s other novels. It is just as good. The title of the books asks the question: Was It Beautiful? While this is really a question for the protagonist, William T, I believe that the question also fits the novel itself. To answer the question, yes, it was a beautiful novel. Very.McGhee revisits the Sterns community in the Adirondacks Mountains. We get to see Crystal and Johnny (&#65533;Rainlight&#65533;, &#65533;Shadow Baby&#65533;) and see a glimpse of Clara and Tamar Winter (&#65533;Shadow Baby&#65533;). With these characters appearing, it is easy for McGhee to build the very strong sense of place that we get with Sterns. Some of the locales are back. Crystal&#65533;s diner plays a strong role in this novel, and readers of McGhee&#65533;s work are immediately familiar with this world. This time around, we get the story of William T Jones. Everyone calls him William T. William T&#65533;s life used to be pretty good. He had a loving wife, a son, and a job he was proud of. Unfortunately, he didn&#65533;t get the life he thought he had. His son was hit by a train and died. His wife left him. His job, while he was still proud of it, wasn&#65533;t as special as it was when his life was still beautiful.This is how we begin the novel, with a 50 year old man dealing with the grief over his life and his losses. In the hands of a lesser writer, this could be the start for cheap melodrama. In the sure hands of Alison McGhee, we are given a compassionate story about a broken man and how his friends can help begin his healing. We do not have to wonder about the title and if it was beautiful. With a novel by Alison McGhee, we know that it is."},{"Title":"Was It Beautiful? : A Novel","review":"One of the many questions asked in this book is whether there is such a thing as &quot;perfect pitch&quot;. Well, to reverse the order, this book is pitch perfect in its writing.Frankly I was a little scared when I picked it up. The loss of a son just seems like it would be too sad a tale to bear. It is sad, but McGhee manages to convey the deep sadness without overplaying it. There is no melodrama here. The characters are strong and sympathetic. The writing is lyrical.This was a wonderful book, and Ms. McGhee's first novels are now definitely on my &quot;to read&quot; list this summer."},{"Title":"Was It Beautiful? : A Novel","review":"A depressing story of loss and unbearable sadness. William T. a trucker in the Adirondacks loses his only son William J. to the train in front of his own eyes and cannot get through the days without wondering and questioning himself. His wife leaves him (she cannot take the pain of losing her only child) and he loses his job, his cat is killed and his dreams are torn apart.A very sad tale of the unbelievable grief that can strike a parent who loses a child; nature is unquestionably mysterious and William T. who thinks of suicide as an only option is barely making it.This is a story for those who know that life is definitely not all roses and happiness; this is for those who have lived and survived grief.I can only recommend it to people who can take a very sad story without cracking up or putting the book down; this is a story you won't forget it strikes you with all the sadness, the frustration, and the impossible sorrow of those who live from their memories..... Those who can take grief should read this book."},{"Title":"Was It Beautiful? : A Novel","review":"\\"Was It Beautiful?\\" is set in the picturesque Adirondack Mountains and explores one man's struggle with several heartbreaking losses. The novel centers on William T. Jones, a middle-aged dairy-office employee who has everything he wants: a loving wife and son, a good job and an old family farmhouse stocked with animals including his elder eccentric cat, Genghis. The novel's preface foreshadows the downward spiral of Jones' life by quoting from the Holy Bible's Job, \\"Oh that I were as in month's past, as in the days when God preserved me.\\"Alison McGhee's writing style is simple, yet effective; her writing enables the reader to live within Jones' thoughts and empathize with his psychological pain. However, the novel roams in depressive terrain so often that you begin to ache for something uplifting to happen. At one point Jones visits with his just separated wife and thinks, \\"Eliza. Come home. I'll keep the house warm for you. I'll stoke the woodstove as high as it'll go.\\" But Jones says nothing to her; it is this helpless attitude that envelops the novel like a suffocating blanket. McGhee does not accord the reader a breather and for this reason the novel becomes frustrating to read - the sad tempo is so over-the-top that one begins to feel numb like Jones.Page after page Jones is \\"dying from the inside out,\\" like the giant maple trees lining his driveway, as he focuses only on a warm and irretrievable past. Before midway through the novel you may want to place a self-help book into Jones' hands or take him to the nearest therapy session because his coping skills are non-existent. It is not until Jones winds up in the hospital that he begins to open his eyes and appreciate what he still has. Redemption seems to flicker on the horizon towards the end of the novel for Jones, but for some readers it may be too late to save this novel.Bohdan Kot"},{"Title":"Was It Beautiful? : A Novel","review":"The story was slow and not very interesting in the beginning two-thirds of the book.

I was open to some of these ideas, but what struck me as odd were the teachers themselves. Very few seemed to have learned the art of critical thinking, but no matter--their lack of intellectual depth was clearly compensated for by the strength of their belief in their special calling and powers.I wondered about the evolution of these so-called \\"spiritual teachers\\" and their teachings, and I believe I have found in this book a good portion of what I wondered about. Peter Washington delves into the beliefs of the Theosophists, many of which ideas are quite similar to some of the current New Age ideas (such as the teaching of the Ascended Masters). He presents evidence that most of these ideas were made up by Madame Blavatsky herself. After being propounded by Madame, they were eagerly gobbled up by a large number of credulous followers. These followers were so taken with their new spiritual leaders that they refused to believe any evidence that they were being duped by tactics such as staged seances or missives from the Masters materialized out of thin air. They even held their tongues when it came out that those leaders were practicing child abuse. This book is not just a study in the power grabbing that often goes on among professional spiritual teachers, it also digs into the willingness of seekers to turn over their power to these teachers. In that sense it is a rather painful, sad study of human nature, yet written in a way that is sarcastic, and at times wickedly witty. I recommend this book to any reader who considers him/herself to be on a spiritual path, as there are many valuable lessons in it."},{"Title":"MADAME BLAVATSKY'S BABOON: A History of the Mystics, Mediums, and Misfits Who Brought...","review":"To track the spoor of the Western guru from the late nineteenth century onward is the prodigious challenge which Peter Washington gamely accepts. Whether he is the right man for the job is another question. His study's title, Madame Blavatsky's Baboon, signals an unfortunate tendency to reduce issues of psychological, historical and metaphysical complexity to a tract about twisters and duffers. Extrapolating his forgivable disdain for the turquoise track suit of David Icke, he cheerfully deconstructs major progenitors of the New Age: Madame Blavatsky, Annie Besant, Rudolph Steiner, Piotr Ouspensky, Krishnamurti, Aldous Huxley and Gurdjieff; seven at one blow. That Icke is to Krishnamurti as a nail is to requiem goes unremarked.Resta's famous \\"Sphinx\\" photo of Helena Petrovna Blavatsky ensures a splendid book cover. What a woman! Much is to be forgiven a mystic who, apart from owning a stuffed baboon\\"claimed to have ridden bareback in a circus, toured Serbia as a concert pianist, opened an ink factory in Odessa, traded as an importer of ostrich feathers in Paris, and worked as an interior decorator to the Empress Eug&eacute;nie.\\" But forgiveness is not Washington's strong suit. Just a spell of remission from his remorseless subtext &eacute;crasez l'infame would have doubled the value of this ambitious historical study. Almost everyone here is a \\"baddie\\"; it is only a question of degree. Blavatsky's obesity is grotesque, her cigarettes foul, her merits non-existent. Julia Ostrowska (\\"I think she is splendid\\", wrote Katherine Mansfield) is simply \\"a Polish prostitute\\". Young Krishnamurti is a wash-out intellectually, but, in any case, \\"the Oxford of the 1920s was unlikely to accept a black man who had not only been proclaimed the Messiah but also accused of sodomy by his own father\\". Gurdjieff, \\"shocking, disgusting and rude\\", stands for the \\"fascination with barbarism and primitivism which colours the politics of Fascism\\". Such eruptions of authorial bile are disturbing; shades here of Freud's insistence on sexual dogma as a bulwark against \\"the black tide of occultism\\". Theodor Adorno's assault on esotericism (\\"The offal of the phenomenal world becomes, to the sick consciousness, the mundus intelligibilis\\") strikes a similar note of morbid intensity.What links Washington's gal&egrave;re of Western gurus and, in his view, reduces their overlapping endeavours to a baboon-like \\"comedy of passion, power and gullibility\\", is their reliance on a secret brotherhood or Hidden Directorate, tucked away in Central Asia or on some supernal plane. For Mme Blavatsky and Annie Besant, this seems a fair cop. (It would be a fair cop too for Alice Bailey, whose twenty-five books written as an amanuensis of \\"the Tibetan Master Djwhal Khul\\"\\" seem curious omissions from the charge-sheet.) But for Steiner? For Krishnamurti? The link allows the author his forgivable fun and intellectual indignation, but at the price of an entirely false emphasis. What this singular platoon do have in common is that all were fervently concerned, in discrepant ways, with the evolution of consciousness and the transformation of being.And were they all quite the dunderheads implied here? To shuffle off as \\"fearsomely complex\\" Gurdjieff's integrated cosmology (Richard Rees, incidentally, shuffled it off as \\"bewilderingly simple\\") is to miss entirely its sophistication. Whether licensed theologians like it or not, here is an unconsidered by-product of esoteric spirituality which tackles audaciously the \\"ghost in the machine\\" dilemma of Cartesian dualism; bridges the discontinuity between creation and an ultra-transcendent Creator (the \\"Wholly Other\\" of Kierkegaard and Barth); eschews, conversely, the puerilities of interventionist \\"Thought for the Day\\" theism; and reconciles the suffering of sentient beings with God's putative benignity, by denying his omnipotence at the law-constrained periphery of creation (God himself cannot beat the ace of trumps with the two of hearts).Like any tour d'horizon of modern esotericism, this book affords some entertaining cameos. Yet the genre is hardly novel. In the past twenty years, we have had James Webb's scholarly study, The Occult Establishment, Colin Wilson's amiable potboiler, The Occult, Christopher Evans's sardonic Cults of Unreason, not to mention a clutch of profound French texts by Antoine Faivre, Professor of the History of Esoteric and Mystical Trends in Modern and Contemporary Europe, at the Sorbonne. With these, as well as primary biographies, conveniently on tap, Washington lofts the art of synthetic paraphrase to new altitudes. If in these 470 pages there nestles some smidgen of original research, it is well camouflaged. Sportingly enough, the author mentions my own recent biography of Gurdjieff as one \\"to which the present book is much indebted\\". This could explain my recent feeling - almost occult in its intensity - of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu.The Western guru phenomenon does offer many delightful moonbeams from the larger lunacy; it is palpably a sector where dereliction of intellectual vigilance is commonplace and perfectly fair game. But such lunacy and dereliction are also commonplace in politics, consumerism and institutional religion. Even Voltaire nods: A.R. Orage edited the New Age, not the Little Review; Sufis do not \\"combine the roles of priest, magician and teacher\\"; Ernst Haeckel was not an Australian; Gurdjieff's birthplace, Alexandropol, is not in Central Asia; the Theosophical Society was not officially founded on September 13, 1875 (but on November 17); Upton Sinclair and Sinclair Lewis were different chaps; and Dr Vernon Harrison is a sight more germane to theosophy than George Harrison, the Beatle.James Moore is Gurdjieff's biographer.He undertook the Gurdjieff module in theDictionary of Gnosis and Western Esotericism."},{"Title":"MADAME BLAVATSKY'S BABOON: A History of the Mystics, Mediums, and Misfits Who Brought...","review":"This book starts out well but becomes bogged down in details. Do we really need to know everything about J.G. Bennett's business partners, his mining projects, or learn the exact chronology of Gurdjieff's movements? Eventually the cast of minor characters becomes so confusing that the more important figures are obscured. Careful editing could have removed perhaps 100 pages of useless information and replaced it with more interesting material. Ironically, despite the author's almost pedantic attention to the obscure, several important literary and religious figures who deserved attention were left out.Though confusing, Washington's focus is extremely narrow. He does very well at describing his characters, but seems unable to explain what really made them tick, or why others chose to follow them. In religious/intellectual terms, the big picture becomes lost in the details. I came away with no real sense of where these characters fit into the history of their time. Washington tells us, for example, every aspect of the foibles of gurus like Ouspensky and Gurdjieff with their tiny bands of disciples in the 20s and 30s, but explains nothing of the wider, pervasive effects of spiritualism on European and American society in those decades. Washington is no historian, and it shows in his floundering descriptions of events like the Great Depression and the world wars.The most obvious issue is bias. Washington tries. Despite his criticism, I think he actually admires Steiner and Krishnamurti, and tweaks them reluctantly. But his often ribald mockery of the characters he dislikes - Blavatsky, Leadbeater, etc. - grows tiresome. I don't particularly care for them either, but find critiques without sneers more effective.This is a history that needed to be written. The story of the New Age movement and its collection of frauds and lost souls is enough to make outsiders laugh and cry at humanity's need for truth and endless gullibility.

The only history I've heard of about them. But the attempt at fact often falls apart as Washington cynically distorts everything but bare outlines. Still, this period is so amazing that even a biased history is helpful. Obviously, anything can be ridiculed in the manner Washington uses if one's motive is low enough, but it just doesn't hold up. For instance, the 'Misfits' in the title (and tone throughout the book) is a misnomer. Nearly everyone profiled was a sociable success: statesmen, aristocrats, millionaires, leaders, capitalists, doctors, reputable artists, writers, thinkers, skeptics and famous editors. Many held down several of these roles at once, and were influential in them. But none were content to rest on their laurels. It's too hard for any amount of cynicism to totally squash the imposing nature of this group. Washington misses the fact that 'credulity' of a sort is required whenever one picks a guide for something new. Those who refuse to climb ever higher peaks can disparage as they please the risks and benefits involved. Also, there are huge content errors when it is (rarely) addressed---the summaries don't seem related to the material (e.g., the role of personality). Fortunately, cynicism is shallow and so quite a bit of substance can be detected between the lines. To sum: Interesting but overly gossipy history. If you want more there is better reading elsewhere."},{"Title":"MADAME BLAVATSKY'S BABOON: A History of the Mystics, Mediums, and Misfits Who Brought...","review":"First the good news. Its hard to find any book that looks at this history at all. For that, Peter Washington had the right idea, because origins are extremely important. Yet, he has fallen to the same mistakes as the 'misfits' that he describes in his book, and that is sensationalism. The author has chosen to accent only the shady and bizarre side of this group of alternative thinkers. Thank goodness we have them, even if 'some' of them are charlatans. From my own studies I know many of his facts were wrong. I am talking about hard facts. He is free to point the narrative to any subjective slant he prefers after all he wrote the book. But, I feel it was a narrow view. Particularly, his treatment of J. Krishnamurti. Krishnamurti has over the course of this century shown himself to be an unclassifiable teacher of the highest order. Not a guru to be followed. But, a respected mind whose teaching is simply sublime. Washington chose to take to heart too often one negative source on this teacher rather than the wealth of positve ones. Washington should revise this book for it's next printing getting his facts straight, being more even-handed and include others that could fit into this context like L. Ron Hubbard and Paul Winchell."},{"Title":"MADAME BLAVATSKY'S BABOON: A History of the Mystics, Mediums, and Misfits Who Brought...","review":"_Madame Blavatsky's Babboon_ by Peter Washington is a history of the various movements which arose out of spiritualism and the Theosophical Society of Madame Blavatsky in the Nineteenth Century. The book covers a great deal, but mostly it focuses on various schisms and scandals within spiritualism, theosophical, and proto-New Age movements. The book also shows the human side of the many spiritualists, magicians, cranks, and mediums - the western gurus who followed from theosophy.The book begins by discussing various forms of spiritualism in the early Nineteenth century. Spiritualism developed as people grew disenfranchised with both materialism and scientism, brought on by modern progress in science, evolutionism (Darwinism), and developments in modern physics, as well as classical religion. Among the various spiritualist groups discussed include the Fox sisters, who allegedly made contact with the spirit world, various groups which grew out of Anglicanism and liberal movements within the church, Mormonism, and Christian Science. All these new religious movements promised contrast to both modern materialism and something different from classical religion. In addition, new doctrines from the East began to become popular.It was in this environment, that Henry Olcott made contact with Helena Petrovna Blavatsky, and out of this contact and friendship developed the Theosophical Society. Blavatsky, the daughter of a Russian aristocrat, made various outrageous claims regarding her early life and her travels. She claimed to have visited Tibet where she made contact with certain Hidden Masters. She was also to write two important works, _Isis Unveiled_ which argued against the materialism and scientism of her day and _The Secret Doctrine_ which outlined her system, revealed her racial doctrines, and expressed her belief in Hidden Masters. The headquarters of the Theosophical Society were subsequently moved from New York to India, where various conflicts between the temperamental and morbidly obese Blavatsky and other members arose.One of the earlier converts to Theosophy was Charles Webster Leadbeater, a pedophiliac prelate who helped found the Liberal Catholic Church (a splinter sect off the Old Catholic Church which maintained allegiance to Theosophy). Leadbeater helped found a school for boys along with Annie Besant. Annie Besant, had begun as a radical - socialist and feminist - who developed an interest in Theosophy. She was subsequently to take over the position of Blavatsky within the society. Together Leadbeater and Besant took an interest in a young Indian child whose father had become a convert to Theosophy. This was Krishnamurti whose teachings eventually made their way to the West where he was schooled. Krishnamurti, himself, was involved in various scandals, including love affairs with older and married women.Rudolph Steiner was another individual who took an early interest in Theosophy. He came from a background which included studies in German idealist philosophy and the writings of Goethe. Later, Steiner was to break off from the Theosophical Society and form his own movement, Anthroposophy. Steiner, always a polymath, had a wide range of interests and was to commission the building of a Goethaneum, modelled on the Wagnerian festivals in Bayreuth. In addition to Steiner, the esotericist Count Herman Keyserling also taught a blend of mysticism.Two other important figures in the history of Western occultism are those of Gurdjieff and Ouspensky, who had a brief alliance with each other. Gurdjieff, a native of Georgia in Russia, was an occult teacher who visited St. Petersburg where he met the intellectual Ouspensky to whom he taught his system. Gurdjieff later became known for his difficult teachings and excessive emphasis on hard work, leading to spiritual wakefulness, or so it was believed. It was always rumored that Gurdjieff was impossible to work with and excessively authoritarian leading many to madness or even suicide under his watch. Ouspensky was an intellectual who developed an interest in the occult through mathematics and modern physics. He was later to split with Gurdjieff though retaining Gurdjieff's system. Another individual who played some role in the history of Gurdjieff's teaching was that of Orage.Other individuals covered in this book include Aldous Huxley, J. G. Bennett, Elizabeth Clare Prophet, and Idries Shah, all claiming to possess unique spiritual wisdom from the East. This book provides an interesting survey of the teachings of various spiritualists from the mid Nineteenth century to the beginning of the modern era. Nearly all reflect the teachings of Madame Blavatsky in their own teachings, especially her belief in Hidden Masters. Later, these individuals were to provide the basis for the beginnings of the New Age movement which owes much to them."},{"Title":"MADAME BLAVATSKY'S BABOON: A History of the Mystics, Mediums, and Misfits Who Brought...","review":"Any attempt to write a book looking at history in a different way is good.

For a non-mystic to write about Gurdjieff, Blavatsky or Krishnamurti is like someone writing a book about Einstein without bothering to learn anything about all that stuff about physics, or for someone tone-deaf from birth to do a bio of Beethoven. Nevertheless, anyone interested in the above biographical figures needs to check this out. His deconstruction of some of the worst of these idiots, like the Theosophists or Bennett, is delicious, though he doesn't understand the positives in the works of the two sanest figures he writes about (Krishnamurti and Ouspensky, both great thinkers with weaknesses)."},{"Title":"MADAME BLAVATSKY'S BABOON: A History of the Mystics, Mediums, and Misfits Who Brought...","review":"It is an OK book.

YES, we get it, there are charlatans in human race and a lot of organized (and unorganized religion is a business). Even in Jesus' time they were the professional priests who were selling God as a sack of potatoes. I have noticed that for some reason Agni Yoga and the guru letters from the time of Roosevelt were missing. I guess Nickolas Roerich's life was not interesting enough to be included in the research/book. Funny, because they were many innuendos and mud slinging about his aborted expeditions and his famous follower (Secretary of Agriculture, Henry A. Wallace), in the administration, most New Age persona's were attacked by the establishment for reasons known or not. Whenever in history a giant and benevolent soul arises, it is always followed by pettiness, jealousy and misunderstanding. But when a person has power and influence over the US administration the mudslinging and lies will flurry up like snowflakes in Siberia.Simply because they were singing to a different tune.

After reading this book, litlle of theosophy's pretensions stands on foot, but much is gained on insights about people's credulity and need for something to believe in.Author Peter Washington is a master of irony and understatement. Although his story speaks for itsel,his terse , humorous style gives an added pleasure, and makes this book one of the best on the subject.

Washington's views are hardly surprising in one way given the history of the New Age movement, but he refuses to give any foundational data from which to judge what is finally a list of the failures of the various second rate spiritual teachers he describes, with none of the successes. Many of these questions are better judged by the standards of Patanjali's Yoga Sutras, than the mishmash of Darwinism, Freud, and self-help books that makes up the psychological normative universe of westerners. This book is nonetheless many fascinating tales in one, with much ommitted. Blavatsky's baboon tokens the immense reaction and puzzlement, among many other factors, to the onset of the Darwin legacy, whose theoretical foundatin no student of Eastern psychology is likely to find convincing. Before excoriating these sources it is worth realizing they took the measure of Darwin and decided they wouldn't knuckle under, and time will prove them right. This counterattack behind the many castaway fronts that appear, Blavatsky in India, Gurdjieff from the realm of the sufis, shows a fashion of revolt against being railroaded into false versions of modernism that is almost spooky it its hidden coordination. And this leads to endless confusion both in the spiritual movements falling into ditches and the hysteria of western sceptics wagging their fingers at a phenomenon that was already visible in the Hellenistic world, what to say of uprooting it. Washington's book describes a comedy of errors that delivers a slap in the face to the idiocy of much New Age presumption, but should indicate at least some aspect of the relative success in these fields that does exist in Indian and the Islamic world. It would also help to take the history backwards to the time of such as Schopenhauer and his tradition,just before, where the key to a western echo of the Upanishads and such is already close at hand in a form that is philosophic, but attempting to bring coherence to these ancient castaways in the middle of modernism, whose fate will not be decided by editorial denunciation of New Agers. But Washington's book shows something that is needed in other areas, the work of good historians. No adequate histories of the sources of these subjects, e.g. the sufis, exist at all."},{"Title":"MADAME BLAVATSKY'S BABOON: A History of the Mystics, Mediums, and Misfits Who Brought...","review":"Except for the eyes, Helena Blavatsky \\"looked overall like a badly wrapped and glittering parcel.\\"And with that, Peter Washington is off to the races. In a way, there is no reason for people who do not believe in spooks to care about Madame Blavatsky and her progeny, apart from the practical fact that she introduced cremation into America, which up until the 1870s had been an exclusively burying nation. For the first century after she began, the numbers of Theosophists and their numerous offshoots were small. Washington does not attempt to enumerate them, but they could hardly have outnumbered even such small sects as Jehovah's Witnesses.But they were so funny. Sympathetic people will feel a tug at the heartstrings at the hopeless search for inner contentment by the mystics. Heartless people, like myself, will read with glee of the self-inflicted psychic wounds of these nuts, who are summarized by Washington in one place as \\"the neurotic, the hysterical, the destructive and the downright mad\\" and in another as \\"bossy matrons, artistic maiden ladies, wealthy idealists and faddists of every variety.\\"By what must have been an effort of self-denial as heroic as anything Gurdjieff or Leadbeater ever demanded of their acolytes, Washington manages not to simply jeer for 400 pages. His occasional jabs are all the funnier for not being overdone.In a sense, though, the last laugh is on Washington and the rest of us sane people. After three or four generations of strife, hilarity, thievery, libel, betrayal, adultery etc. by what were basically small coteries of people who had inherited money but not sense, the Theosophists, although the formal group is quite decayed, have spread their attitudes widely, if shallowly, throughout American popular culture.The story of how this developed is amusing and almost beyond belief, but Washington, professor of literature at Middlesex, has the documents and some personal interviews to back him up.Most of the leading spiritualists were compulsive writers, and besides being incomprehensible, their works are tedious past belief. How Washington was able to plow through the hundreds of volumes of this literature is really more astonishing than any of the claims the spiritualists themselves ever made, except bringing people back from the dead."},{"Title":"MADAME BLAVATSKY'S BABOON: A History of the Mystics, Mediums, and Misfits Who Brought...","review":"Washington has assembled an interesting and accessible overview of the \\"useful\\" life of Theosophy and its ancillary movements. Beginning with the ascendancy of Madame Blavatsky and ending with the death of Krisnamurti, the book charts the meandering course of Theosophy as it grows, changes, and ultimately succumbs to the entropy caused by too many strong leaders each with their own differing interpretations of the meaning of life.The book is well-written and an enjoyable read. Keep in mind that Madame Blavatsky provides more of a backdrop than a focus of this book - far more attention is dedicated to Krishnamurti and Gurdjueff than Madame herself. And while the subtitle indicates that the book tells the story of those who \\"Brought Spiritualism to America,\\" very little emphasis is placed on American spiritualism.Washington's writing is clear, but his tone verges on smugly sarcastic at times.

Having rejected the traditional mystical elements of Catholicism as excrescences on the authentic body of Christian belief, they were all the more ready to embrace new and heterodox ones.

Rather, it should be noted, the faculty of logical thought should enable us to distinguish a sincere mystic, whether he be of the strain of St. Francis of Assisi, or that of Nicholas of Cusa, from such disgusting frauds and charlatans as Blavatsky or Gurdjieff.

I am personally rather critical of the areas covered by this book, but I profoundly disagree with this author about what those problems are. Frankly, I don't feel that this author is simply a sloppy scholar (which he most certainly is). I feel that he is so arrogant and his agenda is so biased that he is driven to distort the facts to give it the spin he wants. That is the only explaination that would explain how aweful the quality of this material is. Blavatsky and this broader field certainly needs intelligent criticism.

A suggestion: when a writer shows such obvious lack of character in how he or she goes about attacking others in such a mean spirited and juvenile fashion, it should be a signal to the reader that the specious arguments and information offered may be suspect. Just a thought.In any case, though not a member of the Theosophical Society myself, or a big fan of some of the people described in this book (though most are not as described by this author), this is a subject I am quite familiar with, and this book is so thoroughly filled with wrong information, lack of heart, and bogus conclusions that it is nothing but a travesty of scholarship. Nasty, incompetent and completely useless."},{"Title":"MADAME BLAVATSKY'S BABOON: A History of the Mystics, Mediums, and Misfits Who Brought...","review":"I googled Ospensky and Gurdjieff and somehow was directed to Madame Blavatsky and her Baboon. I have a hard time keeping all of these people straight as they all want to start schools and lead me to enlightenment. Well, I want to be enlightened as much as the next guy but what a hysterical historical treasure trove this turned out to be. Finally, I could figure out the origins of all these turn-of-the-century movements and figure out what all the 'enlightened students' at Berkeley were winking about back in the 70's... Peter Washington kept my interest with his dust dry British wit. The foibles of this collection of frauds, mystics, misfits, and their easily fooled fans in no way detracted from the ribald and adventuresome lives they led. When not busy engaging in 'free living' they were busily faking 'spirit messages' to each other. This book was hard to start but I came to love it in the end. With no mystical axe to grind, one way or the other, I just enjoyed it as particularly gossip-y history"},{"Title":"MADAME BLAVATSKY'S BABOON: A History of the Mystics, Mediums, and Misfits Who Brought...","review":"The problem with this book is that the author did not know the people he is writing about. Peter Washington simply read a stack of books by other authors and combined them into single manuscript. What you get from this effort is not new, not particularly insightful, and likely to be highly unreliable in terms of accuracy."},{"Title":"MADAME BLAVATSKY'S BABOON: A History of the Mystics, Mediums, and Misfits Who Brought...","review":"Reading biographies of 19th Century historical figures I have often been struck by their unquestioning belief in the supernatural. Both Lincoln and Booth believed in prophetic dreams. Several theories have been put forth for this. One is that after war or natural disaster people long to be reunited with loved ones who did not survive. Someone who claimed to be able to communicate with spirits would certainly have a rich potential market in the 19th and 20th Centuries. Several \\"spiritualist\\" leaders emerged during this time who achieved fame and wealth and attracted scores of wealthy followers. Were they out-and-out charlatans, or did they truly believe that they were communicating with otherworldly beings? I am inclined to the former opinion, and so, no doubt, is author Peter Washington. His overview of the spiritualist movement is very amusing in addition to being extremely informative. Madame Blavatsky, Gurdjieff, and Krishnamurti were all just names that I had occasionally come across in my reading. I am glad that this book contains short biographical sketches of these people as well as about a half a dozen others, like Annie Besant and Ouspensky. Now I know who these people were and how they were connected. I think the book is valuable although I did get tired of Washington's smirky remarks after a while, amusing though they may be. I was also a little perplexed by the long section dealing with Aldous Huxley, who was an interesting and complex literary figure who experimented with hallucinogenic drugs. It's a fascinating episode, but has only a vague connection with spiritualism in that Huxley knew Krishnamurti in California. Krishnamurti is probably the most interesting character in the book. He was an Indian urchin who caught the eye of Theosophical Society honcho C.W. Leadbeater (a known pederast) and was declared \\"holy.\\" Krishnamurti and his brother were taken into the compound where they were groomed for sainthood. Krishnamurti grew up believing that he was spiritually gifted. Ultimately he became enlightened and basically declared that everything is up to the individual. If everything was up to the individual then there was no real need for an organization and thus the Theosophical movement withered away.I enjoyed this book and found it very worthwhile reading. Four stars."},{"Title":"MADAME BLAVATSKY'S BABOON: A History of the Mystics, Mediums, and Misfits Who Brought...","review":"I was surprised with so many bad, and negative reviews to this book, I agree that Peter Washington's Madame Blavatsky's Baboon, try to embrace many so named Gurus in a single net, to be totally fair to the subject, regardless, for those with limited time, and interest about the subject this is a good book that expose the many, uh..? Should we say, Human foibles of those who claim themselves as special Spiritual Beings, just to be exposed as made of clay feet idols! Errare Humanum Est, (to fall in error is Human) and not only for the Gurus exposed, but by those who swallowed the fly as well! The trouble with any Truism in this Post-Modern age, is this new consensus that there is no absolute Truth, and that even if there is such Truth, words can not convey it, this may be speech, or the written word, it is all based in language that is incapable of presenting such Truth, being Language not fix, but malleable and subject to interpretation, and therefore a fallible tool for reaching consensus.Theosophy a noble idea, exploited, and abused, by those who based in the poor knowledge at the time of Eastern Religions invented all sort of nonsense, and delivered with sangfroid to those willing to believe such hodgepodge of concepts and ideas, a mishmash of almost everything they could get their hands on to present ultimate truths, as revelations from Beings of a higher plane.Unfortunately for some whose moniker is the \\"New Age\\" are still victimized with that ancient farrago of \\"knowledge\\" that is so stale, that survives as fossils of a Victorian age!If you are still an skeptic, of the truancy, and charlatanry of some of this characters, and their motley wisdom, you can read a far more serious critic, that attack not only their fallible human nature, but some of their poor conceived Metaphysical ideas as well, Rene Guenon's Theosophy History of a Pseudo-Religion ."},{"Title":"MADAME BLAVATSKY'S BABOON: A History of the Mystics, Mediums, and Misfits Who Brought...","review":"I approached this book with little background on the groups and personalities discussed herein, although with a strong skeptical bias. Peter Washington shares that bias, but he also seems to have done prodigious research on this time and place in the development of 'Western Mystical' belief systems.This book recounts the history of the movement through a retelling of its most flamboyant personalities. Helena Blavatsky, Henry Olcott, Annie Besant, and Charles Leadbeater headline the Theosophical School. Krishnamurti and Gurdijieff also receive about 80 pages each of coverage. Many of the lesser lights in the movement, including their respective belief systems and pedagogy are also inside: Rudolph Steiner, Peter Ouspensky, Hermann Keyserling, A.R. Orage, J.G. Bennett to name just a few.Since all of these people knew each other, and repeatedly back-stabbed each other, this book serves mostly as a fantastic list of grievances internal to a movement. In addition, it is a tale of incredible gullibility on the part of many very wealthy people who funded lavish lifestyles for these frauds.Unfortunately, this book is written in a very confusing fashion, certainly not linear in time. There are also hundreds of 'minor characters'; named once on page 50, then named again on page 350 for no good reason. PW jazzes up the book with a few anecdotes about true talents on the fringes of these movements like Aldous Huxley, Christopher Isherwood, and Frank Lloyd Wright. It took me almost 5 weeks to finish this book because I kept getting impatient with the writing style, although I believe that the scholarship was truly there.Book includes 20 pages of B&W; photographs, 35 pages of notes, a Bibliography with more than 150 entries and an Index."},{"Title":"MADAME BLAVATSKY'S BABOON: A History of the Mystics, Mediums, and Misfits Who Brought...","review":"I'm no follower of the people this book is about, but I wouldn't have picked it up unless I thought I'd get some reasonable objective information from it.

He has as his subjects the most eccentric and quirky individuals imaginable. Yet the book is really quite dull. It takes considerable commitment to trudge through the 400 pages of text.Besides a lack of sympathy for his subjects, it is also clear that the author's knowledge of theosophy, anthroposophy, the work of Gurdjieff and his progeny is entirely superficial.

This is also the case during a televised interview with the author. This is inaccurate. Madame Blavatsky died May,8 1891. She was cremated at Woking Crematiorium, Surrey, England.

Yes, Mr. Washington is clearly skeptical about the Theosophical Movement but he is hardly the first. I think reading ISIS UNVEILED or THE SECRET DOCTRINE would not cause most people to conclude that Washington is wrong to be skeptical. Many of the negative reviews attack his facts but few cite concrete examples. Scroeder (T) does. He claims that Washington places Madame Blavatsky's death in 1909 not its correct 8 May 1891. In my copy of the book, on page 100, Washington writes that Madame Blavatsky died on 8 May 1891.

He conveniently fails to present powerful counter evidence to pretty much all of his libelous claims. Some of which are either horrendously exagerated, or bordering on made-up.Don't take my word for it though, in fact, don't ever take ANYONE's word for anything, do your own research and then decide. Read up on what Theosophy is, and what the TS Society was created to do, and then use your own innate intuition to base your opinions. This is actually one of the main rules in theosophy, use your own intellect, do not just blindly follow another's opinion, specially when said opinion is based on zero personal expirience on the subject matter as it seems to be the case with Mr Washington and the topics of his book.My advice, pass this book up and try your hand at reading a real Theosophy book before passing judgement on it and on Blavatsky."},{"Title":"MADAME BLAVATSKY'S BABOON: A History of the Mystics, Mediums, and Misfits Who Brought...","review":"On superficial examination the book appears to be well-researched and objective. But a more careful inspection -- especially of the theosophic section, to which these remarks are limited -- discloses serious errors and omissions. Aside from fairly obvious use of innuendo and half-truths to bolster his negative conclusions about H. P. Blavatsky and Katherine Tingley, the author is frequently inaccurate, misrepresents theosophic teaching, relies on uncorroborated assertion (often from unfriendly secondary and tertiary sources), omits rebuttal evidence, garbles dates, events, and attributions, downgrades, trivializes, and generally gives a one-sided account. Whatever merit the book may have is defeated by its unreliability and prejudice.One would expect any author who writes on historical subjects to use primary sources as far as possible. There is no record of Peter Washington contacting the Theosophical Society and its considerable historical resources, either to verify facts or to interview staff members and living witnesses who are perhaps better informed about Blavatsky, Tingley, Purucker, and theosophical history. Washington's scholarly competence and objectivity may be deduced from his errors and omissions, misinformation, misattribution and evident reliance on secondary or tertiary sources. Peter Washington in fact gives very little description of theosophy as presented by HPB and her teachers, and what he does mention is often inaccurate or out of context."},{"Title":"The soldier's story of his captivity at Andersonville, Belle Isle, and other Rebel prisons","review":"I bought this as a gift and started reading it.

In addition, it has been viewed as a part of mathematics that has not followed the trend toward axiomatization that has dominated mathematics in the last 150 years. It is however also a field that has taken on enormous importance in recent years do its applicability in network engineering, combinatorial optimization, coding theory, cryptography, integer programming, constraint satisfaction, and computational biology. In the study of toric varieties in algebraic geometry, combinatorics has had a tremendous influence. Indeed combinatorial constructions have helped give a wide variety of concrete examples of algebraic varieties in algebraic geometry, giving beginning students in this area much needed intuition and understanding. It is the the advent of the computer though that has had the greatest influence on combinatorics, and vice versa.The consideration of NP complete problems typically involves enumerative problems in graph theory, one example being the existance of a Hamiltonian cycle in a graph. The use of the computer as a tool for proof in combinatorics, such as the 4-color problem, is now legendary. In addition, several good software packages, such as GAP and Combinatorica, have recently appeared that are explicitly designed to do combinatorics. One fact that is most interesting to me about combinatorics is that it gave the first explicit example of a mathematical statement that is unprovable in Peano arithmetic. Before coming across this, I used to think the unprovable statements of Godel had no direct relevance for mathematics, but were only interesting from the standpoint of its foundations.This book is an introduction to combinatorics for the undergraduate mathematics student and for those working in applications of combinatorics. As with all the other guides in the Schaums series on mathematics, this one has a plethora of many interesting examples and serves its purpose well. Readers who need a more in-depth view can move on to more advanced works after reading this one. The author dedicates this book to the famous mathematician Paul Erdos, who is considered the father of modern combinatorics, and is considered one of most prolific of modern mathematicians, with over 1500 papers to his credit.The author defines combinatorics as the branch of mathematics that attempts to answer enumeration questions without considering all possible cases. The latter is possible by the use of two fundamental rules, namely the sum rule and the product rule. The practical implementation of these rules involves the determination of permutations and combinations, which are discussed in the first chapter, along with the famous pigeonhole principle. Most of this chapter can be read by someone with a background in a typical college algebra course. The author considers some interesting problems in the \\"Solved Problems\\" section, for example one- and two-dimensional binomial random walks, and problems dealing with Ramsey, Catalan, and Stirling numbers. The consideration of Ramsey numbers will lead the reader to several very difficult open problems in combinatorics involving their explicit values.Generalized permutations and combinations are considered in chapter two, along with selections and the inclusion-exclusion principle. The author proves the Sieve formula and the Phillip Hall Marriage Theorem. In the \\"Solved Problems\\" section, the duality principle of distribution, familiar from integer programming is proved, and the author works several problems in combinatorial number theory. A reader working in the field of dynamical systems will appreciate the discussion of the Moebius function in this section. Particularly interesting in this section is the discussion on rook and hit polynomials.The consideration of generating functions and recurrence relations dominates chapter 3, wherein the author considers the partition problem for positive integers. The first and second identities of Euler are proved in the \\"Solved Problems\\" section, and Bernoulli numbers, so important in physics, are discussed in terms of their exponential generating functions. The physicist reader working in statistical physics will appreciate the discussion on Vandermonde determinants. Applications to group theory appear in the discussion on the Young tableaux, preparing the reader for the next chapter.A more detailed discussion of group theory in combinatorics is given in chapter 4, the last chapter of the book. The author proves the Burnside-Frobenius, the Polya enumeration theorems, and Cayley's theorem in the \\"Solved Problems\\" section. Readers without a background in group theory can still read this chapter since the author reviews in detail the basic constructions in group theory, both in the main text and in the \\"Solved Problems\\" section. Combinatorial techniques had a large role to play in the problem of the classification of finite simple groups, the eventual classification proof taking over 15,000 journal pages and involving a large collaboration of mathematicians. Combinatorics also made its presence known in the work of Richard Borchers on the \\"monstrous moonshine\\" that brought together ideas from mathematical physics and the largest simple group, called the monster simple group.The author devotes an appendix to graph theory, which is good considering the enormous power of combinatorics to problems in graph theory and computational geometry. Even though the discussion is brief, he does a good job of summarizing the main results, including a graph-theoretic version of Dilworth's theorem. Combinatorial/graph-theoretic considerations are extremely important in network routing design and many of the techniques discussed in this appendix find their way into these kinds of applications. The author asks the reader to prove that Dilworths' theorem, the Ford-Fulkerson theorem, Hall's marriage theorem, Konig's theorem, and Menger's theorem are equivalent. A very useful glossary of the important definitions and concepts used in the book is inserted at the end of the book."},{"Title":"Schaum's Outline of Theory and Problems of Combinatorics including concepts of Graph Theory","review":"The book does a poor job at laying out the basics for the reader. In the first chapter only 2 pages out of 33 are dedicated to describing the theory, the rest of the chapter consists of word problems. Some of those word problems go beyond the scope of the theory outlined for you, to which I thought was not only unfair but a bit intimidating to the curious math student. Sadly, the majority of this book follows the same routine.From this layout it was clear that this book wasn't written with the complete novice in mind. The Discrete Math [also a Schaum's outline] book I bought alongside this one happens to cover the same topics and does a much better job at explaining the basics with reasonable problems to practice from.As I said before, I can't recommend this book to anyone who is looking to break way into Combinatorics."},{"Title":"Schaum's Outline of Theory and Problems of Combinatorics including concepts of Graph Theory","review":"Not bad for those that have become accustomed to extensive math language within a text.

Perhaps the necessary detachment in this case comes from the fact that Brahms died just over a hundred years ago, for his was not a perfect character!I have always liked Brahms' compositions quite a bit, especially his chamber music, which is among the best. Yet I have never bothered to read a biography of the composer. I only read this one because a relative of mine is handling the estate of one of the author's wives (not Irene, the collaborator), and while visiting this relative I was offered the book. Fortunately, from the outset I thoroughly enjoyed reading Prof. Geiringer's biography.Geiringer acknowledges that there have been many other fine biographies of Brahms, and he decided to write one only because he was given access to about a thousand letters of correspondence Brahms received from well-know artists like the Schumann's, the violinist Joachim, and many others. Geiringer combines a vast knowledge of Brahms' life and music with these letters to produce a highly readable and entertaining work, w/o a hint of sensationalism.In order to leave enough room for a discussion of Brahms' extensive output, the author limits his discussion of the composer's life to about 200 pages, yet it is quite thorough. Brahms' early life of extreme poverty is discussed w/o trying to evoke sympathy, followed by the burgeoniong composer's failure to get a post in his native Hamburg, a lifelong hurt for Brahms, but which very fortuitously causes him to move eventually to Vienna, where his music flowers in a very supportive environment. The young composer's career is given a huge push by a letter Robert Schumann writes in a widely read journal, and Brahms fulfills those expectations, though he surely destroys many compositions we would love to hear, because of his high standards. Also, Brahms, unlike other composers, receives the accolades he deserves while still alive and composing.The view we get of Brahms is balanced - we see his good humor and we also read the famous quote of the composer, who, upon leaving a party, wonders if there is anyone there he has not insulted! Also, while Brahms reaches tremendous heights in his art, he never marries in order to achieve it, and we read about the women (mostly singers of his choral music) he loves but cannot attach himself to. No, Brahms is far from perfect, yet the composer is unfailingly helpful and generous to his family, friends, and also to other composers - Dvorak usually comes to mind in this respect.Following the biographical discussion of Brahms' life, the author as musicologist again provides a thorough but not excessive discussion of the different kinds of works the composer put out, from the chamber music to the many varieties of choral works.Towards the end of the book Geiringer writes an excellent chapter called &quot;The Man And The Artist,&quot; a thorough summary that, as expected, is succinct yet not sensational in any way."},{"Title":"Brahms, his life and work","review":"Wonderfully written book! I borrowed it from a friend and I love it so much I am going to buy it! This book is conveniently divided into three sections (Brahm's life, work, and letters).

It is the only book I've ever found that has stories of real people and how they stayed at home, even when it looked impossible on paper. When I read it I made more than my new husband, and on paper staying at home looked ludicrous. This book encouraged me that it is GOD in control. We do our best - we prepared (paid off credit cards, paid off 1 car), we are frugal, we rarely eat out, we plan, budget and live simply. We make do. But our savings quickly ran out. The stories in here would resonate thru my mind and remind me to rely on God. I've been saying for 2 years \\"I don't know how we can pay the bills this month.\\" I hate that feeling. Yet, for 2 years, we've paid EVERY bill EVERY month, and never once went hungry or had to rely on others. I now write down just how God meets our needs every month (unexpected money gifts, overtime, extra paychecks, a few hours of work for me to do from home with my old employer, gift cards, lower than expected bills, etc.).My next favorite section of the book is on finances, esp. the cost of working.

Amy Leonard stresses religion, power balance, and gender as all having been important in the survival of three of these convents, explaining convincingly that had the nuns been men or had they lived in a country with a stronger central power than the Holy Roman Emperor - or had they not undergone the medieval religious reforms - they would not have made it through the Protestant Reformation. Her perspective is fair, and though she clearly sympathizes with the nuns, she does not exculpate them. The writing is clear, straightforward, and lively (although it must be noted that Leonard has a bad habit of splitting every infinitive that she can), and the thesis is well argued. While many of the bar graphs are somewhat superfluous, most of the frequent anecdotes about individual nuns are entertaining and forward Leonard's argument.

These two readers along with a powerful orchestra accompaniment provide a thrilling and engaging rendition of this classic. Very satisfying indeed.The only qualm I have is the reworking of the plot and characters. I think that the plot reworking made the story easier to tell but not to listen. There were many events that would not have made sense to me unless I had previously read the work.Over all a decent script of a superb classic with a wonderfully choreographed production."},{"Title":"Alien Voices: Lost World (Alien Voices Presents)","review":"Last night I curled up with my 5 month old son to listen to the much anticipated audio novel &quot;The Lost World&quot;. I was not disappointed. I would like to thank Lenard Nimoy, John Delancy and the rest of the team for bringing this novel to life. I thoroughly enjoyed the superior production even though the story itself was kind of convaluted (hard to follow). I look forward to more audio drama's from your team."},{"Title":"Alien Voices: Lost World (Alien Voices Presents)","review":"This is available for download at Leonard & John's company website Alien VoicesIncredible to listen to, very reasonably priced MP3 version"},{"Title":"Alien Voices: Lost World (Alien Voices Presents)","review":"Most of these reviews address the book not how the production did with its presentation of the book. My opinion, it was wonderful. I know its a generalization but I wish more audio books were like this, like old 50's radio shows. It makes the book become alive. The casting was well-done. The voices are what I imagined them to be, maybe better. If only one person was narrorating this book (like most are done now) then this book probably wouldn't be as much fun to listen to on CD. So, if you have a choice to either listen to one voice or many voices with some amusing sound effects, pick the latter."},{"Title":"Alien Voices: Lost World (Alien Voices Presents)","review":"I loved listening to this Alien Voices cd. I first borrowed it at my local library and couldn't stop listening to it! It gives a very 'old radio' feeling (which I also love) and the cast was perfectly done. Though I am also a 'purist' (I always perfer the original story than abridged or amended) those things I quickly ended up letting them go because this was so funny and entertaining! Now I'm looking to see if I can find the actual video of this Alien Voices production. I can't recommend this enough! If you love those 'old radio' broadcasts and love those fun Star Trek characters...this is the one for you!"},{"Title":"Alien Voices: Lost World (Alien Voices Presents)","review":"Combine the feel of old-time radio, modern sound quality, and familiar Trek actor voices and you've got a winner. Combine THAT with Doyle's original premise of the hidden amazon plateua, and you've got something that's a lot of fun to listen to, repeatedly. The plot doesn't focus on the dinosaurs, nor does it allow itself to be updated much at all-- Doyle's original plot shines through. I applaud the AV team for resisting updating these classic tales; they survive on their own merit, despite their age. Young and old readers, whether familiar with the Doyle novel, will enjoy this treatment. I found it also surprising that this was essentially a live performance; a real rarity in audio dramitization."},{"Title":"Alien Voices: Lost World (Alien Voices Presents)","review":"Arthur Conan Doyle is my favorite author and the 4 Star Trek series are my favorite television shows, so you can imagine my excitement when they combined the two in the Alien Voices version of The Lost World. I have seen several movies of the Lost World, but none were as interestingly dramatized as the Alien Voices one. Although it is a fine triumph, I highly reccomend the book which is awesome! Also I highly recommend other Doyle sci-fi classics like &quot;The Posion Belt&quot;, &quot;Maracot Deep&quot; and &quot;Tales of Terror and Mystery.&quot; Who knows, maybe Doyle will reach the fame that Jane Austen recently acquired. He sure deserves it!!!"},{"Title":"Alien Voices: Lost World (Alien Voices Presents)","review":"Wonderful dramatization, modern day foley artists are always enjoyable.

Compiled expertly, the book is an anthology drawn from the writings of this remarkable teacher of peace numbering over 1000.The book is arranged as an encyclopedia, with topics such as Love, Self-Realization and more common topics such as Death, Worries and Problems. Each topic consists of questions answered by Sri Chinmoy. The strength of the books lies not in its format, however, but in its content.Sri Chinmoy's answers are so simple, yet powerful. They offer a rare glimpse into the wisdom of an enlightened person, a wisdom which resonates with clarity and brilliance but is at the same time quite practical and applicable.Any seeker of peace can benefit tremendously from this book which offers insights into the spiritual life and the life beyond problems and worries that few texts offer.A must for anyone interested in achieving a bit more tranquility, balance and happiness in life."},{"Title":"The Wisdom of Sri Chinmoy","review":"Sri Chinmoy is a spiritual leader who deftly blends Eastern and Western teachings with the pragmatic and practical goal of enhancing the lifestyles of today's men and women.

Truly inspiring!"},{"Title":"An Unsocial Socialist","review":"As the previous reviewer has noted this book is hard to put down. I was most impressed with the author's ability to successfully create a colorful (as in inflection-filled) and thus dynamic commentary.

The theme was a total surprise and I really enjoyed the book as the 19th century has been the focal point of most of my reading. I only gave it 4 stars because in the end, though the book had me laughing throughout and was very entertaining, it both began and ended abruptly with the oddest of situations. The story didn't seem complete. But I'm not a big fan of fiction anyway so take it with a grain of salt."},{"Title":"An Unsocial Socialist","review":"This reads like an infomercial for socialism.

I have read a number of Osho's books - some of the incredible titles from the series -Insights for a New Way of Living- published by St. Martin's Press. Somehow I feel very familiar with Osho's writing. This new Osho title 'The Book of Understanding' is of a different level. I have never got a better understanding of his philosophy and ideas. This book presents a truly contemporary concept of spirituality. Something intelligent for people who got out of childish concept of organized religions. It is an easy read - although I need to let many of the statements sink in. To read chapter after chapter is a transformative experience. It is like a mirror - showing me my social, religious and political conditioning - and a way to go beyond it. This author is a true gift by existence to everybody who is not trapped and satisfied with readymade answers provided by others.The understanding that we all have to create our own path to freedom is a deep and profound experience and process. The Book of Understanding is a great guidebook on this path. I can recommend this book to anyone who wants to read something challenging and substantial."},{"Title":"The Book of Understanding: Creating Your Own Path to Freedom","review":"This was my first introduction to Osho and his philosophies. I saw a review of the book in the local paper and asked a bookstore in town to pre-order a copy for me. I picked it up this morning and I'm halfway through! The material is profound and enlightening. Osho really challenges you to know your own voice and become your best self by examining and letting go of the expectations and limits that religion, society, and even our parents have placed upon us throughout our lives. The author doesn't push his own views on you. He simply points out the veil that's been placed over our eyes and gives us the tools to remove it (if we choose to) so that we can find our own way."},{"Title":"The Book of Understanding: Creating Your Own Path to Freedom","review":"i do not have an active social life...and i am not an intellectual...atleast i never wrote a book review before for amazon.com...but i find it facinating that two ex girl friends who gave me my walking papers in the last 6 months gave me a book by Osho as a going away present.the first book i got as a going away present, i simply left unopened at a starbucks as i was upset by the breakup...the second girl gave me The Book of Understanding...i can't say whether i read this meditation book cover to cover like a suspence novel because i was spooked that two different e x-friends gave me a book by the same unknown to me author, or because i truly loved the second girl and respect her mind so much. &lt;we actually broke up about a misunderstanding.>anyway i wish i read this book before i ever dated either one of these gals...this Osho is a master relationship counsellor. i was especially touched when he aked is it worth puttin energy into improving my personality...i said to myself 'hell yes'...he replied 'heaven no'...he actually said \\"the personality has to be dropped so that your individuality can be discovered.\\"i won't be leaving this book at starbucks...and i'm taking her home with me the next time...no more misunderstandings for me."},{"Title":"The Book of Understanding: Creating Your Own Path to Freedom","review":"I highly recommend The Book of Understanding. It changed the way I meditate. In the Afterwords, the following quote was quite unique in suggesting that in meditation, I begin with the body:\\"That's why my effort here is to start every meditation with the body. That is something new.In the ancient days people tried to start meditation directly in your innermost core. That is a difficult process. You don't know anything about your inner center; how can you start your journey from somewhere where you have never been? You can start your journey only from where you already are. You are in the body, hence my emphasis is on dancing, singing, breathing - so you can start from the body. When the body starts becoming meditative....And don't be puzzled by my use of the word meditative for the body. Yes, the body becomes meditative. When it is in a deep dance, when it is functioning perfectly, undividedly, as a whole, it has a meditative quality about it, a certain grace, a beauty.\\"I liked this suggestion. To find out more, I went to [...] and saw a video clip of a meditation, Kundalini, which uses dance before doing a seated meditation. I found that being active before sitting in meditation helped me to be less restless when I did the sitting phase. There is even a free download of the meditation music. I found this meditation more suited to me than zazen or vipassana."},{"Title":"The Book of Understanding: Creating Your Own Path to Freedom","review":"Osho has a way with words in his Book of Understanding but the power of his words lies in the readers ability to think open mindedly and accept his unique approach in helping the reader find clarity of mind. Although the book may come across to some as a continuous bashing on religion, the worth of his knowledge lies in a person being able to see things from a distance rather than so close that the lines are blurred and the obvious easy overlooked. This book is a must read for anyone able to open their mind to new ways of radical thinking in an attempt to understand ourselves in a clearer and more defined way."},{"Title":"The Book of Understanding: Creating Your Own Path to Freedom","review":"New perspectives and thoughts like none I have seen before. OSHO provides the possibility of a new and intriguing path to a place beyond mundane spiritual teachings. While exposing the path he keeps both feet firmly planted on the ground. His teachings are not based on wishful illusions but on the real here and now."},{"Title":"The Book of Understanding: Creating Your Own Path to Freedom","review":"Even after his passing of form, Osho's essential teachings continue to reach seekers worldwide. In the \\"Book of Understanding,\\" he encourages us to discover a radical, new way of living. The pathway to this profound understanding is to question virtually everything that we have been taught; every belief, concept and assumption. In this deep investigation, we realize the delusion of all separation, fear and suffering. Upon the realization of what Osho calls the authentic Self, we also realize true fulfillment. We are then able to live in integrity and enjoy ultimate creativity, peace, harmony and a life lived in true compassion.Katie Davis, Author, \\"Awake Joy\\""},{"Title":"The Book of Understanding: Creating Your Own Path to Freedom","review":"Osho has open my eyes and mentality i am not blind any more he has awaken my self to be aware, atentive, alert and consiousness remaining ecuanimus.

Thanks to Osho that means the ocean."},{"Title":"The Book of Understanding: Creating Your Own Path to Freedom","review":"The more we read of Osho's thoughts, hopefully, the more we are able to take on board what he is trying to tell us. As he says, it all comes down to self-knowledge. The more we understand ourselves and therefore let go of our baggage the more joy we find in our lives and the more we are able to realize that responsibility is the act of self-realization. Sounds so easy! It is, except our egos get in the way and fear takes hold. But the more we grow in consciousness the easier it is to let go of what has held us back.

The author clearly identifies the crossroads where we're standing these days, as the belief systems of our primitive past bump up against the future and its demands for a more generous, aware, and evolved species of human being. Wouldn't it be great if everybody woke up tomorrow morning with the understanding that all we've got is this one, beautiful planet, and it's up to us - not some government, pope, God or extraterrestrial delegation - to figure out how to live on it harmoniously? This book is for those who wonder if and how that much-needed awakening might happen."},{"Title":"The Power of Identity (The Information Age: Economy, Society and Culture, Volume II)","review":"Castells trilogy, The Information Age, was written in the late 20th century but it is really the first sociology classic of the 21st and, as such, comparable to the masterworks of Durkheim and Weber. The first audacious volume chronicled the rise of a new global order based on a network of information flows. Since Castells views the human species as essentially predatory, some remedial measures are needed to resist the injustices that will arise. This second volume is therefore prescriptive. A masterly presentation of the world's current social movements follows. The author's discussion of the affect of the internet on political action and political campaigns is especially useful. Despite the volatile subject matter, I thought that Castells never quite sacrificed his objectivity although a delicate balancing act does take place throughout the volume. This book and the previous one sometimes read like some great epic of science fiction but it is our own very real world in the 21st century that the author is discussing. As an introduction to our brave new planet, this book could hardly be bettered."},{"Title":"The Power of Identity (The Information Age: Economy, Society and Culture, Volume II)","review":"This is the second volume of 'Information Age'. This volume deals with how the social movement has changed through internet and globalization.The public sphere is where social movement projects itself. The internet has had great impact on the public sphere with its global reach. We's witnessed that kind of potential on the some handful of anti-globalization protest in recent years.But what has changed is not only the way of protest. According to Touraine's typology, a social movement is defined by three principles: the movement's identity; its adversary; its vision or social model. Globalization transformed the identity of social movement. Zapatistas and recent environmental movements are the graphic examples. Now adversary is not confined to local government, but the government representing the interests of global agencies like TNCs. They oppose their specific identity and the well-being of society against the global adversary. The impact of these movements comes from their media presence and from their effective use of IT. Castells argues that the ability or inability of the state to cope with these challenges will largely condition the future of society in the 21st century."},{"Title":"The Power of Identity (The Information Age: Economy, Society and Culture, Volume II)","review":"The second book of already classic Castells' trilogy The Information Age, in which the author attempts to reveal structural similarities between various contemporary social movements opposing dominant socioeconomic order. Obviously inspired by Marxist's search for the subject of historical change, Castells tries to infer from these similarities what are necessary prerequisites for the rise of a successful global movement with a positive (constructive) program of social change - change that would remove at least the most serious inequalities and injustice that stem from capitalist logic of today's globalized world. Even if partly unsuccessful in its goal, this book represents very valuable source of sociologically, economically and historically relevant up-to-date (2004) information about contemporary resisting collective identities and their strategies - varying from feminists, Zapata and green movement to Al-Qaeda and Aum Shinrikyo. Castells is successful - although mostly in simplified form - in connecting development of selected collective identities with crisis of modern state, rise of network logic of social organization, development in the mass-media system, and globalization of national economies. This book represents essential reading for all social scientists who are interested in related problems. Because it is very readable and far from being assailed for academic babbling, I recommend this book to anyone who wishes to understand better the changes of the world we live in."},{"Title":"The Power of Identity (The Information Age: Economy, Society and Culture, Volume II)","review":"I would suggest this trilogy to anyone wondering what is going on in this world.Things are changing around us and this book trys to examine how people fit into the picture. Hi-tech is what we constantly here about but what about the social aspects ? People matter. This work points out that many will be excluded out of the global economy.These people who find they are being left behind or do not have any say will find ways to express themselves such as terrorist groups, cults, and other NGO's.Mr.Castelle points out important human nature elements in this new world order."},{"Title":"The Power of Identity (The Information Age: Economy, Society and Culture, Volume II)","review":"This book is more the application of the theories expounded by Toeffler (Future Shock and Third Wave) and John Naisbitt (Megatrends) in the context of the Geo-political and Social happenings today. While the concepts are not necessarily new, the application is in depth and conclusions are well founded and statistically well supported.

And then this afternoon we read it, oh, 25 times conservatively speaking.

Most little boys go through a stage of being fascinated with trucks, and this was one of the first books I have used to introduce the different functions and shapes that trucks can take. Kids will outgrow it quickly, though, since it lacks detail for them to grow into; if you can only get one book about vehicles, get Richard Scarry's Cars and Trucks and Things that Go.

My daughter's favorite is the cement truck. She stares at that page for minutes, and when we happened to see a cement mixer in real life, she squealed, she was so excited!The words are simple and direct, like the pictures.Though I've seen Barton's simplicity criticized, I see it as a winning trait. The images captivate a young child. As for the words, my daughter is already trying to read from these books, and she's not even two. With such simple, short sentences, she can actually \\"read\\" along with me, and she is already able to say whole sentences out of this book. It's adorable!

Does it really get any better than trucks, planes, and trains? I would say not! They move, they have wheels, they go fast and they do all sorts of fun things. I especially liked reading my plane book when we traveled cross country to our new home. It was neat to look out the window and see the same sky that I was looking at in my book. These books are a must have for every home. Go get them!\\"Mom's Two Cents: \\"I have to agree with The Turkeybird and the publishers summary. We initially purchased the Trucks book when he was very little and it instantly became a favorite. Now that he is quite a bit older (at least two years have passed) he still picks them out of our full bookshelf. As he mentioned, we traveled by plane this last summer to move from the DC area to California and the Planes book was a huge hit! There are images of people getting on and off planes in the book and because of the small airport we initially left from, we were able to get aboard the plane just as they did in the book, which he loved! And though you would think these books wouldn't appeal to girls, even The Littlebug picked the Plane book out yesterday as her book of choice.\\"Now, onto the technical side of the book. What I, as a parent, really like about these books are the simple text and straight forward images. It's not going to be the most beautiful book on your shelf, nor will the words be drawn out and elaborate, but it still holds an entertainment and educational value I can't deny. Each page has between 3 to 5 words with a simple illustration demonstrating the text. For smaller kids it can often times be overwhelming to have a book filled with words and dramatic images, but these books though not elegant are still captivating. I highly recommend these books for beginning readers and even for older children who may need a respite between larger, more complicated books.\\""},{"Title":"Trucks","review":"My three year old son loves this series of books.

It is simple with only one sentence per page, so he doesn't lose interest before turning a page. I checked it out from the library when he was not quite two, he had to take it to bed with him every night for the full three weeks we had it. It has been checked out ever since to other people. So I got it for him for Christmas. He still loves it, and wants it read to him every night before bed 2-3 times.

I highly recommend Trucks and Trains."},{"Title":"Trucks","review":"Review by Sherry North, Author, Because You Are My BabyWhen my son was 2, he could not get enough of this book - he asked for it every day and even carried it with him in the car. Of the many truck books for young boys, this one is especially appealing for a few reasons:-Simple, bold illustrations are easy to look at.-Just one sentence per page makes the book great for short attention spans.-In very simple language, the book introduces different kinds of trucks and their purpose. (Oil truck, bucket truck, cement mixer, etc.)Besides appealing to toddlers, I think this would be an excellent choice for boys who are beginning to read on their own."},{"Title":"Trucks","review":"We like this one... story is pretty cute, great drawings. Good book for toddler boys... my son enjoyed it from 18 months on."},{"Title":"Primal Instinct","review":"I agree wholeheartedly with the reader from SF who dissed Walker for his feeble attempt at using pidgin; his dozens of inaccurate &quot;facts&quot; about the Islands and I would add, although there are racial problems here and the Sovereignty movement is strong, it just doesn't work the way Walker has it. There is no major daily Hawaiian language newspaper, for instance. And he has part of the tension between the races as being because all the cops are white! Come to Honolulu and see for your self, and this includes the brass. Mayors, government officals, etc. are represented by every race. Every governor we've had since Arioshyi (1980s) has been non-white, etc., etc.The story itself is ok, not one of his best, but decent. As a 20-year resident of the Islands, the book was ruined for me by his complete misunderstanding of the culture. There are no chiefs on Molokai; I lived 12 years there and it is nothing like the way Walker portrays it, other than it is largely rural. Likewise the way he describes Kahoolawe; to some extent (the Hawaiians only part) he has it confused Niihau and the rest is just made up. The people of Kahoolawe are those who fly over daily to continue picking up ordincance the government left when Kahoolawe was the Target Island.And his use of pidgin! Forget it, it's like he just looked up this rich subculture's language and tried copying it out of a dictionary, with no understanding of idioms, etc. Enough already, but if a writer is going to tackle a culture he doesn't understand, he/she had better do their homework!"},{"Title":"Primal Instinct","review":"If this series of books intrigues you, DO NOT read this book first. Put it down and read some of his later works. Then, if you think you'd like more of Dr. Jessica Coran, give it a go. Mr. Walker has put together a book that was painful to read at times. I say this as an individual who grew up in Hawaii. It's obvious that he's intoxicated with the magic of the islands, but, yikes!, leave the local pidgin, culture and language to the Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau. The whole series of &quot;Instinct&quot; books are somewhat formulaic: young, gorgeous (but) brilliant foresenic medicine expert/FBI agent must confront and overcome monstrous perps. Male counterparts learn to appreciate and treasure this jewel of a woman, and when they do, they betray, they worry, they love, etc., etc.If you are a fan of Dr. Scarpetta or &quot;good ole&quot; V.I. and need some kind of fix in between novels, this'll do in a pinch."},{"Title":"Primal Instinct","review":"This is the 3rd Jessica Coran novel.

Walker proves himself to be at the very top tier of thriller writers with this magnificent entry in a brilliant series.

Great read for women or men the only flaw is to be given to editors for all of the mistakes in grammar & other things that I have not encountered with other e-books. The author deserved 5 stars but who ever is responsible for all the mistakes needs to be fired."},{"Title":"Primal Instinct","review":"I see that other people are giving this book a bad review because of Hawaiian history, etc. None of that bothered me and I am sure it is because I really don't know much about Hawaii's history.My only complaint about this book (as with the others in the series) is that Jessica always compares the lead investigator with her first lover (I swear in almost every book). I know that this shouldn't bother me but I just don't care. I also just am not that crazy about her as a person. I guess I am just tired of hearing that she is the most gorgeous & smartest person alive. I also get tired of hearing references to her past cases.Barring the things I don't like about her the stories themselves are really good. I almost wish this wasn't a series though because of what I mentioned above. I LOVE series books but when you just don't care for the main character I just can't give it a 5 star rating.At any rate, if you don't read these all at one time the books themselves are good."},{"Title":"Primal Instinct","review":"This is the third book I have read by Robert Walker. The first two were good enough to keep my interest until I finished the book. This book however, I could put down several times. I thought it was quite boring. The writing had more to do with Hawaii than the killer or Jessica Coran. I found the killer to be quite boring and not that interesting. The ending of this book also was a dissapointment. I found on a whole that Robert Walkers Jessica Coran series is very good, but this by far is the worst."},{"Title":"Lay sermons, addresses, and reviews","review":"This collection is a very multifarious collection of essays by \\"Darwin's Bulldog\\" Thomas Henry Huxley. Often, Huxley is wronly seen simply as one who simply defended Darwin and did not contribute much by way of originality. Such views are shown here to be mistaken, as we see Huxley the tireless champion of science education, Huxley the philosopher and, as the title suggests, Huxley the popularilzer.These essays were given to popular audiences, and are equal parts science, philosophy, and social argument.**The first five essays generally have to do with explainling how and why science is such a useful advance, and to arguing for science education as an integral part of a general educaiton in Britian. (Huxley was a great defender of science and a prime mover of getting science education into the British curriculum.)**The nex six essays were designed to give the public broad 'science lessons' (in the vein that Dawkins or other popular writers might today). Subjects range from zoology (essay VI) to geology (essays IX, X, and XI), and even to the sociological positivism of Auguste Compte (who you will find that Huxley was not at all fond of).** Essays XII and XIII are defences of Darwin's \\"Origin of Species.\\" Strangely, in reading these essays we find that the criticisms (and defenses) of 150 years ago are often the same as those today. Huxley defends Darwinian evolution from those who accuse him of teleological thinking, 'design theorists', and those who accuse evolution of being incapable of producing design if not by design (130 years before William Dembski!).The last essay (along with remarks made in several other essays) offers a good window into Huxley's view of materialism. Huxley was a materialist, but not in the way often described. On the one hand, Huxley certainly thought that the only way to find reliable knowledge was via science and sense-evidence. Huxley, though DID NOT believe that science could say, as anything better than faith, that nature was all there is. In this, the final essay (\\"On Descartes' 'Discourse Touching the Method of Using One's Reason Rightly and of Seeking Scientific Truth\\"), is a good segue into Huxley's \\"Agsnosticism\\" and \\"Evolution and Ethics.\\"All in all, this is a very good collection of essays that offer a sample of Huxley's wide variety of thoughts and opinions. Not only do we see Uuxley from many different angles (philosophical, scientific, political) but we also see his strangths as a writer; these popular essays are very well written and examples of clear expression.Good collection for any Huxley fan.(The only warning I have is that the table of contents at the beginning of this collection are not \\"hyperlinked,\\" so one must scoll through the entire book to get to any particluar essay.)"},{"Title":"Winter Wheat","review":"I initially picked this book up at the local library, liking the title itself. When I started reading it, I had a hard time putting it down. Mildred Walker does a fantastic job of getting the human heart onto paper and I highly recommend reading this book. My wife and two daughters also read this book, largely based on my recommendation. One of my daughters also had the same reaction I did, and she is only 9 years old. This book only spans the period of less than two years of a girl's life, but oh what a two years! Please read this great book."},{"Title":"Winter Wheat","review":"Mildred Walker is a suburb writter who can span the entire emotional spectrum of humanity. This book is one of my favorites, I have read it several times. Each time I find new ways in which I can relate to the emotion's of the characters. I really enjoy her descpriton of Montana's landscape. Her ability to describe takes the reader into the wheat fields to join in the life journey of her characters. Powerfully written, this book will change how you view yourself and the realtionships around you."},{"Title":"Winter Wheat","review":"Written over sixty years ago about ranchers living in remote parts of Montana, this old fashioned coming of age novel has a surprising currency. Its bittersweet portrayal of human relationships has a deep ring of emotional truth, and its understanding of the constantly shifting nature of identity makes it almost postmodern. Meanwhile, it can be read with a kind of page-turning breathlessness that keeps readers hoping that everything - against all odds - will somehow turn out for the best.Most remarkable for a reader growing up in a mid-century rural community, the novel evokes vividly the seasonal rounds of living and working on a farm circa 1940. Though Montana was her adopted home (Walker grew up in eastern Pennsylvania and attended Wells College), she writes with an intimate knowledge of farm work that is rare in literature. Also remarkable is the novel's wartime setting, as Walker writes of Pearl Harbor and the impact of entry into WWII on the lives of her characters, even while that war was still being fought (the novel was published in 1944).I recommend this novel highly for its way of creating very individual characters leading quite plausible lives rooted firmly in very real physical and psychological worlds. Its lessons about hard work and survival, the bonds of love, living with insecurity, and the lifelong effects of choices made affirm a view of life that embraces both loss and reward. Thanks to the University of Nebraska Press for keeping this fine novel in print. Also recommended, Judy Blunt's \\"Breaking Clean\\" and Mary Clearman Blew's \\"All But the Waltz.\\""},{"Title":"Winter Wheat","review":"Such a beautiful, beautiful book. The characters are gently revealed through their choices, actions, dialogue, and even their interaction with the harsh/lovely landscape. Ellen's situation is unique to her era and environment, but then again, much about her is timeless: her longing, her confusion, her stamina, the bitterness of the lessons she learns in growing up. Her parents are--I'd say richly drawn but that makes me think of the florid descriptions of a Pat Conroy or something, and Walker is as far from that as imaginable. I'll say instead that they are hard and true characters whose own story adds much to Ellen's. You will not regret reading this wonderful book."},{"Title":"Winter Wheat","review":"Mildred Walker must have lived on a farm. Surely she could write about the unpainted house, the yard light, the wind breaks and snow without living on a farm, but her descriptions of winter wheat, the elevator, driving a truck and harvesting wheat are too real to just be observations or a result of research.I grew up on a dry land farm in eastern Montana and reading WINTER WHEAT was a thoroughly enjoyable trek back to my childhood sans hayfever or sloppy mud. The main character, a young girl becomes stronger as she loses her nearly perfect man and learns to see the best of all places, even the depths of tragedy and despair. Her assumptions colored her relationship with her parents, a familiar yet somewhat unexplored topic in books set in the west. I found the combination delightful and easy to relate to my quiet Danish father and mother I thought was always old.This is a definite read if you've lived through life-threatening snow storms, driven a combine or sat on a tractor working far into the night just to finish a field. I could feel the crust of the snow and the warmth of the wood stove. Remember the smell of wet mittens drying and floors slippery with thawing snow and ice?I don't expect city folk to grab this book as a must-read, but the country ones of us - or those who long to be farmers - will delight in Mildred Walker's setting and character study. It tells the hard and the soft of farming and makes the wheat report on the radio come back - clear and holding the future of the crop in a few words.Read it? Yes, but you may want to wait for a sunny day so you can sit at the edge of a field in the shadow of the tall windbreak and grab a handful of dirt now and again."},{"Title":"Winter Wheat","review":"What can I say? This is quite possibly one of the best books I have ever read. Mildred Walker wove a story that stole my heart away. Ellen Webb, Gilbert, Leslie, Anna, Ben, and Warren were so alive in this story. It's as if it really happened. I was transported in time to their lives and I did not want to leave it. Splendid literary talent like this comes rarely. I felt like I was there with them. I could not stop reading this book.I highly recommend this book to all and I have already purchased several copies to distribute to my family and friends. I am going to read it again and again... Thankyou, Mildred Walker, for your depth of understanding of the human heart."},{"Title":"Winter Wheat","review":"The book Winter Wheat by Mildred Walker is a great story for everyone to read. I could really relate to the main character, Ellen, who is in her teens. A long story short is it is a story of a girl going away from home for the first time and how it causes her to change the way she looks at things in her life and the changes of other people's lives. All the little twists and turns of her life keep you keeps you guessing and wondering what is going to happen next.The characters that I enjoyed the most was Leslie and Ellen, because one Leslie is my name, even if it was a guy, and Ellen was very well written and had an exiting two years. It's as if it really happened it been like you were there and apart of their lives. I felt like I was there with them every step of the way. The unpainted house, the yard light, the windbreaks, snow, and the winter wheat were very descriptive just like they would be during to Montana seasons.The main character Ellen becomes stronger as she sees the losses in life. She learned how to find the best of all places, no matter how good or even bad. Her relationship with her parents is more graphic than other families in other books, like showing some of the \\"smaller town life\\" people.When I was reading the book I could feel the crust of the snow and the warmth of the wood stove. Also the smell of wet mittens drying and floors slippery with thawing snow and ice from our big snow boots. I would recommend this book to anyone, big city or small little honky tonk people. It gives you the best views into the heart of Montana that I have seen. You should really read this book."},{"Title":"Winter Wheat","review":"This quiet, character development approach to writing is enhanced by the glorious descriptions of the external environment in (desert-like) countryside.

Fairly straight-forward, coming-of-age story which captures the time period of WWII nicely. What I think will be interesting with high school students is discussing what they think about her not being able to return to college because of fluxuating family income. Not many kids these days face that -- at least not in my school district. It also has an interesting conflict with &quot;you're just a girl&quot; issues."},{"Title":"Winter Wheat","review":"My husband brought this book home for me and having never heard of Mildred Walker, I have to admit that I judged the book by the cover. I thought that I might have a hard time connecting with this book and the main character seeing how this book was written over half a century ago and was about a young woman living in rural Montana. Boy was I wrong!I assumed that there would be a period of adjustment as this is not a modern book, but within a matter of a few pages, I was sucked right in. This book could have been written today. Ms. Walker has a wonderful way with words, she describes everything in such a way that you feel you are almost there, yet somehow avoids being overly descriptive or flowery. I just couldn't put this book down, and about 2/3 of the way through I began feeling sad as I just didn't want it to end, and there are precious few books in my life that have made me feel this way. This was a wonderful book, and now I've ordered several more of hers.*A note: if you are ordering the edition with the foreward by James Welch, I HIGHLY recommend that you save the foreward and read it as an \\"afterward\\" as he describes nearly all the major events in the book."},{"Title":"Winter Wheat","review":"I wish I could give a 4 1/2 star rating for this book. It was nearly perfect. As a young woman in my early twenties, I could really relate to the main character, Ellen, who is in her late teens. It is a story of a girl going away from home for the first time(to college) and how it causes her to change the way she looks at things in her life (mostly her parents and her home). All the little twists and turns of her life keep you turning those pages. I really enjoyed this book and was sorry to see it end. I definitely recommend it!"},{"Title":"Winter Wheat","review":"I've loaned this book to my mom, dad, and all the members of my book club. It gets such a strong reaction from everyone who reads it.

Winter Wheat was written in 1944 and is set in about 1941, I think. It's enjoyable to see how a 1940's author writes on ageless human topics tactfully and compare how a similar topic would be presented today.On another note, being involved in wheat production on the high plains, it was touching to see how some things stay the same (weather & chaff in my sandwich) and how farming differs today.The ending didn't jazz me up much, but then this is a literary novel I suppose and quite short on vampires, zombies & princesses.

She gets engaged and brings her fiance home to Montana where she sees her roots through his eyes - stark, barren and without love. He breaks off their engagement.How Ellen begins to see her past through her own eyes again and recognize what she loved about it is the theme of this book. She has many questions about her parents. Her mother is a Russian immigrant and her father is from Vermont. Do they hate each other? What is their bond?The novel uses wheat as a metaphor - its seasons, colors, growth and the hopes, resignation and tenacity of wheat farmers - to describe life and experience.This is a beautifully rendered book, rich in language and wisdom.

The story of a young woman living with her parents on the Montana plains. You can consider it a coming-of-age story, but much more mature and realistic than such stories usually are. Walker draws the character of Ellen Webb extremely well, and shows her coming to grips with questions of who she is, who her parents are, and what their relationship really is.Great sense of time and place. The book takes place in the early 40's - not too much before it was written, and the dialog is, unsurprisingly, dead-on for that era. And yet, for being over sixty years old, the book has not aged much.

I grew up in the Midwest (central and southern Illinois and Indiana), and I could truly relate to the rural life that (main character) Ellen grew up in and eventually returns to. It is a shame this book hasn't had more publicity, but it is certainly a classic novel and it would be great to see it in the hands of more young people. It's easy to feel for the main character and it's bittersweet as you see Ellen grow up and blossom into an independent woman as she learns the difficult lessons of living and loving.

They're showing up in a variety of places. Each scarf has just one knotted end. And when the fabric is wound around one's fingers, it becomes the perfect instrument for strangulation. Broody Mary finds one outside of Suzanne Howes' place on Cape Cod's Deathblow Hill, after scaring a stranger off the property. Cape-bound travelers Tabitha Newell and Joan House both witness a man being whisked away by one before he disappears in a cab in Boston. What will reknown Cape Cod detective Asey Mayo say when they all turn these menacing undertakings over to him?Ms. Taylor breaks free of her first-person mold here by setting this narrative in a third person omniscient point of view. It's easy to see why: multiple people are involved; and through this technique, we readers get to hear what most of them are thinking. At the core of the plot is a long-time family feud that even now is being conducted across a chain link and barbed-wire fence. It's Suzanne and Lance Howes (\\"Good\\") versus Abby and Simon Keith (\\"Evil\\"). And the major issue between them is the disappearance of most of the Howes family fortune. Neither branch seems to have it.Into the fray come the yellow scarves and several guests to Suzanne's boarding house and lighthouse at Deathblow Hill. Some of those visitors are uninvited, unexpected and unwanted. And with all of the foreshadowing the scarves create, you know it's inevitable that at least one person will be strangled to death. The first victim is Benjamin Carson, Joan's employer, who is found on the floor of Suzanne's kitchen. Why is he even there? He's supposed to be on a trip abroad. What possible relationship could the notable tycoon have with the Howes and the Newells? Joan had never told him where she would be vacationing. She herself didn't know beforehand that she had an even more intimate Cape connection in her own past.Asey is stymied by the way everyone at Suzanne's is behaving and covering for their friends. \\"There just wasn't any way of getting anywhere by the where-were-you-from-two-to-four method. ... [T]hey were all nice intelligent people, and would lie like mad to keep any of the others from being involved. There wouldn't be any sense in trying to stir up a hornet's nest and get them mad at each other; they wouldn't tell then, either. They'd see through the trick before he had his plans organized.\\"While the previous Asey Mayo mysteries could easily be classified as \\"cozies,\\" this one has a more sinister side to it. Simon Keith is a truly nasty man, using his binoculars and lip-reading ability to monitor all the comings and goings in Suzanne's house. You just know he's up to something diabolical. And there's no telling what Benjamin Carson's thugs are really looking for. What kind of clue to the Howe inheritance is hidden in that briefcase?As usual, this book will provide entertaining reading for most mystery lovers, especially those with a fondness for The Cape."},{"Title":"Justice William Johnson, the first dissenter;: The career and constitutional philosophy of a Jeffersonian judge","review":"I first read this old bio of an important Jeffersonian justice a few years back and found it an interesting account of a lesser known justice of the U.S. Supreme Court.

The examples are clear and concise, and the book moves VERY quickly from basic to advanced concepts, which I prefer. However, I think more explanation of why the examples work is needed. Often, commands are introduced with no or little explanation, only to be explained later. This can be annoying. Also, you must be fairly comfortable with Linux to make use of the book. Also, I don't think you could follow this book if you've never done any programming before.I would advise people using this and other Wrox &quot;Beginning&quot; books to have other reference books on hand, when concepts spring up without sufficient explanation. Also, spend more time with the examples and try to use the examples to write your own unique programs before moving on. It will take a little longer, but you'll learn better and faster in the long run."},{"Title":"Beginning Linux Programming (Programmer to Programmer)","review":"I always keep this book at my desk. If you are a UNIX or LINUX programmer, not just a C programmer, and really want to know some of the less covered areas: sockets, ipcs, pipes, signals, etc., get this book. It may not be in depth but it gives you a good overview of all the topics covered. Make sure you get the source code from the WROX press site. I always use it as a start for quick and dirty programs that I may need from time to time."},{"Title":"Beginning Linux Programming (Programmer to Programmer)","review":"This book is the first book I've seen that delivers what the Title and Cover promise. I have been working as an application programmer on other platforms for several years and this book has been great for me. Unlike some of the other books on this topic that limit themselves to things like using editors and compilers, or describing basic progamming concepts in detail, the authors expect the reader has some familiarity with these topics already, and provide an example application that is developed using many of the different tools and facilities that are available on the Unix/Linux platform."},{"Title":"Beginning Linux Programming (Programmer to Programmer)","review":"The book is very good. It has a lot of useful information on the LINUX programming environment.The discussion of make though is oriented towards UNIX generic make, not GNU make. GNU make has more powerful rules that the book does not discuss.In general, given the choice, the book concentrates on common subsets that will be valid on all UNIXen and with most UNIX tools rather than the specifics of LINUX.On the other hand this is a great book which fills a keenly needed niche."},{"Title":"Beginning Linux Programming (Programmer to Programmer)","review":"I won't waste your time here - suffice to say that if you need to get into Unix/Linux programming fast (as I did for a computer science course), get this book quickly. In too many programming books, the authors just seem to want to show off their knowledge. In this book, you really will learn something, as it was written for the student.Just buy it, already."},{"Title":"Beginning Linux Programming (Programmer to Programmer)","review":"This is a big book that covers a lot of topics relating to Linux. If you're looking for a introductory book or a somewhat intermediate book that will help you get a jump on Linux programming then this is probably the best one released for this operating system so far. Although you'll find many typos and misaligned text in this book, as well as some dated code and libraries, it still does provide a lot of useful examples into how Linux programs are written and created. Most of the things covered in this book are done rather quickly so it is not a complete reference manual at all and it doesn't aim to be. It is more or less just a large book on many key Linux subjects and you will not be wasting your time picking up a copy of this book. Hopefully we'll see more books like this one released for this operating system."},{"Title":"Beginning Linux Programming (Programmer to Programmer)","review":"It's most valuable as a complement to Linux Application Development (ISBN 0-201-30821-5) because it contains some material that LAD doesn't. Other than that ... yuck.The book is too big. It doesn't fit comfortably in your lap, and it doesn't open flat on a desk. It's bloated with too many tiny apps that advance the discussion microscopically and are padded with detailed analysis of each increment. Yes, the book is called &quot;*Beginning* Linux Programming&quot; - but, imho, Beginning should really be applied to the Linux, not the Programming.Worse, it seems to have been written as Beginning Unix Programming, and had &quot;Linux&quot; slapped on at the last minute as a marketing gimmick: It's full of vague statements about 'some Unixes do this as do many Linuxes'. It basically treats Linux just as a Yet Another dialect of Unix.Part of this is just that it's just plain dated. The first edition came out in 8-96, which means it was probably started in '95, when Linux wasn't quite as mature - let alone dominant - as it is now. This age shows in the all too many totally risible strawman references to &quot;MS-DOS&quot; programming. (Hardly anyone has used or programmed MS-DOS for years, yet this book only acknowledges Windows in a few of the newer chapters.) It also shows in the way the book is all C - no C++.The new (second edition) chapters are better than the old chapters, but they're not enough to save the book. Too, they've just been sort of dumped in, in the sort of haphazard manner you might expect from a book that uses C examples in Ch 1, devotes Ch 2 to shell programming, and then moves back to C in Ch 3.Don't buy this book with your own money. It'll take too long to extract the few bits of useful info from the herniating mass of blather. Look elsewhere for X and Gnome info."},{"Title":"Beginning Linux Programming (Programmer to Programmer)","review":"Hi, I bought this book because my unix programming class requires it. Everyone I know told me it's an awesome book to buy so I bought it. I suppose it's a good book like everyone said except you have to watch out if you are below intermediate level programmer. It's a good reference book to programmers who are intermediate to expert but definitely not for beginning C programmers. Every thing is short to the point and the book will not pamper you through.

It covers a wide range of topics to such a depth that you will be proficient enough to slinging code when a section is compleat. For example before going into this book I had no ncurses knowlege at all, but by the end of the chapter I was coding ncurses apps easily, and I had a good idea where to go for topics that wern't covered in the book. This book does assume that you are proficient in C and the topics (exp threads and ipc) can get nasty quick.

The authors and contributors have done a fine job; there is a wealth of well presented detail here. It's the physical production of the second edition that disappoints. For reasons known only perhaps to Wrox management, someone changed style sheets; light typefaces now appear where there was bold, double line space where there was single, wider bottom margins that consume more paper, etc. Inappropriate typefaces adversly affect the readability of what could have been another excellent book.

And as its title suggests it is for \\"begginers\\". It covers a wide range of topics, starting from shell programming and ending with device drivers.- Most likely, as in my case, you will read a large subset of the chapters in this book, but not everything.- This book covers a lot of the old APIs as well, thus, you will learn to write portable code which will run under different Linux distributions (and under UNIX too).- This book is a *MUST* for anyone starting in the Linux development world.- One problem though, in my opinon, it should cover a little less of the \\"OLD\\" stuff and it should include MORE about the \\"NEW\\" stuff, especially about the LATEST/GREATEST 2.6.x kernel.- I really liked the fact that it covers few basics about Linux kernel programming and device drivers in chapter 18.- For more info about specific topics (in addition to this title), I suggest the following:A) Linux Networking -> \\"The definitive guide to Linux Network Programming\\"B) Linux Kernel Programming -> \\"Linux Kernel Development (2nd Edition - by Robert Love)\\"C) Device Drivers -> \\"Linux Device Drivers, 3rd Edition\\"D) Another excellent book addressing the same topics -> \\"GNU/Linux Application Programming, by M.

While many have detail that surpasses this book, none are written as clearly. I enjoyed the writing style as much as the information conveyed. You will not be disappointed with this tome.A word of warning, however. This book, while a beginning introduction to many topics, is not for beginning programmers. If you do not already know C, shop for another book. The authors hit the ground running and do not stop to explain pointers and other syntactic minutia. This probably will not be a problem for most of you. Why would a complete novice jump into device drivers? Still, do not be fooled by the &quot;Beginning&quot; in the title. You are introduced to some fairly hairy concepts most programmers seldom delve into (system calls, for example).Am I happy with this book? You bet. If every Wrox book is as expertly edited and authored, then O'reily has some stiff competition. By the way, do not ever purchase a book with the words &quot;Unleashed&quot;, &quot;Maximum&quot;, or &quot;Que&quot; on the cover.

Take out the sections on Tcl, HTML, Perl, and CGI; they are so basic that they are useless anyway, and they don't fit in here. &quot;Beginning Linux Programming&quot; has the potential be the master of all of the Linux books if they would cut out these non-Linux topics and replace them with more Linux information.For example, I loved the compiler section but it stopped short on shared libraries to save room for Perl and CGI later in the book. If the authors are listening: the cover of the book says Linux programming, not web programming.As for the presentation of the book: Great examples, great explainations, and very clear."},{"Title":"Beginning Linux Programming (Programmer to Programmer)","review":"If you are a sysadmin or want to learn programming on UNIX/LINUX you must have this book. I have several books on C and several on other languages I would trade them all for this. It covers the basics (essentials) that other books written exclusively for one language don't even touch on. I explains how all of the languages covered interplay with UNIX/LINUX.The first chapter covers programs, the C compiler, header files, staic libraries, and shared libraries. It explains they all come together to make a program in a way that it can be understoodThe second chapter covers UNIX shell scripts at length. I have good book on shell scripts, and this chapter alone is just as good as that book.The third chapter covers working with UNIX files, system calls, library functions etc... The sample programs all work as they are supposed to. Everything is clearly explained and easily understood.The 4th chapter covers passing arguments to C programs, envorment variables, temporary files, configuring logs, and system resources.I have not read any further, because I've only had this book a week. I've been looking for a book like this for a few years.

It covers all the major Linux languages: C, TCL/TK, Perl, Shell programming, etc. It's not just a cornucopia of different dialects, though, it's clear the authors are true bilinguals: all the examples are well coded, commented and generally do things in the way I would!.Anyone who finishes this book to be able to write pretty much anything they please. It shows you stuff from small utilities for the command line to full GUI-driven database apps. There is a section on writing device drivers and kernel hacking, there's also another section on writing HTML. It really is that broad and encompassing, I refer to it time and time again.Although this book is called 'Beginning Linux Programming', it's clear that a lot of the skills you'll gain from this book are transferable to other platforms, thanks to POSIX, X/Open, et al.One possible criticism is that KDE programming is not covered (except, the TCL/TK programs will obviously work under KDE, as will the GNOME programs if you have the correct libraries installed). However, the book had to end somewhere, and for the bang-per-buck (this is a big book) the value-for-money is quite amazing.And, to top it all off, it has a foreword by Alan Cox, Linux demi-god uber-geek.

This book will play a prominent part in my work bookshelf.One caveat - it says it's for beginners, but almost all of the examples are in C, using some pretty advanced constructs. If you're still rusty with pointer syntax (for example), brush up on your C programming first. Also, like most Linux source, the examples are in straight-C rather than C++, but this is probably a Good Thing.Also, there's a chapter at the end on writing device drivers - I couldn't get any of the examples to compile on my Redhat system running kernel version 2.4.9; I guess they're due for another edition of this book.All in all, one of the best computer books I've ever read!"},{"Title":"Beginning Linux Programming (Programmer to Programmer)","review":"This book as written on the title, is for beginner who wants learn Linux programming.

Like, how to make the Makefile, how to use CVS for group development, how to program for X, etc. With 945 pages, and 21 Chapters + Appendixes, I think they did their jobs by keeping the explanation about each aspect of Linux programming in the right portion on each chapter."},{"Title":"Beginning Linux Programming (Programmer to Programmer)","review":"I've been looking for the opportunity to rave about this book. It is by far the best UNIX/Linux book I've ever read. The part that got my attention is that while it covers several different programming topics, it isn't afraid to get down to the details. From the program management tools to the low-level system calls, every line is explained. The text is full of examples to illustrate the concepts presented which include sockets, database structures, and inter-process communication. Not exactly introductory topics, but the writers have made them as straightforward as your first &quot;Hello World&quot; program.

If you're looking for a book which will cover many topics in a quick-yet-not-that-shallow tutorial, then I highly recommend this book. This book covers many, many important topics from the basics of Linux/UNIX such as terminals, shell programming(scripting), through more proramming issues like Inter Programming Communication (IPC), X programming, debugging and building issues under Linux to the more sysadmin oriented topics such as Perl, HTML programming, etc'. It also includes many other important things, which can be easily viewed in it's TOC... . What I can add is that it's explanation and building of the chapters is very good. This book covers many topics so each chapter isn't too deep, but yet not shallow at all. Most of the time, at the right ratio.So, all in all, I think the authors did a good job in the balance between delving into details and coverage of wide range of topics.I recommend this book to the following: 1. Junior sysadmins (like me!): just make sure you go through an extensive C/C++ tutorial (C++ even better) before getting this one. Go through *all* of this book's chapters. It'll teach you ALOT more than you know about Linux and it'll give you in depth understanding of many things. 2. Programmers in Linux: Well, this is just your first step but, IMHO, it's very important to know your surroundings even if you'de never mess with some of the book's stuff in the future. 3.

One of the rare ones that really correspond to their description in the foreword (which is worth reading, by the way). Very good combination of range of topics, depth, and conciseness (at least for me). Not the book, though, for very beginners or people who have no experience in UNIX-oids at all. The very important characteristic is that the book is good for aquiring something new (re-reading some material couple of times, of course), and at the same time excellent reference, so you don't want to throw it away after reading and buy something lighter on the same topics; believe me, the book is brief enough. Like the authors promised in the preface, a very wide range of topics is covered, so the book is perfect for deciding what you're up to in Linux and is also perfect for general education. But if you want a very detailed and very-very explanatory text on some topic, buy another book on the topic you are inerested in to become really proficient. Considering that the book is a brilliant general reference and tutorial at the same time, well-formatted, and almost without any typos, I would say that for Linux programmers it is rather a must-have item than nice-to-have one."},{"Title":"Beginning Linux Programming (Programmer to Programmer)","review":"This book is excellent for those who have a basic understanding on ANSI C, as well as the Unix/Linux operating system, and wish to begin programming for the platform.

It gives the reader a good start into unix programming. I was a little disappointed though, as far as I can tell this book has little to do with specifically linux.

All of the stories are more or less directly related to the theme of 'exile'. Many are about people who were uprooted by the war and had to leave their homes permanently. Indeed, the majority of the stories is about the legacy of the war in one way or another. Other themes in the stories include gender issues (especially 'The Last of Hanak'o), stigmatisation and discrimination faced by families of 'defectors' to North Korea ('Scarlet Fingernails') etc. Some of the newer stories are not related to the war or major historical events and are about exile in a less direct way: a mentally ill person going on a vacation to recover in 'Conviction' or the secret desire for a healthy young woman of a middle-aged man whose wife is gradually succumbing to cancer in 'From powder to powder'.I think that one of the best stories is 'Land of Exile': The protagonist is involved in very different ways in three periods of Korean history: as a common peasant in the pre-war period, a People's Committee official during the brief occupation by the Korean People's Army and later a construction worker unable to return home for fear of being punished (killed) for his involvement in purges of a local landlord family. 'Kapitan Ri' is an intriguing depiction of a typical collaborator, willing to sacrifice his compatriots and even his own children and ally himself to every external power (Japanese, Russians, Americans) for his own benefit. 'The Last of Hanak'o's story of an awkward relation between a female designer and her university friends shows persisting stereotypes of the \\"unobtrusive and comforting female\\" and violence against women.Given the general theme of 'exile', there is a relatively strong focus on dramatic events such as the war, violently suppressed student demonstrations and escape from hostile regimes. Less dramatic or more gradual, constant themes in Korea are often dealt with less explicitly, but they are there, too: poverty, urbanization ('A Dream of Good Fortune'), gender issues (see above), harsh working conditions and low wages during the economic miracle ('Land of Exile').I found some of the stories a bit difficult to understand. But with the information provided in the introduction and at the beginning of each story I think I was able to get them.This book was very useful for me as a complement for history books and also because of its insights into Korean culture."},{"Title":"Land of Exile: Contemporary Korean Fiction (UNESCO Collection of Representative Works: European)","review":"These comments refer to the first edition, published in 1993, not the revised edition published in 2007 with four additional newer works.The 1993 edition contained 12 short stories by as many writers, ranging from the late 1940s to the mid-1980s. The oldest writers in it were Ch'ae Manshik (1902-50), Kim Tongni (1913-95), who was described as the voice of humanistic nationalism, and Hwang Sunwon (1915-2000), who was called a lyrical humanist and the consummate Korean short-story writer of the 20th century. The youngest writers were Ch'oe Inho (1945-), O Chonghui (1947-), called one of the best female authors of the 1970s, and Im Ch'oru (1954-).Others included Chon Kwangyong (1919-88), Pak Wanso (1931-) -- another memorable female author from the 1970s -- Kim Sungok (1941-), Yun Heunggil (1942-) -- described as one of the writers best known abroad, Cho Chongnae (1943-) and Hwang Sogyong (1943-), called a major representative of the 1970s generation.So far as this reader is aware, these authors have lived mainly in South Korea, although some were born in the north, Manchuria or Japan. One, Hwang Sogyong, lived in the United States ca. 1989-93 after visiting North Korea, before returning to the south and enduring jail for several years.According to the brief introduction, modern Korean literature initially was modeled to a large degree on Western forms. In fiction the main influences were French and Russian realism, and realism maintained its predominance during the period the book covered. In the 20th century, writers frequently portrayed the country's harsh historical realities -- a rigid social and political structure, oppressive colonial rule by the Japanese, post-1945 chaos, and political tension and war resulting in division into north and south. Thereafter, as the north disappeared behind an iron curtain, in the south there was the imposition of military rule from the 1960s and accelerating industrialization, before democratization from the 1990s. Throughout these periods, major themes in the literature have been alienation, isolation and frustration -- forms of exile from the self, other people or society in general.In the collection, the stories from all decades were concerned mainly with broken families, urban squatters, ex-cons, political dissidents, social parasites, childless couples and soldiers lost in the mountains. Some of the stories seemed merely dark and drab, while others impressed for their artistry.Most distinctive for this reader was Chon's \\"Kapitan Ri\\" (1962), about a proud, xenophobic man who'd compromised with and survived all changes of government; despite the great personal and social cost, he was still going strong and plotting his next advance. Cho's \\"Land of Exile\\" (1981), on the other hand, was about a man whose entire life was blighted by circumstance -- the class system before the war, betrayal by a Communist soldier afterward, and poverty in the capitalist south. O's \\"The Bronze Mirror\\" (1982) showed first the individual problems of an aging husband, grief-stricken wife and nervous little girl, before bringing them all together in a beautifully described but bitter conclusion. Kim Tongni's story from the 1950s concerned a forest-dweller's revenge on bullying soldiers. Hwang Sogyong's piece from the 1970s showed the poor living like animals on wasteland that was soon to be destroyed by urban growth.Many of the other stories seemed slight in comparison -- a man returned to his struggling wife, then left -- or contained too many twists and improbabilities -- a long-lost sister and father recognized because of a mole. Or they contained characters and situations I just wasn't able to sympathize with.Other recent collections of Korean fiction include Modern Korean Fiction: An Anthology (2005), Modern Korean Literature: An Anthology (1990), A Ready-Made Life: Early Masters of Modern Korean Fiction (1998), Wayfarer: New Fiction by Korean Women (1997) and Words of Farewell: Stories by Korean Women Writers (1989). For tales from the north, there's Korean Short Stories: A Collection from North Korea (2003)."},{"Title":"Colors (Anne Geddes Collection)","review":"As usual, Anne Geddes provides interesting and visually appealing photographs of children in a myriad of unique costumes and settings. Her pictures provide wonderful opportunities for parents and children to expand upon the visuals and imagine stories that go along with them. However, the colors that are featured in this book are not always bold and distinct. They are integrated into the photoes instead of being the clear focus. Therefore, it is not a great tool for very young children to use while learning about colors. Keeping this in mind the book is still of great value for the older, imaginative reader"},{"Title":"Colors (Anne Geddes Collection)","review":"This was a gift, not something that I thought would interest my child, BUT my 10 month old loves looking at the babies in this book.

I associate her with Kim Addonzio because of there manual on poetry the wrote together, The Poet's Companion, because they are friends, and because their work has a similar feel (though Laux doesn't write in meter and rhyme like Kim does sometimes). There is this raw emotion, but not just flopped on the page like so much bad poetry. In reading this collection, you see what a craftsman Laux is. Her poems feel raw, they feel spontaneous, but they are finely tuned pieces of art.The book is divided into two sections, Smoke and Fire. The first section, Smoke, is the stronger section, with poems like \\"Ray at 14\\", \\"Prayer\\" \\"How It Will Happen, When\\" and others. The poems here feel like smoke when you read them. They touch you lightly, but powerfully, bringing forth all these images, sounds, smells, feelings. Like smoke, they sneak up on you, and then hurt you.\\"What could be more sacred than her eyes,fierce and complicated as the truth. Your liferising behind them. Your name on her lips.\\"--Prayer\\"Death comes to me again, a girl in a cotton slip\\"--Death comes to me again, a girlThe second section doesn't differ much. The poems don't come raging at you like fire. No burning here. They are much more like smoke, but it does contain some great work, and has \\"The Shipfitter's Wife,\\" a beautiful poem that was selected for the Best American Poetry 1999 by Robert Bly. I'm just surprised more of her work hasn't appeared there."},{"Title":"Smoke","review":"Dorianne Laux, Smoke (BOA Editions, 2000)My last encounter with Dorianne Laux was almost twenty years ago, in an anthology called Three West Coast Women (Five Fingers Press, 1987). I picked it up in college, and decided after reading it that I wanted to check out more work by Dorianne Laux. Why it took me close to two decades I've no idea, but I finally have.Smoke is a very, very good book. Laux is one of those poets who uses understatement, and uses it well, preferring to let the poem do the talking:\\"When I arrive at the tollgate I have to makemyself stop thinking as I dig in my pocketsfor the last of my coins, turn to the attendant,indifferent in his blue smock, his white haircurling like smoke around his weathered neck,and say, Thank you, like an idiot, and driveinto the blinding midday light.\\"(--\\"Abschied Symphony\\")This is definitely one to check out. ****"},{"Title":"Smoke","review":"If you love poetry filled with beautiful images, great concrete detail and deeper than just the words on the page, you'll love Dorianne Laux's Smoke.

Having committed myself to the kest system of power yoga over the past two years, I have evolved in my ability to breath deep, not react, and enjoy the sweet struggle that bryan's philosophy focuses on.I noticed that in this CD, Kest's most recent, his philosophy has evolved a little as well. Focusing on keeping attentive to what we are doing and not fidgeting. Giving in to the pose and feeling all of the places it is touching. About an hour and a half of very strong upper and lower body poses. This cd is advanced both physically and mentally. In the final 15 minutes of this practice, bryan leads you through a very simple meditation focused soley on gratitude. Very powerful stuff!I highly recommend this cd to anyone looking to challenge themselves physically and mentally, while focusing on being present, not competing and gratitude.As a side note, the most powerful aspect of Bryan's entire philosophy is how insistent he is about getting out of your ego. In this american culture of materialism, traffic jams and competition, we all have the tendency to get caught up in the rat race and become unconcious. No matter which work out you do, with bryan, you have an opportunity for one hour or whatever to get outside of that, focus on being present, being who you are and where you're at and being ok with it..."},{"Title":"Bryan Kest: Advanced Yoga 2 (CD & Booklet)","review":"I love Bryan Kest! I have been working out to his videos since 1997. I was very fortunate to try his videos first and fall in love with his style of yoga and teaching! Just as I was looking for more, he started releasing cd's of his classes in Santa Monica CA. I was in heaven. First of all, if youre familiar with his Energize, Tone, and Sweat series, which are his original work, this is not that type of class. Those videos are vinyasa style. This cd does not feel very vinyasa to me. Dont get me wrong, its TOUGH! But it doesnt feel like his other classes. That last sentence may only make sense if youre already familiar with Bryans way of teaching.This cd is not for beginners! Its strenuous and long! (2 hours!) But its a great addition to an already existing routine. I like to do one of Bryans early videos and then maybe a little cardio. You'll be too tired for that here. But this workout is all you'll need!Another welcomed change is Bryans attitude about the body. In his early videos it was more about the poses. Now he takes the time to stress the importance of health. I, too, am less concerned with six pack abs. I want my whole body to feel good.One of the things people complain about most is Bryans talking. I've always said that this man has a lot to say and actually cares about people. Listen to him, you'll learn a lot!As I said earlier, only buy this cd if you already pratice yoga 3-4 times a week already. Otherwise, you're just going to burn out. This isnt the type of cd you can do daily.

The down side was I found several errors that would cause the inexperienced reader (with HTTP, HTML, and Web Servers) some headaches but nothing that would have caused more than a few minutes of puzzlement. So perhaps 4-1/2 Stars. Get this book; Apache: The Definitive Guide; and a good HTML book and you are off to becoming a great Web Server Administrator."},{"Title":"Apache Server 2 Bible","review":"Apache Server Bible is a well organized reference that provides extensive detail information (this is a good thing)"},{"Title":"Apache Server 2 Bible","review":"This is a book to have if you use Apache Server.

After revealing a few examples, we are ready to forgive the cynicism.The title is a word play. The stories are all about the various owner/collectors of the object in question, which the bowl considers to be a string of collections of its own.The story opens with the bowl currently in the hands of Rosa, a romantically desperate young Londoner who works for an auction agency that has acquired the piece and is estimating and appraising it, a job that falls to Rose. Rosa is a perfect fit for the task as she possesses some latent extrasensory capabilities that allow her to sense the bowls stories and experiences, which both stimulate and distract her. The primary distraction is from Nikki, her temporary roommate who is a psycho maniac slowly stealing Rosa blind behind her back.This book is not quite up to Fischer's usual standards, and that is, I believe, a matter of a fault in construction. Fischer never seems to be sure if this is a novel or a book of short stories with a theme. As a result, the narrative exists somewhere in between and this leads to some awkwardness and disjointedness throughout the text.That criticism notwithstanding, the book nevertheless provides considerable pleasure simple by allowing us to share once again in Fischer's somewhat skewed and cosmically comic world view. The man may not always be polished but he is always funny.On the whole, a pleasant diversion but not even close to Fischer at his best."},{"Title":"The Collector Collector","review":"This is another book review from Wolfie and Kansas, the boonie dogs from Toto, Guam. The narrator of Tibor Fischer's novel &quot;The Collector Collector&quot; is a 5,000-year old ceramic bowl. (Since the bowl never divulges its name, we'll refer to it below as Mr. Bowl.) Mr. Bowl relates both its present-day adventures with Rosa, a London art appraiser, and numerous tales about other humans it has known in the past several millenia.This book is very clever, and sometimes laugh-out-loud funny. The modern human characters and the situations they get themselves into are consistently amusing. Some of Mr. Bowl's flashbacks are fascinating. There is only one thing missing here. In 5,000 years of existence, Mr. Bowl apparently never served as a dog food bowl. At least he does not recount any tales of memorable canines. Don't Mr. Bowl and Mr. Fischer know that the two most famous bowls or bowl-like objects in the history of literature are a Grecian urn--and Snoopy's supper dish"},{"Title":"The Collector Collector","review":"This is my least favorite of Fischer's body of work. The symbolism, while noteworthy, seems forced and often times overemphasized. Some of the anecdotes interspersed in the story (a trademark of Fischer's) seem repetitive and not up to the quality of their counterparts in his other novels. Fischer seems to be mired in bizarre sexual exploits for the sake of sexual exploits alone. When put alongside some of the really exceptional sketches in this book, the more modest ones appear conspicuously inferior.Nevertheless, this is a witty, amusing book that I still found enjoyable, despite its shortcomings. With a finale that is so endearing and uncharacteristically optimistic, you will put down the book with a feeling of satisfaction. Even a low point for Fischer is something that many writers can only wish to accomplish."},{"Title":"The Collector Collector","review":"I can't make up my mind whether this book was written in the tradition of Pynchon and Barth to be taught in college English classes rather than read, or whether it's a Martin Amis-style wink-and-a prayer pot boiler with pretensions. The idea of having the narrator be a thousands-of-years-old bowl who comments on the action by relating stories of previous owners is rich in narrative possibility, which Fischer eschews in favor of semi-clever word play. The near total reliance on scenes of sexual activity and drug use to advance the narrative is a major fault. A better writer might have been able to pull it off but Fischer never gets beyond the banality of hipness."},{"Title":"The Collector Collector","review":"Who wouldn't love a talking bowl? Tibor Fischer's offbeat plot and attractive prose easily carry this breezy book through a series of not-too-adventurous adventures. It's fun to read, but there isn't a lot of meat."},{"Title":"The Collector Collector","review":"Like a Pot Noodle, it'll do in a pinch. I hope Tibor picks up the game next time around.Frugal.What's a Lugal, Dougal?"},{"Title":"The Collector Collector","review":"I won't synopsize, as you can find that anywhere. Tibor has written three excellent novels: Under The Frog, The Thought Gang, and The Collector Colletor. Even if you have been disappointed by his other works, do not write him off until you have tried one or more of these three. I recommend them in that order. All bitterly funny, all astonishingly original, all deeply memorable, all vastly superior to his more recent efforts."},{"Title":"The Collector Collector","review":"This is one of the best books ever! From the very beginning it's an amazingly entertaining piece of storytelling. It has a decidedly british tone to it.. which takes a few pages to sink into. But once that hurdle is vaulted, you're in for a nearly constant chuckle-fest for probably 90% of the rest of the book.The protagonist's attitude, the situations, the descriptions! Ughh.. I simply loved traversing through the language play of every page. It's so quotable. So fresh. So much fun.. I bet it would be a great book to read aloud - in spite of the many breaks for extended laughter that will have to be taken.The only reason it doesn't get a full 5 stars is because toward the end.. well, it starts to fizzle and drag. His delivery seems more rushed and dry, becoming needlessly repetitive. It's like he doesn't quite know what to do with his characters after a while.. or what the dialog should be devoted to. He does wrap the plot up in some way or another - just not with the panache available to the rest of the book.I SO COMPLETELY recommend this book to everyone. Oh, and have a dictionary handy. The vocabulary used is quite a bit beyond most things I've read lately."},{"Title":"The Collector Collector","review":"Forget about all the bowl jokes and the fact that the narrator is one. This book is not about crockery. It's about humans. Mr. Fischer has the amazing ability to pick up odd human traits and use them the exploit this mad mad mad world we find ourselves in. By using a narrator that's thousands of years old Fischer can really show us how silly our lives--and the things we fill them with--are.The book was laugh out loud funny and a page turner (quite cliche, I know, but's it's monday morning). I brought it to parties with me and sat in the corner to read it while everyone else was dancing. Actually, I'm glad I finished it--now I can have my life back. Be warned, it's a dangerous book."},{"Title":"The Collector Collector","review":"A quite enjoyable escape from reality. Mr. Fischer is a master of the English language. His use of elaborate descriptions of people and objects is extremely visual.If you have been endowed with an imagination and would like to give it a good, brisk walk, read this book."},{"Title":"The Collector Collector","review":"In a world where I am constantly amazed and sometimes irritated by the inability of the average writer to obtain a firm grasp on the English language, this book is a refreshing reminder of its power to prod the imagination. The Collector Collector is amusing and penetrating in the observations it makes on the human condition throughout time. All this by way of a multi-faceted bowl. Absolutely lovely bit of prose."},{"Title":"The Collector Collector","review":"A lovely, charming, exciting book that kept me turning pages faster and faster. Two changes in Billy's life occur on the same day. He is about to loose the most important things in his life.

I dare you"},{"Title":"The Collector Collector","review":"This book is funny and smart. As others have noted, it isn't War &amp; Peace, or Ulysses, either. More like a very adult, edgy comic book. However, this male-written female perspective on males and other females really rings true (or else the women I work with and to whom I am often invisible have been putting me on all these years). This turned out to be the most fascinating aspect of the book, and I think it is no small achievement."},{"Title":"The Collector Collector","review":"A boastful narrative by a sentient, if autistic, millennia-old piece of pottery with a taste for wordplay, improbable sexual escapades and shape-changing. No, you read all of that right.The style smacks of Gabriel Garcia Marquez comparing writing chops with Salman Rushdie while trying out for a Bridget Jones Philosophy of Unmarried Life competition.On the face of it, a bowl that's been around for most of human history encounters Rosa, a human with a facility for imbibing its visions via an osmosis-like effect while in tactile contact with it. The bowl can also absorb Rosa's emotions and memories while selectively feeding her reminiscences about its eventful past. Rosa is seeking love in London but is singularly unsucessful; she has kidnapped an agony aunt columnist and is keeping her imprisoned in a well in the hope of consultation on how to find Mr. Right. Nikki, an adventuress with a taste for sexual escapades, robbery and general immorality foists herself on Rosa as a flatmate. Rosa has a best friend called Lettuce whose chief purpose in life appears to be to indiscriminately eat whatever is in Rosa's kitchen and be impervious to Rosa's insults. Nikki has a guardian angel called Lump, who seems to be a bit of female walking dead, the approximate size and disposition of a Sherman tank. And there is a jar of beetroot pickle that nobody can open.I'm sorry if this all sounds a bit disjointed and bizarre. That's probably because it is.Now, Mr Douglas Adams was every bit as inventive and wacky (more so, arguably) in his misnumbered trilogy in five parts (The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy) but he was never irritating. And he did have a point at the end of all those bizarre quantum goings-on. (Namely, 42.)Unfortunately, with Mr Fischer, the cleverness with words and the relentless enumeration of past encounters begins to jar (pun unintended) by about the fifth page and you wish the bowl would put a lid on it. There are bizarre reminiscences that serve no purpose other than to highlight Mr Fischer's facility with words. And at the end of all the bizarre ceramic goings-on, there is no point. Probably because a bowl has no point to begin with.3 stars for some ingenious word usage (particularly, \\"florida\\" as a euphemism for human congress.) I'm in a generous mood because of the music I'm listening to."},{"Title":"The Collector Collector","review":"For those of you looking for a strong central plot, beware. This book does not fall victim to the typical novel outline used by the majority of today's authors. This book is written by a man who has dared to use his intelligence and wit to create a novel that is viciously satirical in its plays on words and odd story lines while simultaneously keeping the reader entranced with its modern edge and style that can only be compared with a bizaare hybrid of Shakespeare and Chuck Palahniuk (writer of &quot;Fight Club&quot;). For all of you who require a bit of a challenge with your recreational reading, this book is both strange and delicious in its approach."},{"Title":"The Collector Collector","review":"I enjoyed Fischer's book &quot;The Thought Gang&quot;. A lot, actually. Unfortunately, for its first half, &quot;The Collector Collector&quot; did not live up to that book's standards. It lacked its narrative thrust and rollicking sense of humour. Hindsight tells me that I just wasn't getting Fischer's intent. I now see that he wrote a demented, perverted, and hyper-articulate version of &quot;Bridget Jones' Diary&quot;, where the female protagonists are as likely to maim and murder their sexual conquests, as fall in love with them. Also, there's a professional matchmaker trapped down a well by a dissatisfied customer, and many frozen iguanas. This is all filtered through the magic-realist perspective of the main character, a 5,000-year-old bowl. Who can read minds. And change shapes. If none of this makes sense to you, I take full blame, for Fischer manages to hold it all together perfectly.On the surface, there's much here to giggle at, and think about. But underneath all that, there's also a lot of loneliness in the book. People are constantly running from or pushing away romantic partners, for inexplicable reasons. Rosa, in whose London flat much of the action takes place, is desperate for every man she meets to fall in love with her. Contrast this with Nikki, a kleptomaniac/prostitute/houseguest, who doesn't even know what kind of happiness she wants. And then we have our narrator, the bowl, who appears to have witnessed the entirety of human history, and has an endless catalogue of human characteristics stored away, but can't speak with those around him (her?).There's really not much story here to hang your hat on. The book is a series of quick scenes, tableaus, culled from Rosa and Nikki's everyday life interspersed with stories from the bowl's memory. I found that hard to handle at first, but got used to the style after a while. And in the end, even though I didn't enjoy it as much as &quot;The Thought Gang&quot;, I still got a kick out of &quot;The Collector Collector&quot;."},{"Title":"The Collector Collector","review":"&quot;The Collector Collector&quot; is a veritable, dark comic medley about life, love, success, failure, etc... Fischer, like Tom Robbins (and a semi-obscure writer named J. Joyce) before him, uses unbridled structural imagination and hybridization as the central vehicles to express his protagonist's vaguely normal existence in a sea of eccentricity. This book deserves considerable attention, if nothing else, for the author's choice of narrator; the wise and discerning urn. For all it's whimsical satire, this novel presents deep sobering insight into contemporary society."},{"Title":"The Collector Collector","review":"After reading &quot;Under the Frog,&quot; this is the sort of successor that I expected from Tibor Fischer. Where &quot;The Thought Gang&quot; stroked toward Sterne's end of the pool, losing itself (I believe) in an excess of excess, &quot;The Collector Collector&quot; is Rabelaisian through and through. Panurge has become a bowl with a real animus for Gorgon crockery, and his companion (however briefly) is Rosa, not on a journey to Lanternland, but on a quest for just one decent fellow to share her life with (an interesting twist on Rabelais' tale, where it is Panurge who seeks advice on marriage).There were times I laughed so hard (the Mad Poets collection) that I was incapacitated for many minutes afterward, and there were other times (Rosa alone in her hotel room in Australia, too depressed to do anything but breathe) that I was taken once again at how adept Mr. Fischer is at juxtaposing robust, often black humor with scenes of such unaffected poignancy.An exquisite book."},{"Title":"The Collector Collector","review":"When I started this book, I expected it to be along the lines of Under the Frog. It is, yet only slightly. The protagonist, Rosa, is your typical woman. She is simply an art collector and appraiser who comes into a piece of 5,000 year old earthenware. Her simplicity and \\"goody two shoes\\" attitude are sharply contrasted with the presence of the nymphomaniac klepto Nikki. This contrast provides the basis for the book as the bowl (who is also the narrator) is given ample opportunity to hearken back to the stories of the bowl's past 5,000 years of life. The stories related are funny as is the interplay between Nikki,Rosa [...].All in all, a GREAT read. YOU HAVE TO READ THIS BOOK!Hmmmm, what to read next? The Thought Gang.Happy reading [....]"},{"Title":"The Collector Collector","review":"&quot;I've had a planetful,&quot; begins the narrator of this comical novel, which is no understatement for an ancient ceramic bowl which knows some 5000 languages and which has seen the whole of human history happen past. This is a &quot;bowl with soul&quot; that knows it all, from the ubiquity of frozen iguanas to the secret symbolism of earrings, from the two-hundred and eighty-four types of buttocks to the ninety-two types of surprise to the ten unceasing conversations.Leave it to the off-kilter imagination of Tibor Fischer to make a piece of curmudgeonly pottery the hero of his 3rd book. And, if you think about it, you can forget about the proverbial fly-on-the-wall: sentient crockery *would* make the ultimate unseen observer. Rarely do people look around &amp; wonder if the earthenware is listening in.But Mr. Fischer isn't content to let the idea of an (ostensibly) inanimate narrator sink in before he starts throwing the reader curve-after-screwball in! ! his inimitably rarefied-but-no-less-pungent style. Enter Rosa, a lovelorn art-appraiser with the ability to &quot;divine&quot; the history of objects. Enter Nikki, a nymphomaniacal kleptomaniac who aspires to circus stardom. Enter Lump, less an ex-lover of Nikki's than a protective Golem, more undead than living. Enter a kidnapping, some thefts, and not a few couplings.Now read on as these and a host of other colorful denizens &amp; complications (both past &amp; present) move through what is essentially a pot's-eye view of humanity's endless struggles with the most basic of dilemmas, illustrated with hilarious asides &amp; boiled down to one final question: Who finds true love?Give The Collector Collector a gander. In it, you'll find true entertainment."},{"Title":"The Collector Collector","review":"This isn't Nabokov, but Fischer sure knows how to tell an amusing story. The 1st person perspective in this one is fresh and fun. The plot serves more to give the Collector Collector a reason to reminisce than to hold the story together, but the Collector Collector holds it together just fine. The characters are almost cartoonish, but not overly silly.This is a great book if you're looking for a light, amusing read. I enjoyed it a lot."},{"Title":"The Collector Collector","review":"The beginning of this story wasn't as interesting as I had expected, but as you read on and get engrossed in the story, it becomes a truly enjoyable experience.

Tibor Fischer is brilliant.I hate spoiling things so I am typing adequate words to fulfill the review requirement."},{"Title":"The Collector Collector","review":"Imagine a sentient piece of crockery that has had thousands of years to observe and pontificate on the human condition - O the stories it could tell. What a wonderful potential there is in this idea. Fischer most certainly has a black gift for words and satire, but wastes it by overemphasizing the sadder aspects of human sexuality. When in doubt, talk about sex.The titular character, the bowl in question, catalogs and enumerates the various type of human body types and behaviours, , but more importantly it collects the memories of the people who collect it. Enter Rosa, an appraiser for an auction house who has the gift of being able to lay her hands on an object and extract the stories it has to tell. The bowl resists, feeding her selective tales to amuse, but leaving her unaware of its awareness.In story includes a fools parade of various sordid individuals. Nikki is a grifter who has wormed her way into Rosa's apartment, stealing nearly everything in dribs and drabs, and who's life is unwrapped as progressively perverse. She's followed around by the agents of former johns who seek to kill her, and is protected by the massive 300 pound Lump, a former female lover with diminutive angel's wings, whom Nikki has previously shot dead. Dead bodies pile up as a sideshow. The insanely rich, paranoid and fat Marius wishes to buy the bowl and traipses into the story. The most \\"normal\\" person is Lettuce, Rosa's friend who's problem is finding the right sort of relationship. Rosa herself is luckless in love and has trapped an advice columnist in a well, promising to release her only if she actually provides advice that will help her find a normal relationship that will make her happy.Fischer is an acquired taste that leaves one with mixed feelings. At times erotic, but mostly not. The tale of the undying man and that of Odile who always just missed being historic and her collection of mad poets were relatively good, but others such as the tale of the sea captain, like the story itself went nowhere - self referential irony perhaps, but somewhat flat.

On this night the great Chicago fire of 1872 starts and she begins to realize that her family is more important than all the riches she has dreamed about wanting. In an attempt to reach her family, she helps a convict who tried to rob her, helps save a church, helps rescue people.Dylan Kennedy is the talk of Chicago society, handsome, from a wealthy Boston family, charming and a total fraud. Kathleen met him at the society gather she attended the evening of the fire and drew his attention. During the fire, he finds her and rescues a child from a burning building, helps her save the church and when they find end up trapped in city hall he marries her, thinking they will not survive the night. He finds a tunnel and along with the convict, priest, mayor and judge they do escape.The story goes on and in the end they renew their vows at the rebuilt church and the book ends with them happily married.The story is fiction, placed in an actual historic event. The author's details of the fire and the destruction are impressive and bring an event in history to life. In my opinion that is the point of historical fiction to make history real through make believe. Both characters are developed quickly and in depth with all of the supporting characters being true to human flaws and human interactions of love, caring and righteousness. This was a book that I enjoyed and if you are a fan of historical fiction, in my opinion, you will enjoy this story."},{"Title":"The Mistress (Mira)","review":"The Chicago Fire Trilogy books are the best stories relating to the gigantic fire that nearly destroyed the whole city.

Not entirely good, she \\"faked\\" her position in the beginning of the book, but certainly not all bad. She seemed real to me. Wanting more, as we all do, but in the end realizing that what she most wanted, Dylan, had nothing to so with money.Dylan was also likable because he had survived so much.

As much as I enjoyed &quot;The Hostage&quot;, I loved &quot;The Mistress&quot; even more.Kathleen O'Leary has always yearned to be a part of the glittering, upper-class world that she only saw second-hand through her work as a lady's maid. With a keen interest in business and a love for the finer things in life, she feels that she doesn't fit in with her Irish, working class family. While pretending to be the lady of her dreams at a party, she meets the dashingly handsome Dylan Francis Kennedy. The two are immediately smitten, but we soon learn that Dylan is not all that he seems, either. Not only is he not a moneyed gentleman, he is a longtime con artist and swindler, determined to get at the money that he thinks Kathleen has.What I loved about this story is that it shows how people's dreams and desires change. In the wake of the Chicago Fire, Kathleen realizes that her family--not her yearning for things material--is the most important thing in her life. Her love for them and pride in her heritage give her great strength and the courage to fight for her man and their future together.

He trusts no one and needs instant cash that she cannot provide while she continues to shower him with love.THE MISTRESS is an enjoyable Americana romance that centers on the aftermath of the Chicago fire. The story line uses real events and people to propel the entertaining romance to its climax. The lead couple will receive reader empathy as they learn the importance of being truthful as well as earnest in a relationship. However, what makes Susan Wiggs' tale a cut above the norm is the intricate look at survivors whose prize for minor success is clinging to life one day at a time.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Mistress (Mira)","review":"Wow- this book read like an eyewitness account of the Great Fire of Chicago in 1871 and the rebuilding that followed for months afterwards. Seeing the events through the eyes of Kathleen, Dylan, Bull and other characters in this story gave it life, and made it real and tangible to the reader! The fire blazed off the pages and I could feel its heat.The romance was almost secondary. I loved the character of Kathleen. Part-Cinderella and part-My Fair Lady, she was a maid who attended a society event and passed herself off as a Lady. She was feisty, brave and proud. Someone to admire for more than her outward beauty. Dylan was a bit harder to like - too rough around the edges and too set on an unscrupulous lifestyle, determined not to change. But in his heroism, he showed caring and a softer-side. Lots of sexy scenes. Maybe too many. Unfortunately, the story seemed to drag a bit during these scenes, and they could have been condensed to make the it flow better through the more important historical events.The lesson Katie taught Dylan, that the riches of love and family is worth more than money, is something those of us who are products of a material society need to reflect more upon."},{"Title":"The Mistress (Mira)","review":"Well, I loved this author's last book, THE HOSTAGE, and I wanted to love this one, too. It's totally different, but it left me with the same warm-inside feeling as the first one. It's a story about figuring out who you are and what's most important in life. This book surprised me in several places. Truly satisfying, I would reccommend it to anyone!"},{"Title":"The Mistress (Mira)","review":"Kathleen O'Leary took the chance with a borrowed dress and jewels, and fell in love with Dylan Kennedy, a wealthy and desired bachelor. So the story ends here, right? Of course not... it's a romance, and we must have turbulence, passion, fire (ha! no pun intended...)! Both were not what they pretended to be, and through a heedless marriage the truth comes out. What's a 12:01 Cinderalla and a dethroned Prince Charming to do?It's a story about how you can find your identity, your peace, in the one you love, and how unlikely that love can sometimes be; it's not unlike The Charm School, another book by Wiggs, that paired together a hero and a heroine that, under normal circumstances, wouldn't even have looked at each other on the street. Well-written and heartwarming, set against the famous fire in Chicago and the stunning effects it had on people's (real and fiction) lives, The Mistress is a lovely, polished gem to spend your day with."},{"Title":"The Mistress (Mira)","review":"Could this be a true version of how that horrible fire in 1871 started? Add romance Cinderella style, minus Prince Charming and instead insert an unscrupulous rake, out to steal Cinderella's (non-existant) fortune and the story unfolds.This is my first Susan Wiggs novel; but it won't be my last! I was captivated by the unusual storyline, however not being a avid romance reader, felt it bogged down a little in the middle.I wanted them to quit making love and get on with the action! The action being; how two penniless people are going to overcome the tragedy of the century, stay together long enough to find their trust and become prosperous!"},{"Title":"The Mistress (Mira)","review":"I picked this book up thinking it would be an interesting alternative to the typical historical romance novels. And don't get me wrong it is. The maid and the cheat - not your typical stuff. Kathleen's character and transformation are well developed. Her regrets and realizations touch every dreamer's desires. However, falling so deeply in love, after just one night (no matter the infernal fires) is just not real; it is gullible, perhaps addressing the gullibility of Kathleen, or may be a quick way to fill the pages of a novel. And Dylan, I mean really, a charming character at first - and wildly so throughout - carefree and uninhibited. But for someone who is so fallen, unlike the pious female, he seems to be altered quiet unnoticeably. He revisits childhood disappointments and adulthood squanders, but for some reason the driving force for his alteration (because of Kathleen) was not noticed by me. A very materialistic man, and a very materialistic woman - however, one, because of her faith, sees her errors after walking through the fires of hell (very Jane Eyre-ish) and the other because of what - trying to impress a fake heiress??? Or a woman who promises him nothing but great sex? It just didn't ring true for me."},{"Title":"The Mistress (Mira)","review":"Kathleen Bridget O'Leary doesn't just weave a fantasy in her mind....she works to make her dreams come true. However, even in the best of her dreams she never conjured up any man as dashing, good looking, or as captivating as Dylan Kennedy. He surpasses everything she ever expected or dreamed of in giving her heart over to a man. However, there are a few little problems with this wonderful rogue. He has made an art of lying and he doesn't know what love is. Kate has her work cut out for her as she struggles to not only survive the great Chicago fire of 1871 and its aftermath, but to also prove to Dylan that love does exist.I haven't been so totally immersed in a book or loved the characters like I have those in &quot;The Mistress in a very long time. This is the first novel by Susan Wiggs I've read and she immediately climbed to the top of my list of favorite authors. So, if you have this book....curl up and enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Mistress (Mira)","review":"This is book 2 of the Chicago Fire Trilogy by Susan Wiggs. I have to say I had a really hard time getting into the story because Dylan is such a reprehensible character.Kathleen O'Leahry - the daughter of Catherine O'Leahry who's cow was said to kick over a lantern that started the 1871 fire - works as maid. When her mistress takes ill, she becomes part of a \\"Social Experimental.\\"Dressed in borrowed clothing and jewels, she's taken to a party and introduced as a heiress - one of the Baltimore Leahrys. She seems to be pulling it off, attracting the attention of Dylan Kennedy, the most eligible bachelor in Chicago.But Kennedy is not what he seems, he's a two-bit con artist who preys on young heiresses.The pair are thrust together during the fire, and must count on one another for survival, but while Kathleen is eaten up over her deception and tries to tell Dylan, Dylan continues to believe he's nabbed himself the heiress of his dreams, and has not qualms about taking her money.Wiggs tries to make Dylan more likable - having him rescue a child from a burning building, among other things - but he just rubbed me the wrong way.The sting at the end of the story is pretty fun though, so once you get past the first part of the book, it's pretty easy going. This is also a great book if don't like the heavily detailed steamy scenes in some other novels. Kennedy and Kathleen do have sex, but it's largely glossed over.While the story line is fictional, the historical information regarding the fire is extremely well researched and accurate.And just for the record, no, the cow didn't start the fire. Wiggs goes with the stray spark theory, which is one of two theories as to how the fire got started.'"},{"Title":"The Mistress (Mira)","review":"Oh, this book. I want this to be my life. I was so much like Kathleen, wanting things so bad and thinking once I got them my life would be perfect. But no - THIS is perfect, to have someone care about you the way Dylan did, even when he was trying not to. To love what you have, not crave what you lack. This sounds like a sappy country song but read this book, its not sapy, it's very real and so right-on about the way love works in the real world. If this is romance than I'm a fan."},{"Title":"The Mistress (Mira)","review":"I was captivated from the very start. This story makes you sit back and think about yourself and what is really important in life. I loved it! I have found a new author to add to my favorites list!"},{"Title":"Multicultural Politics: Racism, Ethnicity, and Muslims in Britain (Contradictions of Modernity)","review":"Tariq Modood's Multicultural Politics: Racism, Ethnicity, and Muslims in Britain is a significant contribution in the study of contemporary Europe and its treatment of minorities. The book's focus on Muslims, who comprise the largest minority in both Britain and Europe, is an added plus. The book comes out in a time many Western analysts discuss the future of Western Muslims. Modood takes the discussion beyond Europe to include comparisons with the situation in the United States.Modood broadens the discussion of multiculturalism to include a focus on secularism. He argues that \\"fundamentalist\\" secularist ideology that is anti-religion has had an adverse impact on the treatment of religious minorities. As a result, Muslims for example have faced stagnation in upward mobility. The current challenge to Britian's treatment of its Muslims is to assure that these new Britons are able to advance like their white Christian cohorts. The alternative, of course, is the emergence of a second-class citizenry group.The irony of this bleak prospect is that is has been enhanced despite a growing participation of the new minorities, particularly Muslims, in British and other European public discourses. Modood argues that this Muslim assertiveness should lead to a rethinking of what pluralism means in today's European societies. The new thinking must include a fresh look at the secular state as it attempts to offer greater inclusion for religious minorities. Here Modood opens up a new line of inquiry that integrates sociology and political science. Multicultural Politics is a must reading for those who are serious about considering the status of minorities in the new Europe and the future of Islam in the West."},{"Title":"Multicultural Politics: Racism, Ethnicity, and Muslims in Britain (Contradictions of Modernity)","review":"Multicultural Politics is a VERY worthwhile read. Modood challenges traditional conceptions of identity and racism by exploring the experience of South Asian Muslims in Britain. He seeks to achieve an understanding of society that is \\"anchored in the comprehension of agents themselves.\\" The most persistent voice is his own, which infuses his arguments with the passion of a child whose \\"privileged middle-class life\\" in Pakistan was disrupted by his family's immigration to Britain in 1961.After analyzing ethnic statistics in Britain, Modood argues that the divide is not a black-white divide but \\"a divide between white, Chinese, African Asian, and Indian men on the one hand, and Bangladeshi, Pakistani, and Caribbean men on the other.\\" Referencing the 20% of whites under 35 who admitted to being prejudiced against Asians in the 1986 Survey Report, Modood argues that this prejudice is primarily against Muslims and that \\"cultural racism\\" exists in tandem with and often as a second step to \\"color racism.\\" While a quarter of whites attend a place of worship at least once a month, two-thirds of Muslims attend at least once a week. These statistics form the basis of Modood's claim that the movement to eliminate color racism excluded Asians by lumping them into the \\"black\\" category with which they could not identify.\\"In locating oneself within a hostile society,\\" Modood writes, \\"one must begin with one's mode of being, not one's mode of oppression.\\" Modood cites evidence of Britain's \\"hostile society\\" in the BNP, adverse immigration laws, and \\"Paki-bashing\\" in the police force when Muslims confront the highest level of attacks on person and property. He also alleges discrimination against Muslims in education and employment. Muslims are underrepresented in prestigious jobs, and a BBC Radio experiment discovered that identical CVs submitted to 50 firms yielded interviews for 23% of applicants with white names compared to 9% with Muslim names. Modood also points to indirect discrimination that favors locals, requires work on Friday's, or frowns upon Muslim dress. However, he rejects Rex's theory that ethnicity is artificially determined by group conflict and Smith's theory that it is formed by resistance to oppression. Ethnicity is not, as Miles contends, a \\"false doctrine\\" and it is not \\"voluntary,\\" as Banton suggests. Modood asserts that real collectivities exist, and defines them through five dimensions, including \\"cultural distinctiveness\\" and \\"identity.\\"He extends this analysis by arguing for a \\"state policy of multiculturalism\\" that views the country as more than a liberal association of autonomous individuals. He asserts the \\"positive right\\" of minorities to \\"share in the public domain, including law, in order to live by communal values even where those values run counter to majority values and lifestyles.\\" While criticizing the effective \\"establishment\\" of Anglicanism in the British constitution, he argues that radical secularism also privileges the dominant ethnic group by forcing minorities to follow its normative legal ideal. Instead he proposes a \\"plural state,\\" which recognizes both communities and individuals as actors and gives the former \\"a formal representation or administrative role\\" to play in the state, thereby offering a holistic emotional identity.Modood's proposal fails to take Islam's pluralism into account. The very act of \\"institutionalizing some public space for religions\\" runs contrary to his fluid concept of identity. Modood asserts that he does not believe in \\"discrete, bounded populations of cultural absolutes\\" and expects a group to \\"change, develop, adopt, borrow, and synthesize\\". His proposal would marginalize minorities within Islam by creating a formal dialogue in the public sphere. Who will represent the Shi'a? Who will represent the 50% of Muslims who do not approve of state-funding for parochial schools or the youth who continue to identify with Islam without speaking South Asian languages, attending a mosque, or having arranged marriages?A second cause for concern lies in Modood's definition of incitement to religious hatred. He compares the statement \\"Jesus Christ was a homosexual\\" with \\"Prophet Muhammad was a lewd, dishonest, dissembling power seeker\\" and concludes that the former is permissible but that the latter isn't because it criticizes a belief that is \\"part of the primary self-identification of a group.\\" By forcing speech to contribute to \\"constructive dialogue,\\" Modood places speech under subjective control. This act is a slippery slope to stifling academic inquiry. The ability of subversives within a religion to challenge the ascendant interpretation is essential to its fluid identity. Like his call for a \\"plural state,\\" restricting offensive speech hardens the boundaries of identity that Modood ostensibly prefers remain \\"soft.\\""},{"Title":"Rex","review":"This book is perfect for the young reader who hasn't yet outgrown their obsession with dinosaurs.

In other words, it's both educational and adventuresome, good for boys approaching their teen-age years. But this story of a boy and his dinosaur friend is also perfect bedtime reading for parents.

When their possessions are sent back to the family, Davy is given his mother's music box which accidentally has the egg hidden in it. For contrast, there is also the evil archeologist, Professor Berenson that is fairly certain that Davy has this creature while attempting to force Davy to give the dinosaur to him. The adventures develop friendships, trusts, and even include professional wrestling.REX is such a humorous and lovable character that I found myself wanting to be a part of the story. Davy is a believable 6th-grade student that has problems very typical for his age. The weakest character was the grandmother which I found to be rather inattentive and often disinterested. The other supporting characters were very well established with each one having their own distinct personality.The book is very fast-paced and constantly made me wonder how each situation was going to be resolved. The reading level is at about the 6th grade and definitely a book that would interest boys.

It is for the runner or skier or triathlete looking to take there game to the next level . I'm looking for a new edition to the book because it can be improved upon as technology has changed a bit.

It is a book for serious and dedicated athletes, who must plan everything. The weakness of this book is that it is not for casual athletes regardless of what the previous reviewers would have you believe. The second weakness of this book is you have to be able to speak the lingua franca of serious athletic training, which I guess I do not. A third issue I have with this book is that when I tried it, it took the fun out of just riding. I'm still riding but I'm not training for racing except for longer endurance races like a half century or a century ride. A better book to buy if you are trying to cycle to lose weight is Racing Weight by Matt Fitzgerald, which is avalailable on this site. Racing Weight advises beginners, like I used to be when I bought Serious Training for Endurance Athletes, to exercise based on what you love to do, which is how eventually you will lose the weight you want to trim off.

Sometimes you don't know what you're going to get when everyone gives a book 5 stars. Sometimes it's hard to get an unbiased review.I was pleased with the book and what others have said is true. I recommend this book to endurance athletes looking for reasons and explanations on why to train a certain way and what it will do for your body in the long run.However, I am a competetive rower and there were few topics that took rowing into account. Most of the training is geared towards running/cycling/triathetes and not specific to rowing as much as I was hoping. Also, there is way too little emphasis on resistance training. Most of the book is about setting up a mathmatical training plan and says to devote time sparingly to strength training. I'm not an expert on other sports, but I do know that power through strength training is vital for a strong pull on those oars. I suggest devoting more time in the SERIOUS formula to weight training in the gym than the book suggests, especially in the early training weeks.As for the rest of the book, it's great, but it takes a *LOT* of paperwork. Fortunately my wife is handy with MS Excel and plotted all the charts for me with forulas that makes it all easy. However, without her I know that I would be daunted and discouraged at the task of making all the charts and calculations by hand. In a future updated edition (I hope that they make one) the book should come with a CDROM loaded with all the charts and formulas, or at least a web site link for downloading them. In the 21st century it's good practice to have online content and I hope to see it with this great text book."},{"Title":"Serious Training for Endurance Athletes 2nd","review":"Whilst this book is aimed primarily at the serious endurance athlete, I wish to widen its appeal after having used the book to good effect at the age of 59. Consequently, I would suggest you do not allow yourself to be restricted by the title because you do not have to be a competitive endurance athlete to gain maximum profit from this work.Nowadays, my own memories of winning the regimental mile (and in a very credible time!) are very distant. Nevertheless, I still go running with a pack on my back (old airborne habits die very hard!) as the battle of mind vs middle age spread enters the hardest phase yet. It is a fact that the older one gets, the harder all physical training becomes. This book, however, proved its worth in the first few pages by showing me an easier way to obtain similar results. After all, the book commences with; \\"Consider your own objectives.\\" Says it all really.There are many times in life when we all believe we know best and never more so than when it comes to physical training, but, consider this; If such training was as simple as just going for a jog, then why are others obtaining university degrees in the subject with some gaining high paid employment - especially in the field of sports injuries. The reality is, we who go for a run (and often do nothing else!) are not gaining maximum benefit from all that hard work.Whilst the focus of the book remains the serious endurance athlete - and from which all such people will gain enormously from a thorough study of the content, I was particularly impressed by the way in which the book is able to benefit those of a lesser standard. There is no point in boring people with a blow-by-blow account of my own physical condition because no two people are alike. Nevertheless, if this work can be of great assistance to me - in my 60th year!, then there is something here for anyone with a wish to improve their own physical abilities and, therefore, their own appearance and, ultimately, health.It is a simple fact that when you are fit and slim you not only look good but also feel good about yourself. Such results, however, are not obtained through liposuction, pills or other easy solutions - they are obtained through hard graft and physical endurance. What is important, therefore, is for each individual to start at their own level, understand that level and go on to gain maximum profit from their own physical input and this book shows the way.Lesson one; Do not be embarrassed! Nobody is laughing just because you are wearing a tracksuit. Lesson two; Buy a copy of this book and make a start.

She had gotten counseling for ten years but she needed more therapy than she was getting at the time. She was a \\"Borderline\\" and was unable to separate the idea of detahcmnet, from her rages. Ouch. I was a convenient target of her anger since I was her spouse. I was not an alcoholic then; nor am I now.Her \\"friends\\" told her to use this technique on me - I was not the legitimate target, but she was gullible. For all intents and purposes, this was misusing the technique and if a psychiatrist had advised her to do it, it would have been malpractice. detaching with love turned into detaching with hate. the effect of raging behavior on a spouse, is to shatter that person's self esteem and ability to cope with life.If things ar ethat bad, why stay? there is no reason to stick around. If you are considering doing this to a person, just leave first, no matter what the cost. It will work out, and you may be able to keep the target as a friend someday, instead of driving them away like a wild dog. The inapprorpiate use of this technique nearly drove me to suicide.

I have always been a fan of history, especially that of American history, and great American battles. However, out of the knowledge that I have received from school, never has this approach been introduced. Gloria Miller tells the story of a &quot;middle-American&quot; poor, farm girl from rural Ohio and the effects the war had on her and the people closest to her. Instead of approaching WWII in a manner that we have all heard before, she sees the war from her own eyes, as a naive young woman, whose decisions and actions revolve around this great but horrible time. After reading this book, I have a renwed appreciation for the American people, who banded together in times of dispair, and made the sacrifices that they did. Whether the sacrifices were risking thier lives, or sending mail, America pulled together, and that alone defines greatness."},{"Title":"Fading Voices and Haunting Memories: From the World War II Era","review":"When my parents handed me this book to read several years ago, I was like, oh, it's just another one of those books. You know, books that really aren't all that interesting but my parents thought that they had to share it with me because the author is from my hometown. This past weekend, my mother-in-law wanted to borrow it and my parents started talking again about Mrs. Miller ~~ so, I decided to pick it up and read it.I haven't been able to put it down. The stories in this book are haunting. They are real. They are stories from soldiers who fought in both theaters, the European and the Pacific. They are stories from civilians that remained behind, especially Gloria's stories. The stories weren't elaborate or embellished ~~ they were spoken in the way the soldiers told their stories and they were intimate stories spoken to preserve the memories of the horrors they had seen.I did not find this book to be anything other than educational and preserving the memories, the voices of the men and women who survived that period, for history's sake. It is a honest look at what happened then and it is something I will encourage my children to read when they are older. It is a collection of stories, thoughts and bits of historical facts. It is something that I wish my great-uncles shared with me ~~ one of them was a pilot for the Royal Air Force in England (he signed up long before the draft), and I think there were three others that fought in Europe. Looking at the pictures, I find it hard to believe that what are our Senior Citizens today were at one time thrust upon the theater of the world and fought to preserve the world from lunatics and madmen. Those senior citizens are fast fading and I am grateful for Mrs. Miller's effort in retaining some of these voices for future generations.This is definitely a book to keep for all libraries. I am proud to have read some of the histories of the men from my hometown. It has helped me understand better some of my grandfather's generation's thoughts and dreams, and why they are the way they are. I have a bigger understanding of the sacrifices and turmoil they all have gone through. It is definitely a book I would recommend all serious students of history to read. It's a bit more intimate than the dry tomes that should be required history reading.I am glad that my parents have lent me this book and hope to hear that Mrs. Miller will write another one soon!5-17-06"},{"Title":"Fading Voices and Haunting Memories: From the World War II Era","review":"Fading Voices was quite a volume from a new author and I heartily recommend it to those who are interested in the personal stories behind WW II.

But Gloria Miler's book &quot;Fading Voices and Haunting Memories&quot; does exactly that.

The author has woven together brief chronologies of the events of WWII, as they occurred, interspersed with the individual stories of refugees, veterans, family members and soldiers as they fit into the chronology. These individual narrations are primarily recent, having been done in interviews with the author in the years just preceding this book. This effort is not about the details of battles won and lost so much at it is a very revealing look at the way people adjusted to the challenges of separation, rationing, uncertainty and danger as the war progressed. The personal memoirs provide unusual clarity into the way Americans faced the unknowable and unpredictable as they searched for normality in what was a far from normal time and circumstance. The author tells in significant detail of how she is courted, married and able to transition from her very sheltered life on an Ohio farm to complete independence while her husband is overseas. His story compliments hers as he describes his life in the Pacific theater as a radar technician. What this book does better than most is to put perspective into the lives of \\"ordinary\\" people when confronted with the extraordinary times of a world war, and it will make good reading for those interested in WWII history."},{"Title":"Karlson Flies Again","review":"Karlson is one of Astrid Lindgren's most famous creations. It spans at least 3 books - Karlson on the Roof, Karlson Flies Again and Karlson is Sneaking Around Again (this one being the second).Karlson is a short, fat man with a properller in his back and a button on his belly. He flies around and lives on the roof of a Stockholm suburb. In the series, he befriends what was a lonely boy, the youngest of three children. Karlson is a memorable character who takes pranks to the extreme, as well as slapstick humour, gluttony (especially for sweets) and is generally a happy-go-lucky wiseass who describes himself as \\"a beautiful and pleasingly plump man in his prime\\". Children are not below appreciating ironic humour and this series explores it well as we laught at his pranks while realising the character traits that they are mocking (as they are exaggerated to a childlike extreme - he constantly demands attention, food and is a general drama queen).In this book, the boy explores more of Karlson's world on the roof (including Karlson's endearing \\"portrait of my rabbits\\" which is a picture of a fox!) and the two of them terrorise and are oppressed by Bok - an unpleasant nanny past her middle age that was arranged for the boy while his family are away. A great read for kids from a young age!"},{"Title":"Karlson Flies Again","review":"All three Karlsson books by Astrid Lindgren are children classics, \\"cult\\" books. I can't belive you can only find them in English from used book sellers for $72, $249 and other ridiculous prices.I wonder if those children books publishers ever look at out-of-print books prices. Don't those prices give you some clue on what is in demand?I mean, really, guys - you have lots of immigrants from other countries, especially from China, Japan, Russia, Poland, other European countries, who love and miss that book and wish to buy them now for their own kids. Just estimate, how big is this market, please.I am sure people who were born here would appreciate them too if they were more accessible.You just can't go wrong with publishing the world's most brilliant, famous children classics. Please reprint three Karlson books. And, maybe, you can get a new, better translation too, because the existing one is rather dull, as people who read it told me.Karlsson books/character in my opinion are/is main books/character you recognize Astrid Lidgren by. All others like Pippi longstocking, Ronie, Emil, etc. come after it. While you can find those other books easily in stores and on Amazon, the best one sadly became some kind of rarity.These books are in the same league with Winni the Pooh, Mary Poppins, Wizard of Oz.

That bit of anger helps him kill them, especially women who don't have close family to look for them. Unfortunately, he messed up and messed with one who did have family connections, leading to the two police officers who came aboard to stop him. Factor in a troubled veteran, a dog, more homeless people, a politican, and a Robosupervisor (Robocop+Supervisor) and this story makes for great dialogue, strange behavior, and a decent plot. I enjoyed the book."},{"Title":"A Cold and Silent Dying (Marti Macalister Mysteries)","review":"Homeless people are dying in Lincoln Prairie, Illinois and the big question is does anybody care? Since they are considered the invisible people in society, one less doesn't make a difference. Detectives Marti MacAlister and Vik Jessenovik believe that everyone, regardless of their social standing, deserves justice and are on the case. However, they are running up against a major obstacle in working the case; their overzealous boss has them on a short leash and everything they do is being scrutinized.Lieutenant Gail Nicholson rules with an iron fist and everything is done by the book. Her rules are law and violators will be punished to the fullest extent. As an African-American woman, she is determined to move quickly and efficiently up the chain of command, so she only takes cases that she feels will make her shine. When a series of homeless murders begin to plague Lincoln Prairie, Lt. Nicholson insists that MacAlister and Jessenovik wrap things up as quickly and quietly as possible. She doesn't really feel that the homeless are worthy of the time and money an extensive investigation might cost. In addition to all of this Nicholson sees Marti as a threat because she is a well-respected, popular, black female detective, and Nicholson intends to make her life a living hell.Besides a serial killer, Detective MacAlsiter has other problems. Her best friend's deranged ex-husband, Devonte Lutrell, has revenge on his mind. He blames Marti for ruining his life. Devonte's ultimate goal is to kill Marti, and if anyone gets in the way of that goal, they are as good as dead.A COLD AND SILENT DYING is a story filled with suspense, hate, hubris and compassion. Marti MacAlister is completely dedicated to her job, but at the same time her family is her most important work. Her love for them often gets her through a difficult case. Author Eleanor Taylor Bland has a way of making her character's strong but vulnerable, and she often allows readers into the minds of her characters' I love her writing style; however, in this story, I was disappointed by the ending. It was anticlimactic and I felt as though I were left hanging. With that being said, I'm still a huge fan of her books and look forward to reading more of the Marti MacAlister series.Reviewed by Simone A. Hawksof The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers"},{"Title":"A Cold and Silent Dying (Marti Macalister Mysteries)","review":"A number of changes have flooded Lincoln Prairie's police department. Marti's boss moved up in the heirarchy only to be replaced by a woman who will stomp on those below her to get to the top. She chooses Marti to become her next victim. Things don't get any better. Sharon (Marti's best friend) receives a call from the murderous \\"Mr. Wonderful\\" whom she thought was dead. Mr. Wonderful is not only in the land of the living but wants to make sure that those who thwarted his plans should also be sentenced to death. Add in Vik's wife getting sicker, a number of homeless murders and an alderman keeping a secret, guess what you have? A large group of changes that keep you confused as to what is going on.Our author presents us with some great themes and issues in this new book. The problem is that you're overwhelmed with all of the sidetracks in the story until you wonder what is the main point? Who is the main focus? Why are we chasing one rabbit after another when the first few chapters had us focused. In many parts of the story I felt something was missing as you transitioned from one character to the next. Bland's book was some choppy reading and wasn't that enjoyable. With that said I must commend the author on dealing with the issues of investigation when it comes to the victims being homeless.Should the police waste their time investigating the murder of an indigent person? After all the outstanding citizens in one's community are far more important. The questions raised will make you take a closer look at how justice is served on all levels of our society. Another issue is that of a small town that has now grown to a point where murders have gotten to the point of being common. How does a community deal with those changes? Again, interesting issues are raised but get lost in the quagmire of changes."},{"Title":"A Cold and Silent Dying (Marti Macalister Mysteries)","review":"With a change in administration Lincoln Prairie homicide detective Marti McAllister reports to Lieutenant Gail Nicholson. This situation neither woman likes because the lieutenant wants to be the only African-American in the department and Marti because she put too many years into being a police officer to deal with petty garbage. Lt. Nicholson is recording every move Marti makes waiting until she has enough evidence to fire her.While Marti is coping with the Lieutenant, she and her partner are dealing with a case in which two homeless people were murdered in an abandoned house. A Desert Storm vet was in the house but they don't have enough evidence to arrest him. The lieutenant wants Marti and her partner to forget about trying to get more evidence on the vet because the public cares more about a man who served his country than two homeless people. The case is far from closed because more bodies turn up murdered in the same way the first two victims were. Marti doesn't know it but this perpetrator is known to her and poses a danger to her and those she cares about.The animosity between the two cops feels realistic because Marti's boss is a woman who wants no competition and she knows that her subordinate could take the limelight away from her. The case is solved by good old fashioned detective work with many officers putting in plenty of man hours to catch the perpetrator before he strikes again. Eleanor Taylor Bland is an expert at creating true-to-life characters for readers who like strong independent women will definitely want to read A COLD AND DYING DAY.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Almost a Whisper: A Holistic Approach to Working with Your Horse","review":"This is one of the better books on horse psychology.

I have used his technique for years. I truely hope more people try it."},{"Title":"Almost a Whisper: A Holistic Approach to Working with Your Horse","review":"I bought this book based on Amazon customers' effusive recommendations, and I tried very hard to like it. I did -sometimes-but I just don't think it worked for me overall. All of the previous customer reviews that address the book's content are pretty much accurate, including the reviewer who noted that the contents are wordy and repetitive; they are. So, to give additional information to the prospective buyer, this review focuses on what I would have appreciated knowing.First, a good portion of the book is devoted to the authors' efforts to convince the reader to abandon the stereotypical \\"cowboy school\\" of horse breaking/training. It was as if they assumed their audience consisted of cowboys of decades ago. This is understandable given Sam's background, but if that's the target audience, I'm not sure the book's title is going to attract those people. The problem I had with the authors writing so much extolling the wisdom of the \\"horse whisperer\\" philosophy is that I was already there. That's why I bought the book.Second, while they rightly criticize abusive horse breaking methods in favor of theirs, several passages come across like they're proselytizing. This tone wasn't completely off-putting. Neither entirely was the fact that they occasionally digress to opine on society's ills. Other readers may not be so charitable about these musings. (While other readers may high five them for it.)Third, the book was generally well organized, but many points - mostly on why one should choose horse whispering - were repeated. Repetition does aid memory, but I would have appreciated more content on various situations involving the mature horse. Why is it that these sorts of books generally focus on the \\"starting the colts\\" stage? Don't many riders own older horses that know how to get away with a lot, are spoiled, domineering, etc.? From what Sam says in the book, it sounds like many of the attendees at his clinics are those riders or novice horse owners. If so, I don't suspect many of these people are into the starting the colts phase. Even if they are, examples on dealing with older horses other than trailer loading and spooking would help. For instance, I found it frustrating that the authors incompletely tell about horse owners who didn't think their horses had problems because the owners didn't ask the horses to do anything they didn't want to do. They relate the example of the horse that would not cross water or the filly that exploded when the owners tried to get her to move under saddle. Too bad the book didn't apply the horse whisperer method to these examples. Rather, they are mentioned only to illustrate why these owners need to readjust their attitude. I wholeheartedly agree that the rider's attitude is more than half of the problem, but finishing off these examples by employing the horse whisperer method would have been far more instructive, effective, and valuable.Fourth, there are a few instances that really stick out as strange or incongruous. I was taken aback by the several references to misbehaving horses \\"going to dog food,\\" even though these comments are always made by a hypothetical owner exasperated with his \\"misbehaving\\" horse. I similarly gave pause when Sam bluntly admits to laying horses down. (He does candidly explain the limited circumstances under which he does this, and emphasizes that he does not train others to do it.) I also looked askance when the authors unequivocally say that horses have a form of mental telepathy. I guess this added to the holistic part of the book? More of a petty irritation, probably better levied on the editor, is the fact that the index is not carefully compiled. Page references are not always correct (e.g., in my edition, Buck Branaman is mentioned on page 138, but is indexed as appearing on page 137).In sum, the book is a readable amalgamation of biography, journal of one's journey in search of personal enlightenment, how to start colts, philosophy (life in general and life with horses), training manual, and \\"The World According To Sam and Lane.\\" There is much in &quot;Almost a Whisper&quot; to learn, particularly to those who haven't read any natural horsemanship books, and especially to those who haven't broken out of the breaking method. The approach these authors take may not fit everyone, but it is the message that's important. Unfortunately, I found many aspects of the book distracting from the worthy points. Now forewarned, I'll hopefully be able to focus on those points when I reread this. This book may have been three stars for me, but if Sam and Lane's style effectively reaches others, and it appears it has, the book is worthy of five stars for them."},{"Title":"Almost a Whisper: A Holistic Approach to Working with Your Horse","review":"What an absolutely wonderful book.

Working with horses as I do and seeing what I see in both horses and their people, I found (and continue to find) this book packed full of relevant concepts. And each time I read it, I find more. The focus here is on working with your (or any) horse rather than &quot;against&quot; his nature.

SAM SYSTEMATICALLY EXPLAINS HIS METHOD OF OBTAINING THE HORSE'S RESPECT TO A DEGREE THAT ALLOWS SAM TO BRIDLE, SADDLE, AND RIDE AN UNTRAINED HORSE WITHOUT THE ATTENDANT RESISTANCE AND WILD BUCKING. HE DEVOTES A GOOD PORTION OF HIS BOOK TO THE HORSE OWNER, AND WHAT THE INDIVIDUAL SHOULD DO TO DEVELOPE GOOD HABITS IN HIS HORSE. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS BOOK FOR THE LIBRARY OF EVERY HORSE OWNER.

Sam not only communicates with the horse, but more importantly us all knowing humans.One significant issue that struck me as so different is the character Sam demonstrates in giving credit to others. Very specifically his father for teaching him so much early on. Sam that is character. Something that is probably recognized by the horse quicker than the human.This is a great book.

Thanks to Sam's book, I have now met and had him help me with my horses. If you want glitz and hollywood glamour, you won't find what you are looking for in Sam's book. If you are looking for someone to tell you how pretty your horse looks with his whiskers sheared, you won't find this in his book either. If you are looking for a real horseman, you will find him in this book. My horses have found a true friend and knowledgeable horseman in Sam. My hope is that after reading his book, you will begin to see the horse from the horse's point of view as opposed to the Hollywood image.

This is the best so far.As I have lived in Korea for 10+ years, I have Korean friends in the same age group as the author, Richard Kim. From the first-hand accounts I have heard from my friends, I believe Lost Names accurately describes conditions for the common Korean citizen during the Occupation period.Through the entire book, I believed I was reading the author's autobiography. I didn't realize that was not the case until I read the Author's Note on the last page. I kept wondering why, since these were his memoirs, the author didn't write in the past tense.For me personally, the book would have been easier to read if it had been written in the past tense. In any case, I highly recommend this book for those who love to learn about the tragic history of the beautiful Land of the Morning Calm."},{"Title":"Lost Names: Scenes from a Korean Boyhood","review":"This was probably my favorite of the books we read in the Japanese History course I took my senior year of college. Young Richard Kim spent the majority of his childhood in his native Korea while it was under occupation by the Japanese, who were not very nice to or tolerant of his people, no matter they were the majority and the occupying Japanese were the minority. There are many hardships and much prejudice he faces growing up, from neighbors, the government, teachers, and schoolmates, but he never loses his sense of pride and Korean nationalism, constantly being reminded by his parents (who are ministers) and his grandmother to remain aware of where he comes from, his identity, the sustained hope that the Japanese won't always be in Korea, and to do well in school and set a fine example to the Japanese, since he mustn't let those Japanese boys at school think they're better than he is. When WWII comes along, everyone suffers the normal wartime deprivations, such as food shortages and bombing raids, but it is especially hard for the Koreans in the midst. Young Richard is forced, along with his classmates, to bow in the direction of the Emperor each morning, recite an ode of allegiance to the Emperor and Japanese government, and, worst of all, to even change his family name. All Koreans are forced to change their surnames to Japanese surnames, although Richard's father is clever and changes their family's name to one with the root meaning \\"rock,\\" which of course is a reference to Saint Peter and the family's religious faith, a reference the Japanese won't get. It's enough to take away and try to usurp one's culture, traditions, customs, language, and way of life, but when you take away someone's name, that is in a way the ultimate erasure of their identity. Even when forced to, at least on the surface, speak a foreign language, submit to foreign leaders, and follow alien customs, there's still the comfort of knowing your base identity, your name, is still the same, but taking it away makes this prejudice and attempted usurpation of Korean culture incredibly personal and insulting.It didn't really bother me that some of these memories and thoughts are very complex and detailed for a child as young as Richard is in the beginning. Many times memories of traumatic defining events are stronger and more vivid and real precisely because they were so awful and traumatic, leaving more impact than something as mundane as, say, eating breakfast or walking the dog. And even if some gaps in Richard's memory may have been filled in by what he imagines happened or what his family have told him happened, it doesn't lessen the emotional impact of these events in the slightest. And I like how it was told in the present tense; since discovering quite some time ago that books can be written in the present tense and there's no rule written in stone saying you must only and always write in the past tense, I've much preferred books written in the present tense. It makes the events seem more real and gripping, full of suspense and tension, like constantly wondering what's going to happen next, living right in the moment."},{"Title":"Lost Names: Scenes from a Korean Boyhood","review":"I collect books about Korea, and have read many novels, poems and non-fiction works. But Lost Names is certainly one of the best. Small details and major characters both help to build an accurate, emotional depiction of Koreans and the struggle to live during the brutal Japanese occupation of World War II.I read this book in one sitting, mailed it to one of my sisters, and have bought a copy for another sister. Some passages are humorous, and others are painfully sad...but the author infuses the entire work with hope and forgiveness. The main character's father is a memorable study of dignity, wisdom and strength.My 13 year old son has read this book four times! It is slightly mature for a young reader, but if you or your child have any interest in Asian history, Korea or warm stories of childhood, you'll love it. A must-read for any Korean-Americans wanting to understand the deprivation, tenacity and social conditions forced upon their parents or grandparents, who survived the harsh conditions of life in Korea during WWII."},{"Title":"Lost Names: Scenes from a Korean Boyhood","review":"A beautifully written book that places you in Korea during the second world war.

Considering that it is fiction the author was surprisingly \\"tame\\" in telling the story. I was expecting another depressing memoir of a family destroyed by the Japanese occupation. In Kim's book, however, the family's suffering is more subtle and their eventual triump refreshing. It's nice to not read a book where everyone and their mothers die a painful death. This book gave a lot of insight into the lives of Koreans during the occupation. It was also nice to know that not all of the imperial Japanese soldiers were as gruesome as they were in the Rape of Nanjing."},{"Title":"Lost Names: Scenes from a Korean Boyhood","review":"Imperialism is something that is often associated exclusively with the West. The histories of the British colonization of India and the Spanish colonies of Latin America abound, but many fail to notice the history of the Empire of Japan, which held Eastern Asia prior to and during the Second World War. Richard Kim writes about his childhood experience in Korea from 1932 to 1945 in his book Lost Names: Scenes from a Korean Boyhood and focuses on the situation of Japanese imperialism on the Korean peninsula, and the effects of the colonization.Richard sees first hand how Japan influence on Korea is affecting his family life, school, and friendships. The book begins with an image of Kim's family leaving Korea for a job and being stopped by the Japanese Imperial Army. This was the first of the scenes that were told through the eyes of Richard Kim. The book goes on to depict six more stories, separated by chapters.Japan is painted as an outside influence, which is taking over Korea in a more passive way. The narrator describes the Japanese as not bad people, but people who are distinct from the native Koreans, and collectively more powerful and all-surrendering when it comes to their Emperor. This is shown when the narrator talks about how the books gets it's name, in which the Koreans are made to give up their Korean names in exchange for a Japanese name. Showing the strong nature of his family the name chosen by his father means \\"Foundation of Rock.\\"Throughout the book, Koreans are portrayed as being in control in Korea behind the thick wall of Japanese occupation. This is largely personified in the character of Kim's college-educated father, whose firm anti-Japanese standpoints are looked-up-to by much of the local community. In spite of this, many Koreans are portrayed to be people who are indebted to the Japanese - shown by the character of Kim's teacher.Aside from the educated people, Koreans are portrayed as being unaware of the events around the world at the time, shown by the narrator's mother's obliviousness to the unfolding of German invasions in Europe and Japanese occupations in China. These chapters's focus on day-to-day event, which make it very important to the overall understanding the reader, gets of the depth of the effects of the Japanese colonization.Overall this book was very informative, one is able to see the true impact of the Japanese during World War II. However, not every event depicted in the story is completely true is still shows a first hand perspective in a new way, through a child eye. I would recommend the book to anyone interested in history or the impact of war. Just keep in mind this is not completely factual, but it will give you a better understanding of Korean history."},{"Title":"Lost Names: Scenes from a Korean Boyhood","review":"How could such a young child have such complex thoughts? That's what I was thinking the whole time I was reading it. If author was going to incorporate historical information, maybe he should not have used the first-person narrative."},{"Title":"Lost Names: Scenes from a Korean Boyhood","review":"The \\"scenes from a Korean boyhood\\" in this book, which are evidently based on actual events, are very compelling and convey powerfully what life was like under the Japanese occupation of Korea. So that's the reason to read this book. Unfortunately, these scenes are set in a kind of fiction jello that connects one episode with another by means of impressionistic accounts of the Korean landscape and so on. This sort of writing is much less successful, and you'll find your eyes sliding past some of it. Kim is not as skillful at blending fiction and nonfiction as, say, Dave Eggers, and one wishes the author had related more about the father, who had been imprisoned by the Japanese, or the grandparents, or even the village, which was located in what is now North Korea. However, that would be a different book. Lost Names is not difficult reading and is certainly a good place to begin learning about what Koreans endured during World War II."},{"Title":"Lost Names: Scenes from a Korean Boyhood","review":"This book is about the struggles of a Korean boy during the Japanese occupation in Korea. Many of the characters on non-fiction, but most of the story it self is fiction, based on true events. The Japanese did everything in their power to take away the Korean culture and make it their own, from taking their names to beating the Japanese language into them laterally. Through an emotional depiction of what was going on in Korea from 1932-1945 while the Japanese staked claim on the country. Told from the point of view of a young Korean boy the reader is intrigued by the casual conversational tone of the book, but captured by the emotional rollercoaster it seems to take you on. In the beginning of the book you are given a scene on a train passing through Manchuria, in the frozen winter. In history class we have learned of the harsh winters, and of Manchuria but it is books such as these that really bring what happened in history to life, and makes me realize to boys and girls who were once just like me lived through this. The only thing I would have to say that I really didn't enjoy about this book is that it was told through the eyes of a very young boy, and starts when he is only a year old. In my opinion a book told through the eyes of a child who is only a year old doesn't make a whole lot of sense. Other than that it was a good read, and very good way to tie human lives, and dignity into history."},{"Title":"Lost Names: Scenes from a Korean Boyhood","review":"The story was simple and it was an easy and somewhat captivating read.

The range of content covered was excellent, and the author's clear prose made for an easily-understood journey through the many streams of Alchemy (islam, Chinese, Western, etc).However, his writing style at times is almost \\"too\\" dispassionate, and on a few occasions he seems to not follow-through with an intriguing line of enquiry. For instance, taking the Rosicrucian documents of the early 17th century at face value, rather than mentioning their more allegorical significance, as outlined by Paul Foster Case in \\"The True And Invisible Rosicrucian Order\\".Or after an important meeting in his search for Chinese alchemy, he admits afterwards that he forgot to ask several key questions of his subject. Better planning, Peter!In terms of narrative drive, Marshall is no match for Graeme Hancock's \\"Fingerprints of The Gods\\", although that author's later works (e.g. \\"Supernatural\\") have become, to my mind, almost too zealous.In summary, I would say Marshall has done an admirable job, and can recommend this book. He has since written a book focussing soley on Prague and the court of Rudolph II, which was apparently published in September of this year, but I've not found listed on Amazon yet."},{"Title":"The Philosopher's Stone: A Quest for the Secrets of Alchemy","review":"Possibly one of the finest examples of a complex subject material given respect and yet communicated in enough of an intellectual delivery that it convinces the reader of how genuine the author is about sharing his experience on this frontier. More than likely if you have a sincere interest in this book, it will be kept in your immediate presence constantly until you have finished reading it twice, and then find a handy spot on a nearby bookcase, up high enough to keep it from getting grabbed by the crayon graffiti generation. I've read over a dozen other books on the subject that collectively shared less than 5% of what Peter Marshall teaches the reader in this book, \\"The Philosopher's Stone: A Quest for the Secrets of Alchemy.\\" You will have to read above the 8th grade level, and you will need to have a genuine interest, not just a clumsy curiosity. I wish I had found this book when it was first published. I'm a little older and less able to recall what I read without going over it and over it. This book is still worth it, even if life has taken its toll on my college study skills. I recommend this book. BTW, no you won't be an alchemist when you're done reading it, nor will you be able to turn lead into gold, or mercury into silver, nor will you be able to create your own philosopher's stone. This is information, not a how-to book from Home Depot on building a backyard deck. You will however have a greater appreciation for serious seekers of this lost knowledge. I wish this had been required reading in high school, because of some of the balance to life that is shared. Today's world is so full of selfishness and materialistic greed that it is tough to believe there are people who strive for inner peace and external peace enough to feel that balance is more important than climbing the corporate ladder and amassing fortune or fame."},{"Title":"The Philosopher's Stone: A Quest for the Secrets of Alchemy","review":"This is really an excellent book! Globe-trotter and author Peter Marshall provides a fascinating overview of the history of alchemy in diverse cultures in both ancient and modern times.

This book raises a few points about some of the short-comings of the judicial system. It also illustrates the dangers of bending therules so that the punishment fits the crime.The ending has a bit of a fairy-tale flavor to it, but this is more than compensated for by the grit, fear, and adrenalin rush throughout the text.

Whether you agree with how they went about arresting criminals or not, the story is different from any other cop book that is out there. Giving it even more credibility is the author who is a former police officer. \\"Renegade Crew\\" deserves five-stars. I did not want to put it down and I will be re-reading it again tonight.

Mavor, Jr. Has done for Atlantis what Heinrich Schliemann did for Troy, and nobody has noticed.Like most rational people I have avoided Atlantis as a subject only fit for airheads and crackpots. But I wanted to know where all this Atlantis nonsense was coming from. Luckily when I went searching for real information I found &quot;Voyage to Atlantis&quot;. Mayor is a real archaeologist and oceanographer.In this book he tells us the source of the Atlantis myth (Plato in &quot;Timaeus&quot; and &quot;Critias&quot;) and quotes Plato at length for reference. Plato was in turn quoting a story that Solon had read in Egypt. Mavor's thesis hinges on Solon making a error in translation such that every measurement that should read in the hundreds instead reads in the thousands, while smaller numbers are not changed. This holds true for dates as well as distances and population counts. If the measurements in the thousands in Plato's account are changed to hundreds his Atlantis accurately describes the Minoan civilization of Crete and the Island of Thera (also known as Santorini) in size, population, military strength, and time period (900 years before Solon rather than 9000).With a valid theory to start with Mavor then did the real archeology necessary to back up his claims, using the latest technology in underwater research.If you want a good scientific look at the legend of Atlantis read this book."},{"Title":"Voyage to Atlantis","review":"Excellent book. Well written and the facts seem to strongly support the author's theories. It is my belief that if Atlantis did indeed exist, that James Mavor's book provides the most compelling argment for it's whereabouts.The premise that Plato's dates are off by multiplication of 10 is very interesting, and the author shows several examples of this discrepancy. This is the foundation of a theory that puts Atlantis in the Agean Sea on the volcanic island of Thera.It seems that this IS the answer everyone is looking for, but all of the proof is not complete. It's unfortunate that the Greek government will not allow massive underwater exploration of this area. Hopefully someday someone will get the chance to further explore Mavor's theory and the legend of Atlantis will be solved."},{"Title":"Relations","review":"this is an excellent book.

Instead of dwelling on sickness, Chopra shows us how our health is really in our own hands. It is wonderfully refreshing to find a doctor who is not in the business of pushing pills for every ill and ache. Instead of giving us the five-minute look-over and writing a prescription, Dr. Chopra shows us the way to influence our body so it can cure itself. He tell us what we already know, but always wanted to hear from a doctor: That all drugs have side effects and most are expensive. Don't we all want an alternative?Chopra provides beginning chapters on common illnesses and at times gives typical doctor instructions on what to eat and what to avoid (\\"don't drink alcohol, even in moderation\\"). But he moves beyond that, looking inside the sick person and inviting us to look inside ourselves. Our emotions and attitudes affect our bodies, and if we learn to control emotions we can improve our health. Chopra recommends meditation as a means of marshalling our inner resources.While there must be some limit to this approach to health, there nevertheless is much evidence for its effectiveness. I particularly enjoyed his case histories and anecdotes. In one case, he admits lying to a patient. She had cancer, but he told her he removed gall stones. She believed him and the cancer went away! He attributes her recovery to her belief that she was well, a manifestation of the placebo effect that no one can explain, other than \\"mind over matter.\\" Doctors dismiss diseases that go away by themselves by saying the patient is \\"in remission.\\" But that is not an explanation. Chopra looks at these spontaneous healings as the body's ability to heal itself through the power inside the person, the body's natural intelligence. Intelligence, says Dr. Chopra, is in everything that's alive. I think of Chopra's nature intelligence when I see my cat make a graceful leap from porch to pillar. His body is using its built-in intelligence to make a perfect landing! Perhaps if we can become aware that our bodies use built-in intelligence, we can, as Dr. Chopra suggests, create health."},{"Title":"Creating Health: How to Wake Up the Body's Intelligence","review":"This book,as most Chopra's works,are extraordinary tools in a search for the invisible realm of the human universe.That realm includes our feelings,intuition,emotions,desires,and every inner aspect of the human mind and soul,and finally that shall also includes God.That book can be an important door for a person who seeks the meaning of spirituality,as well as the meaning of life. Deepak Chopra has an astonishing inspiration, and a very solid scientific education.My life has just turned upside-down,in a good direction,after knowing his works.I wish every single person in this planet knew what this man has discovered.Don't miss this author!"},{"Title":"Creating Health: How to Wake Up the Body's Intelligence","review":"The basic idea of Deepak Chopra's work is that your attitude to the world, the way you think and interpret the reality creates different chemicals and hormones which have an enormous impact on your body and your health. This is how mind connects to the body. But the best part is, that your attitude and your thinking is in your hands, which means that your health is also in your hands. Chopra is a big promotor of alternative health care methods and an opponent of the traditional medicine.Chopra builds on old tradition from India and introduces his own advances including a breath-focused meditation. The book is easy to follow since Chopra uses very logical sequence of ideas and has a very clear syntax.If you like this book then I would recommend to you also Deepak Chopra's most famous Ageless Body, Timeless Mind."},{"Title":"Creating Health: How to Wake Up the Body's Intelligence","review":"Hey folks, I really recommend this book to you.

He is an incredible and intuitive mystic who also happens to be an M.D. He knows the way to perfect health and he lines it out in this book. And it's simple!! Read it..Do it!!"},{"Title":"Creating Health: How to Wake Up the Body's Intelligence","review":"When I first began hearing of Deepak Chopra, I did not think to much of him. A very good friend of mine recommendedThe Seven Spiritual Laws of Success: A Practical Guide to the Fulfillment of Your Dreams (based on Creating Affluence)a long time ago but I've yet to read it. So recently I picked up this book on sale from Exclusive Books, a big book store chain in South Africa, like Borders or Barnes & Noble in the USA. Anyway this book has made a tremendous impact on how I view healthy living. Firstly I now see how I can live a healthier life and enjoy more of life. This sounds stupid and simple but I always imagined living healthy to be some kind of effort. And in fact it should be or could be effortless - it all starts with your mind and how you think, and how you feel about yourself. Much of what Deepak Chopra says resonates so much with what is theThe Secret (Extended Edition)I am very surprised they did not interview him.The way this book is written makes it a really quick and easy read. The chapters are short and the whole book is divided into four sections: Health and Disease, Laying the Foundation, Strategies for Creating Health and Toward a Higher Reality: Mediation and Metamorphosis.Now one of my own internal guides is when I see references to other people I already respect. For example Deepak Chopra quotes Napoleon Hill, several times in the later half the book, and it fits. He also references his friend Dr Wayne Dyer, which I think is the leading light in the West when it comes to manifesting your reality. All this can be bit much to believe for someone who is not familiar with the law of attraction, and changing your physiology by changing your thoughts but give this one a try. It's short, direct, simple to understand and yet it encompasses a vast body of knowledge. And I really enjoyed the fact that he ended off focussing on the new physics as he calls it that was started with Einstein. There is a link between quantum physics and the old paradigms of the East. And you don't even have to read theThe Tao of Physicsto see it. As they see in these circles believing is seeing not the other way around."},{"Title":"Creating Health: How to Wake Up the Body's Intelligence","review":"The volume is recomended for all physicians, pharmacologists, healers, families and philosophers. In a perfect blending of the most ancient and most modern of arts, Dr. Chopra hypothesises the needfulness of complementary holistic medicines, not just the blinded, cold barbarism of atheism presently taught in the west's medical mainstream, wholly subsidized by the Chemical Industry & Global Communism.Found his points well taken and in comportment with all modern consensus; Medicine has lost its humanity and treats the patient's symptoms rather than causes or better yet, the whole patient's being. I feel the work was revolutionary and helped speed up the renewal of medicine underway.Communism requires that modern medicine be turned into a dehumanising agent and tool of death; i.e. the \\"medicine\\" of Hitler, Stalin, Stanger and the other good sputnicks of 20th century medicine. Chopra calls for a humane unified treatment of disease where the human body is not a random colection of chemicals but a spiritual being as well. This quite agreed with our understanding of man as made in God's own image. Chopra's leadership in addressing many issues is remarkeable, although we found some points at which to disagree or question further. You will hopefully have your worldview expanded by this deep thinker and modern mainstream medical moralist."},{"Title":"Creating Health: How to Wake Up the Body's Intelligence","review":"I was very excited reading the first of four sections. It dealt with the mind-body connection and how we, by our very thoughts, influence our own health. For example, if we worry we cause ourselves stress; hormones are produced that can be damaging to the body and can cause disease. If a person can control or relieve the stress, then they are going to be a healthier person. I was so excited by this. I couldn't wait to read the rest of the book to learn what I could do to improve my health.The fun stopped at the end of the first section.The second section dealt with \\"intelligence,\\" which seemed to me like a scientific way of saying \\"God.\\"The third section was supposed to give strategies for creating health. Instead, it was filled with vague statements and generalities. One sloppy persuasive technique Dr. Chopra used on multiple occasions to bolster his philosophy was to define a word in a common instance then use the same word in a completely different context but the reader is supposed to infer that the two are equivalent. For example, \\"Compassion is the quality shown by people who can freely express kindness.\\" Sounds good to me. But then, \\"All living organisms display behavior patterns that favor the whole over the interests of the individual part. Cells work not for themselves, but for the integrity of the tissue of which they are a part.\\" Then, \\"I am calling this process the beginning of compassion because each cell 'sympathetically' senses the need of all other cells and automatically responds to it.\\" Then, \\"No healing can occur without compassion.\\" (Really?) Finally, \\"[Compassion] heals the healer.\\"Also, Dr. Chopra repeatedly makes statements as facts without proving them. A perfect example is the above, \\"No healing can occur without compassion.\\" The reader is just supposed to take Dr. Chopra's word for it.The last section was the biggest disappointment of all. It was a 50-page advertisement for Transcendental Meditation and Ayurveda. It doesn't give any instruction on TM or Ayurveda, but you will read about how great they both are.In the book, Dr. Chopra states, \\"I have been proposing here that perfect health is a reality for anyone, that everyone can expand his share of infinite intelligence.\\" The problem arises when a person, believing this, does everything Dr. Chopra recommends to correct a disease state but fails to effect a cure. Dr. Chopra's philosophy of health cannot fail, but the patient can."},{"Title":"The Thirteen Books of Euclid's Elements.3 volumes.","review":"They just took the free Google edition, ran it through the Amazon's free pdf format converter, and charged a dollar for a big pile of unformatted wingding mess."},{"Title":"The Thirteen Books of Euclid's Elements.3 volumes.","review":"The kindle version of this book is essentially unreadable.

For people who aren't sure if they have read this one or not, it's about Victoria (Tory) a 'failed' Miss America (third runner up) who has to figure out who she is if she's not a beauty queen. Of course she finds a wonderful man (this is a romance after all!) but she also resolves her relationship with her mother and creates new relationships with her extended family. That's why I love this author - she grounds her characters in real worlds, made beautiful by love. You really hate to finish her novels. If you come across this one, grab it, it's a keeper!..."},{"Title":"Don't Forget to Smile","review":"Tory Duncan is an ex-beauty queen, a former competitor in the Miss America Pageant now disillusioned with the whole pageant industry and her role in it. Divorced and unsure of who she is, she finds herself in Oregon where she eventually opens a bar in Sullivan City, a working class logging town. With her organizational skills and hard work, the bar prospers and Tory begins the task of reshaping herself into a new and better person.Joe Brigham is one of many, many Brighams in Sullivan City, and one of three Joe Brighams. He comes from a large family. Growing up, he was overshadowed by several of his siblings whose talents were more identifiable or traditional than his. He married early, had a child, and settled into the working class homeowner lifestyle his family had patterned. But when he becomes involved in the local union, his work there requires more of him, and his ambitions become larger than Sullivan City can accomodate, his wife objects and decides to divorce Joe and marry his more traditional cousin, Dennis, instead. Joe is left without anything but his job, trying to be more than a weekend father to his six-year-old son, Max. But it's tough.Tory first meets Joe when her bar is held up by an inept pair of armed robbers. No one, including the criminals, knows exactly how a robbery is supposed to go down, and Joe steps in when it looks like their nervousness might result in someone getting hurt. His skill as a mediator impresses everyone, especially Tory who looks past his background and pleasant but generic Brigham looks and sees a born leader. Someone truly interesting and dynamic.I first read Don't Forget to Smile in April of 2001 - six years ago. My primary impression of DFTS is that it was a little depressing. Enjoyable, but a little sad. I felt angry on Joe Brigham's behalf about the shaft he'd gotten in his divorce, and I also felt angry at Joe Brigham that he was planning to spend his son's adolescent years as a weekend and vacation dad in order to further his career ambitions. The idea that he would be able to leave in a few years, that his son would only really need his dad until he was 9 or 10, to me seemed selfish and unrealistic.However, while I still felt both of these things, my reading experience was much more positive this time around. Reading it again, I was surprised to find that the book has an overall very positive message about reconciliation and forgiveness.Don't Forget to Smile fits right in with the rest of the Seidel canon in that it's a low-key story with everyday drama. Readers who like spy stories and shoot-'em-ups probably wouldn't pick her books up, but the way Seidel draws her characters bottom up - from their family origins and dynamics to their interests, abilities and avocations - always makes them seem like living, breathing true-to-life people. Tory, with her disappointment in herself and her past choices, and Joe, with his frustration at being replaced as husband and father by a close relative: they have real, understandable problems the reader can relate to. One thing that differentiates Seidel's family dramas from those of other authors is that her characters often come from functional families, yet they still have problems. Tory's mother did not beat her, emotionally abuse or neglect her, but Tory still resents her for forcing her into beauty pageants throughout her childhood. Joe loves his family, but it doesn't stop him from resenting his older brother for being better at everything his working class world admires. Evil, uncaring abusive parents are easy to draw; it's harder to draw characters who succeeded in some ways but failed in others. But the result is far more interesting.Seidel again puts her spotlight on the spotlight. So many of her characters have limelight professions, and she does her research. There is a lot of detail here on beauty pageants: the good, the bad, and the just plain routine. She is pretty even handed portraying them as not very healthy for children or stage parents, but a good way for some secure young women to get scholarship money for college.One thing I noticed much more this time around was her portrayal of Max, Joe's son. Romance novel children are frequently precocious, but this is presented as cute and played for laughs. Max is a much more realistic child, a bright boy whose energy, intelligence, and frequent impatience make him both lovable and hard to deal with at times. Joe and his ex, Marianne, have to ride herd on him at times and it's an effort. That he's willing to make that effort and try to do it as often as possible makes him a good father and a true everyday hero.Tory's major conflict involves her mother and her lack of knowledge about how families work. Tory resents how her mother made pageants into their whole lives. It is only through her involvement with Joe, an objective observer with lots of hands-on family experience, that she learns how to see her mother in a different, more forgiving light. There is also a touching section in which Tory meets a family member she was never aware of that read quite a bit like an adult adoptee's reunion story. The ends are wrapped up a bit too quickly on this drama, but the overall effect is very nice.I'm not quite sure how to grade Don't Forget to Smile. It hovers right there between an A- and a B+. I enjoyed it thoroughly, more than I remembered doing, and I can highly recommend it to anyone. But it's not my favorite Seidel either. Is it unfair to grade on a curve measuring this one against other Seidel greats? Perhaps. All I know is, this one is worth seeking out. It's too bad it didn't get more exposure."},{"Title":"Don't Forget to Smile","review":"Victoria Duncan is a ex-beauty queen. She started out in the child pageants and made it all the way up to second runner up in the Miss America Pageant.But people in the small blue collar town of Sullivan City,OR don't know about that. A hard worker with monumental organizational skills and the knowledge that research is the key to everything, Victoria opens up a bar that welcomes the regular Joe loggers and their families. She becomes plain old Tory, a bartender with a sympathetic ear and an easy smile.And speaking of regular Joe's -- Joe Brigham is a regular in Tory's bar who makes an impression on her when he helps out during a robbery attempt (he gives the would-be robbers helpful and practical advice so nobody gets hurt). He's one of the Brighams, a large family that have been part of the town for years, many of whom work on the line and out on the camps.Unlike his family, Joe isn't content with just being a worker on the line. He has been tapped to be a union rep and the responsibilities and rewards of the job awaken something in him that he didn't even know existed.The two of them, Joe and Tory, strike up a friendship and then a romance while navigating through their own family issues. Joe is divorced with a son and his ex-wife has remarried his cousin. Tory has some lingering resentments against her mother over her life in the pageant industry.I have been in the mood for simple contemporary romances for awhile. I wanted something that had no whiff of paranormal at all and no navy SEALS, FBI or women in jeopardy. I came across Seidel and her stuff seemed to fit the bill.She reminds me a little of Barbara Delinsky before BD went completely over into women's fiction/Jodi Picoult territory. It is romance with a little more grit than some of the stuff that is being put out today.For one, not many romances take place in blue collar, industrial, working towns that look at the issues of unions and people being out of work. And while many heroes in romance come from such places, romance makes it very clear that they aren't staying there. They usually go off and make tons of money and become super rich and successful. I like the tenor of this story because it allows Joe to still be a good hero without giving him the trappings to wealth and power.In the context of his family and the people in his town Joe is very successful. And he does very useful work in working with people and the unions. However his ambition is looked at with some puzzlement by members of his family. His wife divorced him because he was doing something she considered different and dangerous. He wasn't content to just be a worker and that made him alien to her. Thankfully, Seidel doe not make Joe's ex-wife evil or villainous, just a woman who has very definite ideas of wife-husband-family-work in the context of their town.Tory is at first a little enigmatic but she starts to open up and you see why the beautiful ex-beauty queen would settle in a place like Sullivan City. I also loved the inside information Seidel gives about Pageants. Joe's younger sister wants more that Sullivan City can offer, she wants to go to College and finds out that pageants can be a way to get money. Tory is reluctantly pulled in to helping as Joe discovers her glittery secret.All in all this was a fine read. It isn't flashy, it has a bit of melancholy and is very grounded in realism. I am a sucker for family drama so I lap stories like this up. It won't appeal at all to people who like wealthy characters and urbane settings but I think people who like rich characters and a good story will enjoy it."},{"Title":"Don't Forget to Smile","review":"This is, without a doubt, the best romance I have ever read.

However, the interviews flowed nicely and you almost forgot you weren't reading a story. It begins in the 1920s when Madonna is young, talks about half of her siblings passing away for various reasons, then when she's older she suffers from TB, and is placed in a sanitorium for about ten years with miinimal contact with family. Throughout these years in the sanitorium, she sees about 500 people come in and leave in body bags and is always believing she'll be next. Then finally she escapes and ends up at the \\"white sanitorium\\", because up untill now she was at the \\"indian saitorium\\". Here, she meets an okay white doctor who tries to help her by doing a surgery that is still new and has never been done on anyone. She agrees to have the surgery, which includes taking out a couple of ribs and parts of her bad lung. However, we learn in the book that the doctor accidentally cuts her arm nerve during surgery, but he apparently apologizes, so I guess it's okay. Now, she can't use her one arm, or control her head, so she has to be placed in a brace for support. Eventually she recovers, but it takes about a year. Anyway, she continues her life, but discovers she cannot have children because of all the TB medicine she had to take, she does get married, but they have issues later on with their cattle ranch. She tries to go to school and finish her degree but her health continues to stop her. The book ended with her being positive as usual. I was kind of disturbed by the whole thing, and I thought why would God put someone on this earth just to suffer like that?
